It does not tolerate degraded forests. <em>Manouria impressa</em>&#160;shelters beneath logs, and is inactive for long periods of the year (aestivate).<br/><br/>In Phu Luang Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, <em>M. impressa</em>&#160;exhibits seasonal variation in habitat use between montane forest, montane scrub forest and bamboo forest; however montane forest was the most utilised habitat throughout the year in both adults and juveniles. A single individual has been found at about 450 m in dry deciduous dipterocarp forest in Phu Kradueng National Park, Thailand. Habitat selection of <em>M. impressa </em>may associate with food abundance. <em>M. impressa</em> is a specialist feeder, consuming mushrooms in the rainy season, and green plants during the rest of the active period. Most mushrooms consumed by <em>M. impressa </em>are edible and preferred by local people (Wanchai 2012).&#160;Courting and mating have been observed in all seasons in Thailand, but peak in the rainy season.&#160;Clutch size in one observed wild nest was estimated at 8–10 eggs.

Almost 100% of responses indicated that hunting continues for <em>M. impressa</em> (and other turtle species) and the interviewees suggested that <em>M. impressa</em> were more regularly consumed locally than sold for international trade. Most interviewees said that local people did not hunt&#160;<em>M. impressa</em> directly but were collected incidentally during other activities.<em> Manouria impressa</em> are often collected by locals when collecting mushrooms, and cooked immediately or taken back to the village for food (Wanchai 2012).","<p><em>Manouria impressa</em> is cryptic and can occur at relatively high densities in appropriate habitat.

It is absent from most coastal islands and dunes (Godley 1992). Burrows of the gopher tortoise or rodents are used for shelter (Gentry and Smith 1968; Lee 1968; Franz 1986), and it also hides under logs and under or in stumps (Wright and Wright 1949). Breeding occurs in ephemeral to semi-permanent graminoid-dominated wetlands that lack large predatory fish (Bailey 1991; Moler and Franz 1987; J.G. Palis unpubl.). This species does not adapt well to habitat degradation or the introduction of predators to its breeding habitat.","Threats to this species are many and include loss of longleaf pine habitat through maximum-yield timber management (for example, through establishment of pine monocultures) and decreased frequency of fire; introduction of predatory fish into breeding ponds; road construction near breeding sites; and declining populations of gopher tortoises whose burrows are used extensively by gopher frogs (Bailey 1991; Godley 1992). Mechanical site preparation techniques (such as roller chopping) destroy burrow openings, which may trap inhabitants. Routine pine straw harvest and associated removal of herbaceous vegetation also degrades the habitat quality (A.L. Braswell pers. comm.). Introduction of predatory game fishes (<em>Lepomis</em> spp. and <em>Micropterus</em> spp.) is detrimental as these species feed upon gopher frog tadpoles and possibly eggs. In some instances, introduction of mosquito fish (<em>Gambusia</em> spp.) can also be detrimental to gopher frogs and other larval amphibians (A.L. Braswell pers. comm.). Breeding sites are often degraded by off-road recreational vehicle (ORV) use or by sand roads that pass through or adjacent to the ponds as vehicular traffic disrupts pond floor micro-topography and eliminates herbaceous vegetation (J.G. Palis pers. comm.). More specifically, large tires of ORVs may break the organic hardpan that lies below the pond floor. This hardpan prevents water from draining into the sand below the wetland (LaClaire and Franz 1991), so breaking the hardpan could result in a shorter hydroperiod and thus make some wetlands unsuitable for gopher frog reproduction. Loss of herbaceous vegetation from ORV use could also discourage gopher frog reproduction since egg masses are attached to stems of herbaceous vegetation (Bailey 1990; J.G. Palis pers. comm.). Erosion of unpaved roads lying adjacent to breeding sites may result in sedimentation into the ponds. Introduction of sediment is exacerbated by the placement of wing ditches that divert water from roads into ponds. Heavy grazing by cattle in summer in dried pond basins might reduce or eliminate frog oviposition sites and/or alter pond nutrient cycling.","In Alabama, this frog occurs at six breeding sites (M.A. Bailey pers. comm.). In Florida, it is extant at 79 sites east of the Apalachicola River (R. Franz unpubl.) and it breeds in at least 25 sites west of the Apalachicola River (J.G. Palis pers. comm.). It is known from two specimens in Tennessee (Redmond and Scott 1996; M.A. Bailey pers. comm.), and it is known to occur at seven sites at least in Georgia, including Fort Benning (where 60-110 breeding adults were recorded in a two acre pond; Andrews pers. comm.), Fort Stewart (18 breeding sites recorded; D.J. Stevenson pers. comm.), McIntosh County, Baker County (at least five sites), Charlton County (C.W. Seyle unpubl.), Taylor County (three breeding sites), and Marion County. It is known from two sites (Savannah River Ecology Lab and Santee Coastal Reserve) in South Carolina. In North Carolina, it breeds at 11 sites (A.L. Braswell unpubl.). Though few data are available concerning changes in the species’ population status, much information exists on the reduction of its habitat and breeding sites. The longleaf pine (<em>Pinus palustris</em>) community, the ecosystem primarily inhabited by this species, has been reduced to less than 5% of its historical range (Frost 1993; Outcalt and Sheffield 1996). Bailey (1994) reported that eight of 14 known breeding sites in Alabama are considered historic and of the six extant ponds, only three supported substantial populations.

Surviving subpopulations remain  threatened by ongoing and increasing habitat loss due to the planting of  oil palm and illicit crops, expanding cattle ranching, increased oil  exploration and mining, and fires.","Night monkeys typically occur in primary and secondary forest (including disturbed forest and selectively logged forest), seasonally flooded and <em>terra firma</em>, lowland forest, and submontane and montane (cloud forests) in Colombia and the Andes to 3,200 m above sea level (the specifically montane forms are <em>Aotus lemurinus</em> and <em>Aotus miconax</em>) (Hernández Camacho and Cooper 1976, Aquino and Encarnación 1994a, Defler 2004). Aquino and Encarnación (1994b) reviewed the habitat and forest preferences of the genus. A research in San Martin area, in 100 forest fragments, found <em>A. brumbacki </em>groups in fragments of gallery forest, lowland rainforest and <em>Mauritia flexuosa</em> swamps (Carretero-Pìnzon and Defler in prep.)<br/><br/>Night monkeys are nocturnal: they are most active at dawn and dusk.  The only exception is <em>Aotus azarae azarae</em> of the Chaco of southern Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, which is cathemeral (active during night and day). They are frugivorous; their diet includes fruit, nectar and flower (seasonally important for the <em>A. a. azarae</em> in the Chaco), leaves, and small animals prey such as insects (Wright 1989; Fernandez-Duque 2007). <em>Aotus azarae</em> has been observed to include a significant portion of leaves in its diet (Ganzhorn and Wright 1994, Wright 1985, Arditi and Placci 1990, Giménez and Fernandez-Duque 2003), as has <em>Aotus zonalis</em> on Barro Colorado Island in an early study by Hladik and Hladik (1969).<br/><br/>They are socially monogamous, living in small groups of an adult pair and offspring of different ages (infant, one or two juveniles and sometimes a subadult. In <em>A. a. azarae</em>, a significant number of adults range alone. They may be subadults that have left their natal groups or older adults which have been evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernandez-Duque and Huntington 2002, Fernandez-Duque 2004). Both sexes disperse. Males care for the infants (carry them) (Rotundo <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2005). Lone adults were observed by Villavicencio Galindo (2003) in northern Colombia. Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 5-18 ha (depending on the species and location) (Wright 1978, Fernandez-Duque 2007). Solano (1995) estimated a home range of 17.5 ha for <em>A. brumbacki</em> on the Río Duda in Tinigua Natural National Park, Colombia. Wright (1994) and Fernandez-Duque (2007) review the behaviour and ecology of the genus.<br/><br/>Captive male <em>A. lemurinus</em> reach sexual maturity when two years old, and captive female <em>A. vociferans</em> and <em>A. nancymaae</em> first breed when 3-4 years old (Dixson 1983; Fernandez-Duque 2007). In the wild, male <em>A. azarae</em> reach adult weight only when about 4 years old, and age at first reproduction is about 5 years of age (Juárez <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernandez-Duque 2004). A female <em>A. azarae</em>was found to breed for the first time at 58 months of age (Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2002). Single offspring are the rule. Wright (1985) recorded births between August and February for <em>A. nigriceps</em> in Peru (Manu National Park), and Aquino <em>et al.</em> (1990) indicated a birth season between December and March) for <em>A. nancymaae</em> in north-eastern Peru.

There is no firm evidence for a significant range-wide population decline that warrants listing in a higher category of threat at the present time; however, its status could change as pressures on its habitat grow and if hunting of larger-bodied primates continues to intensify in the western parts of its range.","<em>Colobus guereza</em> is arboreal, but will travel across the ground between patches of forest. It occupies a wide range of forest types including low, mid-montane and montane moist forest, ground water forest, secondary forest, riverine forest, swamp forest and gallery forest. It is often common in secondary or degraded forest (Fashing and Oates 2013, Groves and Ting 2013). <em>Colobus guereza</em> is strictly folivorous in some regions, but feeds both on leaves and fruits in others (Fashing and Oates 2013). They live in groups of 2-10 adults, and group home ranges are from 1.5 to 100 ha (Fashing and Oates 2013, Groves and Ting 2013).","<em>Colobus guereza</em> is one of the few primate species which responds well to low to medium levels of habitat disturbance. This species is, however, threatened in many parts of its range by habitat loss through timber extraction, through removal of natural forest for exotic tree plantations and agriculture, and by rapidly expanding human populations (von Hippel <em>et al.</em> 2000, Fashing &amp; Oates 2013, Groves &amp; Ting 2013).<br/><br/>Bushmeat hunting is damaging populations in the western part of the range.<em> C. guereza </em>is also killed for its skins, which are used in traditional ceremonies and as ornaments worn by various African tribes (including Kikuyu, Samburu, Chagga, Kuria and Luhya; Mwenja 2007, de Jong &amp; Butynski 2010, Fashing &amp; Oates 2013, Groves &amp; Ting 2013). In the 19th century, the skins featured in the international fur trade, and in the 1970s large numbers of skins were on sale to tourists in Kenya and Ethiopia (Oates 1977).","<em>Colobus guereza</em> is a widespread species that is locally abundant. Densities range from 3 individuals/km² (Ituri Forest, DRC; Bocian 1997) to 800 individuals/km² (Murchison Falls, Uganda; Leskes and Acheson 1970 in Fashing and Oates 2013). Densities tend to be highest in patches of forest along lakes and rivers, intermediate in moist forest that have been subjected to low to moderate levels of human disturbance, and lowest in undisturbed moist forest (Fashing and Oates 2013).

This species experiences a considerable range in elevation of near sea level in the south to above 2,607 m in the north at Chendebji (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wangchuk <em>et al</em>. 2003). One isolated population is found in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, Nayakgaon, in the Kokrajhar district of Assam (Medhi&#160;et al. 2004). Study of this population has shown that the animals can withstand the effects of habitat change to some extent and survive in altered habitats (Medhi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). The diet consists of young and mature leaves, ripe and unripe fruits, and seeds, with most feeding spent on young leaves (Gupta 1998, 2002). Subba (1989) and Subba and Santiapillai (1989), however, found that this species prefers fruits and buds to leaves. In forest fragments they may depend on cultivated crops such as tapioca, betel, and guava. It is diurnal and arboreal (Khajuria 1977).<br/><br/>Long-term field studies show that the species spends 12.8–33% in feeding, 40–63.14%in resting, 6.29–19% in locomotion, 5–11.54% in monitoring, 2–3.7% time in playing and 0.35–6% time grooming and other social activities (Mukherjee 1996, Chetry 2002, Biswas 2004, Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). The home range of the species varies from 2 to 58 ha depending on the habitat quality (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Being a folivore the principal share of its diet is leaves, yet they consume other food item like fruits, seeds, flowers and insects on a regular basis. The species spends 60% of the time on feeding leaves, 24.6% time on fruits, 5.99% time on petiole, 2.5% on flower and flower buds, and 2.56% on stem cortex and shoot. They were also reported eating gum, soil, algae and burned wild potatoes and arium, snail (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Chirang Reserve Forest, the buffer between Manas and Ripu-Chirang Elephant Reserve, the langurs were seen to feed on <em>Cryptocoryne retrospiralis</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>","<p>Due to habitat destruction, the populations of this species are restricted to fragmented forest pockets, especially in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em> 2004). Habitat destruction is the major threat to this species in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em> 2004). Hunting is prohibited in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, yet electrocution from power lines and hunting by dogs are local threats, which are affecting the population (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em>&#160;2004). A comparative analysis based on satellite images taken in 1988 and 1998 showed a 50% loss of original habitat in India for this species (Srivastava <em>et al</em>., 2001). Although commercial logging is banned in reserves where this species is found, illegal encroachment and logging, woodcutting and domestic fuel wood collection have severely affected the habitsats of the species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2001). The political unrest, the settlement of&#160; refugee in the habitat, developmental activities , shifting cultivation, commercial logging, rubber plantation, contributed the habitat destruction of the species (Chetry <em>et al</em>., 2010).&#160; Stone quarrying and its associated noise pollution, as well as artillery firing practices in the Bamuni hills, may also have a negative effect.</p> <p>Recorded forest cover lost during 1997-2001 has been reported in the following as Chirang Reserve Forest (593 km<sup>2</sup>) reduced to 393 km<sup>2</sup>, and&#160;Bengaltal Reserve Forest reduced to 5 km<sup>2</sup> during this period and similar trend was reported throughout the distribution range in India except in protected areas. The habitat is still under tremendous anthrpogernic pressure in the form encroachments, expansion of agricultural activities&#160;and other development activities are existing&#160;and which is expected to&#160;continue in future too.&#160;There was massive habitat loss between 1989 and 2000, which resulted in severe fragmentation into 19 pockets where the Golden Langur survived until sometime and eventually disappeared (Choudhury, 2002).</p> <p>Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following threats for this species: “Crop plantations, grazing, harvesting non-woody vegetation for firewood and charcoal production, selective logging, timber collection, human settlement, deforestation, fragmentation, trade, killed by domestic dogs, habitat loss, high juvenile mortality, inbreeding, and local trade in live animals as pets and in road shows. Trade is insignificant.” Due to road construction and other human activities (settlements), the northern and southern populations are completely separated and this has led to loss of suitable habitats and fragmentation (J. Das pers. comm.). There are potential threats to the population in the near future in India due to mustard cultivation and other human activities, and therefore the population is also expected to decline (J. Das pers. comm.).&#160;Poisoning due to organochlorine insecticide is another threat to the population as witnessed in a rubber plantation in Kokrajhar, Assam (Nath and Chakraborthy, 2011).</p><p>It is suspected that the rate of decline in India is well above 60%, definitely more than in Bhutan; but given the overall disturbance in both the countries due to increasing number of development projects, damming, conversion of forests for settlements, cultivation and plantations, the destruction of habitat is on the increase and is expected to continue into the future for another two decades at least at the same rate.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>A total of&#160;5,141 individuals in 566 troops were sighted in&#160;India in mid-to-late 2000s (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ghosh <em>et al</em>. 2009) and 6,637 individual reported from Bhutan in early 2000s (Wangchuk 2003). Demographic trends indicate a decline in the population of this species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2001). Groups were bigger and densities higher in areas of more degraded habitat (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001), however, owing to disturbance and felling, the langurs remained in higher densities&#160;for quite some time but currently they have totally disappeared from degraded habitats. The langurs near the National Highway such as Bismuri and other places have vanished. The high density was due to crowding from sudden habitat loss and degradation. The langurs survived for quite some time in such habitat as the local people generally do not kill for meat unlike many other areas of northeastern India (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>The population has declined by more than 30% in the last 30 years, and is expected to decline further in the near future due to various threats outlined by field biologists in both India and Bhutan (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Population densities in Manas National Park, and Ripu and Chirrang reserve forests are 8 ind/km², 46 ind/km², and 64 ind/km², respectively. The Golden Langur Conservation Project saw a rise in the langurs population across the range in India, from 1,500 in 1997 to 5,600 in 2007–2012, and in Bhutan, estimated to be 6,600 in number. Estimated range size at present is 1,506 km². The density has also significantly increased from one individual/km² to 3.71 individuals/km² in 2009. Distribution&#160;area&#160;in the protected area and outside protected area in India is 1,993 km² and in the protected areas of Bhutan is 2,992 km² (Chetry <em>et al.</em> 2010). Overall there is no increase (except in some pockets) but populations have declined sharply in areas such as Chirang RF.

Its distribution in Bhutan is limited to the foothills of the Black Mountains (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001, Chetri and Chetri 2009). The total known range of this species in both India and Bhutan is less than 30,000 km², and much of it is not suitable habitat (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001).

However, Srivastava <em>et al</em>. (2001) reports that the species is also found in Ripu, Chirrang, and Manas Forest Reserves. Yet these reserves are unstable, and the complete protection of Manas National Park is needed (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). By upgrading the protection and status of this species, it is believed that isolated populations can be linked through corridors that will prevent genetic fragmentation (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). A long-term study is needed to assess the actual impact of habitat alteration on the species over long periods of time (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Medhi <em>et al.</em> (2004) suggest the following actions to protect the population of this species in Nayakgaon: insulation or diversion of electric lines, motivate villagers to restrain their dogs, planting of trees to develop a corridor between the Nayakgaon population and the Chakrashila population, a long term study of behaviour and ecology, and regular monitoring of the population. <br/><br/>Chetry and Chetry (2009) suggested habitat conservation, forested corridors linking the fragments, habitat restoration of the degraded forest, wild to wild translocation of isolated populations, community participation in forest management and trans-boundary&#160;conservation programme for the conservation of the species.

It has also been noted in bamboo “brakes” and hollock (<em>Terminalia myriocarpa</em>) and ajhar (<em>Largerstroemia flosreginae</em>) plantations. One gibbon pair in the Borajan Reserved Forest (north-east India) was observed to habitually descend from the trees to move over scrub and short bamboo especially while trying to reach the isolated food trees inside a village. This pair was found sleeping at heights of 0 m or less in bamboo clumps (Kakati 1997). Although gibbons may be moving through, or sleeping in, bamboo forest or plantations, they cannot survive in monocultures (W. Brockleman pers. comm.). Additionally, the species has been observed in two plains forest locations (Choudhury 1991). Its preferred habitat, however, is dense evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (Choudhury 2001). It has been recorded at altitudes of up to 2,500 m in Manipur, northeast India (Choudhury 2001).<br/><br/>Home ranges in most populations range from 8-63 ha (Ahsan 2001, Alfred and Sati 1990, Muzaffar <em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160; Feeroz and Islam 1992,&#160; Islam and Feeroz 1992; Islam and Feeroz 1992a, Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996, Tilson 1979), but unusually large home ranges of 200-400 ha were reported from Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India (Mukherjee 19<em>96</em>). The western hoolock is a frugivorous species, with ripe fruits composing a majority of its diet (Ahsan 2001, Alfred and Sati 1990, Bin Muzaffar <em>et al.</em> 2007,&#160; Feeroz and Islam 1992, Islam and Feeroz 1992a&#160; Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996, Tilson 1979). A dominantly folivorous diet was reported during studies carried out in Assam’s Borajan Reserved Forest and in Tripura (Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996), and gibbons living in small forest fragments were observed to experience a period of almost total lack of fruit in their diet at the end of the dry season (Kakati 2000, Mukherjee 1996). Low fruit availability may contribute to the relatively large home range sizes of some populations. In northeast India, the hoolock gibbon is recognized as being an important disperser of undigested seeds from large and small fruit-bearing trees (Das <em>et al</em>. 2005).","In Bangladesh, the main threats are the combined effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, human interference and hunting (Islam and Feeroz 1992, Molur <em>et al.</em> 2005). Hunting is universal all over Bangladesh as well as India, and may be in Myanmar also. In China, the Tibetan population could be under threat from hunting for food or non-targeted hunting, but this is not established.<br/><br/>In some Indian locales, these animals are rare due to large scale hunting for food and because some ethnic groups believe the gibbons have medicinal properties (Gupta 2005, J. Das pers. comm). On the other hand, observations from Arunachal Pradesh (P.C. Ray pers. comm.) suggest that hoolocks are not hunted for subsistence, and may even be cherished. Density of gibbons is still high around tribal villages of several ethnic groups; the same is true in northern Myanmar. Additionally, jhoom cultivation threatens the habitats of Indian populations, some of which are relatively isolated already (Choudhury 1991). Affecting all northeastern Indian primate populations are harvesting of bamboo for paper mills, oil mining and exploration, and coal mining, which deplete habitat and cause pollution and disturbance (Choudhury 1991). Habitat fragmentation and loss are major threats in India (Kakati 2000). Small and restricted groups may not be viable because of genetic and demographic instabilities and because they are more affected by hunting pressure and habitat loss. Many small forest fragments are reported to have only one or a few gibbon groups. These have limited chances of surviving more than a few generations without translocation (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015, Das <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, shifting cultivation is a major threat, and so is hunting. Although logging is restricted on the western side of the Chindwin, it is still considered a threat for this species (Geissmann <em>et al</em>. 2013). Political and ethnic conflicts have prevented the Myanmar government from promoting development and conservation activities effectively in areas of northwestern and central western Myanmar along the borders with India and Bangladesh. Thus, most conservation efforts have been concentrated within the range of <em>Hoolock leuconedys</em>.","There are estimated to be about 200-280 hoolocks in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2006, Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005). In China, a population has been identified in Medog Nature Reserve in southeastern Tibet, just across the border from Arunachal Pradesh, but the identity of this taxon is not established and there has been no survey conducted to determine the population numbers (W. Bleisch pers. comm).<br/><br/>This species occurs in several of India’s northeastern states, but populations there tend to be isolated. It is common in certain areas of occurrence, but rare in others due to intense hunting by local tribes (Choudhury 1991), and is considered rare throughout its range (Choudhury 2001). The species was found in all forested patches in northeastern India about 30 years ago, but they are reduced to a few forest fragments now. The total population in northeastern India is now estimated to be over 12,000, of which about 2,000 occur in the state of Assam (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2005), and most of the remainder in Arunachal Pradesh. A population of about 170 gibbons has more recently been identified as <em>H. leuconedys</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2006) and should be subtracted from the population estimate if this identity is proven. Moreover, there are surveys needed in Mehao region, where there is uncertainty as to which species the gibbons there represent (Das <em>et al.</em> 2006, Das pers. comm). Namdapha National Park in the Changlang District of Arunachal Pradesh is a relative stronghold for this species in India, offering the population there its largest contiguous stretch of protected habitat (Chetry <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160;Recent surveys by Ray <em>et al.</em> (2015) using auditory methods have revealed high average densities of 3.47 groups per km² in the northern part of Namdapha National Park, which would yield projections of the total population in the park of over 15,000. However, caution is advised, as further surveys in the central and southern parts of the park are needed, and are ongoing.<br/><br/>There are no population estimates available for Myanmar. It is possible that the largest and most viable populations of western hoolock are to be found in this country, where at present almost no attention is paid to it (W. Brockelman pers. comm). There are several thousand square kilometres of unsurveyed forest habitat in the central-west and north-west of this country, with a particular need to survey the western areas west of Chindwin/Ayerawady River. There are reports of gibbons in Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range, but there is no knowledge of the actual population level there (W. Brockelman pers. comm. 2006). The western part of Hukuang Tiger Reserve with a large area of forest (&gt;1,000 km²) has not been surveyed, but is likely to have this species. The northern limit is just south of Hkakaraborazi National Park.",Decreasing,"This species is found in eastern Bangladesh, northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), and northwestern Myanmar (west of the Chindwin River). It might possibly occur in China (extreme southeastern Tibet). The distribution in India is restricted to points south of the Brahmaputra and east of the Dibang (Dingba Qu) Rivers (Choudhury 2001). Animals that once were common in the plains of Arunachal Pradesh (northeasternmost India) before that habitat was cultivated for agriculture and tea are not so any more (Islam and Feeroz 1992).<br/><br/>The boundary between the two species of <em>Hoolock</em> is the Chindwin River, which flows into the Ayerawady (Irrawady) River. At the headwaters in the north there is a hybrid zone or cline between the two species (since they are almost certainly not reproductively isolated). Das <em>et al</em>. (2006) reported the discovery of a population of <em>Hoolock leuconedys</em> in Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India, which has traditionally been considered to be part of the range of <em>H. hoolock</em>.",This species is hunted for food throughout most of its range.

Quantitative analysis has also suggested that the population may face a  high risk of extinction under some ecologically feasible future  scenarios (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the late 1950s, the population was estimated to be over 2,000 individuals (Haimoff 1984, Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987). By 1989, the Hainan Gibbon population was thought to have been reduced to a single relict population of 21 gibbons occurring in four groups, restricted to a 16 km<sup>2</sup> patch of primary montane rainforest on Mt. Futouling within Bawangling National Nature Reserve (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1989). The Hainan Gibbon is also threatened by issues associated with extremely small population size, such as inbreeding effects, poor mate availability, and anthropogenic or natural disaster, with population modelling indicating that the surviving population is highly vulnerable to such issues (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Fellowes <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bryant&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016).</p>","<p>This species currently occurs in montane rainforest, at altitudes ranging from 650 to 1,200 m (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005), although specimens were collected at lower elevations prior to the complete clearance of lowland forest on Hainan. It is diurnal, arboreal, and mostly frugivorous; the most difficult time for the gibbons to find food in Bawangling National Nature Reserve is between February and April, when only a handful of food-plant species are available for the gibbons.<br/><br/>Group size has been reported to range from 4-8 individuals, with an average of 5.3-5.5 individuals, depending on the year of the study; during 2009-2011 the largest group comprised of 11 individuals (Mootnick <em>et al</em>. 2012). Like its closest congener the Cao Vit Gibbon (<em>Nomascus nasutus</em>), the Hainan Gibbon appears to be habitually polygynous with a bi-female breeding system (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016). Home range size was previously thought to be large for gibbons, with estimates between 2.0-9.87 km<sup>2</sup> (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1989, Wei <em>et al</em>. 2004, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, recent standardised analysis has indicated that home range size is actually in line with closely related species, with an average home range of 1.49 km<sup>2</sup> (Bryant 2014, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016b, Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017).

However, although core remaining habitat at Bawangling has been relatively well protected, poaching of other wildlife with rifles and traps continues to occur within the reserve, so this species is still potentially at threat from hunting activity (e.g. accidental shooting through mistaken identity).<br/><br/>The Hainan Gibbon is also threatened by issues associated with extremely small population size, such as inbreeding effects, poor mate availability, and anthropogenic or natural disaster, with population modelling indicating that the surviving population is highly vulnerable to such issues (Chan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Fellowes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016). There are reports of a sex bias in births, but it is not possible to identify the sex of young Hainan gibbons in the field, because immature individuals do not differ in fur colouration or calls, and sexual organs of males and females resemble each other (T. Geissmann pers. comm. 2006). However, recent genetic analysis has indicated that three out of four offspring born into one group in recent years were male (Bryant <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Forest loss also remains a threat: between 1991 and 2008, remote sensing vegetation maps reported a decrease in gibbon habitat across Hainan by 540 km<sup>2</sup> (35%), and by 6.3 km<sup>2</sup> (7%) in the locality of the last remaining population at Bawangling National Nature Reserve. Forest patches suitable to support gibbons decreased from 754 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;to 316 km<sup>2</sup> in total area during this period, with plantations replacing forests below 760 m, and habitat becoming increasingly degraded (Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987, 1989; Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p>  </p>","<p>  </p><p>In the late 1950s, the population was estimated to be over 2,000 individuals (Haimoff 1984, Liu <em>et al</em>. 1987).

In 1998, the Bawangling population was thought to consist of 17 individuals (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2004). During a comprehensive survey in 2003, only 13 individuals were recorded, consisting of two groups, in addition to two solitary males (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2005). Fellowes <em>et al</em>.

Suitable gibbon habitat exists more widely across the Bawangling landscape and also outside Bawangling, and there have been anecdotal reports of gibbon occurrence in various forested sites, such as Yinggeling National Nature Reserve, Jiaxi Nature Reserve and Limushan Nature Reserve (B. Chan unpubl. data, Turvey<em> et al</em>. 2016). Surveys have been conducted in some of these areas, but have not as yet detected any concrete evidence of any additional surviving gibbon individuals or populations (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Within Bawangling, past conservation efforts have focused on regular monitoring of the gibbon population, restoration of degraded lowland forest, and engagement of local villagers in conservation activities (Fellowes <em>et al.</em> 2008). Community work including public outreach and promotion of alternative livelihoods to lessen the villager's reliance on forest products and lands have also been initiated, however, there is a need for continued gun and trap confiscation around Bawangling. Following the 2014 conservation action planning meeting for the Hainan Gibbon (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2015), current key conservation activities include: continued monitoring and development of optimal monitoring techniques to better understand gibbon dispersal, group formation and colonisation of new habitat; continued effective protection of gibbon habitat and enhancement of forest connectivity within and beyond the reserve, to promote expansion of gibbons into additional good-quality habitat; development of an emergency response plan in the event of a crisis situation; and improved communication to facilitate collaboration among stakeholders.

They feed in early evening, while in flight, on flies, beetles, true bugs, dragonflies, bees, wasps, and crickets. They are quick and direct when flying, feeding mostly among or above&#160;the tops of trees at about 6 to 15 m (Wilson and Ruff 1999). However, it is not uncommon to see them over open ponds, along forest edges, or near lights, presumably where insects accumulate. Like most microchiropterans, seminole bats find their insect prey through echolocation.<br/>Generally, seminole bats are found in lowland forest stands of mixed deciduous and pine trees. Although several bats may be found hanging together, roosting alone is more common. They hang 1.5 to 6.1 m above the ground on the southwest side of trees, clinging to the inside of clumps of Spanish moss (<em>Tillandsia usneoides</em>), leaves, or loose bark; occasionally they can roost in caves. Roosting is more common in pine trees, especially during parturition and lactation.&#160;Trees that are selected for roosting are taller and larger in diameter than other trees near the roost area. Selected trees are also tend to be near forest edges that permit easy flight paths (Constantine 1958, 1966; Barbour and Davis 1969; Menzel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998). The area directly below the moss where they hang is clear of other branches, allowing these bats to drop down to begin their flight. The ground beneath them is covered with leaf litter and other organic debris, thus reducing the amount of sunlight that is reflected on them when hanging.","Since these bats roost primarily in Spanish moss, the gathering of this moss could affect roosting behavior (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Although no studies have been done to determine whether there has been an impact, educating moss collectors about these roosting requirements could help seminole bats.","<em>L. seminolus</em> is a solitary bat species, and rarely are more than two individuals found roosting together (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Individuals usually roost alone and remain in the roost whenever the temperature is below 21°C. If the relative humidity increases, they are able to fly at lower temperatures. A sighting was reported at 20°C when the relative humidity was 38%. They do not hibernate, but do go into torpor. These bats fly throughout the year and have been spotted on warm days in the middle of winter. Seasonal migration does occur within their range in the southeastern United States. There are fewer seminole bats in the northern portions of their range during the winter, but in the south they are one of the most abundant bats active at that time of year. They have been known to join groups of migrating birds on southward migrations. No studies have yet been done to determine how they navigate their migration route. The possibilities include visual landmarks, smells, or winds (Constantine 1958, Neuweiler 2000).&#160;There have been no longevity studies on seminole bats.

More data and population monitoring are required for this species, and a reassessment is recommended as soon as additional information becomes available.","Habitats include desert scrub, open conifer-oak woodlands and pine forests in the Upper Sonoran and Transition Life Zones, generally arid areas where agave plants are present (USFWS 2000).&#160;This species usually favours higher and cooler regions than <em>L. yerbabuenae</em> (Arita 1991).&#160;Roosting habitat requirements are not well known.&#160;It usually roosts in large groups (up to 10,000) in caves or mines, occasionally found in buildings, hollow trees or culverts. It emerges well after sunset and feeds on pollen and nectar, principally of agaves and various cacti. <em>Pseudobombax, Ceiba, Ipomoea, Calliandra, Pinus</em>, and grasses are also important food sources in Central Mexico (Gardner 1977). Fruit and insects are sometimes taken; 173 samples contained insect parts in central México (Sánchez and Medellín 2007). Northern subpopulations migrate south in winter; numbers found in caves fluctuate greatly from year to year, indicating eruptive movements in addition to seasonal migration. A single young is born in May or June (Hensley and Wilkins 1988, Reid 1997).","Primary threats include disturbance of roosts, loss of food sources through clearing of land for agriculture and human exploitation of agaves (e.g., for production of alcoholic beverages), and direct killing by humans. Other threats may include negative effects of ingestion of pesticides applied to plants, competition for roosts and nectar, natural catastrophes, disease and predation; however, these are not believed to be major limiting factors, though some of them could become significant for subpopulations reduced to small size by other factors (see USFWS 2000). <br/><br/>These bats are sensitive to disturbance in their roosting sites (they often quickly take flight upon human entry; Wilson 1985) and, in general, roosting caves are becoming increasingly subject to human destruction and disturbance. Human disturbance and destruction of roost sites is a common occurrence in Mexico. The availability of roost sites free from disturbance may be a significant limiting factor. Special precautions should be taken when mine and cave surveys are conducted. In June and July when the young are very small, disturbance can cause them to lose their grasp on the rock and fall to their death. During hibernation, disturbance will cause an increase in metabolism; this use of fat reserves may cause starvation prior to spring (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 1996). A major problem for bats all over Mexico is that uninformed citizens frequently destroy all bats in a roost, believing them to be vampire bats. <br/><br/>Foraging habitat can be degraded or destroyed by harvesting of agave (an important food resource). Although it has been estimated that bootleg mescal makers are eliminating between 500,00 and 1,200,000 wild paniculate agave a year in Sonora alone, there is no clear support for such a statement. Agave plant parts are harvested just before they bloom; this prevents flowering and can prevent reproduction by the affected plant (an agave plant grows for 10 to 20 years, flowers only once, then dies). However, there are few places in Sonora or elsewhere in Mexico where wild Agave harvesting has eliminated a significant percentage of nectar-producing genets, and plants harvested by indigenous people generally produce vegetative offshoots that may eventually produce flowers (Nabhan and Fleming 1993). Populations of unharvested plants persist in many areas that are not easily accessible to humans. The negative impact of agave harvest probably is not as great as was previously believed. On the other hand, reduced pollination resulting from decreased bat populations may eventually lead to a reduction in agave distribution and abundance. <br/><br/>Some foraging habitat has been degraded or destroyed by expansion of agriculture and other land uses. Large areas of both the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental and the Mexican Plateau have been converted to agriculture or rangeland. <br/><br/>This species may experience predation from owls, hawks, snakes and mammals, but natural levels of predation likely are inconsequential to the overall status of the species. However, increased populations of domestic and feral cats and other predators near human habitations may affect the survival of colonies, particularly maternity colonies (USFWS 2000).","This bat is uncommon or rare (Reid 1997). The number of occurrences or subpopulations is unknown but probably exceeds 20; Arita (1991) mapped a few dozen collection sites in Mexico. One known colonial roosting site exists in the United States, which has shown large declines in the past (Matthews and Moseley 1990), but there could be one or more additional sites that have not yet been detected. The number of occurrences or subpopulations with good viability is unknown but likely there are not very many. Several caves in central Mexico were known to contain considerable numbers in the past but now contain only small colonies or none at all (see USFWS 2000). It is probably declining in number of occurrences or subpopulations and  in overall population size, but the rate of decline is unknown and  better information is need. The only mating roost has been declining but  is now protected.<br/><br/>There is a single known U.S. roost at  Emory Peak (a cave in Big Bend National Park,&#160;Texas), which&#160;fluctuates widely from year to year (zero to 10,000+ individuals): 10,650 bats in 1967, 5,000 in 1968, 3,900  in 1969, zero in 1970, 8,025 in 1971, 1,000 in 1983, 4,942-5,990 in  1988, over 5,000 in 1991, zero in 1992, and 2,859 in 1993 (Matthews and  Moseley 1990, see USFWS 2000). No significant trend can be ascertained from these data,  which are the best available for the species. Reasons for the  fluctuations are not understood, but they could reflect annual  variations in food resources in different parts of the range (USFWS  2000).&#160;Fluctuation may be in part due to some counts being made before  or after the main period of bat occupation of the cave (Cockrum and  Petryszyn 1991). The Texas subpopulation may be a ""spill-over"" colony  present during years of high population or reduced food supply. <br/><br/>Sánchez and Medellín (2007) estimated the  colony at Cueva del Diablo, Morelos, central Mexico, at 3,000  individuals, while López (2010) estimated the same colony at 4,000. Both  estimates were done visually under the supervision of the same  individual (R. Medellin) and during the winter months, the only time of  the year this species remains in the area. Arita and Prado rated this  species as widespread and scarce in Mexico. See  Arita (1993) for general information on conservation status and  population size in Mexico. <br/><br/>The long-term trend  is unclear. The extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO)  probably have not changed much, but the habitat quality, the number of occurrences or  subpopulations and population size may have dramatically decreased in  some sites during the last three decades. Wilson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  (1985) found that this species was either completely absent or present  in reduced numbers in known roosts. The number of bats found represented  only a fraction of the total reported in previous studies. For example,  in an abandoned mine in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, where an estimated  population of 10,000 was observed in 1938, no individuals of <em>L. nivalis</em>  were found in 1983 (Wilson 1985). Another mine in Nuevo Leon had a  ceiling covered with newborn bats in 1967, but only one bat was found in  1983. A few other roosts had reduced numbers of bats compared to  findings during previous surveys. These changes could indicate a decline  in the overall population, but they might reflect movement of bats  among different roosting sites in different years, or they could result  from seasonal changes in bat distribution (survey dates varied).",Decreasing,"This species is known from southeast Arizona, south New Mexico and southwest Texas (USA) to south Mexico and Guatemala (Simmons 2005). However, there is no evidence of this species being present south of Guerrero, Mexico (R. Medellín unpubl. data), and its southern limit of distribution should be adjusted to central Guerrero, Mexico, to reflect this fact. It generally occurs from lowlands to 3,500 m asl (mostly 1,000 to 2,200 m asl, Reid 1997).<br/><br/>The range includes medium to high elevations in northern and central Mexico, southwestern Texas (southern Brewster and Presidio counties), and southwestern New Mexico, at elevations of about 500 to 3,500 m asl. Most occurrences in Mexico are at elevations of 1,000 to 2,200 m asl, but this bat been captured at an elevation of 3,780 m asl (Arita 1991), and the type specimen was caught near snow line at 17,816 feet (5,747 m asl) on Mt. Orizaba, in Veracruz, Mexico (USFWS 2000). In Texas, this species is known from the Big Bend National Park and Chinati Mountain area. Two specimens of <em>Leptonycteris </em>taken in Hidalgo County, New Mexico (in 1963 and 1967), were determined to be <em>L. nivalis</em>. The presence of this species in New Mexico was reconfirmed in Hidalgo County in 1992 (Hoyt <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994). This species formerly was thought to occupy a much larger area, extending into southern Mexico and Guatemala, but specimens collected from those areas have been assigned to <em>L. yerbabuenae</em> (Arita and Humphrey 1988). The only colonial roost in the U.S. is a cave at Emory Peak, at an elevation of 2,290 m asl, in the Chisos Mountains, Texas. Simmons (2005) described the range of <em>L. nivalis</em> as extending to southern Mexico and Guatemala, and she also included southeastern Arizona in the range. However, no actual records for Arizona are known, and Arita (1991) showed the range as extending only as far south as Puebla and northern Guerrero.",This species is not used.,Terrestrial,"A protected subpopulation exists at Emory Peak, Big Bend National Park, Texas (USFWS 2000). Further regular surveys are needed to determine important roost sites, abundance and trends. Conservation of this bat will require maintenance of relatively large areas of wild Agave. Identification and protection of currently and formerly occupied roost sites and protection of foraging habitat in at least several areas throughout the range are important conservation needs. Subpopulations need to be defined, and movement patterns need to be better understood. Accurate censusing methods need to be developed. This species is the focus of a specific conservation program by the government and the University of Mexico (UNAM). The only mating roost known in the state of Morelos, central Mexico is now secured as a sanctuary and&#160;with the aid&#160;of the local land owners the situation is improving dramatically.&#160;In Mexico the species is listed as threatened under NOM - 059 - SEMARNAT - 2015, and is a priority species of the Mexican Bat Conservation Program and of the Commission of Protected Areas of the Mexican Federal Government.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22152905,9919,Hemitragus jemlahicus,Near Threatened,A2bcde,2020,2020-01-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Himalayan Tahr is listed as Near Threatened in view of the general prevalence of ‘old’ and ‘new’ threats, often increasing in intensity. There are small pockets with reasonable densities of tahr but vast areas devoid of them. Overall, tahr populations are on the decline, as indicated by sharp drops and disappearance in some areas, and declining habitat quality, ongoing poaching and impact of livestock as competitor, in other areas. It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years) and the species nearly meets the criteria A2bcde for Vulnerable, but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.","<p>Since Burrard’s (1925) hunting account, Himalayan Tahr has been known to traverse the steepest precipices. In general, they inhabit steep rocky mountain slopes, between 3,000–4,000 m asl, with woods and rhododendron <em>Rhodondendron</em> sp. scrub (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/></p>  <p>In Nepal, various surveys—like those in Kang Chu area (Schaller 1973), Everest National Park (Ale 2007), Langtang National Park (Green, 1979) and Annapurna Conservation Area (Gurung 1995)—reported that tahr occupy various habitat types from open alpine grassland and subalpine scrubland to sparse or even dense forests (tahr winter habitat). Precipitous cliffs break the continuity of these habitats. The best tahr habitat in the Everest region can be described as cliff faces broken by ledges supporting grasses, forbs and shrub mats at higher altitudes (mean 3,863 m, SE=0.9, range 3,260 m - 4,800 m, n=191) and patches of open pine or birch forest at lower altitude (mean 3,621 m, SE=1.4, range 3,300 m - 4,031 m, n=66). Tahr was reported from as high as 5,200 m (e.g., in Langtang: Fox 1974) and as low as 2,500 m in Kang Chu (Schaller 1977). In these mountains, steep hill slopes and undulating terrains are often characteristically interrupted by abrupt cliffs which act as oasis for these cliff-huggers whose presence is often predictive in these enclaves. This cliff-hugging behaviour of tahr restricts its own distribution (Ale 2007) and perhaps limits its group size as well. </p>  <p>Himalayan Tahr is diurnal, with varying group sizes depending on the degree of habitat ruggedness that characterizes particular localities. Group size of tahr is also influenced by the abundance of food and predation pressure. For instance, in Everest, group size ranged from 1-46 (average of ca. 8, n=277), during 2004 to 2006 (Lovari 1992, Ale 2007). The average group size increased over the decade in Everest perhaps in response to the return of snow leopards to the region (Ale 2007). Tahr formed comparatively larger groups in Annapurna Base Camp, Annapurna Conservation Area (13.8, range 1-57, n=134: Gurung 1995) and Langtang (average 15, largest group 77: Green 1979). Both Annapurna and Langtang lacked large predator, such as the snow leopard, in alpine and subalpine habitat, but most of these areas were characterized by undulating grasslands and scrublands thereby providing more plant forages for herbivores. <br/></p>  <p>The prevalence of local hunting may also influence the average group size. In Himachal Pradesh, western Himalaya (India), group size was very small (ca. 1.7, n = 7) with severe hunting in the past (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1983). This may have been reflected in the overall density reported from different study sites. In Everest, the tahr density was ca. 3.4/km<sup>2</sup> (with no human hunting but presence of large predator). Gurung (1995) reported tahr at the density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup> from Annapurna, with no human hunting and no large predator. In the absence of local hunting or natural predation, food can be the principle factor liming the size of populations. In overall Langtang (with no large predator and no human hunting), Tiwari (2006) reported 8.72 tahr/km<sup>2</sup> (8 herds, 218 individuals, in an area of 25 square kilometre). In the Langtang region of Langtang National Park, local density of tahr reached as high as 24/km<sup>2</sup> (Green 1979: 170 in 7 km<sup>2</sup>), where tahr was neither hunted nor its habitat grazed by livestock. On the other hand, Yala region of Langtang National Park, with ten times more domestic sheep and eight times more cattle than Langtang region, reached low tahr density (6/km<sup>2</sup>). In the absence of hunting in parts of New Zealand, tahr attained densities of &gt;30/km<sup>2 </sup>(Tustin and Challies, 1978). Female groups can reach very high densities in New Zealand, with groups of 100–150 commonly observed in areas that have not been hunted (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data). With regular hunting their population, however, maintained a density of ca. 5/km<sup>2</sup> (Tustin and Challies 1978)</p>  <p>Mating occurs from October to January, with it peaking around the first half of December (Lovari, S., unpubl. data). One or occasionally two kids are born in June and July after a gestation of 180-242 days. The age at sexual maturity is 1.5 years, with captive animals living up to 22 years (Smith <em>et al</em>., 2008). Females have home ranges of about 2 km<sup>2</sup> centred on rock bluffs. Males appear to be highly mobile, and outside of the rut are segregated from females (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data).</p>    <p>Himalayan Tahr is known to eat grass, herbs and some fruits. On Mt. Everest, tahr’s diets consisted typically of such grasses and sedges as <em>Carex, Avena</em>, <em>Poa</em>, <em>Trisetum</em>, <em>Cyperaceae</em> and <em>Imperata</em>. (Shrestha et al. 2002): overall, the diets were composed of 47% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 28% grasses and 25% sedges. This was similar to that Green (1979) reported for tahr in Langtang valley (38% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 34% grasses, 21% sedges, 4% ferns and 4% mosses). Green (1979) found in winter tahr supplemented its diet with small amounts of mosses and ferns, presumably because other food is less readily available. The diets of livestock and tahr were similar in the Everest region, but the proportion of woody plants (<em>Rhododendron</em> and <em>Cotoneaster</em>) was higher and that of grasses and sedges were lower in the diet of livestock than tahr. </p>","<p>The major threats in China are uncontrolled hunting and deforestation. In India, Himalayan Tahr is hunted for meat, and there is apparently significant competition with livestock for summer grazing in some areas. <span lang=""EN-IN"">Tahr possibly survive in small patches of steep, rugged forests around the sub-alpine zone, while much of its habitat is lost due to heavy pressure from local people and from developmental pressures. In Nepal, threats come from an expanding human population and accompanying increases in livestock, habitat loss, and poaching. As a result of these factors, tahr populations are becoming increasingly isolated. Besides threats related to anthropogenic activities, avalanches during winters with high snowfall also can be a significant mortality factor for tahr.</p>","<p>No global population estimate of Himalayan Tahr is currently available. The rate of its population change is unknown.<br/><br/>Only a few Himalayan Tahr have been observed in China (Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986). Perhaps, between 400 and 500 tahr, all located in southern Tibet, may exist in China (Wang 1998).<br/><br/>No estimate of tahr population in India is available, however, a number of sporadic counts of tahr are available from across the range. In Himachal Pradesh, for instance, approximately 130 in Kanawar Wildlife Sanctuary, and over 100 in Great Himalayan National Park (S. Pandey, pers. comm.) were reported. Population estimates have also been reported from parts of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary: 70 in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1994), and 110 in the Tungnath region of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Kittur <em>et al</em>. 2006). One survey between 1996 and 1998 indicated 50 tahr inhabiting Tirthan valley of the Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). Kandpal and Sathyakumar (2010) reported tahr from the Pindari glacier area. A recent high altitude ungulate survey in 2016 estimated 297 tahr (range: 222–565, 0.32 animals/sq. km) from Uttarakhand (Habib <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest several local extinctions of tahr in India (Sathyakumar, S., unpubl. data). They may be close to extirpation from western parts of Jammu and Kashmir. The entire population reported earlier from north of the Chenab River (between Kisthwar and the Banihal pass) is believed to be locally extinct now. Small populations of tahr survive in Bani-Sarthal (Kathua) and Kisthwar National Park (Kisthwar-Doda) (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Density estimates ranging from as high as 19.6 to 25.7<span lang=""EN-IN""> per km² (Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttarakhand) (Sathyakumar 1994) and from as low as 1.4 to 4.6 <span lang=""EN-IN"">per km² (Great Himalayan National Park, Himachal Pradesh) (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999) have been reported from different parts of Western Himalaya.<br/><br/></span>A different abundance index, that is, encounter rates (number/km walked) indicated tahr was less abundant in Nanda Devi National Park than Tungnath in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1993, 1994). Also, the tahr population was denser in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary than Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). A camera trap survey (trap nights/100 days) from the upper catchment of Bhagirathi River revealed higher abundance of tahr in temperate habitat (4.4 ± 2.62) than alpine habitat (0.6 ± 0.34) (Pal <em>et al</em>., in press). In Sikkim, an intensive study in Prek Chu Catchment found the presence of Himalayan Tahr in subalpine and alpine zone, but they were rare compared to other ungulates such as blue sheep (Bhattacharya 2013).<br/><br/>No total population size estimates of tahr are available for Nepal, but there have been several sporadic surveys from different parts of the country over the decades. Bauer (1988) estimated 1,000 tahr for Sagamartha, Makalu-Barun and Langtang National Parks. These three regions obviously support more tahr than Bauer’s estimates, as revealed by relatively recent studies (see below).<br/><br/>Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park can easily support 700-800 tahr, at least half of them occurring in Namche, Phorste, Thame and Gokyo valleys, in an area of <em>ca</em> 160 km². The overall mean group size was 8.5, from 2004 to 2006, with an overall density of 3.4/km2 (Lovari et al. 2009, Ale 2007). Between 1989 and 2010, there was a decrease of tahr by some 2/3, from ca 350 to <em>ca</em> 100 tahr, in the core area of Sagarmatha National Park because of increased predation following the return of the snow leopard (Lovari &amp; Mishra 2016). The recent data are lacking but numbers of predator and prey may have estabilised by now in Everest (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The most recent survey, in 2012, revealed a minimum of 394 tahr from Langtang in ca. 79.3 km² (density 5.3 tahr/km²: Thapa 2012). Green’s (1978) density estimates in Langtang National Park were similar in some localities (6.8 per sq. km) but in other localities they reached as high as s 25.0 per square kilometre.<br/><br/>Tahr has been reported from all of Nepal’s mountain protected areas but there have been no systematic surveys in these parks. No data on tahr are available from Gaurishankar Conservation Area, but in 2010 a short survey on the status of snow leopards also revealed the presence of tahr in Rolwaling valley in Gaurishankar. Their numbers, however, were dwindling (just 12 individuals observed, although with a decent kid-to-female ratio of 0.7: Ale <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent survey (Devkota <em>et al</em>. 2017) in an area of 124.2 km<sup>2</sup> in the upper reaches of Tsum valley, in Manaslu Conservation Area, revealed 223 tahr (nine herds, average group size of 25, range 2 to 74 individuals; a density of 1.8 animals per km<sup>2</sup>). Earlier in 2012, just two-day observations yielded at least 400 in the Tsum Valley and a similar number from the Budhi Gandhaki Valley in Manaslu (Sandro Lovari and Madhu Chettri, unpubl. data). The recent status of tahr in Annapurna Conservation Area is lacking but Gurung (1995) counted over 500 tahr in Annapurna Base Camp (density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>A total of 285 tahr were reported from Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve by Kandel <em>et al</em>. (2011). Tahr has been sighted in Shey Phoksundo, Khaptad, and Rara National Parks, in western Nepal. Even though there have been no formal surveys, each of these parks were reported to support at least 50 tahr, according to local experts (quoted in Gurung, 1995). Many districts that fall outside of protected areas, such as Dolpo, Jumla, Humla and Jajarkot, have been reported to contain sparse populations of tahr (Raju Acharya, Karan B. Shah, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest that considerable local extinctions of tahr have taken place in Nepal. Overall, conservative estimates of tahr population for entire Nepal may not exceed 10,000 (Som B. Ale, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The potential habitat of Himalayan Tahr, worldwide, between 2,200 m and 4,200 m elevation, is estimated at <em>c.</em> 44,200 km<sup>2</sup> with most areas being in Nepal (that is, 22,455 km<sup>2</sup>), followed by India (20,248 km<sup>2</sup>) and China (1,465 km<sup>2</sup>). Suitable tahr habitat occurs in Himachal Pradesh (8,903 km<sup>2</sup>), Uttarakhand (6,500 km<sup>2</sup>) and Sikkim (865 km<sup>2</sup>), and Jammu and Kashmir (3,979 km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>The current global population of Himalayan Tahr in its native range (that is, China, India and Nepal) is difficult to estimate due to the paucity of data, but it may not exceed the size of introduced populations in New Zealand, South Africa, United States of America, and Argentina (likely extinct). No attempts to census tahr populations have been made from the other countries except from New Zealand. The total abundance of tahr in New Zealand alone, from 2016 to 2018, was placed between 24,777 and 47,461, with average density ranging from 0.06 to 9.2 tahr/km<sup>2</sup>.</p>",Decreasing,"Himalayan Tahr is found in the Himalaya of China, India and Nepal spread over an estimated 44,200 km², however the actual area of occurrence may be much smaller given extirpation and currently unsuitable habitats in between. Outside the Himalayas, tahr was introduced to the South Island of New Zealand and Western Cape Province in South Africa (Grubb 2005). They were accidentally released in Cibola National Forest Mountain (New Mexico, USA) from a game ranch, and in Neuquén province and Parque Diana ranch of Argentina perhaps illegally by ranchers (Flueck 2010), and possibly now extinct from Neuquén (Guichon <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In China, Himalayan Tahr was discovered in 1974 in Quxiang of Buoqu Valley (aka Zhangmu Valley) in southern Tibet (Beijing Natural History Museum and Qinghai Institute of Biology 1977). Since then, there has been no additional information pertaining to its occurrence or status. A confirmed report of species presence came from Tibet’s Geelong-Buoqu Valleys (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986, Wang 1998, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Qomolangma Nature Reserve (pers. comm., Labaciren) where numbers of tahr have been sighted regularly in the Rongxia and Chentang valleys.<br/><br/>In India, Himalayan Tahr occurs along subalpine regions across southern forested slopes in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim (Sathyakmuar 2002). Populations are patchily distributed from south-central Kashmir through the southern part of Kullu (Himachal Pradesh) between c. 2,000 and 3,300 m (Gaston et al. 1981, 1983). They are widely present at similar elevations from northern Uttarakhand all the way to the border of Nepal. Small numbers of tahr also inhabit east Sikkim (nearby India-Nepal border) and west Sikkim (close to India-Bhutan border).<br/><br/>In Nepal, Himalayan Tahr formerly had a continuous distribution between 1,500 m and 5,200 m, but this has been increasingly disrupted by human activities such as livestock-grazing and subsistence hunting (Green 1978, 1979, Ale, S. B. unpubl. data). Overall, in Nepal, tahr inhabits temperate to sub-alpine forests and alpine meadows, mainly between <em>ca</em> 2,500 m and 4,000 m, but individuals at times venture up to 5,200 m. Schaller (1977) mapped fourteen locations of tahr in Nepal, but there are undoubtedly more.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, tahr is reported from the Jigme Khesar Strict Nature Reserve (Tshewang <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Bhutan Government’s Nature Conservation Division of the Department of Forest and Park Services has not confirmed its presence in the country (Sonam Wangdi, December 2019, pers. comm.).","<p>In New Zealand, there is occasional commercial harvesting of tahr for meat. There is a substantial recreational hunt of this species, and adult males (≥4.5 years old) are highly sought after as trophies by recreational and trophy hunters.</p>  In Nepal’s only in one hunting reserve, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Himalayan Tahr is harvested for trophy (blue sheep, <em>Pseudois nayaur</em>, were more sought after than Himalayan Tahr). The income thus generated has been used for conservation and local income generation activities (Karki and Thapa 2011). Two types of revenue have been generated through trophy hunting: the revenue collected by the Nepal’s government’s wildlife department, and money collected by local communities (although not substantiated on a legal basis, so monetary figures are not known: the charge to hunters may have varied from $533–1,333 for a Himalayan Tahr (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015). Locals used the money collected from tahr and blue sheep trophy-hunting for community development activities, for example, upgrading facilities of the local health post, constructing trails, and maintaining a bridge. Government revenue collected from 2007 to 2012 totalled $184,372, a portion of which went to conservation activities (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Terrestrial,"<p>Himalayan Tahr is not listed under threatened category of CITES. </p>  <p>It is listed as Category I species in China. Conservation measures proposed for China included undertaking surveys to determine the species’ distribution and status in Qomolangma Nature Reserve&#160;(Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Qomolangma&#160;Nature Reserve started the snow leopard program in 2015 funded by Vanke Foundation. The program undertook a large-scale wildlife survey and subsequent conservation projects that included educating local communities about tahr and other wildlife. </p>  <p>In India, protected areas with Himalayan Tahr include: Jammu and Kashmir – Kishtwar National Park (locally threatened); Himachal Pradesh - Great Himalayan National Park (confirmed), and Daranghati (locally threatened), Gamgul Siahbehi, Kanawar, Khokhan, Kugti, Manali (locally threatened or extinct), Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah (locally threatened) Wildlife Sanctuaries; Uttarakhand -Nanda Devi and (probably) Valley of Flowers National Parks, Govind Pashu Vihar and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuaries; and Sikkim - Khangchendzonga National Park (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981, 1983, Green 1987; Kathayat and Mathur 2002). Tahr uses rugged forested slopes with temperate oak and pine forests, well below the subalpine areas where it is often currently located. This suggests that its current range distribution may reflect displacement from formerly used lower elevation areas. Conservation measures proposed for India include: 1) extend the Great Himalayan National Park as proposed, 2) establish the proposed Srikhand National Park (Himachal Pradesh), 3) devise innovative community based reserves for the species outside protected areas (these need to include community based protection, tourism, awareness, etc.), and 4) include areas with tahr in the innovative, participatory, landscape level planning and action under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Project Snow Leopard. Overall, the country’s conservation strategy clearly states conserving species in and outside protected areas.</p>  <p>A significant proportion of Nepal’s tahr occurs within protected areas, but its population is widespread in areas outside of protected areas (e.g., the region that lies between Manaslu and Langtang, Bhimthang valley between Manalsu and Annapurna, and Dolpo, Jumla, Mugu and Humla districts). The species occurs in all mountain protected areas of Nepal: Langtang, Rara, Sagamartha (Everest), Makalu-Barun and Shey-Phoksundo National Parks; Api Nampa, Annapurna, Manalsu, Gaurishankar and Kanchanjunga Conservation Areas, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, and Khaptad National Park. </p>  <p>Conservation measures proposed for Nepal: 1) maintain the current, closely controlled, legal hunting program in Dhorpatan, 2) consider a regulated program of low-level subsistence hunting by local villagers, and 3) undertake surveys to understand the increasing fragmentation of tahr populations and offer mitigation measures. The first steps to address this issue would be to begin in selected areas by mapping tahr habitat features such as cliffs (using 1:50,000 topographic maps), followed by ground surveys to validate the species’ presence/absence.</p>  <p>Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is the only reserve in Nepal that allows trophy hunting of Himalayan Tahr along with blue sheep. From 2008 to 2011, Karki and Thapa (2011) reported 34 Himalayan Tahr were harvested: 18 in 2008/09 (100% harvest; quota set by the government), 11 (61% in 2009/10) and 5 (28 % in 2010/11). A quick glance on the numbers harvested indicates they were not so small numbers if adult males have been the only target. It would mean some 10-15 % of the adult male (trophy) population (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm). Perhaps the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation – Nepal should consider revaluating the trophy hunting of tahr on a sustainable basis.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
22155086,41023,Mazama bororo,Vulnerable,C2a(ii),2016,2015-10-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Mazama bororo</em> is confirmed to be Vulnerable. This is a range-restricted species and endemic of Brazil, it has an estimated number of 8,500 mature individuals in just one subpopulation considering two density levels along its extent of occurrence: 1.5/km² in the well-protected areas and 0.5/km² in the lower quality remnants around. A continuing decline in numbers of mature individuals and population structure are inferred due to several processes that will continue in the next years related to poaching, predation by domestic and feral dogs. The species is also highly threatened due to the habitat quality loss and forest conversion to agricultural lands (pines, eucalyptus, banana and heart of Palm). Other threats are the possible competition with other deer species as the Red Brocket (<em>M. americana</em>).","The species is endemic to the Tropical and Subtropical moist broadleaf forests of Atlantic Forest biome. It occupies all forest formations of the Serra do Mar coastal forests ecoregion (montane, submontane and lowland rain forests) and their ecotones with the Araucaria moist forest and the Paraná-Paraíba interior forests (Vogliotti and Duarte 2010). The regional relief varies from the sea level coastal plains to abrupt terrain and hills above 1,200 meters. The climate in the region is humid subtropical, with transition to the highland humid subtropical. <br/>Home range estimations were performed using two females radio tracked from Intervales State Park, population showing a variation from 25 to 64 hectares (Vogliotti and Duarte 2009). Streams of water seem to be an important displacement route for this species. <br/><em>Mazama bororo </em>showed crepuscular and nocturnal habits and seems to be more active during the summer/rainy season (Vogliotti and Duarte 2012). Fawns were recorded between September and February and some evidence of frugivory was also provided by camera traps (Vogliotti and Duarte 2010).","The main threats were compiled from national and regional lists of endangered Brazilian fauna (Duarte <em>et al.</em> 2012, Vogliotti and Braga 2009, Duarte and Vogliotti 2009) and they are: poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation related to changes in the land use,  habitat degradation caused by the illegal exploitation of heart of Palm, predation by domestic and feral dogs. Possible threat is: emerging infectious diseases from cattle.","Population data about this species are still scarce. The only available population-based study was conducted in Intervales State Park, where it was estimated a density of 1.5 individuals/km² (considered the optimal condition in well-protected areas). Lower densities (0.5 individuals/km²) were assigned to the remaining areas along its extension of occurrence due to the relative abundance of species evidences in different areas. These values generated an estimated total number of 8,500 mature individuals (Vogliotti and Duarte 2010, 2012). A continuing decline in numbers of mature individuals and population structure are inferred considering an estimated number of 8,500 mature individuals in just one subpopulation. Its range is restricted to the Atlantic Forest biome (between the parallels 23° and 26° South and the meridians 47° and 50° West) along the south of São Paulo, east of Paraná and extreme northeast of Santa Catarina States in Brazil (Duarte <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).",Decreasing,"The geographic range was initially based on the origins of captive animals used in the species description (Duarte 1992, 1996; Duarte and Jorge 2003). The first wild population was discovered at Intervales State Park between 2000 and 2002 (Vogliotti and Duarte 2009). Since then, it was described only nine sites of present occurrence (Vogliotti and Duarte 2012). <em>Mazama bororo</em> seems to be restricted to the Atlantic Forest biome, between the parallels 23° and 26° South and the meridians 47° and 50° West (Vogliotti and Duarte 2010). This range extends along the south of São Paulo State, east of Paraná and extreme northeast of Santa Catarina State (Vogliotti and Duarte 2012).",,Terrestrial,The main legal frame in Brazil for threaten species management and protection are: the National Official List of endangered fauna species (BRASIL 2014) and the Endangered Mammals of Paraná (PARANÁ 2010). The guidelines for its conservation are outlined in the National Action Plan for the Brazilian endangered deer (Duarte et al. 2012) and the Conservation Plan for the endangered mammals of Paraná State (PARANÁ 2009). The general Action Plan objective is the maintenance of the population and genetic viability of the species listed. Its specific objectives can be arranged in four main categories covering a number of specific actions for the conservation of Small Red Brocket Deer: 1) Public policies and legislation (8 specific actions); 2) Habitat protection (8 actions); 3) Basic and applied research (9 actions); 4) <em>In situ</em> conservation program (11 actions).

22157664,41784,Axis porcinus,Endangered,A2bcd,2015,2014-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"It is still believed that the most appropriate category for Hog Deer is Endangered A2bcd (past reduction of 50% or greater in three generations, taken here as about 21 years). A detailed assessment of the Red List status of Hog Deer in 2008 convincingly showed that the species had been undergoing a serious and overlooked global decline for decades. Those authors provided the following justification which, with few caveats, is considered to still hold true for the 2014 assessment: it is considered Endangered, through a combination of population trends across its range (see below). Reflecting the ever-increasing proportion of the total native population in well secured protected areas such as Kaziranga, despite an ongoing major reduction in occupancy and number of subpopulations, future declines in the total number of animals (A3 and A4) are unlikely to be at rates in the next three generations sufficient for Endangered. However, without concerted action, within the next decade or two Hog Deer is likely to warrant again listing as Endangered through a different criterion, B2ac (c through episodic flood-caused mass mortality), reflecting the loss of all subpopulations except a handful in protected areas with effective cohesive interventions against poaching and the wealth of other, habitat-related, threats facing Hog Deer. Currently the area of occupancy is far too high for listing as Endangered on this criterion, or even, probably, as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>During the mid and later decades of the twentieth century, the global population underwent rapid range-wide reductions, with the almost total loss of Hog Deer from Southeast Asia (when it was widespread and numerous in much of Cambodia, southern Viet Nam, lowland Thailand and probably plains Lao PDR) and massive declines in the Terai Arc Landscape subpopulations consequent upon the conquering of malaria and the influx of people to the area with wholesale habitat conversion and heavy hunting. Unquestionably at this time Hog Deer global population declines were at rates consistent with Endangered listing. By the mid 1980s (i.e., the start of the relevant period for a current A2 listing), subpopulations (at least those large enough to influence the overall global decline rate) had gone from Thailand and Bangladesh and, almost certainly, from Lao PDR, Viet Nam and China. It is likely that many Hog Deer remained in Cambodia, where subpopulations two to three decades ago may well have been in the thousands or even into the low tens of thousands, based on general perceptions of large-mammal abundance and relative wealth of suitable habitat (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), and Myanmar, where Hog Deer was regarded as a widespread and common species of no conservation concern in the mid 1980s (various people per J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In the interim, the Cambodian population has collapsed. Although there is a dearth of information on current status in Myanmar, there is no reason to assume that such a trend is not also in train there, although it may potentially be somewhat behind Cambodia. In sum, the rate of population decline in the last 21 years in the region comprising Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Thailand, China and Bangladesh has exceeded 90%, a continuation of such declines from the 1950s onwards.<br/><br/>Populations in India and Nepal - and perhaps Pakistan and Bhutan (no recent information traced) - have not declined at anything like such a rate in the last two decades. Declines in India are likely to have been more like 30–40% over the last 21 years, although this may be an underestimate (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008); even in high-profile protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve, Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve subpopulations are not secure. Declines have been at least 30% for Nepal (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>The trend in the population in Myanmar and its proportionate contribution to the overall global trend over the last three generations is the chief uncertainty. It was surely numerically large enough to have some influence on the global assessment of decline rate, given the abundance of prime habitat. Coupling the continued conversion of habitat to agriculture, the lack of protected areas specifically for the species (in contrast to those for Eld’s Deer), the uneven success of Eld’s Deer protected areas in conserving the species even with prioritised support and international collaboration, and the lack of awareness over the plight of grassland biodiversity in the country, as typified by current locations of protected areas, it is clear that whatever the surviving population of Hog Deer is in Myanmar, this is largely due to chance. In no other range state has chance resulted in the survival of large subpopulations: there has been almost regional extinction in the countries to the east of Myanmar, and a fast retraction to reasonably well-secured protected areas in the countries to the west. The current reality for Myanmar probably lies somewhere between these two, and, thus, subpopulations have probably declined by 40–60% or even more in the last three generations.<br/><br/>Combining these inferred regional decline rates, an overall global decline rate in the last 21 years of 50% is tenable. The Thai ‘wild-living’ subpopulation is re-introduced into artificially created habitats, and has not been used to influence the assessment; although it is within the species' native geographic range, it is possible that it is not the native subspecies. The Sri Lankan and Australian subpopulations, outside the native range, has not been used to influence the assessment (but seems to be declining anyway).<br/><br/>Hog Deer has not been listed as threatened prior to 2008. This was probably due in large part to a few large, high-density, South Asian subpopulations that give the appearance of ‘abundance’, but these are exceptional to its true status, of extinction across most of its former range and within much of its present range. This is not fully appreciated even at the present time, despite the analysis of Biswas and Mathur (2000) and subsequent work by Biswas across one of the two main range states (India).<br/><br/>In the six years since 2008, new subpopulations were found in Cambodia, but are probably not too small to have much influence on global population trends. However effective protection for any Cambodian subpopulations has failed to materialise, and declines in this short window have probably exceeded 90% driven by unprecedented economic development in Cambodia. The situation in Myanmar appears equally bleak, with similar current trends in exploitation of preferred habitats and weak protection measures, together with a lack of focus on the species (see also the 2014 assessment of Eld's Deer).<br/><br/>The situation in India and Nepal appears to be similar to that in 2008. A recent assessment on Northeast India, a major stronghold of the species found large local subpopulations still occur in Assam with sizeable numbers in northers West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2013). There is a small but secured subpopulation in Manipur and scattered animals in other states of the region. However in Assam sharp declines have been recorded outside the protected areas such as in Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts (Chodhury 2007).","Hog Deer is usually reported from habitat consisting of wet or moist tall grasslands, often associated with medium- to large-sized rivers (Bhowmik <em>et al</em>. 1999, Biswas and Mathur 2000, Biswas 2004), and appears to reach its highest densities in floodplain grasslands (Seidensticker 1976, Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Karanth and Nichols 2000, Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). It avoids closed-canopy forest, but will use coastal grasslands (e.g., Peacock 1933). Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) considered Hog Deer to be an obligate grassland species in the Terai Arc Landscape of India, and studies in India and Nepal have shown a preference for grasslands dominated by <em>Imperata cylindrica</em>&#160;(Biswas 2004 and references therein). Similar alluvial floodplain grassland seems to be used in Thailand and Indochina (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007, Clark undated, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). In Bardia National Park, measured densities were much higher in the floodplain association than in the riverine association, and no Hog Deer was found in adjacent Sal <em>Shorea robusta</em> forest at all (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). In the hilly areas of northeastern India, it occurs in small grassy areas, light woodland and abandoned <em>juhms</em>&#160;with grass (Choudhury 2013, A. Choudhury pers. comm 2014). The highest elevation where it has been recorder was 1,500 m asl in Nagaland (Choudhury 2013). These seem to be marginal habitats supporting only low-density subpopulations (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006): they may historically have been primarily ‘sink’ subpopulations. The remnant population in Bangladesh is located in grassy, lightly wooded, hill country (Khan 2004). In the southwestern coastal lowlands of Cambodia, where apparently the species was once common (Dumas 1944), the species appears to use an open habitat mosaic including brackish <em>Eleocharis</em>&#160;sedge marshes and&#160;‘upland’ tall <em>Imperata cylindrica</em>&#160;grasslands, and areas of scrubby open secondary woodland interspersed with&#160;‘dry’ short stature grasslands; cane-grass floodplain grasslands are essentially absent in this region (Timmins and Sechres 2010, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The reintroduced semi-wild subpopulations in Thailand occupy a variety of habitats for which there is no evidence of use by wild subpopulations in Thailand, Lao PDR, Viet Nam or Cambodia. One of the few detailed historical accounts of an abundant subpopulation in Southeast Asia was from extensive tall floodplain grasslands in the Dong Nai catchment, Viet Nam (Clark undated). Hog Deer is a primarily a grazer of young grasses, particularly <em>Imperata cylindrica</em> and <em>Saccharum</em> spp.; it also takes herbs, flowers, fruits and browse (young leaves and shoots of shrubs; Bhowmik <em>et al</em>. 1999, Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Bisawas 2004, Wegge <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is much more a grazer and less a browser than is the Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>. Animals occur in scrub and cinnamon gardens in Sri Lanka, where they cause considerable damage to home crops (McCarthy and Dissanayake 1992).<br/><br/>Where undisturbed, Hog Deer tend to be crepuscular, with significant day-time activity and some at night, especially in the hot and wet seasons (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991). In some areas it seems to have become more nocturnal and solitary (e.g., Cambodia; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), presumably through hunting pressure. The main social group is a female and fawn. When more Hog Deer are together, they do not form a strong ""unit"", fleeing when flushed in different directions rather than as one. In Chitwan, aggregations of up to 20 animals have been observed feeding on new shoots following fire (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991). In Kaziranga, aggregations of 40–80 animals are frequently seen on grazing grounds created by Great Indian Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em> and/or short grasslands near large water bodies (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008, based on observations in 1996). Home ranges vary widely in size, but average about five to 70 ha, depending on how the range is defined (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). In Chitwan, Hog Deer is essentially sedentary (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991), but in cultivated landscapes (Sri Lanka) movements are reported to be influenced by agricultural seasons (McCarthy and Dissanayake 1992). Hog Deer moves into higher-lying grasslands in response to monsoon flooding in India, Myanmar and presumably throughout their range (Peacock 1933, Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995). The rut is during September–October in Nepal and India and (presumably based on captives) during September–February in China. One to two fawns are born during April–May in Nepal and during April–October in China. Gestation period is 220–230 days (Dhungel and O’Gara 1991, Sheng and Ohtaishi 1993). Fawns wean at six months, reaching sexual maturity at eight to 12 months. The maximum recorded life span is 20 years.","Hog Deer is threatened by hunting and by habitat loss and degradation; much prime Hog Deer habitat had probably been converted well before the 20th century (e.g., Peacock 1933). The balance between these threats and their current severity varies somewhat between ‘South Asia’ (here comprising India, Nepal, presumably Bhutan and perhaps Pakistan) and ‘Southeast Asia’ (here comprising China, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and Bangladesh). In 2008 it was considered that there was insufficient information to judge for Myammar into which group it would fit however as of 2014 it is now clear that trends in habitats clearance, hunting pressure and conservation management in Myanmar are very similar to&#160;‘Southeast Asia’ especially Cambodia. Sri Lanka and Australia are considered outside the native range so not covered in detail here.<br/><br/>In the Mekong countries of Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam and also probably China and Bangladesh, hunting has been, and remains, the primary direct threat to the species. In addition to local consumption of meat, the main factor presently driving such hunting is the thriving and probably increasing national, regional and East Asian markets trade in bushmeat, abetted by markets for traditional medicinal products derived from deer species and for trophy antlers (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007). It is also possible that hunting could be stimulated by demand for captive animals, especially from zoos and menageries in Thailand and Cambodia (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), although as of 2014 this is almost certainly insignificant (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The species is apparently easy to hunt compared with other sympatric deer (e.g. Peacock 1933, Dumas 1944), and fawns are likely to be very vulnerable to dogs which almost always accompany human parties during excursions, however, brief, outside farm and residential land, even if these are not for hunting (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Hunting itself has been greatly augmented by habitat loss: the vast majority of tall floodplain grasslands have been lost in the region due to the suitability of such habitat for human settlement and agriculture, and only very small patches remain. This huge extent of habitat loss probably occurred largely after Hog Deer had been hunted down to negligible numbers (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The coastal lowland open habitat mosaic of southwestern Cambodia in contrast remained extensive and relatively little changed even in 2008, however development pressure in the area has increased enormously in the intervening years, with considerable developments of agricultural and agroforestry plantations (Timmins and Sechrest 2010, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Given these threats, which are ongoing, Hog Deer is one of the most threatened large mammals in Indochina (Timmins and Duckworth 2000, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). The most significant challenge to conserving the species there is the uncertainty involved with long term protected area-based conservation management. As of the end of 2014 there are still no specific conservation measures for the species in Cambodia; none of the known subpopulations occur substantially within a protected area and given hunting pressure and trends in habitat loss, these subpopulations are highly likely to be extirpated in the short to medium term (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/>Even in South Asia, where many protected areas are effective in conserving populations of large ungulates, Hog Deer declined precipitously in the 20th century through habitat loss and hunting. It is still in decline even within some protected areas (e.g. Bhowmik 2002; see below). In India, habitat loss to cultivation has greatly reduced the area available to Hog Deer, and has continued to do so outside protected areas even in recent decades (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) stated that high levels of malaria had previously discouraged settlement, agriculture, and thus habitat conversion in the Terai Arc Landscape, and that the conquering of malaria has made the Indian side of the Terai Arc Landscape ""one of the most densely populated regions of [India, with a] population growing at a much higher rate than the rest of [India]. Most of the fertile Terai plains have been taken over by agriculture"". Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) stated that controlling disturbance to Lagga Bagga forest block in Pilibhit Forest Division (now within a tiger reserve; B. Long pers. comm. 2008) is a huge challenge: many people rely on it for firewood, thatch grass and fodder, and that intensive protection and participatory management with these people are required to restore the area. Such a threat profile is typical of areas supporting Hog Deer. Outside protected areas, some Hog Deer remain in woodland areas where densities are very low, and although animals do appear to breed in such situations, it is unclear in the absence of adjacent high-density river plains populations how viable such woodland populations will be in the long term (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006). Protected areas are encroached for cultivation and even more so for livestock grazing, which is surely increasing pressure on Hog Deer along with many other species. As a grazing species, Hog Deer numbers are likely to be severely depressed by competition with domestic livestock (by analogy with other wild ruminants, as detailed by Madhusudan 2004), although no data were traced on this. Domestic stock are ubiquitous in all areas outside the protected area network and even occur in many within it, specifically at least: Chitwan; Orang; Jaldapara; and Gorumara (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, R.H. Emslie pers. comm., B.N. Talukdar pers. comm., S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Most subpopulations in India are under severe threat from hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), although the largest subpopulation of the species, in Kaziranga, has been secured from this threat for many years. Poaching occurs in protected areas throughout the Indian range, especially in north Bengal, and can be associated with other human uses of protected areas perceived to be more legitimate, such as grazing camps (Biswas 2004). Many old skulls of Hog Deer were found across Arunachal Pradesh and Assam during the survey of Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002). On average two to three skulls were recorded from most houses in villages randomly visited during the survey in Arunachal Pradesh. Regularly, shots were heard and machans (tree-houses made for poaching) were found during the surveys in Nameri National Park, Sonai-Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary and Namdapha Tiger Reserve. According to questionnaire, 52% of responses reported high incidence of Hog Deer hunting in neighbouring areas. Hunting was reported as the primary reason for the sudden decline of the Hog Deer population from north Bengal since 1877. Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002) detailed evidence of Hog Deer hunting during the survey and past records from the district of Cooch Behar (West Bengal) back to the 18th century. Even today, in high-profile areas such a Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji National Park, there are still instances of deer poaching, and poaching has seriously depleted abundance of large mammals in most of the Terai Arc Landscape. Some poaching is driven by a desire to seek adventure, the thrill of shikar and wild meat, some by crushing poverty of daily wage labourers and others, some to take advantage of the business opportunity of supplying a lucrative trade. Poaching is done with dogs, snares, spears and guns (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Outside protected areas in India, enforcement of anti-hunting regulations is patchy and, unless there is effective specific intervention, all Hog Deer subpopulations in such areas will become extirpated in the near future from hunting (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer avidly eats rice and so in the past was “destroyed ruthlessly on such grounds” (Peacock 1933). It seems unlikely that killing Hog Deer solely for reduction of crop damage is nowadays a reason for population decline, although it may be a convenient excuse to kill deer. Most serious is that the predilection of Hog Deer to eat rice is likely to bring them into closer contact with people and therefore to increase easy opportunities for hunting. In Kratie, Cambodia, Hog Deer occur near, and seasonally forage in, rice fields, especially in the early rainy season. People set traps for wild pigs <em>Sus</em> species, which are more abundant than Hog Deer, and the traps sometimes kill Hog Deer. The local people now are reportedly refraining from using indiscriminate traps in the Hog Deer area, but such cooperation is unlikely to continue forever, because crop predation by pigs is really a problem (A. Maxwell pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In today’s highly fragmented subpopulations which have limited dispersal possibility, flooding may take heavy tolls, especially in the Brahmaputra flood plain (Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995). In Kaziranga National Park, where the largest subpopulation of this species is found, flooding is likely to be a major threat: in 1998 the flood reduced the subpopulation to less than half its pre-flood number (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006). High floods both lead to drowning as animals are washed away also falling victim to road kill (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014). The situation is similar in Nepal where Hog Deer appears to be especially vulnerable because of the short-grass habitats it usually uses during flood season, and in protected area like Koshi Tappu, flooding probably causes wide fluctuations in population numbers (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer subpopulations appear to rebound quickly even from heavy losses, but the fragmentation and increasing isolation of subpopulations into small areas, sometimes with no linkage to suitable higher ground, makes periodic losses from flooding a high risk for future site-level extinctions. Flooding is also a danger because, except in areas of effective anti-poaching activity, by marooning Hog Deer on little patches of high ground it makes them more easy to hunt (Peacock 1933).<br/><br/>A further threat also reflects the colossal habitat fragmentation in recent centuries. Prime Hog Deer habitats are naturally dynamic, and on a living floodplain new areas of grasslands are constantly created through natural processes to replace those changing through natural succession to woody vegetation; creation occurs through traumatic change of floodplain stream and land layout during spates (Dinerstein 1979, Lehmkuhl 1994, Peet <em>et al</em>. 1999). This is incompatible with farming and other human land-uses, which seek a predictable landscape. Hence, within Hog Deer range, there are very few active natural floodplains in which pre-exploitation processes shape the landscape in this way. Thus, the grasslands which are the prime habitat of Hog Deer generally require active management. In some protected areas grasslands are being lost by succession of wooded habitats, for example Chitwan (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006) and Bardia (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). By contrast, annual burning in Kaziranga, while maintaining a grass habitat, has rapidly changed the grassland structure and composition and how this change affects Hog Deer subpopulations is not known (S. Deb Roy pers. comm. 1996). In Nepal there is also succession of different grassland types and in particular <em>Imperata cylindrica</em> grasslands, which Hog Deer appears to favour at certain times of the year (Biswas 2004), are being replaced by larger cane grasses (H. S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Locally, conservation management of grasslands to benefit rhinoceroses, for instance in Jaldapara, might negatively affect Hog Deer (Biswas 2004 and references within).<br/><br/>The invasive creeper <em>Mikania</em> sp. threatens Hog Deer’s favoured grasslands both within and outside protected areas, and after flooding and poaching is possibly the next most serious threat to the species in Nepal (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). In combination with invasion by <em>Chromolaena odorata</em> (=<em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>), heavy livestock grazing pressure and invasion of some grasslands by <em>Acacia catechu</em> and <em>Dalbergia sissou</em>, the grassland area in Chitwan has been reduced from 20% to 4.7% of the national park (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.). <em>Mikania</em> sp. are also carpeting large areas of non-forest habitats in the Hukaung Valley, Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). <em>Lantana camara</em> is also displacing native plants widely, and in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, the creeper <em>Tiliacora acuminata</em> is proliferating across Hog Deer habitat (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). In Assam an invasive <em>Mimosa</em> sp. threatens the habitat in sites like Kaziranga and Orang National Parks, whereas in Manas National Park an invasive <em>Lea</em> sp. has become a major threat to the grassland habitat of the hog deer (B. Talukdar pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>Floodplain grasslands are strongly affected in their pace of natural succession by water flows and levels, and seasonal patterns in them. Hydropower development changes these parameters and thus threatens habitat, including a project under consideration across the Mekong which would affect the sole known subpopulation of <em>A. p. annamiticus</em> (that in Cambodia), and another across the Karnali river which would modify habitats in Bardia, Nepal (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). There have been proposals to dam the Brahmaputra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen, this could very negatively affect the habitat quality and Hog Deer carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods, as well as changes in water levels and flows). In Jaldapara Sanctuary, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in the sanctuary is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools are slowly drying up (S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Disease epidemics spreading from domestic livestock presumably pose a threat, especially given the close overlap of Hog Deer and domestic livestock in South Asia, the high densities especially of the latter, and the small and localised nature of Hog Deer subpopulations.<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka the continued survival of the introduced subpopulations depends on controlling hunting and maintaining traditional agricultural land use practices. The land is too intensively cultivated for the establishment of protected areas within the range of the species. Threats in the rest of the introduced range are not reviewed here.","<em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pakistan</em><br/>Hog Deer is confined to isolated riverine grasslands along the Indus valley and its upper tributaries, mostly in the Indus River forest reserves of Sind Province, with small subpopulations around the Indus mouth and to the north of Sukkur (Roberts 1977). The species was listed for the protected areas of Chashma Lake Wildlife Sanctuary, Head Islam/Chak Kotora Game Reserve (greatly reduced in number), Lal Suhanra National Park (reintroduced), Taunsa Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary, and possibly Rasool Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary (WCMC 1992), but no information more recent than Whale (1996) has been traced.<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</em><br/>Hog Deer is found mainly in the Terai grasslands along the Himalayan foothills and the flood-plains of the Rivers Ganges and Brahmaputra, from Punjab in the west to Arunachal Pradesh in the east (Tandon 1989, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, Biswas 2004). Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004), who made extensive surveys of the Terai Arc Landscape of India (for Tiger,&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Panthera tigris,</span>&#160;and various prey species), considered that Dudhwa Tiger Reserve is excellent habitat for Hog Deer; that there was a reasonable subpopulation in Pilhibit Forest Division, particularly the Lagga Bagga forest block (now within a Tiger reserve; B. Long pers. comm. 2008); that Kishanpur Wildife Sanctuary (203 km<sup>2</sup>), with one of the few remnants of Terai habitat in India, supported considerable numbers, and that Katarniaghat Wildife Division also held Hog Deer. Assessments conducted specifically for Hog Deer by Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002; see also Biswas 2004) for India surmised that populations remained in 29–34 areas, with significant numbers only in the following: Arunachal Pradesh: 100–200 in D’ering, and 20–50 in Namdapha; Assam: 20–50 in Dibrusaikhowa, over 1,000 in Kaziranga (but see below), over 1,000 in Manas, 20–50 in Nameiri, 200–500 in Orang, 20–50 in Kobuchapori, 20–50 in Burachapori, and 20–50 in Sunai Rupa; Bihar: 100–200 in Valmiki; Uttrakand (= Uttaranchal): 200–500 in Corbett Tiger Reserve (but see below); Uttar Pradesh: 1,000–2,000 in Dudhwa, 20–50 in Katarniaghat, 100–200 in Kishanpur, and 20–50 in North Kheri Forest Division; and West Bengal: 100–200 in Gorumara and a population at Jaldapara. Their estimate for Pilhibit Forest Division was zero, <em>contra</em> Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004). Biswas’s study also considered that Hog Deer had been lost from 35 historically known localities, and suggested it was ‘endangered’, with citations given for alarming decline even prior to the mid 1970s (Biswas 2004). The figures were not derived from rigorous sampling and some will surely need revision. Particularly, it is certain that there are over 10,000 Hog Deer in Kaziranga, with a best estimate of 14,000–16,000, at ecological densities of 38.6 (with SE 3.45) animals per km<sup>2</sup> (Karanth and Nicholls 2000, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008); and in Corbett Tiger Reserve, only about 100 were reported in 2008 by Bivash Pandav (pers. comm. 2008) and while the actual number is unclear, densities are now very low, even in prime habitat (K.M. Chinnappa and Praveen per N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008), and a rapid decline is in place (A. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Dudhwa Tiger Reserve also faces a suite of conservation problems meaning that population status of Hog Deer there is unlikely to be as healthy as in Kaziranga: poaching is rampant, and the creeper <em>Tiliacora acuminata</em>&#160;is proliferating across Hog Deer habitat (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). At Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, where Biswas (1999) studied ecology of Hog Deer in the 1990s, sightings, and presumably populations, have now drastically declined (A.J.T. Johnsingh pers. comm. 2008). Hog Deer is now primarily restricted to protected areas (A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006), but south of Rajaji National Park there are a few isolated groups along the river (perhaps totalling about 100 animals); these are outside protected areas (B. Pandav pers. comm. 2008). All such subpopulations outside protected areas are in very rapid decline (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). The presence of this species in Manipur and southern Assam (close to Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura) is based on records in Biswas <em>et al</em>. (2002); its current status there is unknown. All groups in these areas were estimated to be very small, and should not be assumed to persist. The more recent assessment by Choudhury (2013) indicated the following numbers in some key northeastern Indian reserves: Kaziranga (c. 10,000; marginal decline owing to high floods), Manas (c. 1,500; marginal increase since near extirpation in the 1989-1992 period), RG Orang (c. 500; all in Assam); Jaldapara (250+; marginal increase in recent years owing to improved protection, in Arunachal Pradesh); and Keibul Lamjao (c. 100) (in Manipur).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bangladesh</em><br/>Hog Deer has disappeared from the Sundarbans (Salter 1984) and has not been reported from the Sylhet District, in the northeast, since the 1970s (Khan 2004). After a long period with no records, an animal was trapped by local people in 2002 (Khan 2004). Further surveys suggested that a few Hog Deer remained in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of the southeast (Khan 2004, Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008). Camera trapping and observational surveys during 2010-2011 in Chittagong Hill Tracts did not detect Hog Deer, however the surveys did not cover the low hills and degraded forest areas in which the species would most likely be expected to occur (S. Chakma per.comm. 2014). There is a small captive population derived from native animals (Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008). Within historic times, Hog Deer was never widespread in the country and pressure was on it from at least the 1970s (Md Anwarul Islam pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nepal</em><br/>Hog Deer is locally abundant in the Terai, but is now restricted largely, if not entirely, to protected areas (P. Yonzon pers. comm. 2006, H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Although subpopulations may currently be relatively stable, declines in the past 20–30 years are likely to have exceeded 30% (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2008). Measured densities range from 0.1 per km<sup>2</sup> in riverine forest, to 16.5 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in savanna, and 35 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in grassland flood-plains (Seidensticker 1976, Dhungel and O’Gara 1991). In Bardia National Park, densities of 77.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the floodplain association and 5.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the riverine association (and zero in Sal forest) were measured (Odden <em>et al</em>. 2005). The species occurs in the following protected areas: Parsa Wildlife Reserve (with a very small subpopulation), Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Bardia National Park, Chitwan National Park, and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve (Hem Sagar Baral pers. comm. 2008). Each of Suklaphanta, Bardia and Chitwan supports hundreds of Hog Deer. As of 2014, there has been no significant change in the population since 2008 (H.S. Baral pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bhutan</em><br/>The small Bhutan subpopulation is found mostly along the southern foothills and small plains along the rivers. Animals have been observed in three protected areas along its border with Assam India, these are Phipsoo, Royal Manas and Khaling. The number of individuals in Royal Manas National Park could be greater than 150, with the grassland around the Gabhorukunda river as the main stronghold (A. Choudhury, pers. comm 2014). It has also been recorder from Mochu Wildlife Reserve.<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</em><br/>Hog Deer historically was recorded in southwest parts of Gengma and Cangyuan counties of Western Yunnan bordering Myanmar, and has recently been stated to be extinct in the country (Ohtaishi and Gao 1990, Smith and Xie Yan 2008).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Myanmar</em><br/>Hog Deer has long been known in Myanmar (e.g., Evans 1902) and occurred throughout the country wherever there were grassy plains (Peacock 1933). For the 2008 assessment detailed information on Hog Deer's current range or population status in Myanmar has not been traced. It was already in major decline by the time Peacock (1933) wrote. It was listed only for three protected areas by WCMC (1992): Pidaung, Kahilu, and Hlawga Wildlife Reserves. Of these, the Hlawga subpopulation of many dozen (in 2007) is a semi-captive, managed herd: the entire area, of several square kilometres, is fenced; however, it may be ‘native’ in that the founders were reputedly from animals captured locally during the 1980s (Saw Htoo Tha Po verbally 2007 to J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008)., but these have been added to over the years (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). As of 2014, there were still small numbers at Hlawga, but they appeared to be decreasing because of new management at the park and possibly hunting (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). The Pidaung Wildlife Sanctuary was set aside in 1918 to protect an unusual mix of evergreen forest and savanna-like ecosystems (Milton <em>et al</em>. 1964), and Hog Deer used to be very numerous within it (Peacock 1933); at this time it was the only site in the country where Hog Deer received a measure of protection. Today, the presence of permanent human settlements, roads and railway lines, plantations of sugar cane, military camps and permanent cultivation have completely altered large portions of the sanctuary, and an insignificant area of the original ecosystem remains (Rao <em>et al</em>. 2002). These land-uses are concentrated in the plains parts of the sanctuary, where Hog Deer used to live, and have converted so absolutely these areas that it is not obvious to someone driving along the road when the protected area is entered or exited (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visits in 2005-2006). People and dogs are ubiquitous and it seems implausible that any Hog Deer could survive here (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008, based on visits in 2005–2006). However park staff believe that a few animals still persist there (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). In 2010 and 2011 Hog Deer was confirmed by camera-trapping from Hukaung Valley in Kachin state (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014), following on from reports from hunters' and conservation staff between 2005-2007 (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). At the turn of the century suitable habitat was very extensive in the Hukaung Valley, but as of 2014 review of remote imagery suggests that there has been massive loss of riparian grasslands to make way for agriculture and other anthropogenic land uses (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Hog deer are still present in a fairly large area of floodplain grasslands including areas along the Tanai (Upper Chindwin), Tawan and Mogaung streams. Much of the grasslands where hog deer area known are outside of the Wildlife Sanctuary but as awareness of the species is increasing, it appears they occur further inside the Wildlife Sanctuary than previously thought (R. Tizard pers. comm. 2014). An FFI survey team recorded Hog Deer in the grasslands between the boundary of Indawgyi WS and the forest in 2012 (T. Zaw pers. comm. 2014). Several government staff indicated in 2005-2007 that the species is still locally common in lowland Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). Pidaung was seen as a flagship protected area (it was one of the country’s first), and its current status does not augur well for the few other protected areas which contain suitable Hog Deer habitat. Extensive camera-trapping for a Tiger survey found no evidence of the species (Lynam 2003), but this may simply have reflected the focus of the survey on closed evergreen forests (habitats unsuitable for Hog Deer), as various other species known to be common but not using closed evergreen forest were also camera-trapped rarely if at all (T. Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Thailand</em><br/>The species was formerly abundant in the Chao Phraya Basin during the early 20th century, but had become extinct there by the mid-1960s (Humphrey and Bain 1990). There was formerly a huge export trade, for example 20,000 skins went out of the Gulf of Siam (it is not stated whether this was from Thailand, Cambodia, or both) in 1930–1931 (Dumas 1944). There was a plea for conservation attention to the species in Thailand in Lekagul and McNeely (1977), but this seems to have come too late. Animals reportedly from Thailand and possibly Myanmar have been used to build up numerous managed herds in captive and semi-wild conditions across the country, although the origins of the managed herds remain uncertain. Such animals were introduced into Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary and Propagation Station in northern Thailand in the early 1990s, at a higher elevation than is typical for the natural range of the species; this herd lives in open grassland around the edge of a reservoir (A. Pattanavibool pers. comm. 2006, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006). There is also an apparently large introduced subpopulation on the island of Ko Chang in the Gulf of Siam.<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Lao PDR</em><br/>Hog Deer is probably extinct in Lao PDR and its past status is difficult to assess: there are few, if any, specimens held in international collections from the country, and there were no records (except of old trophies) during extensive surveys across the country in the 1990s (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). However, Osgood (1932) specifically cautioned that it was much under-represented in zoological collections, despite it being locally common in Indochina. The extent to which this statement includes Lao PDR is unknown. All potentially suitable habitat patches are now small in size and are heavily used by local people, hunting pressure in Lao PDR is high, and it is inconceivable in the great majority of areas that any Hog Deer could still persist (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008, 2014). <br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Viet Nam</em><br/>Hog Deer is thought to be extinct in Viet Nam, having previously occurred in some large subpopulations in suitable habitat (e.g. Clark undated) and apparently having been widespread in the south according to reports in Ratajszczak (1991). This reflects the rapidity with which suitable habitat has been lost and the heavy hunting pressure on large mammals throughout much of Viet Nam (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Timmins and Duckworth 2000). If the species still occurs in Viet Nam, it is most likely to be along the Kon river in Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve, the western Srepok river lowlands of Dak Lak Province, the Sa Tay area of Kon Tum and Gia Lai Provinces, the Dong Nai river lowlands and Lam Dong Province (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). However, there is no recent evidence other than unconfirmed reports, and a trophy which may be of Hog Deer from the Kon Cha Rang NR area. Other evidence, notably high hunting rates of ungulates in general, suggest that even very small numbers are unlikely to survive (Dang Huy Huynh 1986, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006, 2014).<br/><br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cambodia</em><br/>Hog Deer used to be abundant on the vast marshy plains of Cambodia, such as around Sre Ambel, in the province of Kratie, around Kompong Som, and around Kampot; in the drier regions of much of the north it was not common (Dumas 1944). Increased wildlife surveys from 1994 onwards failed to find Hog Deer anywhere in Cambodia until it was re-found in Kratie in 2006, following concerns it might already be extinct (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007). A few animals, probably in the low dozens, remain scattered in small groups in remnant areas of floodplain grasslands and other vegetation in Kratie Province (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008.). In 2008 the species was detected in grasslands and remained widespread (Timmins and Sechrest 2010). Potential habitat in the southwest was much greater in extent than in the Kratie floodplains suggesting that a much larger subpopulation of deer remained there at least at the turn of the century (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014) and the species was recorded from three additional sites in 2013 during focused surveys for the species (Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Since 2008 however there has been no effective protection of any of the known subpopulations or of other areas of habitat with good potential for persistence; and coastal areas have in the intervening six years seen high rates of conversion especially to plantation agriculture and forestry (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). All remaining subpopulations are likely to be small, possibly isolated from each other, and subject to hunting (Brook <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><em style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></em><em style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sri Lanka</em> (probably introduced)<br/>Hog Deer is restricted to largely cultivated landscapes within a 35 km<sup>2</sup> area, between Ambalangoda and Indurawa on the southwest coast, and inland as far as Elpitiya (McCarthy and Dissanayake 1992, 1994). It does not occur in any protected area. Hog Deer is thought to have been introduced to Sri Lanka by the Dutch or the Portuguese in the 16th century, or possibly by a Sinhalese ruler in the pre-colonial period or the British later on; suggestions that it is native are doubted because of the absence of records across central and southern India (Biswas and Mathur 2000). Vishvanath <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014) recommend genetic studies to further clarify the status of Sri Lanka's Hog Deer subpopulation.<br/><br/><strong><em>Australia</em>&#160;</strong>(introduced)<br/>All extant subpopulations of Hog Deer are on the South Coast of Victoria. There are two managed subpopulations at reserves on Sunday Island and at Blond Bay. Additionally, there are scattered groups on private land between Wilson's Promontory and Orbost. These subpopulations derive from releases made in 1865 (Scroggie <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).",Decreasing,"Hog Deer historically occurred from Pakistan, throughout northern and northeastern India, including the Himalayan foothill zone, east across non-Sundaic Southeast Asia and, marginally, southern China (southern Yunnan province), but it is now reduced to isolated subpopulations within this range. It is almost extirpated from east of Myanmar. It is extinct in Thailand (where it has, however, been reintroduced) and almost certainly in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (Humphrey and Bain 1990, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Very small numbers have been found recently in Bangladesh and in five areas in Cambodia (Khan 2004, Maxwell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007, Timmings and Sechrest 2010, Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). A report on the internet in 2007 from China turned out to refer to a young Sambar (B.P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2012).  Hog Deer still probably occurs in at least several areas of Myanmar (J.W. Duckworth <em>in litt</em>. 2008, from various sources), and localised subpopulations survive in northern and northeastern India, Nepal, Bhutan (few recent data) and Pakistan (status uncertain; Biswas and Mathur 2000, Biswas 2004). Hog Deer has been introduced (not mapped) into Australia (specifically the coastal regions of south and east Gippsland; Moore and Mayze 1990), the United States (Texas, Florida and Hawaii; Grubb 2005) and it is presumed introduced into Sri Lanka; however there remains some discussion as to whether the species is native or introduced into Sri Lanka (Vishvanath <em>et al</em>. 2014) so the species is retained here as non-native until definitive information is received.","Hog Deer is hunted in various parts of its range. It is hunted for its meat (bushmeat trade), traditional  medicinal products and for trophy antlers. It is also  possible that hunting could be stimulated by demand for captive  animals.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Hog Deer is fully protected in Bangladesh, India, and probably most or all other range states. One subspecies is listed on CITES Appendix I as<em> Axis porcinus annamiticus</em><em></em>.<br/><br/>Wetlands, especially floodplain grasslands, have traditionally been ignored by the protected area systems and other conservation initiatives of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2006). Most of the area supporting the single known subpopulation in Cambodia has been proposed for protected area status, but the situation is complicated by the inclusion of agricultural lands and traditional use areas of local people, and the high human population immediately nearby (Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bezuijen <em>et al</em>. 2008); as of 2014 no protected status has been granted to this area (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). As soon as the subpopulation was found, a small conservation programme with external funding from WWF was started to support a small number of forestry rangers and local guardians to carry out patrolling and community outreach activities, in addition to basic research. These measures ceased due to a combination of factors including lack of funding and motivation in part brought on by the failure to establish the site as as protected area in c. 2008 (R.J. Timmins pers. comm 2014), but may be re-established by WWF with the Forestry Administration (Brook <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Probably the bulk of the southwest Cambodian subpopulation lies outside of protected areas, although there was marginal inclusion within one protected area Botum Sakor National Park and the proposed Southwest Elephant Corridor, with confirmed occurrence near to the Dong Peng Multiple Use Area. However, in all of these areas deer are in peripheral areas, while conservation attention, is focused on extensive forest at their heart (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In 2013 a national action plan was developed for the conservation of Hog Deer in Indochina. The plan recommends securing the Kratie subpopulation and one of the Southwest subpopulations (Andoung Teuk) thourgh establishing anti-poaching patrols, engaging local communities in the conservation oh Hog Deer, stabilizing land-use and formalizing protection for the sites. It also recommends the establishment of a conservation breeding programme for the species from ideally to other known small and isolated subpopulations in the Southwest (Forestry Administration, 2014). The plan has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. To ensure protection and survival of animals, consideration should be given as to whether it would be useful for part of the areas to be strategically fenced to help deter poaching, agricultural encroachment and predation by dogs; but this would need to consider seasonal movements.<br/><br/>There are few areas in Viet Nam where suitable habitat is thought to remain, but if reasonable extents of alluvial grassland survive in the following areas surveys for Hog Deer may be warranted: Cat Tien National Park, the Kon river in the Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve area, and the Sa Tay area of Kon Tum and Gia Lai Provinces; although given the high hunting pressure in Viet Nam it is becoming very unlikely that any animals could still survive (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Cat Tien National Park retains significant areas of alluvial grasslands, and could potentially in the future become a site for reintroduction, however park management appears to be to some extent ignorant of the importance of these grasslands with ongoing schemes to re-establish forest and a fire management policy that is probably leading to woody encroachment of grasslands (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014, based on a visit in December 2013).<br/><br/>It is not certain what conservation measures are in place (if any) for the rediscovered subpopulation in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>There has been no comprehensive assessment of Hog Deer in Myanmar, but it probably exists mostly in unprotected plains grassland areas which, as in the Mekong countries, are conventionally seen as of low conservation value (Peacock 1933, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). In 2010 an 11,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;extension of the Hukaung valley was established. Hog Deer were camera-trapped in three localities in the grasslands along the Tawang River; one in the core area and the other two on the edge of the core area and the extension. In the last two years (since 2012) this area has seen the development of human settlements and agricultural expansion (Than Zaw pers. comm.) resulting in considerable loss of grassland habitat (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). A clarification of the status of Hog Deer in Myanmar is urgent: there may yet remain areas supporting animals which have high conservation potential if they do not disappear before being known to conservation. This lack of conservation profile is the chief challenge to Hog Deer in Myanmar at the moment, as it was in Peacock’s (1933) day: “the butchery of these little deer and the failure to provide more than one small sanctuary for their preservation is certainly one of the weak spots in Myanmar game legislation...the existing legislation is singularly ineffective in preventing their wholesale destruction. Moreover, there are few forest reserves which are suitable for the Hog Deer, and the legislation concerned with such forests is little more than a gesture”. If not met head-on, there are no grounds to assume that Hog Deer national conservation status will not replicate that shown by all range states to the east (major population collapse), if indeed it has not already done so.<br/><br/>Most Hog Deer subpopulations remaining in India, Nepal and Bhutan are in protected areas where animals are at least somewhat, and in some cases well, protected from poaching (Biswas <em>et al</em>. 2002, Biswas 2004, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pralad Yonzon pers. comm. 2006, H. S. Baral pers. comm. 2008, A. Choudhury pers. comm. 2006, N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Wildlife protection laws in India have also helped in retaining the specialized habitat of Hog Deer, arresting habitat loss and habitat conversion in some protected areas. Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. (2004) found a strong correlation with Hog Deer subpopulations and protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape of India (similar to that for Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em>), in contrast to other deer which occur relatively widely outside protected areas. Some protected areas are not big enough to allow adequate ranging during heavy flood periods, and thus prevent heavy mortality during such periods, and all suffer from being too small to be allowed unfettered habitat succession, because new grasslands are not now being created by natural processes elsewhere (see Habitat and ecology). In India and Nepal, Hog Deer has benefited from conservation measures taken for Great Indian Rhinoceros and Barasingha in the same wet grassland habitats (Q. Qureshi pers. comm. 1995, Biswas 2004). However, grassland management for rhinoceros may in some cases be deleterious to Hog Deer (Biswas 2004).<br/><br/>In South Asia there is an urgent need to update the status review of Biswas and Mathur (2000), even though some large Hog Deer subpopulations inhabit some of the best-secured protected areas in the world. Even assuming that these protected areas continue to receive sufficient material and political support, such a review is necessary because all subpopulations face uncertain futures from a multitude of factors, some of which originate outside protected areas and beyond the zone of influence of protected area managers. The review needs to determine roughly the numbers remaining and the locations of all sizeable or potentially sizeable subpopulations, and especially for each make assessments of current and likely future conservation status and population trends, bearing in mind threats from poaching, agricultural encroachment, livestock grazing, natural habitat succession, perverse habitat management, invasive plant species, the risk of disease epidemics from domestic livestock, changes to water levels and flows (e.g. from upstream dams), further fragmentation of subpopulations and habitats, episodic mortality through flooding and abiotic risks such as insurgency (which can collapse protected area management, although it does not always do so). Confinement of subpopulations to small habitat patches isolated from other such patches raises the intrinsic threat of subpopulation loss significantly when considering the wide gamut of threats facing such subpopulations (Biswas and Singh 2002, Biswas 2004), and in some sites challenges may be so pervasive that long-term retention of Hog Deer subpopulations may be so difficult as to be an inefficient use of resources. An integrated South Asia-wide conservation plan may be the best route to direct resources to a representative set of areas where long-term persistence of large Hog Deer subpopulations can be assured provided sufficient resources are mobilised and deployed in the appropriate way. <br/><br/>By contrast, in Southeast Asia, any subpopulation found east of central Thailand (i.e. within the historical range of <em>A. p. annamiticus</em>, the western limit of which is not clear) warrants immediate attention. It is plausible that the recently found small and fragile subpopulation in Cambodia is the last stock of this taxon. The isolated small subpopulations in Bangladesh, although presumably of the nominate race, warrant priority protection in maintaining the ancestral geographic and habitat range of Hog Deer.  Species-specific intervention in Myanmar should probably, given the great challenges in the country (and, specifically, the uneven success to date with Eld’s Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em> conservation), be fitted within larger initiatives such as conservation of the Hukaung Valley, probably the largest floodplain in tropical Asia retaining largely natural ecological processes of stream geography and habitat dynamics.<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, where the species is restricted to privately-owned gardens, its survival depends on the goodwill of the landowners. The conservation value of this introduced subpopulation needs re-evaluation, considering approximate size, recent trend, ecological integrity and any genetic uniqueness, balanced against the likely cost of conservation interventions to secure the subpopulation’s future. Needs of other introduced subpopulations are not considered here.<br/><br/>There is a large total of animals in zoos of tropical Asia. Although at least one Mekong animal appeared in a zoo recently (in Cambodia in the mid 1990s, C.M. Poole pers. comm. 1998), so far as is known, all captive herds are derived from subpopulations from Thailand and Myanmar and further west. Reintroduction of animals in the range of the nominate, should it be needed, thus has many options. There is no captive buffer for <em>A. p. annamiticus</em>.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Habitat destruction has occurred for decades in the range of the  Peruvian Dwarf Deer. Its distribution range has declined in Bolivia and  Peru (at least 40% of the expected range in Bolivia somehow degraded due  to colonization, deforestation, and burning for agriculture and cattle  grazing (see the Threats section)). Threats to this species have not ceased and are  not reversible. In addition small geographic range (area of occupancy &lt;2,000 km²), severely fragmented populations and continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat are severely reducing populations.","Records from Bolivia include ‘ceja de selva’ elfin forest and grasslands (3,600 m), cloud montane forest ‘Yungas’ forests, and sub Andean forests (1,400 m), although local reports may extend that from 4,000 to 1,000 m (Rumiz <em>et al.</em> 2007). Records from Peru include the same vegetation types as in Bolivia, but without records in grasslands or over 3,500 m (Barrio in prep). Details on its ecology are unknown, although it seems to be solitary, active at day as well at night, and expected to be a browser frugivore in the forest understorey. <em>Oxalis</em> sp. has been identified among plant species eaten by <em>Mazama chunyi</em>. Nothing is known of reproduction or life in captivity","Habitat destruction occurs due to small scale cattle ranching and agriculture practised by local communities through forest cutting and burning of montane grasslands and shrublands. Coca plantations may be the main cause of habitat destruction in some areas of La Paz and Cochabamba in Bolivia, and in Puno and Cuzco in Peru. Mining, road construction and colonization expand habitat loss. Hunting occurs as a source of meat and medicinal products at local level but needs assessment. A grid analysis of the conservation status of habitats within the extent of occurrence estimated in Bolivia suggest that 58,6% of the distribution range is in good and very good status; and 41.4 % suffers degradation (25.5% regular, 15.9 % critical and very critical). Ongoing assessments in Peru (Barrio in prep.) suggest a similar situation.","There are no estimates of abundance, population size or subpopulation ranges. Points from Bolivia may be grouped into 5 to 7 localities distributed in Madidi, Apolobamba, Cotapata and Carrasco, and marginally (needing confirmation) in Pilón Lajas, Isiboro Secure and Amboró. Points from Peru can be grouped in 7 to 9 localities distributed in Sandia, Carabaya, Quispicanchi, Paucartambo, Calca, Urubamba, La Convención, and Satipo, but include old collecting / report sites that are currently densely settled and degraded. Several sites of potentially good habitats recently surveyed in Peru showed its presence in most available habitat studied. Current distribution and abundance need to be further assessed. Decreasing population trend is suspected from habitat destruction.",Decreasing,"The species is known from southern Peru (Junin, Cuzco, and Puno) and northern Bolivia (La Paz and Cochabamba). Recent published accounts from Peru only reported its presence in the Cordillera of Vilcabamba (Emmons <em>et al.</em> 2001), in the south of Manu (Pacheco <em>et al</em>. 1993), and in Machu Picchu (ParksWatch 2004). An ongoing survey in Peru has found the species in eleven new localities, within and outside protected areas of the southeastern Andes. Recent surveys in Bolivia found the species in a number of locations within protected areas along the Andes from La Paz to Cochabamba. Ongoing geographic surveys in Peru (Barrio in prep.) will define more precisely the actual range, but most probably it will not increase significantly its extent of occurrence. Area of occupancy (AOO) is based on 60+ record points in Bolivia (with 2x2  km quadrats = 224 km², and with 4x4 km quadrats = 656 km² ) and 49  points in Peru (104 km² or 368 km²).",Hunting occurs as a source of meat and medicinal products at local level.,Terrestrial,"This taxon needs to be locally and regionally recognized as a potentially threatened species; for this, more field surveys, ecological studies and educational and management work with communities focusing on habitat destruction and hunting are needed.  Monitoring of use by local communities may yield more specimens and show its contribution to subsistence. Since its distribution range coincides with the Vilcabamba-Amboró Conservation Corridor, the species may become a symbol or conservation object for this initiative. In Peru, the species can be found in the appropriate habitat in Otishi and Manu National Parks, as well as in Machu Picchu Historic Sanctuary. In Bolivia it has been found in six protected areas: Madidi, Apolobamba, Pilón Lajas, Cotapata, Isiboro Secure and Carrasco, but probably also occurs in Amboro.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
22167675,4257,Rucervus duvaucelii,Vulnerable,C1,2015,2015-01-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Barasingha is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion C1 because the estimated total population lies between 3,500 and 5,100 animals (not all of which will be mature individuals) and outside of several key populations, the protection status is not secure. Thus, the species is assumed to still be in decline by at least 10% over 24 years (three generations) mostly due to habitat conversion and degradation.<br/><br/>The range is now severely fragmented and the total area of occupancy (AOO) possibly falls below 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>, if areas of unsuitable habitat within protected areas supporting it are excluded. If the AOO were to be confirmed, then this species may also qualify as Vulnerable based on criterion B2. However, no substantive new information was received in 2014 to enable a full reassessment of this species.&#160;This species is reliant upon hands-on management in protected areas and changes in management style could see a resumption of very rapid declines echoing those of the mid-twentieth century.","Habitat use differs between Barasingha populations, and is reflected in hoof morphology. Central Indian animals (<em>R. d. branderi</em>) occupy open sal (<em>Shorea robusta</em>) forest with a grass understorey and grass glades; northern animals (<em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> and <em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em>) are obligate grassland forms, true Swamp Deer, inhabiting flooded tall grassland (Dunbar Brander 1927, Pocock 1943, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004), and, in Bangladesh, formerly, around mangroves of the Sundarbans (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Barasingha is predominantly a grazer (the main forage species are given in Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004), but at least <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> is known to feed occasionally on aquatic plants (C.D. Schaaf pers. comm. 1990), and aquatic plants contribute significantly to the diet of <em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em> during the monsoon and winter (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>The animals disperse in the wet season and congregate in large herds during the dry season, often in response to new growth following fire and the need for drinking water (Henshaw 1991, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004 and references therein). These seasonal movements take animals outside protected areas in at least Dudhwa and Kaziranga (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Dudhwa, mean group sizes during summer, monsoon and winter were 32, 13 and seven respectively; congregations of up to 250 individuals have been seen (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994). The composite home range of herds ranges from 10 to 30 km<sup>2</sup> annually (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>The Barasingha is polygynous: males and females have a linear hierarchy and during the rut males tend to defend females in oestrous (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1985, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Mating in <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> and <em>R. d. branderi</em> occurs during winter; most of the stags are in hard antler by September and they start calling by then. Calling peaks during mid October to November, but occurs within mid August–mid April. As the season progresses, the evening calling peak shifts to morning (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Rutting starts for <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> in August–September, for <em>R. d. branderi</em> in early December and for <em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em> in April; antler shedding begins by mid January, late April and early October respectively for the three races; fawning peaks in July–August, September-October, and March-April respectively for the three races (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2005 and references therein). There is strong fidelity to rutting sites and animals continue to visit those amid cultivation (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>The Barasingha is monoestrous and monotochus (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Females reproduce at the age of two to three years and males older than four years contribute to breeding (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Gestation lasts 240–250 days (Asdell 1964). The sex ratio in all three subspecies ranged from 40–80 stags per 100 hinds (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Sankaran 1989, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). The low male to female ratio reflects selective predation and poaching (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Barasingha females, including the two-year-olds, have reproductive rates of 20–45 fawns per 100 hinds (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Sankaran 1989, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Barasingha mortality is largely by predation, flooding (for <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> and <em>R. d. ranjitsinhii</em>) and poaching. Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> is a major predator of Barasingha, there are reports of kills by Leopard <em>P. pardus</em> and Dhole <em>Cuon alpinus</em> (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Golden Jackal <em>Canis aureus</em> predation on fawns and yearlings was reported by Singh (1985) and Schaff (1978).<br/><br/>Ecology and behaviour have been studied in several populations; Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (2004) gives an overview of information to date.","It is likely that Barasingha always had a patchy distribution, reflecting the available suitable habitat, and thus was predisposed to local extermination (Groves 1982). In aggregate, habitat conversion has led to its loss from most of its ancestral range. High levels of malaria discouraged settlement, agriculture and thus habitat conversion in the Terai Arc Landscape until recently. The conquering of malaria has made the Indian side of the Terai Arc Landscape ""one of the most densely populated regions of [India] and the [human] population is growing at a much higher rate than the rest of [India]. Most of the fertile terai plains have been taken over by agriculture."" (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004: 32). Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary (203 km<sup>2</sup>) is one of the few remnants of terai habitat in India (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). This deer's habitat is now reduced to isolated fragments as a result of agricultural encroachment and the destruction through habitat conversion of wetlands; the wet grasslands were seen as useless areas (they were termed ‘blanks’). Conversion took place largely during the 1930s–1960s (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Isolation into small, fragmented, populations increases the likelihood of localised extinctions, including those through chance events such as extreme weather and disease, as well as compounding the effects of ‘situation-normal’ threats like hunting.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation is still problematic within protected areas supporting Barasingha. Grass, timber and fuelwood cutting by local people degrade the surviving habitat, which lies mostly within protected areas, and external threats include change in river dynamics due to human developmental activities, increase in siltation and reduced flow of water during critical periods of summer. Protected area management practices are sometimes questionable, e.g. the current practice of grassland burning to control woody succession needs to be done in form of a mosaic, and harrowing should be discouraged as it seems to deteriorate grassland condition and promote occupation by unpalatable grass species like <em>Cymbopogon</em> spp. Many grasslands and woodlands have weed infestation (e.g. <em>Sesbania</em> spp.); manual weed removal in Dudhwa and Kaziranga yielded good results for habitat of Barasingha (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995, 2004). Although there seems to be no direct analysis of the effect of domestic stock grazing on this deer, in other wild ungulate communities studied in India they cause a major depression of densities of grazing species (e.g. Madhusudan 2004), and pending direct data, this should be assumed to be the case with Barasingha. Barasingha populations recovered in parts of North and Central India once grazing by domestic stock was controlled (Schaller 1967, Martin 1977, Schaff 1978, Singh 1984, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). Serious efforts remain necessary to control grazing in Hastinapur, Jhilmil tal and Katerniaghat (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). The grasslands and wetlands of the Terai arc landscape and the obligate species that they support, even those within protected areas are besieged by a multitude of threats which synergistically bode badly for the future (see also Red List accounts for Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Great Indian Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>).<br/><br/>Barasingha meat is not considered a delicacy, being seen as less palatable than the meat of Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em> and Chital <em>A. axis</em> (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994) but Barasingha are still poached for antlers and meat (to local markets), especially populations outside protected areas permanently or seasonally (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). The hide is used to manufacture whips and other items (A. Singh pers. comm.). Particularly in Bangladesh, hunting seems to have been responsible for national extinction because the Sundarbans mangrove forest is still extensive (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). It is likely to remain a highly significant threat for populations outside well-secured protected areas.","The present distribution of the Barasingha is much reduced and fragmented, reflecting major losses in the 1930s–1960s through conversion of large tracts of grassland to cropland and through barely-restrained hunting (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). <br/><br/>The northern subspecies <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> is the most numerous of the three races, with an estimated wild population is of 1,800–2,400 in India and 1,650–1,800 in Nepal (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004; Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral, NTNC, <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Schaller (1967) reported <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> from 15 localities in India of which 11 were in Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal, three in Assam and one in West Bengal. At present <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> exists in only six localities in Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal, two in Assam and none in West Bengal. In Nepal, out of four localities reported by Schaller (1967) only two now hold the species. Holloway (1973) reported a locality additional to Schaller’s, the Katerniaghat Sanctuary in Bahraich district of Uttar Pradesh. According to Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (2004), using data largely from Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (1995), <em>R. d. duvacelii</em> is restricted to Jhilmil tal Wildlife Conservation Reserve (Uttaranchal; no estimate), Hastinapur Sanctuary; Bijnor Forest Divison; Pilibhit Forest Divison (50–90 animals in the early 1990s, about 50 a decade later, centred on the Lagga Bagga forest block of Mahof and Mala ranges; Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004; but a population of about 300 in Lagga Bagga reported in 2008 to B. Long pers. comm. 2008); Kishanpur Sanctuary (about 400 in the early 1990s, Qureshi and Sawarkar 1994; and still “considerable numbers” a decade later, Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004; a population of 600 reported in 2008 to B. Long pers. comm. 2008); Dudhwa National Park, Kheri District (a decline from 1,200–1,500 in 1976 to about 700 by 1993, but still excellent habitat; Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004; a population of 600 reported in 2008 to B. Long pers. comm. 2008); Katerniaghat Sanctuary (10–25 animals in the early 1990s) (all in Uttar Pradesh) in India. There is also a population of over 100 Barasinghas in a small conservation reserve called Tatwala in Hardwar district; this habitat and population is totally isolated from other Barasingha populations (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). A small population was discovered in Uttarakhand state in 2005 in Jhilmil Jheel, an (37 km<sup>2</sup>) area of Reserve Forest.&#160;It persists at two sites in Nepal, Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve and Karnali–Bardia Reserve. At the former there was an increase from around 900 in 1976 to around 1,850 animals in 1993 (Henshaw 1993), and since then relative stability: the minimum estimate in a count in April 2007 was of 1,674 animals, making this the largest single population in the world of the subspecies (Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral, NTNC, <em>in litt</em>. 2008). In 2014, the Swamp Deer population was estimated at 2,301 (H. Baral pers. comm., based on data from the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation). At Karnali–Bardia Reserve, at least 34 animals were thought to be present, an increase from six in 1977, by Bauer (1990); during 1995–1996, Chiranjibi Prasad Pokheral (<em>in litt</em>. 2008) recorded about 73 animals in the park. Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated 50–100 animals. Since the assessments of Schaller (1967) populations have apparently gone from Banke Division and Chitawan Division (both Nepal); Jaulasal Sanctuary; Lalkua Sanctuary; Maldhan Sanctuary; along the river Ganges, west of Handpur; between Hardwar and Luksor; Sonaripur Sanctuary; South Kheri Forest Division; Bahdi Tal, six miles west of Bellerain; Ghola and surrounding tracts; Mirchia, bordering Nepal; Jaldapara Sanctuary and surroundings (all India) (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Further details of the Indian population of <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em>, estimated to total 3,500–4,000, are summarized in Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (1995); no more recent synthesis was traced.<br/><br/><em>Rucervus duvaucelii ranjitsinhi</em> is only found in Assam: Kaziranga National Park may have held about 750 animals in 1984, but this had declined to 350–500 by 1994 (Choudhury 1987; Qureshi and Sawarkar 1994). These numbers were not based on methods which quantify confidence in the proposed population size; the first-ever rigorous estimates came from Karanth and Nichols (2000) who recorded a population density of 14 animals per km<sup>2</sup> during their surveys in 1996 in Kaziranga National Park. The current status in Manas Tiger Reserve is uncertain (although it reportedly still occurs; B. Long pers. comm. 2008), and the species is extinct in Darang Division along the Bhutan border (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em><em>&#160;branderi</em> survives only in Kanha Tiger Reseve (Madhya Pradesh): the population peaked at an estimated 500 in 1988, an increase from a count of 66 in 1966 (Khajuria and Sinha 1986, Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). In 1995, Karanth and Nichols (2000) estimated population density of three per km<sup>2</sup> in Kanha National Park. In 2004, the population was thought to number 300–350 (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Other populations had become extinct since the 1960s in Motinala and Karanjia ranges, Mandla District; Balaghat District between Baihar and Lamba; near Amarkantak, Bilaspur District; near Kota, Bilaspur District; Madhya Pradesh-Orissa border Raipur District; West Bastar Division near Tekemeta; West Bastar Division near Kutru in Toynar and Bhairamgarh Range (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004; some different locality names were used in Schaller 1967).<br/><br/>In 1992 there were approximately 50 individuals in five Indian zoos and 300 in various zoos in North America and Europe (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004)",Decreasing,"The Barasingha is currently found in isolated localities in north and central India, and southwestern Nepal. It is extinct in Pakistan and Bangladesh (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004, Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Into the early twentieth century, the Barasingha was widely distributed in areas of suitable habitat throughout the Indo–Gangetic plain and the lowlands flanking the southern Himalaya. The range formerly extended eastward across the terai of southern Nepal through the Sundarbans as far as Assam. Barasingha occurred west to the River Indus, into Pakistan, and as far south as the River Godavari area of east-central India (Schaller 1967, Groves 1982, Sankaran 1989). The only known population in Bangladesh was in the Sundarbans, where it has been extinct for perhaps a century. The species may also have been in the northeast of Bangladesh, given its distribution in adjacent India (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Groves (1982) defined three subspecies with distributions (from Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004) as follows:<br/><ul><li><em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> (G. Cuvier, 1823) (Wetland Barasingha): Indo-Gangetic plain, north of the Ganges: Nepal, India, and, where extinct, Pakistan.</li><li><em>R. d. branderi</em> Pocock, 1943 (Hard-ground Barasingha): central India, between the rivers Ganges and Godavari.</li><li><em>R. d. ranjitsinhi</em> (Groves, 1982) (Eastern Barasingha): Brahmaputra plain; probably disjunct from the nominate for a very long time (Groves 1982): India and, where extinct, Bangladesh.</li></ul>","Barasingha meat is not considered a delicacy, being seen as less palatable than the meat of Hog Deer&#160;<em>Axis porcinus</em>&#160;and Chital&#160;<em>A. axis</em>&#160;(Qureshi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1994) but Barasingha are still poached for antlers and meat (to local markets), especially populations outside protected areas permanently or seasonally (Qureshi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). The hide is used to manufacture whips and other items (A. Singh pers. comm.).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is listed on CITES – Appendix I<em></em>. It is a Schedule I species under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004) and it is protected under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Swamp Deer is one of 27 mammal species strictly protected by the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2029 (1973) of Nepal. A PHVA (Population and Habitat Viability Assessment) workshop was conducted at the Wildlife Institute of India in July 1995. In 1995 there were 74 (25:34:15) individuals of <em>R. d. duvaucelii</em> in 10 Indian zoos (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1995). <br/><br/>Protected areas form the cornerstone of protecting Barasingha, given its attachment to level, well-watered areas, i.e. those perfect for agriculture. This makes for challenging conservation: “Controlling human disturbance on Lagga Bagga [Pilhibit Forest Division, Terai Arc Landscape, India] is a huge challenge: many people rely on it for firewood, thatch grass and fodder. Intensive protection and participatory management with these people are required to restore the area” (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Lagga Bagga was recently accorded protected area status, as a tiger reserve (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Lagga Bagga and Kishanpur protected areas are connected by the Pilibhit Forest Division although Barasingha habitat is not contiguous (B. Long pers. comm. 2008). Dudhwa is also close by, and Lagga Bagga is adjacent to Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve of Nepal. These four areas in total hold most of the remaining <em>R. d. duvauvcelii</em>. Not surprisingly, few Barasingha herds now exist outside protected areas; in the Terai Arc Landscape of northern India, Hog Deer and Barasingha had the highest proportions (of all ungulates studied) of their regional populations within protected areas (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Remaining populations outside protected areas seem to be small, scattered, and facing a number of threats difficult to resolve; probably these should be seen as of lower priority than ensuring the persistence of populations within protected areas, but a rigorous assessment of this is needed.<br/><br/>Qureshi <em>et al</em>. (1995) recommended conservation actions which can, over a decade later, be boiled down to maintaining the integrity of the protected areas supporting key populations, with particular attention to:<br/><ol><li>Curb poaching. The species does not have a high international trade value so poaching must tackled at least partly by and through local communities.</li><li>Curb habitat degradation through further fragmentation and over-harvest of plant material from protected habitat.</li><li>Develop long-term conservation management security for those areas where significant numbers disperse seasonally out of existing protected areas into surrounding farmland.</li><li>Maintain appropriate burning regimes and other active habitat-management measures.</li><li>Reduce and eventually cease grazing of domestic stock within protected areas.</li></ol>All these five issues should be addressed through effectively formulated and implemented protected area-specific management plans, reflecting the fragmented present distribution, the negligible likelihood of ever rejoining populations and that the threats have local causes and thus locally appropriate solutions. Given the wide range of possible threats and, in particular, the apparent necessity for active management of habitats (as well as control of human behaviour), management plans are particularly important to ensure a cohesive approach to conservation of Barasingha within the ecosystem of each protected area. Management plans have been prepared for various protected areas but their current status is not documented here.<br/><br/>One of the subspecies is down to a single herd, and another to just two herds. This makes extinction for a variety of unpredictable factors (e.g. weather, disease) a possibility. Establishment of additional populations of each of these forms a priority (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 2004). Patches of suitable habitat remain for each form, from which the species has been hunted out and which could, if hunting can be prevented, serve as suitable release areas. Captive breeding is often mentioned as being important for this species, but its conservation benefit is not clear. Each subspecies has protected areas which have–in the nick of time for two subspecies–secured buoyant populations. To expand beyond these, those protected areas retaining the species but not functioning so effectively need strengthening to allow natural recruitment. Establishment of additional herds of the two races down to a single site could be supported by translocations from each one’s sole current herd.<br/><br/>There are ongoing plans in Nepal to translocate some of the deer from Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve to boost the smaller population of Bardia National Park. The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation is also looking at the feasibility of re-introducing the species to Chitwan National Park. Swamp Deer was extirpated from Chitwan National Park during the 1960s, possibly due to a combination of factors (e.g. poaching, disease and habitat loss). The re-introduction programme will follow IUCN guidelines and ensure that in case of a catastrophic event in Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, good numbers are also stocked in other protected areas where the species occurred in the recent past or still occurrs in small numbers.<br/><br/>In Kanha National Park, conservation activities have included dispersal of Tigers <em>Panthera tigris</em> away from main grazing areas, control of poaching, cessation of grass burning, creation of water reservoirs, and reduction in domestic cattle numbers (Khajuria and Sinha 1986). Out-migration of villages from the park has significantly extended Barasingha habitat and protected their traditional fawning and rutting grounds (Qureshi <em>et al</em>. 1994).

Area of occupancy and habitat quality are also thought to be declining, and the species faces a number of serious ongoing threats including bycatch, habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, and competition from introduced species.","A riparian species, it is found in holes primarily along oxbow lakes, less frequently by rivers and ponds. It does not inhabit all water bodies within its range; it has quite strict habitat requirements and prefers water bodies with rich water-marsh vegetation, bushes and primary forests along the banks. Prefers lakes with 1-2 m depth with rich invertebrate fauna. Also found in small rivers with slow flow. In favourable years it is able to reproduce during the whole year, but usually has two reproduction peaks at the end of spring and autumn. Males participate in care of young. Omnivorous, recorded feeding on at least 72 species of water invertebrates and 30 plant species, as well as fish and amphibians.","The main threat to the Russian Desman at present is the widespread use of fixed fishing nets. These nets, which are used by poachers, have become increasingly cheap and widely available in recent years: one study recorded 50 'outlets' freely selling these nets on the Moscow-Vladimir section of the Nizhny Novgorod highway alone (<a href=""http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html"">http://www.biodiversity.ru/eng/programs/desman/results.html</a>). The very low price and high durability of modern nets means that poachers often leave them in the water for days or even months, checking them only occasionally and often abandoning them. A Desman dies on average within 5-10 minutes when trapped in a net. <br/><br/>The second most important threat is the use of 'electric landing nets' (or electric rods), which use an electric current to stun fish. These items of equipment, also used by poachers, have become widespread over the last 10-15 years. They are not believed to directly harm Desmans, as a general rule, but they almost totally wipe out the fish and aquatic invertebrates that the Desman depends upon.  <br/><br/>A third major threat is habitat loss and degradation. During the second half of the twentieth century water pollution, creation of impoundments, drainage, clearance of riparian vegetation, and uncontrolled agricultural exploitation of flood plains became widespread and contributed to the decline in the species' population. However, this process has abated somewhat in the last decade, and its influence on the decline in the Russian Desman population is today secondary. Competition for breeding sites with introduced Nutria (<em>Myocastor coypus</em>) and Muskrats (<em>Ondatra zibethicus</em>) may also be a threat.","At the beginning of the 1970s in the Soviet Union there were about 70,000 individuals, of which the majority occurred in Russia, with about 1,500 individuals in Kazakhstan and single records in Ukraine and Belarus.

The species is experiencing continuing decline in suitable habitat area due to seasonal controlled burning, increasing agriculture, flood control, grazing pressure, predation, loss of grassland habitat due to encroaching broadleaved trees, thatch collection, and human development (Bell <em>et al</em>. 1990, Maheswaran 2002, Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2011, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup <em>et al.</em> 2015, Khadka <em>et al.</em> 2017).","<p>The Hispid Hare primarily occupies tracts of early successional tall grasslands, locally termed ""elephant grass"" (Bell <em>et al.</em> 1990). During the dry season, most grassy areas are subject to burning, and the rabbits take refuge in marshy areas or grasses adjacent to river banks that are not susceptible to burning (Bell <em>et al</em>. 1990). Hispid Hares consume about 20 species of plant, but concentrate their diet on Kans (<em>Saccharum spontaneum</em>) and Cogon Grass (<em>Imperata cylindrica</em>) (Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The limited information available on reproduction indicates that the Hispid Hare probably has a small average litter size (Bell <em>et al</em>. 1990). It exhibits crepuscular behaviour (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>","<p>The primary threat to Hispid Hare populations is habitat loss, caused by encroaching agriculture, logging, summer flooding, and human development (Bell <em>et al.</em> 1990). The natural spatial and temporal dynamics of the tall grassland habitat, particularly the fire cycles, are key important to the conservation of this species (Bell <em>et al</em>. 1990, Maheswaran 2002, Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup, Dorji and Jamphel 2015). The natural process of succession of grassland into woodlands reduces suitable habitat for grassland specialists such as the Hispid Hare. Thus, the elephant grass habitat occupied by the species is highly fragmented, and often intersected by forests, streams, and rivers (Maheswaran 2002). It has been estimated that a decline (quantitative and qualitative) of 20-50% in suitable habitat occurred between 1994 and 2005, a rate that was expected to continue through 2014 (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005). Recent literature indicates that the destruction of habitat has continued (Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup, Dorji and Jamphel 2015). The Hispid Hare is also affected negatively by grazing, predation, loss of grassland habitat due to encroaching broadleaved trees, and thatch collection (Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>","<p>During the mid-1960s there was speculation that the Hispid Hare had gone extinct, however, the capture of a live specimen in 1971 in the Barnadi Wildlife Sanctuary, northwest Assam, confirmed that the species was persisting (Maheswaran 2002). Across its range the species has experienced a dramatic decline due to habitat loss and other contributing factors in recent years, using the early work of Bell (1987), Bell <em>et al.</em> (1990), and Maheswaran (2002) as benchmarks. For example, at Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve Bell (1987) found a density of 6.10/ha, whereas Yadav <em>et al. </em>(2008) determined the density to be 1.01/ha. Working in the same reserve, Aryal<em> et al. </em>(2012) estimated that the entire population size was only 219 (±40) Hispid Hares. The recent discovery of a Hispid Hare in Chitwan National Park was the first sighting of this species there in over three decades (Khadka <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Knowledge of the distribution of the Hispid Hare has always been limited. The historic range of the species extended along the foothill region of the southern Himalayas from Uttar Pradesh through southern Nepal, the northern region of West Bengal to Assam, and into Bangladesh as far south as Dacca (Bell <em>et al.</em> 1990). The current distribution in South Asia is sporadic, including the countries of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Bhutan (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup <em>et al.</em> 2015, Khadka <em>et al.</em> 2017). While its extent of occurrence is estimated to be 188,316 km², this belies its highly fragmented occurrence and highly specialized habitat that is under threat from numerous factors. Recent observations (within the past 10 years) have only been made in Shuklaphanta National Park, Bardia National Park, Chitwan National Park (Nepal), Jaldapara National Park and Manas National Park (India) and Royal Manas National Park (Bhutan) (Yadav <em>et al.</em> 2008, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup <em>et al.</em> 2015, Khadka <em>et al.</em> 2017). Within each of these parks only small areas of grassland habitat are suitable for the Hispid Hare, and most surveys are only successful at finding occupancy, in small numbers, in a small percentage of potential habitat. The number of locations where extant Hispid Hare populations have been located in the past 10 years, as evidenced by the recent literature, is significantly less than the number of those identified by Bell <em>et al.</em> (1990). The area of occupancy for the Hispid Hare has been estimated to be &lt;500 km², in highly fragmented populations in widely disparate localities (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005). It occurs at elevations ranging from 100-250 m (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>","<p>This species may be locally harvested, although due to its extremely low density, it is not highly sought after (Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The Hispid Hare is listed in CITES Appendix I (although this may be a historical artifact of an early listing; the species is never known to have been involved in trade), in India it is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and in Nepal it is listed in Schedule I of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973 (Bell <em>et al.</em> 1990, Jordan <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jnawali <em>et al.</em> 2011).

A survey conducted in 2001 found no evidence of the presence of the Hispid Hare in Buxa Tiger Reserve, where it had been reported as occurring it the 1980s (Maheswaran 2002). And as indicated above, recent sightings have been confined to a small number of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.<br/> <br/> Long term research is needed to examine effects of threats such as burning, harvesting, and livestock grazing, as well as studies of ecology, reproduction, and movement patterns during flood and burning seasons (Yadav <em>et al. </em>2008, Aryal <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tandan<em> et al.</em> 2013, Nath and Machary 2015, Nidup <em>et al.</em> 2015). Control of the burning season within the range of the Hispid Hare is needed to ensure that suitable habitat is available throughout the year, as well as the development of management plans for the remaining areas of suitable grassland habitat. Forest managers should be encouraged in the fostering of local species of grass and avoid the introduction of alien species for use by camp elephants (Maheswaran 2002). A return to the natural system would help prevent the extirpation of Hispid Hares, as well as other native species (Maheswaran 2002).

This range is becoming increasingly fragmented and the area of  available suitable habitat is decreasing (Velazquez 1994, Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2016, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018, Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em>  2018). This rabbit is being threatened by competition with grazing  livestock, increasing frequency of fire, intrusion by humans  (settlements, roads, etc.), and climate change. Models extrapolating its  persistence in a metapopulation context under climate change indicate  that it is likely to be severely impacted (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2009).  Its current EOO is 2,469 km², and an overestimate of the AOO is &lt;444  km² (based on the sum of 19 relatively large habitat polygons, in which  the species is further fragmented). The high level of current  fragmentation and the multitude of ongoing threats are likely to lead to  further decreases in area occupied. Thus, the Volcano Rabbit qualifies  for Endangered status (EN B1ab(i,ii,iii,v) + B2ab(i,ii,iii,v)).<br/><br/>Reports  that the Volcano Rabbit has gone extinct in the vicinity of the Nevado  de Toluca (Mexico Daily News 2018) are false. Native populations of the  Volcano Rabbit have never been in the Nevado de Toluca. A colony was  introduced in the 1970s and sometime later a single individual was  captured and taken into captivity, since then there have been no  verified records of the species in this area. The Nevado de Toluca is  not included in the current distribution map for the species.","The Volcano Rabbit is a habitat specialist (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993, Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em>  2018, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). It is found at its highest  density in a subalpine habitat containing bunchgrass (“zacaton”) and  pine communities (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993, Hunter and Cresswell 2015, Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>  2015). The largest remaining area of preferred habitat resides in the  Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park, between 3,400 and 4,200 m  (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). A study conducted on the Iztaccihuatl  volcano found that preference was shown for areas that had low  occurrence of “closed forest, long grass, cattle grazing, hunting, bare  ground and incline” (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). Contrary to previous  findings, the study suggested that an increase of recent fire activity  resulted in increased abundance of the rabbit, resulting from improved  habitat quality from reduced competition to bunchgrass (Hunter and  Cresswell 2015). However, regular use of fire to benefit cattle grazing  is not recommended given that cattle grazing proved to be more  detrimental to the Volcano Rabbit than the benefit of improved habitat  quality (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). Further, prevalence of fire led to a  decrease in population persistence (VORTEX modeling, Portales <em>et al.</em>  1997). A second study in the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountain Range found  that, in addition to the previously mentioned factors, proximity to  highways and population centers had a negative impact on abundance,  although this study did not find a correlation with regard to slope (the  effect of fire was not examined) (Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Until  today, habitat fragmentation has not resulted in the loss of genetic  variability, nor has it affected the genetic structure of Volcano Rabbit  populations. The values of genetic diversity are similar in populations  that live in a connected landscape and those that live in an  unconnected one. In addition, gene flow has been detected even in  isolated populations (Montes-Carreto <em>et al.</em>, in press).<br/><br/>The  diet of the Volcano Rabbit is diverse. It is known to consume more than  70 plant species, although the rabbits consume with greater frequency  zacatonales of the genera Muhlenbergia, Festuca, and Jarava (Cervantes  and Martínez 1992, Martínez-García <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mancines-Arellano  2017). In areas where bunchgrass is less abundant, they give birth in  cracks and abandoned burrows (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993). It is  unlikely that the Volcano Rabbit constructs burrows of its own (Fa and  Bell 1990). Gestation time for this species is 38-40 days (Cervantes <em>et al.</em>  1990). It may be reproductively active year-round with a peak breeding  season occurring ""during the warm, rainy summer"" (Cervantes <em>et al.</em>  1990). Litter size is one to three (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).  Adults in a captive breeding program weighed 400-600 g, with birth  weights for females 25-27 g and males 32 g (Matsuzaki <em>et al.</em>  1982). Total length of newborns ranges from 8.3-10.6 cm (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990). Mean total length of adults range between 26.8-32.0 (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990). Most activity occurs in the morning and late afternoon (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>A  study conducted in the Itxa-Popo National Park found that the Volcano  Rabbit makes up 12.5% and 5.5% of the prey base for the Bobcat (<em>Lynx  rufus</em>) and Coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>), respectively (Garcia <em>et al.</em>  2014). Additional predators include the Long-tailed Weasel (<em>Mustela  frenata</em>), Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>), and rattlesnakes  (<em>Crotalus </em>spp.) (Cervantes-Reza 1981, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).","The Volcano Rabbit is threatened by habitat destruction, caused by  livestock grazing, agriculture and property development encroachment,  logging, harvest of the “zacaton” grasses, and fires (98% of which are  started by humans attempting to encourage new pasture growth) (Fa and  Bell 1990). Its range is within 45 minutes of one of the world’s largest  cities (Mexico City) and urban expansion has resulted in habitat loss  (Fa and Bell 1990), which is ongoing. Today, suitable habitat for the  Volcano Rabbit in the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountains covers 7,544 ha,  equivalent to only 13.68% of the landscape, including 957 patches: 293  have a minimum area of 0.25 ha and only two are larger than 1,000 ha  (Uriostegui-Velarde et al 2018). Though hunting is illegal, it continues  because of lack of local knowledge of its protected status, and lack of  enforcement (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990, Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>Reduction  of habitat quality associated to the presence of pasture lands, crops,  and roads may have a stressful effect on the rabbits, as mean cortisol  metabolites levels measured in its faeces were more than two times  higher in highly degraded habitat compared to the low degraded habitat  (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species. Anderson <em>et al.</em>  (2009) predicted that the lower elevation range limit of the Volcano  Rabbit may shift upslope by approximately 700 m during the next 100  years, which will reduce the area occupied by the species, as the  mountain peaks currently lack suitable habitat.","An early estimate of the population of the Volcano Rabbit was 7,085  rabbits; 1,811 individuals in Pelado, 1,816 in Tlaloc, 3,458 in  Izta-Popo and approximately 3,056 for the surrounding areas (Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997). Due to a variety of continuous and ongoing threats, its population is likely to be lower at the present time.<br/><br/>Population  densities estimated by line transects are variable between regions.  Studies conducted on the Pelado Volcano indicated that densities ranged  from 0.11 to 1.2 rabbits/ha according to habitat characteristics  (Velázquez 1994); in the Biological Corredor Chichinautzin the density  was estimated to be 4.2 individuals/ha (Rizo-Aguilar <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). Other studies have shown the relative abundance based on fecal  pellet counts is also highly variable throughout its distribution,  ranging from 0.1 to 3.1 latrines/m² in habitat on the Volcano Pelado  (Velázquez 1994, Velázquez and Heil 1996), and 0.02 to 0.12 latrines/m²  in Sierra Chichinautzin (Rizo-Aguilar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>The  only study that has monitored trends in population was conducted in a  core population in the Sierra Chichinautzin based on density estimates  using pellet counts (Guerrero <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press). This study  indicated that Volcano Rabbit density declined from 4.2 individuals/ha  in 2011 to &lt;1 individual/ha in 2017.<br/><br/>Initial studies indicated  that the Volcano Rabbit occupied fragmented habitat, and that there  were 16 discrete occupied habitat fragments (Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em>  1997); the current number of isolated habitat polygons is 19. More  recent evaluation of the degree of fragmentation within occupied habitat  polygons was able to discern significantly more fine-scale Volcano  Rabbit habitat fragmentation (Uriostegui-Velarde <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).  At the landscape level 957 patches of available habitat covering 75.44  km² were identified along the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountain Range (thus  encompassing Tlaloc Volcano, Pelado Volcano, and Coajomulco forests),  most (N = 293) of which had a minimum area of 2,500 m². Only two patches  were larger than 1,000 ha. 144 plots were sampled intensively, and of  these 50 contained no evidence of Volcano Rabbit presence (no latrines  were located); on only five plots were there more than 100 latrines,  indicating the presence of a highly viable population  (Uriostegui-Velarde <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).",Decreasing,"The Volcano Rabbit is endemic to Mexico, restricted to the Transverse  Neovolcanic Belt, mainly in discontinuous patches on four volcanoes  (Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl, El Pelado, Tlaloc) and the Sierra  Chichinautzin (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>2016, Velázquez and  Gopar-Merino 2018). An initial estimate of area of occupancy (AOO) was approximately 386 km²  based on occupancy on the four volcanoes (Velazquez 1994), although  this area has subsequently been reduced to 335 km². Recent observations,  based on latrine records and sightings in the Biological Corridor  Chichinautzin, have added 109 km² to this distribution (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>  2016). A recent survey in the Parque Ecoturístico Piedra Canteada,  along the Tlaxcala/Puebla border, north of Iztaccihuatl, yielded a  recent siting of Volcano Rabbits, but the extent is unknown  (Ramírez-Albores <em>et al.</em>2014). As a result of the over 15 years  continuous volcanic activity of the Popocatepetl Volcano, the  distribution range has shifted and expanded, locally. Currently, the  discontinuous EOO is 2,469 km². The whole range, however, is becoming  increasingly fragmented as a result of human-induced and natural causes  (Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em> 2018, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>The Volcano Rabbit occurs between 2,900 m and 4,250 m in elevation (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016), but its highest density is found between 3,150 m and 3,400 m (Velazquez 1994).","In some areas, this species is hunted for food.",Terrestrial,"The Volcano Rabbit is listed under Appendix I of CITES (1973), although  the species has never been involved in international trade and this  listing is apparently an historical artifact. Hunting is illegal  according to Mexican law, but poorly enforced (Fa and Bell 1990,  Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). It is listed as endangered in the  Mexican Official Norm NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (SEMARNAT 2010). It occurs  within the protected areas Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks, but  hunting, grazing, and grass burning persist within the park boundaries  (Cervantes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>Captive  breeding programs have been established with some success, but infant  mortality in captivity is very high (Fa and Bell 1990).<br/><br/>It is  recommended that conservation measures focus on habitat management,  particularly the control of burning and overgrazing of the bunchgrass  “zacaton” habitat, and enforcement of the existing laws prohibiting  hunting and trade of the Volcano Rabbit (Fa and Bell 1990, Hunter and  Cresswell 2015, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). Management of the  protected areas should be improved and education plans at local,  national, and international levels should be implemented (Fa and Bell  1990, Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Hunter and Cresswell 2015,  Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). Captive colonies, especially those in  the zoos of Mexico City should be used to educate the public about the  protected status of the Volcano Rabbit (Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez and  Gopar-Merino 2018).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
45181925,41209,Nesolagus timminsi,Endangered,A2d+3d+4d,2019,2018-05-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Annamite Striped Rabbit is categorised as Endangered based on the rates of decline inferred&#160;over the 10-year period (a period exceeding that of three generations) to 2018 (past), the 10-year period from 2018 (future), and any 10-year period including 2018 within it (ongoing). Illegal hunting pressure is extremely high throughout the species' known global range. This poaching is primarily accomplished with wire snares; is almost ubiquitous across the Annamite forests, even in protected areas; and has resulted in precipitous declines of almost all ground-dwelling mammal and bird species similar in size to or larger than this rabbit. There is no reason to believe that populations of Annamite Striped Rabbit have not suffered declines comparable to those of other similarly sized mammals in the Annamites. There are indications that it is more sensitive to hunting than are some comparably sized ground-dwelling mammal species. Best-case scenarios, incorporating insight for similar-size ground-dwelling&#160;mammal species, suggest that the global population of Annamite Striped Rabbit has declined by more than 50% over the 10-year time period to 2018. Camera-trapping indicates that although the species is still present in detectable numbers across much of its known range, it is nevertheless uncommon in areas that have undergone, or are currently experiencing, intense poaching pressure, compared with what can be ascertained of populations before the onset of intensive snaring. Although it is evidently more abundant than are some of the larger Annamite endemic mammal species such as Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em> and Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em>, indicating (even allowing for different pre-exploitation densities) that its populations have not been as negatively affected by snaring as have the ungulates, these latter species’ populations have been assessed as having recent rates of decline almost certainly over 90%.&#160;Moreover, Annamite Striped Rabbit&#160;appears effectively&#160;to be restricted to wet evergreen forest: this means that the vast majority of its range is in Viet Nam, where snaring pressure has been recently, and remains, remarkably high; therefore, a higher percentage of its global population&#160; has been exposed to these high levels of snaring than for Annamite endemic or near-endemic mammals with more flexible habitat requirements and that extend further westward into Lao PDR, such as Owston’s Civet <em>Chrotogale owstoni</em>. As of 2018, it has been over 20 years (two assessment windows of time for this species under Category A) since intensive snaring started to sweep through the Annamite mountains, and it is likely that over 95% of Annamite Striped Rabbit’s occupied range has at some point experienced intensive snaring (i.e., over 100 snares per km², equating to 3,000 snare-nights per km², per month). Comparing the relative levels of decline at first wave of industrial snaring with those subsequently, and looking at geographic patterns of expansion of this snaring between the mid 1990s and 2018, the consensus assessment of surveyors and wildlife researchers active in the species's range is that in the 10 years to 2018 it declined by 50-65%. It is extremely unlikely that hunting pressure will decrease to a point that would allow widespread population recovery in the near future; continuing population declines extending into the next 10 years (from 2018) of comparable magnitude are suspected to be likely.","To date, no studies have focused on the ecology of Annamite Striped Rabbit. Nonetheless, some general natural history traits can be surmised from camera-trap records and villager information. It is clear that it occurs predominantly in wet evergreen forest, that which has little to no dry season (probably no month with rainfall below 40 mm; Rundel 1999). Most records come from low- to mid-elevation broadleaf forest. As an example of typical Annamite Striped Rabbit occurrence patterns, camera-trapping in three protected areas in Viet Nam, Phong Dien Nature Reserve (= NR), Khe Nuoc Trong proposed NR and Bac Huong Hoa NR, detected Annamite Striped Rabbit in broadleaf wet evergreen forest from 50 to 1,183 m asl (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2017). There is one record in Viet Nam from close to the highest point in Bach Ma NP in forest with characteristics approaching montane&#160;evergreen forest, but still with an ever-wet climate&#160;(A. Tilker, A. Nguyen&#160;The Truong&#160;and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2016). One record in Lao PDR comes from the western portion of Xe Sap NPA where semi-evergreen and lower montane forests (following Rundel 1999) predominate (Lamxay&#160;2013); however, intensive and extensive camera-trapping showed that the species is very localised and/or very rare in western Xe Sap NPA. The localised presence of <em>Licuala</em> and <em>Lanonia</em> palm species indicates small patches of ‘ever-wet’ habitat in this area (Timmins 2013) and the lower montane forest areas with a considerable Dalat Pine&#160;<em>Pinus dalatensis</em> component (Timmins 2013) are another clear indication that these lower montane forests have reduced dry seasons compared with most such forests in Lao PDR.<br/><br/>Although&#160;Annamite Striped Rabbit has potentially a low detectability by camera-trapping as conventionally practised in Indochina, it appears to have been detected by all camera-trapping efforts of more than a few thousand camera-trap-nights in wet evergreen forest (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2018).&#160;In stark contrast, it has never been camera-trapped by surveys of similar effort in areas of indisputable semi-evergreen and lower montane forest (following Rundel 1999) in Lao PDR. Particularly telling in this regard are the absence of detections from Nam Et&#160;– Phou Louey NPA, Nam Kading NPA, the Nam Ngiap catchment, the Nam Xang&#160;– Nam Chouan area, Phou Sithon ESCA, large regions of Nakai&#160;– Nam Theun NPA, and much of western Xe Sap NPA: these are all areas with varying degrees of Annamite faunal affinity. In Nakai&#160;– Nam Theun NPA the few detections were all in sites where, as with Xe Sap NPA, other indications suggest localised occurrence of wet evergreen forest (or forest strongly transitional with it). Potentially,&#160;many Lao populations function as sink populations, because most if not all wet evergreen forest in Lao PDR is likely to be to some extent ‘transitional’ with ‘drier’ semi-evergreen and lower montane forests, and thus is presumably suboptimal for this rabbit.<br/><br/>Camera-trapping from the Hue SNR in central Viet Nam suggests that the species survives in secondary and heavily degraded forest (M. Le&#160;pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>There is one report of Annamite Striped Rabbit occurrence far from wet evergreen forest, in western Khammouan province, Lao PDR. This was based upon the presentation of a <em>Nesolagus timminsi</em> image to local villagers and a positive response from the villagers that the animal was present in their area (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2008, A.V. Abramov pers. comm. 2018). However, other independent evidence (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2018) indicates that identification of animal images (including mammals as distinctive&#160;as Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> and Saola) by local villagers is often not reliable. The area reported is a mosaic of karst and rural agriculture, far from wet evergreen forest. Occurrence in this area would, if confirmed, represent a substantial increase in the species’s known range, and would require a comprehensive rethink of biogeographic patterns of occurrence of not only this species, but other Annamite associates as well. On this survey, A. Abramov (pers. comm. 2018) reported also that they found small leporid tracks, and that villagers stated that the animal with which they identified the Annamite Striped Rabbit image was common in the area and an at least occasional pest of rice fields. Factors contesting occurrence in this region are the lack of any evidence of Annamite Striped Rabbit in western Lao PDR despite extensive camera-trapping&#160;and the absence of trade records of it in the several fresh wildlife meat markets around Khammouan's&#160;western karst: Kha-nyou <em>Laonastes aenigmamus</em> and several other small mammal species of karst are found in these markets quite frequently (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2018). There is no confirmation from anywhere in its range of Annamite Striped Rabbit occurrence in any habitat remote from wet evergreen forest.<br/><br/>Annamite Striped Rabbit appears to be strictly nocturnal: camera-trap records from seven protected areas in the central Annamites (Bach Ma NP, the Hue and Quang Nam SNRs, Phong Dien NR, Khe Nuoc Trong proposed NR, Bac Huong Hoa NR and Xe Sap NPA) were exclusively at night (A. Tilker, A. Nguyen&#160;The Truong&#160;and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2016, M. Le&#160;pers. comm. 2016, Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2017). It appears to be solitary: the aforementioned systematic camera-trapping in Bach Ma NP, the Hue and Quang Nam SNRs, and Xe Sap NPA showed predominantly lone individuals, with only two exceptions, both of duos (A. Tilker, A. Nguyen&#160;The Truong&#160;and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2016, M. Le&#160;pers. comm. 2016). Almost nothing is known about reproduction. A duo of kittens, estimated to be approximately one week old, was found in a shallow burrow in Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area, Bolikhamxai province, Lao PDR, during the month of January (O. Vongsa pers. comm. 2015). A second duo of kittens, estimated to be 10–12 weeks of age, were found in Pu Mat NP in the month of May (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Annamite Striped Rabbit is threatened by poaching, with widespread snaring probably the most damaging form, although the species is also caught opportunistically by hunters, sometimes with the aid of dogs. Snaring operations range from the setting of a few snares to supply the camps of forest users not targeting ground-dwelling large mammals, to well-organised gangs focused on supplying such mammals to the national and international trade in wildlife meat and purportedly medicinal products. Indiscriminate wire snares have reduced populations severely of almost all ground-dwelling mammal species of rabbit-size or larger in the Annamites, and while Annamite Striped Rabbit may be slightly buffered from the effects of snaring operations by its small size and presumed small home range, there is both direct and indirect evidence that industrial-level snaring has reduced greatly its population. In Viet Nam, Timmins&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1999) mentioned a snared individual from just north of Phong Nha Ke Bang NP; a snared individual was found in Ha Tinh province (Dang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001); a skeleton was found in a snare by Timmins and Trinh (1999); remains were found in a snare in the same area of Ha Tinh&#160;(N. Furey pers. comm. 2002);&#160;and one was found in a brush-fence-style snare line in the Hue SNR (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2016). In Lao PDR, one was found dead in a wire snare close to eastern Xe Sap NPA (K. Thongasmouth pers. comm. 2013). At least four animals, all presumed to have been snared, were seen in the local market at Ban Lak-20 (= Ban Lak Xao) in the 1990s (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2018). The numbers observed in snares or otherwise in trade gives no suggestion, relative to the frequency with which other sympatric species have similarly been observed, that snaring pressure is any less significant a threat to rabbits than it is to any other species of similar or larger size.&#160;<br/><br/>The scarcity of records since about 2010 in many localities within the species’s range offers the most compelling evidence of snaring-driven declines. For example, in Bach Ma NP, where both past and current snaring levels have reached staggering magnitudes, Annamite Striped Rabbit appears as of 2018, on the basis of extensive camera-trapping, to be rare (see 'Population'). Although without pre-exploitation baselines it is not possible to prove declines in any particular area, the ecological conditions in Bach Ma NP resemble those in the Hue and Quang Nam SNRs (adjacent to Bach Ma NP), where Annamite Striped Rabbit densities are higher. It is thus reasonable to assume that without intensive hunting pressure, Annamite Striped Rabbit would be much more common in Bach Ma NP than at present, and that its rarity there is a consequence of hunting. Similar patterns of decline are evident at other localities in Viet Nam, including the Ke Go&#160;– Khe Net Lowlands: industrial-level snaring is likely to have caused the decline in this species there, as well as in a number of other ground-dwelling species. Although snaring numbers recorded by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2015) are relatively low (fewer than 1,500 snares), this result came from a relatively small area of forest and during only approximately three months’ survey, indicating a high overall snaring intensity (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2018). Most wildlife was recorded at the very tops of the hills in the protected area, away from the main snare lines (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2018). Although information does not span the relevant period, the highest intensity of snaring may have ceased well before the 2010 surveys, given that large numbers of abandoned snares were not found.&#160;<br/><br/>Mortality from hunting dogs occurs in some areas. Local reports from hunters operating near the Quang Nam SNR in central Viet Nam suggest that while hunters do not target Annamite Striped Rabbit with dogs, it is captured opportunistically while hunters walk the streams at night, and that such events may not be uncommon (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2016). Hunters report that when the species is illuminated by lamp-light it freezes, allowing the hunter to shoot the rabbit or the dogs to attack and kill it. Two separate encounters with two separate individuals in the same area of Quang Nam SNR, in which both animals were captured by hand (and then released unharmed), provide evidence for this behaviour (S. Woodfin pers. comm. 2015; A. Tilker pers. comm. 2015). Villagers from Ban Kalo, in Xekong province, Lao PDR, reported a similar opportunistic hunting of Annamite Striped Rabbit using local hunting dogs (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2014). While there is no evidence for a specific market demand for Annamite Striped Rabbit, and while it does not command the high prices of some species targeted for the wildlife trade such as pangolins <em>Manis</em> or some turtles, it is plausible that its meat can sometimes fetch a higher-than-average price because of novelty.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation are major threats only insomuch as they increase accessibility to hunters. Viet Nam’s aggressive road building policy, particularly in border regions, has in recent years increased accessibility to previously little-disturbed habitat for farmers and timber harvesters (semi-commercial and commercial logging operations), as well as for mammal poachers. Dams, which so far have had minimal impact, look set to increase in the future; they not only reduce habitat but also increase accessibility to commercial hunters and harvesters of other forest products, who take wildlife meat opportunistically whilst pursuing other activities. Similarly, the expansion of the road network in many border areas of Lao PDR (e.g., Salavan and Xekong provinces) will improve access into areas of Annamite Striped Rabbit range and, in the absence of functioning law enforcement, increase levels of snaring of mammals potentially to intensities similar to much of the species' Viet Namese range. Mining for gold, gems and other minerals seems to be on the rise, which results in habitat destruction and increased hunting levels.","Although population size and density have not been established anywhere in its range, Annamite Striped Rabbit appears to be noticeably less abundant&#160;in heavily hunted areas than in areas perceived on the basis of other evidence to have had lower hunting intensity. Observations and estimates of the intensity of hunting pressure across the species' known and presumed distribution in both range states indicates that at a landscape level this pressure is extremely high, with episodic deployment of snares in the region of dozens to hundreds of snares per km² over periods of years within almost every km² of suitable habitat in these landscapes. Although clear quantification of population size or decline rates is not possible, subjective assessment of available evidence, from camera-trapping of this species and trends in conservation status of other species in the same areas, suggests that substantial range-wide declines are very likely to have occurred. The clearest and most compelling information on the population trend of Annamite Striped Rabbit comes from a camera-trapping project in central Viet Nam. Because camera-trapping as conventionally practised in Indochina is often targeted at animals much larger than in Annamite Striped Rabbit, and for a variety of objectives, there is wide variation in its ability to detect this rabbit reliably. During this specific camera-trapping project in central Viet Nam the&#160;cameras were set consistently&#160;low enough to record rabbit-sized ground-dwelling mammal species reliably. Systematic such camera-trapping (totalling 6,805 camera-trap-nights) in Bach Ma National Park (= NP) in 2014-2015 at 53 camera-trap stations evenly spaced across the national park detected Annamite Striped Rabbit at only four (7.5%) of the stations, with a total of seven detections (defined as images of the species separated by at least 60 minutes from the previous image of the species at the same station) (A. Tilker, A. Nguyen&#160;The Truong&#160;and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2016). Most records came from the more remote and rugged parts of the protected area. More intensive camera-trapping in a core part of the protected area, at finer spatial scale, failed to record the species at 64 stations (8,256 camera-trap-nights), indicating that the species is either extremely rare or extirpated in this part of the protected area (A. Tilker, A. Nguyen&#160;The Truong&#160;and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>Camera-trapping in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves (= SNRs),&#160;two contiguous protected areas adjacent to Bach Ma NP, conducted immediately after the Bach Ma NP survey, detected the species more often: it was recorded at 10 (of 39) stations with camera-traps spaced systematically over the protected areas, in a total of 5,933 camera-trap-nights, comprising 47 detections (defined as above). The detection of Annamite Striped Rabbit at 25.6% of the camera-trap stations is far higher than in the landscape-scale camera-trapping in Bach Ma NP, but well below the occupancy of other mammals generally taken to be more resilient to hunting, such as ferret badger(s) <em>Melogale</em>. A further 54 detections (from 14 [of 64] stations) was obtained in an intensive effort in the reserves’ core. This intensive camera-trapping recorded a minimum of 27 individuals, as identified by their unique striping patterns (A. Tilker, A. Nguyen&#160;The Truong&#160;and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2016). Unlike Bach Ma NP, the Hue and Quang Nam SNRs have some level of anti-poaching support (although snaring persists at high levels nonetheless), which could indicate that Annamite Striped Rabbit may be able to rebound in the presence of targeted anti-snaring efforts. However, no baseline survey was conducted in this area before anti-poaching activities began, so the population trend remains speculative.<br/><br/>It is likely that the inferred differences in ground-dwelling vertebrate densities (including those of Annamite Striped Rabbit)&#160;between Bach Ma NP and the SNRs is caused by Bach Ma NP having been more ‘accessible’&#160;to more hunters for a longer period of time, and so having experienced more sustained hunting pressure than have localities more distant from the high human population density and the high densities of ‘access’-oriented infrastructure that characterise the Viet Namese coastal lowlands. That this is the case largely hinges on the lack of evidence to suggest that Bach Ma NP's habitat&#160;quality&#160;is lower than that of the SNRs&#160;for any of the species apparently less abundant in the former than in the latter (such as Northern Red Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vaginalis</em>, the Roosevelts' Muntjac&#160;<em>M. rooseveltorum</em>&#160;taxonomic complex, Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>, Crested Argus&#160;<em>Rheinardia ocellata</em>, Malayan Porcupine <em>Hystrix brachyura</em>, Masked Palm Civet <em>Paguma larvata</em>, Mainland Serow <em>Capricornis milneedwardsii</em>, and Crab-eating Mongoose <em>Herpestes urva</em>). Apparent patterns of decline from the Bach Ma NP / SNRs forest complex of other species known to be particularly sensitive to snaring, including Crested Argus, suggest that levels of accessibility and/or remoteness may explain distributions of ground-dwelling species, including Annamite Striped Rabbit, in this particular forest block (N. Wilkinson pers. comm. 2018). Ease of access is postulated commonly to affect the distribution and status of many quarry species in South-east Asia (e.g., Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2016), including Annamite species such as Owston’s Civet <em>Chrotogale owstoni</em>, Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis&#160;</em>and Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em> (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2016a,b,c). All available evidence indicates that the current low densities of species such as Crested Argus in areas such as Bach Ma NP can be attributed confidently to substantial snare-induced declines, in many cases probably exceeding 90% over an approximately 20-year period starting in the late 1990s, because reasonably clear data on population status at the beginning of this period exist for these species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>It appears that Annamite Striped Rabbit occurs at densities broadly similar to those of other species that are considered to be sensitive to snaring and are thought to have declined over a similar time period by rates in excess of 50%. For example, in the combined landscape and intensive camera-trapping in Bach Ma NP mentioned above, representing 117 camera-trap stations and 15,061 camera-trap-nights, Crested Argus was detected at only two stations and Owston’s Civet&#160;at, at most, one (the image is insufficiently clear for consensus on its identification); some hunting-sensitive species were not recorded in this effort, including Saola, Sambar&#160;and Greater Hog Badger <em>Arctonyx collaris</em>. Species that are believed to be fairly robust to snaring pressure during this survey appeared to be at depressed levels but were nonetheless more frequently photographed than was Annamite Striped Rabbit: Common Palm Civet <em>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</em> was detected at 48 stations, Asiatic Brush-Tailed Porcupine <em>Atherurus macrourus</em> at 44, and ferret badger(s) at 46 (A. Tilker, A. Nguyen&#160;The Truong&#160;and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2016). In sum, Annamite Striped Rabbit seems to be following other hunting-sensitive species into local extirpation in Bach Ma NP.<br/><br/>Given that most of the habitat suitable for the species is in Viet Nam, and that most (perhaps nearly all) of it&#160;is probably under levels of hunting pressure not an order of magnitude different from&#160;those in Bach Ma NP, it is likely that Annamite Striped Rabbit densities are depressed to broadly similar levels across most of the species’s range. While this is largely a subjective extrapolation&#160;by those who have spent years surveying in the species's range, some other recent camera-trapping surveys provide support for the conclusion that the species occurs at low densities in core parts of its distribution (but see the caveat above about the risk of some styles of camera-trapping under-detecting the species). Patterns of hunting pressure and overall defaunation similar&#160;to those in Bach Ma NP were found in the Ke Go&#160;– Khe Net Lowlands by small carnivore-targeted&#160;surveys conducted in 2007, 2008 and 2010. In total, 1,171 camera-trap-nights (with cameras set at heights above ground suitable for detecting the rabbit)&#160;and 101 hours of spotlighting did not record Annamite Striped Rabbit. Furthermore, this work failed to record other species believed generally to be sensitive to snaring (Owston’s Civet, Sambar, Greater Hog Badger, Crested Argus), but did record species&#160;presumed to be more resilient to hunting,&#160;such as Common Palm Civet&#160;and Asiatic Brush-tailed Porcupine&#160;(Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2015). Targeted camera-trapping in Pu Mat NP in 2015, focused on two interior parts of the protected area, and representing 20 camera-trap stations and approximately 2,500 camera-trap-nights, yielded similar results: no Annamite Striped Rabbit was recorded (Tuan Vo pers. comm. 2017). A sighting of a female Annamite Striped Rabbit with young in 2017 shows that the species persists in Pu Mat NP (Abramov <em>et al</em>. 2016), but this single sighting does not provide evidence that its densities are not severely depressed in the protected area. A camera-trap survey in Ba Na&#160;– Nui Chua Nature Reserve (=&#160;NR) during 2016–2017, in which 23 camera-trap stations operated for more than one year, in an area adjacent to Bach Ma NP (and within the species’s historical distribution although potentially suboptimal habitat), also failed to record it, and likewise documented low encounter rates for mammals and galliform birds considered to be sensitive to snaring, with Owston’s Civet and Crested Argus recorded at only a single camera-trap station each, and no records of Greater Hog Badger (Hoang Quoc Huy pers. comm. 2018). Not surprisingly, the mammal community in Ba Na –&#160;Nui Chua NR appears to have undergone levels of defaunation similar to those at Bach Ma NP and the Ke Go – Khe Net Lowlands (Hoang Quoc Huy pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Surveys in Bac Huong Hoa NR in 2015 and 2016, totalling 134 stations and 5,294 camera-trap-nights, recorded the species at seven (5.22% of) camera-trap stations (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2017). Surveys in Phong Dien NR in 2016, totalling 84 stations and 4,181 camera-trap-nights, recorded the species at three (3.57% of) stations (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2017).&#160; Surveys in Khe Nuoc Trong proposed NR from 2012 to 2017, totalling 1,018 independent stations and 33,500 camera-trap-nights, recorded the species at 54 (5.22% of) stations (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2017). The proportion of stations at which the species was recorded by all three surveys is broadly similar to the results from Bach Ma NP.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, the species was camera-trapped only twice (at different stations; in 2007) in Nakai – Nam Theun National Protected Area (= NPA) during surveys from 2006 to 2011 covering four survey blocks, which comprised at least some suitable habitats for the species, with a total of 11,126 camera-trap-nights and 201 camera-trap stations (Johnson and Johnston 2007, Nam Theun 2 Watershed Management and Protection Authority pers. comm. 2011). Both stations were within 5 km of the international border. Interpretation of this result is confounded by several factors, notably that most of the NPA is probably unsuitable in forest-type for the species and has therefore never supported a sizeable population of it. Thus, even though intensive snaring had not yet affected much of the NPA by 2006–2011, there was no possibility of recording a high encounter rate with the species. Since 2011, no relevant camera-trapping has taken place to provide up-to-date information on conservation status of ground-dwelling animal populations in the parts of the NPA within which Annamite Striped Rabbit was recorded previously. However, since these two records in 2007, the trade-driven snaring pressure,&#160;especially within 5–10 km of the Viet Namese border (where lies most of the habitat suitable for the species in the NPA) has intensified. This suggests that, were surveys to be repeated, they would find severe declines among the more hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling species there (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2016, C.N.Z. Coudrat pers. comm. 2018). Populations of Annamite Striped Rabbit in these areas are, therefore, likely to have declined, possibly to local extinction.<br/><br/>Surveys in the northern and central Annamites during 2012–2017 that focused on assessing hunting pressure (by direct observation of hunting signs, and determining the local status of hunting-sensitive quarry species through direct observation, encounters with animal signs, and opinions of local villagers) support strongly&#160;the assumption that the camera-trapping rates expressed above for Viet Nam are a true indication of depressed population density. Excepting surveys in Nakai&#160;– Nam Theun NPA, these surveys intentionally entered and assessed the least accessible, remotest, parts of each area (because species status is, often, strongly related to level of human access; Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2016). Although these surveys could not determine directly&#160;the current status of Annamite Striped Rabbit, past and current rates of snaring could be inferred along with the status of some of the presumed snaring-sensitive species listed above. In all Viet Namese areas surveyed, including the SNRs, Phong Dien and Bac Huong Hoa NRs and the Bach Ma NP extension, evidence was found that dozens to hundreds of snares per km² had been deployed over periods of multiple years. Encounter rates with ungulate signs in these same areas were well below those in areas with evidence of significantly lower hunting intensity, and calling rates of Crested Argus were vastly lower than the rates heard in ecologically similar forest in the 1990s.&#160; Lao sites however showed considerably more variability in the past and ongoing intensity of snaring. A situation similar to that of Viet Nam was found in the eastern international border area of Nakai – Nam Theun NPA in Lao PDR. In other Lao sites, intensive snaring appeared to be or have been more heterogeneous (for instance, in Xe Sap NPA), although still affecting a majority of the area or in some areas a large minority of the area (generally, the parts closest to the Viet Namese border). Only one landscape, comprising Khoun Xe&#160;– Nong Ma Provincial Protected Area (PPA) and Laving Laveun NPA of Central Lao PDR, was found where a substantial proportion of the area showed no signs of current or past intensive snaring pressure. Even within this landscape, signs in border areas evinced snaring intensity not dissimilar to those in surveyed areas of Viet Nam. The areas surveyed included some such as Phou Sithon Endangered Species Conservation Area (ESCA) where, based on habitat and climactic factors, Annamite Striped Rabbit is almost certainly absent, and others such as Xe Sap NPA where occurrence is likely to be highly localised. Overall, given the likely distribution of suitable habitat for Annamite Striped Rabbit, only the Khoun Xe –&#160;Nong Ma PPA and Laving Laveun NPA landscape had a sizeable area of suitable habitat with relatively low hunting intensity at this time.<br/><br/>Intensive snaring in the Annamites appears to have begun in the 1990s, when Saola, the Annamite large mammal species now closest to global extinction (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 2016c), was apparently still relatively frequently caught. Since then, surveys often find evidence of intensive snaring; concerns of its severity were already raised before 2000 (e.g. Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999). However, snaring has not affected all areas simultaneously in similar ways. Instead, intensive snaring appears to have progressed wave-like through the forests of the Annamites, with the progression of the wave, albeit in a somewhat stochastic fashion, most likely related to factors such as access and initial resource abundance. Although there have been no studies of the dynamics, observations suggest that usually at the forefront of the wave (defined as initial entry of poachers to previously unsnared forest areas) snares are deployed intensively, up to thousands per km². Snaring at this density is likely to lead to rapid, extensive declines in all mammal species rabbit-sized and larger, and thus after a few years (perhaps shorter), with the ground-dwelling large mammal community probably typically depleted by more than 80% at a locality, poachers move on. The form of and damage from the next phase probably depends on the relative ease of access and the quantities of other valuable forest resources remaining in the area. In accessible areas (for example, those reachable in a single day’s travel from the nearest human habitation, such as all of Bach Ma NP), snaring probably continues at a sustained and significant level (in the order of dozens of snare-nights per km² per month) because of the low resource cost for snaring in the context of the abundance of other ‘marketable’ forest resources remaining. In areas that take greater effort to enter, for example, those more than a day’s travel away, the situation is probably more complex, although at least periodic episodes of snaring are likely to take place in association with directed poaching of high-value species. However, these remote areas may also remain snaring-free for a considerable time after the initial wave. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, encountering the forefront of this wave was commonplace during Annamite surveys, at which time large areas had not yet experienced intensive snaring at all. But during the 2012–2017 surveys outlined above, the front of the wave was found only in Lao areas, notably in Xe Sap NPA and Khoun Xe –&#160;Nong Ma PPA. In all Viet Namese areas the most intensive snaring had clearly passed, probably at least 5–10 years previously. Although continued snaring was found in all Viet Namese areas surveyed during this time, the levels were in most cases considerably less than those which typify the initial forefront of the wave, supporting the conclusion that in accessible forest areas relatively low intensity but widespread snaring occurs, whilst relatively remote areas receive generally more intensive but localised effort. In some cases, notably in Phong Dien NR and even more so the eastern border areas of Nakai – Nam Theun NPA, evidence of recent snaring was limited, though mammal densities appeared to be severely depressed.<br/><br/>Considering observations of snaring from the late 1990s onwards, as of 2018 the core area of Khoun Xe&#160;– Nong Ma PPA is almost certainly by far the largest area of Annamite Striped Rabbit range remaining that has yet to experience intensive snaring. Overall, probably more than 95% of the species’s entire range has already&#160;experienced high to very high levels of snaring pressure. Given the still increasing demand for wildlife in the thriving illegal trade, and the very small percentage of the species’s range in Lao PDR that had not by 2018 experienced a significantly lower snaring pressure, and therefore is likely to retain healthier populations, Khoun Xe –&#160;Nong Ma PPA will almost certainly experience industrial snaring within the next five years unless there are unprecedented enforcement interventions.<br/><br/>Intensive snaring has been ongoing in Annamite Striped Rabbit range for a little over 20 years, yet the Red List Criterion A assessment window is only for ten years, meaning that it is important to consider the portion of the decline that has occurred during 2008–2018. Although there is no baseline for the species's abundance at the start of intensive snaring, the likely progression and magnitude of decline over the quarter-century to 2018 can be proposed. Subjective assessments from wildlife surveyors active in the Annamite forests before industrial snaring indicate that local populations of all ground-dwelling species of mammals of rabbit-size and larger may be reduced initially by close to an order of magnitude (including species often considered ‘hunting-resilient’ such as palm civets and ferret badgers). After this, interpretation is more problematic, in part because some small patches seem to escape the ‘initial crest’ of the snaring wave. By 2008, the start of the time period relevant for assessing Annamite Striped Rabbit under Criterion A, intensive snaring had already probably affected around half, perhaps more, of the species's range, based on field observation up to that period (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2018).&#160; Since 2008, such snaring has affected about 90%, perhaps more, of the range that as of 2008 had not been snared thus (that is, about 45% of the original range). Thus, as of 2018, no more than 5% of the species's original range has never been intensively snared. Assuming that initial Annamite Striped Rabbit population densities are reduced by well over half following landscape-scale intensive snaring, by 2008 populations had already declined by well over 50% in at least half of the species’s range. At this time, the bulk of the population therefore remained in areas not yet intensively snared. Under the foregoing presumptions, from 2008 the small proportion of the global population in the areas already heavily affected has by 2018 presumably declined at a reduced rate (perhaps below 50%), whilst the majority of the unaffected populations has undergone a substantial decline (of more than 50%). It is likely that a small fraction (5% or lower of the total population) did not experience any decline. An average, weighting population trend by the proportion of the global population in each category in 2008, results in a decline of 50% or more for the entire population for the ten years to 2018.<br/><br/>These decline rates seem plausible given the evidence presented above, despite some uncertainty of the relative severity of decline rates during the initial wave relative to ongoing rates thereafter. Areas such as Bach Ma NP, Phong Dien NR, and the Ke Go – Khe Net&#160;Lowlands, with good evidence of intensive snaring before 2008, would now have Annamite Striped Rabbit populations substantially below 25% of their early 1990s levels. This inference fits with the general camera-trapping findings given above. The scenario also fits the information from the SNRs where, evidently, intensive snaring generally occurred later (some before, some after 2008). It does not contradict the general conclusion that the recent protection levels in the SNRs might have reduced decline rates substantially or even have lead to minor recovery there, given the strong evidence that substantial snaring activity had already swept through the SNRs before significant anti-poaching enforcement occurred there.<br/><br/>Taken together, available evidence incorporating information from other similar-size ground-dwelling mammal species indicates that the total global population of Annamite Striped Rabbit has declined by more than 50%, plausibly up to 65% over the 10 years to 2018. The rate of decline that will be experienced in the future, now that about 95% of the species' global range has already undergone intensive snaring, depends largely upon the relative difference (if any) between the rates of decline during the first wave relative to the ongoing decline thereafter. Based on slender quantification (such as the numbers of snared Annamite Striped Rabbits found in the 1990s versus those found since 2008; see below), the current status in areas such as Phong Dien NR and Bach Ma NP may reflect substantial initial declines (perhaps of about 75%, maybe higher) but lower decreases since then (perhaps 30% or even lower, and perhaps even localised recovery). It is therefore possible that in the ten years to 2028 declines would not meet the 50% threshold. However, taking a precautionary viewpoint, particularly given the increasing trend in regional natural resource exploitation in general, and industrial snaring in particular, a further 50% decline is quite plausible in the future.",Decreasing,"Annamite Striped Rabbit&#160;occurs at low and medium altitudes in the northern and central Annamite Mountains along the Viet Nam and Lao PDR border. In Viet Nam, it is believed to occur in six provinces (listed from north to south): Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam. In Lao PDR it is believed to occur also in six provinces (from north to south): Xiangkhouang (unconfirmed), Bolikhamxai, Khammouan, Savannakhet, Salavan and Xekong. There are no records from the&#160;southern parts of the central Annamites or from the southern Annamites but these regions are not obviously ecologically unsuitable. The westward extent of occurrence in Lao PDR appears to be tied closely to localised climactic factors, with all indications suggesting that the species is strongly associated with wet evergreen forest. Fitting this, it has been confirmed in the Lao PDR only in areas close to the border with Viet Nam: a pattern shown by various other wet evergreen forest indicator species. The Annamite ridge forms most of the international border between the two countries and places most of Lao PDR in the rain-shadow of moisture-laden air masses from Viet Nam in the Lao dry season. The vast majority of habitat suitable for Annamite Striped Rabbit is therefore in Viet Nam. Most records come from below 1,000 m and the species has been recorded nearly down to sea level (50 m asl; Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2018), although few low-altitude areas retain otherwise suitable habitat. The highest record traced was at 1,300 m asl (A. Tilker, A. Nguyen The Truong and A. Wilting pers. comm. 2016).","Although there is no evidence of a targeted trade for the species, it is certainly hunted as part of the thriving wildlife trade that occurs across its known range. Given the paucity of information suggesting that the species has a high value for wildlife trade, it is likely that when caught, it often ends up in the local fresh wildlife meat markets, or is used for primary consumption. In fact, the first evidence of <em>Nesolagus</em> in mainland South-east Asia came from a subsistence market in rural Lao PDR (Surridge <em>et al</em>. 1999).",Terrestrial,"Although habitat loss and degradation have undoubtedly been factors in Annamite Striped Rabbit population declines from historical levels, the primary threat to the species is the intensive snaring that occurs across Annamite forests, and which is especially high in northern and central Viet Nam (which areas comprise most of the species's known range). It is difficult to convey the intensity of snaring in the Annamites: in many protected areas, hundreds of snares can be collected in a single day’s walk, and elaborate brush-fence-style snare lines can reach several kilometres in length (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017, 2018). It is therefore no surprise that, as with other rare and threatened ground-dwelling Annamite endemic mammal species, the highest priority for Annamite Striped Rabbit is effective law enforcement to curtail the industrial-level snaring that occurs across the region, combined with efforts to reduce the demand for wildlife meat and products sold as medicines (the ultimate driver of snaring throughout the Annamites) amongst the increasing middle classes in Viet Nam, Lao PDR and further afield (whether or not this rabbit is ever traded further afield does not affect the merit of this recommendation, as it is simply one species among a large general catch, driven by market demand in not just Lao PDR and Viet Nam). The challenges to enacting effective protected area-based law enforcement are substantial: neither Viet Nam nor Lao PDR has a historical model upon which to base effective protected area management, and government support remains weak, involving laws and decrees that have, typically, little follow-up action. Protected areas across the species’s range remain little more than paper parks, and if the species is to survive in the wild, this situation must change fundamentally. Some success has been achieved by joint government- and NGO-led snare-removal teams operating in the Hue and Quang Nam SNRs in Viet Nam and in neighbouring Xe Sap NPA in Lao PDR, operating under the direction of the WWF ‘Carbon and Biodiversity’ (CarBi) project. Over a five-year period, these patrols have removed more than 75,000 snares from the SNRs and the eastern section of Xe Sap NPA (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2018). Notable as these achievements are, the level of snaring in all three protected areas remains extremely high, with snaring intensity plausibly reaching thousands of snare-nights per square kilometre per year (A. Tilker pers. comm. 2017). Therefore, although this joint management model provides some hope for future protection for Annamite Striped Rabbit from intensive snaring in at least one forest block, considerable increase in effectiveness is needed before any part of this forest complex could be considered safe for the species (or any other ground-dwelling Annamite endemic mammal). Most other protected areas known or likely to hold the species are probably at least as exploited and as of 2018 receive minimal law enforcement effort or snare removal.<br/><br/>Because of the challenges that remain in the effective management of&#160;&#160;protected area, it is vital that conservation stakeholders consider within the next few years the establishment a captive ‘insurance’ population of this species. Currently it is not held in captivity. Although it is true that the urgency to establish an insurance population of Annamite Striped Rabbit is lower than for some other Annamite endemic mammals, notably Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, it would be prudent to secure an <em>ex situ</em> population of Annamite Striped Rabbit in the near future: the general snaring-driven&#160;declines are unlikely to slow in coming years. Establishing a captive population for Annamite Striped Rabbit should be less difficult than for the much larger and rarer Saola: unlike Saola, the rabbit still exists in detectable densities within several forest blocks in both Viet Nam and Lao PDR, and it should be much easier to capture, in part because of its habitat of becoming immobile when encountered with a headlamp at night. Indeed, as long as proper international expertise to oversee the care of captured individuals can be secured, there seems little downside in establishing an insurance population sooner rather than later.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45196929,4806,Chrotogale owstoni,Endangered,A2bcd+3bcd+4cd,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Owston's Civet is listed as Endangered A2bcd, A3bcd, A4cd because of an ongoing population decline, inferred to exceed 50% over the last three generations (taken as 15 years) and suspected to continue for the next three. This is inferred from over-exploitation, with habitat fragmentation exacerbating the speed at which the species is being extirpated. Hunting is a severe threat because the species is primarily ground-dwelling and so is exposed to the very high levels of snaring and other forms of ground-level trapping throughout its range. This assessment is made without any direct quantification of decline rate. Two largely sympatric ungulates&#160;of broadly similar generation lengths, Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>&#160;and Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em>, are proposed as Critically Endangered under the same criteria for the same reasons. Owston's Civet has always been and remains more widespread than them, and unlike them there is still evidence of&#160;several&#160;high-density&#160;Owston's Civet&#160;populations. While this does not necessarily mean the civet's overall population decline rate is lower, the lower category for Owston's Civet is assigned based on its wider occurrence in montane forest (in which this civet is known to live, in some areas commonly, and up to 2,600 m) and karst (which is predicted to hold viable populations). These habitats, which contain some areas of very rugged and/or highland terrain into which industrial snaring has not yet widely spread, are apparently not occupied by the two ungulates. If market forces drive intensive snaring also into these habitats, then Critically Endangered would be the appropriate category for future decline rates of Owston's Civet given its apparent rapid extirpation across some heavily snared parts of Viet Nam.","Owston’s Civet occurs in a variety of habitats, all within evergreen biomes, linked by the common feature of a non-harsh dry season. It is, or was, much more widely spread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, reflecting the much larger area of Viet Nam with significant humidity in the driest months (i.e., lacking a harsh dry season).&#160;The pattern of locality records in Lao PDR where the species is evidently naturally localised&#160;quite clearly shows that the species has a narrow&#160;habitat usage. Areas with&#160;a non-harsh dry season&#160;in Lao PDR are restricted (Timmins and Trinh 2001).&#160;The areas providing high encounter rates of Owston's Civet in Lao PDR are adjacent to low sections of the Annamite spine (the north-south mountain range forming much of the international border between Lao PDR and Viet Nam) that allow moisture-bearing winds from Viet Nam during Lao PDR's dry season, which in the rest of the country is harsh at lower and mid altitudes (Timmins and Trinh 2001, Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Sivilay&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Many other evergreen forest survey areas across the country lack records,&#160;despite the use therein of methods suitable to find the species, at adequate intensities, and the finding of multiple hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling mammals,&#160;It is essentially absent from the predominant evergreen forest types of Lao PDR, lowland, mid-elevation and lower montane semi-evergreen (dry evergreen) and lower montane forests. This is based on spotlighting in several survey areas supporting these forest types in the early - mid 1990s (Duckworth 1997) and on camera-trapping in the 21st century in Phou Sithon, Nakai-Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA), Laving-Laveun NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, Phou Chomvoy Provincial Protected Area and Xe Sap NBCA (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); the hunting intensity in all of these at the time of camera-trapping was equivalent to Pu Mat before (sometimes well before) 1998, about when the species was still readily detected by camera-traps. It is evidently locally present in Lao PDR below 1,000 m where wet evergreen forest occurs, but the absence of records from Laving-Laveun NBCA, which holds various other wet&#160;evergreen forest species,&#160;suggests that Owston's Civet is particularly sensitive to climatic conditions. It also occurs in montane evergreen forest (over 1,000 m), but is probably equally restricted by climatic conditions in its geographic and altitudinal range. Montane areas&#160;with wet climates, such as various high peaks in eastern parts of Lao PDR, appear to support the species over a relatively wide range (e.g., Xe Sap NBCA; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whilst peaks further west (greater rain-shadowing during the winter) appear to support more localised populations (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey NBCA; Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Wet evergreen forest is, or was, far more widespread in Viet Nam than in Lao PDR, but it is not universal. The strong evidence from Lao PDR for climatic sensitivity of Owston's Civet suggests that some Viet Namese evergreen forests will hold the species sparsely or not at all (those in a&#160;rain-shadow).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Annamite wet evergreen forest of Lao PDR, Owston's Civet has been recorded as high as suitable survey has occurred (1,500 m; Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The few records from Lao PDR's northern highlands, mostly imprecisely located (barring that in Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009), are likely to come from higher altitudes where the colder temperatures ameliorate the low dry-season rainfall. Thus, in Lao PDR Owston's Civet is likely to occur&#160;mostly in hill and montane altitudes, although there are credible reports from as low as 550 m (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), whereas in Viet Nam the species has a wide altitudinal range, right down to the plains and up to 2,600 m (Van Ban district, Lao Kay province, in 2002; S. Swan pers. comm. 2014). Recent camera-trap records at&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, in the northern highlands of Viet Nam, come from altitudes of 1,722-2,444 m a.s.l.; there was very little survey effort below 1,700 m (B.M. Rawson pers, comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Captive animals in both Viet Nam and the U.K. relish earthworms (J. Meek pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014) and the species's skull and dentition suggest an invertebrate diet (Thomas 1927). An earthworm-dominated diet would explain the tight linkage with year-round humidity, given that in the parts of Lao PDR with a harsh dry season earthworms are not accessible during that season. This remains purely speculative, especially given that the component of Owston's Civet range south of the northern highlands resembles that of various other species unlikely to depend directly on access to earthworms, e.g. Annamite Striped Rabbit <em>Nesolagus timminsi</em>&#160;and Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>.<br/><br/>Suitable forests, in Viet Nam at least, include some on limestone and some dominated by bamboo (Roberton 2007). There are indications from Lao PDR of occurrence in degraded and edge habitat such as banana gardens (King 2002), but these remain to be confirmed. The lack of records from deciduous forest surely reflects the genuine pattern of occurrence.<br/><br/>Owston's Civet has not been studied in the field, but camera-trapping indicates that it is nocturnal, largely solitary and presumably largely active at ground level (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), although there is at least one record of a wild animal 3 m up a tree (Dang and Le 2010). The species climbs well in captivity (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).","Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the two countries holding most of the geographic range of Owston's Civet, have among the highest levels of non-specific mammal hunting in the world. For many decades hunting with projectiles, dogs, and traps fabricated from local plant materials has been very high, for largely local use. From the late 1980s, rising throughout the 1990s, 2000s and into the 2010s, rapidly increasing affluence of Chinese and Viet Namese consumers and, to a lesser extent, those in Lao PDR has fuelled an explosive rise in urban demand for wildlife meat, including civets (e.g., Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Lao PDR, the same situation has developed, largely for export rather than in-country consumption. This demand has resulted in levels of snaring probably unprecedented anywhere in the world, using durable materials (metal) linked by brushwood drift-fences. These are evidently extremely efficient in extirpating mobile ground-dwelling mammals of civet size (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014); some areas of little-degraded forest now support negligible densities of ground-dwelling mammals of this size class and above (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Although such trade-driven off-take of large mammals from protected areas and such wildlife trade is unambiguously illegal in both Lao PDR and Viet Nam, enforcement is uneven and the large profits to be made hamper effective resolution of the problem. In parts of Lao PDR, trade prices for wild meat are so high and wild stocks so depleted that severe dietary problems are evident among rural hill people (i.e., those without access rights to productive fisheries) (Krahn and Johnson 2007). There is no reason to expect these hunting levels to decline until the wildlife species affected have been hunted out; larger species such as big cats <em>Panthera</em>, wild cattle <em>Bos</em> and Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em> are already widely extirpated in Viet Nam and Lao PDR (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014), yet hunting continues. Some Viet Namese areas camera-trapped and discussed by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) were almost bereft of any ground-dwelling mammals or birds bigger than rats. This is the plausible end-point for most areas holding Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>By contrast, Owston's Civet seems to be fairly resilient to long-standing hunting methods and intensities, judging by the numbers that were and still are camera-trapped in in Viet Nam's northern highlands (Swan and O'Reilly 2004, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004, B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). In contrast to Owston's Civet, many other hunting-sensitive species in these areas were or are already extirpated or reduced to numbers so low as to evade detection. This area has no or negligible trade-driven operation of metal snares in long lines; this lack is typical of Hmong-dominated northern highland areas (J. Tordoff pers. comm. 2014). Most hunting for mammals of civet-size and over in these areas is active, with projectiles and with dogs,&#160;rather than by passive trapping; and it is&#160;by day (B. Long pers comm. 2014). The nocturnal, solitary, generally inconspicuous habits of Owston's Civet evidently facilitate its survival in such areas; its dens must be in areas not readily found by dogs.<br/><br/>Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation have affected large areas of Owston’s Civet range (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989), particularly in Viet Nam and increasingly in Lao PDR. Habitat fragmentation magnifies the impact of hunting on populations, particularly when roads are built into areas of, until then, limited accessibility. Vehicle access makes the harvest of a whole host of mid-price marketable materials such as civet meat economically viable where previously the labour investment of carrying heavy loads long distances restrained off-take in those areas to high-value products and what was required for living off the land during the process. An ongoing massive expansion of the road system in Lao PDR, in part related to large infrastructure construction such as dams and mines (e.g., Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011, W.G. Robichaud pers. comm. 2014), is likely to bring most of the Lao areas holding Owston's Civet within close-enough range of vehicle access that general wildlife meat extraction is economically feasible. This is already the case for most of the Viet Namese areas.<br/><br/>The exceptions to this grim assessment include karst massifs (into which road building is rarely economically viable), montane areas inhabited by people who disdain snaring, and any protected areas which develop effective enough management regimes before the species is extirpated. While there are Owston's Civet records form karst, densities within such landscapes are unknown, as is the degree to which the&#160;species&#160;depends upon tall forests there (themselves rather patchy in occurrence in karst landscapes). The extent to which industrial snaring will spread into hill areas already largely depleted of animals larger than civets (by day-time shooting and hunting with dogs), notably large areas of the northern highlands, is unclear; if some such areas do not start to deploy it (for various reasons, such as ongoing remoteness from road networks, or the cultural predispositions of the inhabitants), these areas will also be important havens to Owston's Civet.<br/><br/>The adaptability of Owston's Civet to non-hunted degraded and fragmented areas is unknown, but so long as snaring remains uncontrolled, is moot.","The total population of Owston's Civet will always have been much smaller than that of most other mainland South-east Asian civets because it has such a small geographic range. There is insufficient&#160;baseline information to define the precise&#160;range and even the general abundance in the era before trade-driven hunting began to accelerate steeply in the 1980s with the increasingly wide deployment of cable-snares in long lines linked by brushwood drift fences. Therefore, its population trend needs to be inferred from trends in habitat and in hunting (types, distributions and intensities), based on a hypothesised geographic and ecological distribution, itself inferred from habitat (from which the known precisely located records come) and distributions of ecologically restricted co-occurring species.<br/><br/>Severe declines probably started in the early 1990s, Around this time, evidence suggests other ground-dwelling, now much-declined, Annamite-centred species such as Saola <em>Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</em>, Large-antlered Muntjac <em>Muntiacus vuquangensis</em> and&#160;Edwards’s Pheasant <em>Lophura edwardsii</em>&#160;were, by today’s standards, still common in accessible Viet Namese forests. Camera-trapping in the late 1990s in Pu Mat Nature Reserve and in Huong Son district (SFNC 2000, Timmins and Trinh 2001) suggested that the species was still relatively common in mid-elevation forests where hunting pressure was already relatively intense. The number of animals in trade in the 1990s (e.g., at Ban Lak-20 (= Ban Lak Xao) in Lao PDR; received by the Owston’s Civet Project at&#160;Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam; and observed in trade near Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park and as&#160;stuffed specimens along route 1, both Viet Nam) all suggest the species was frequent thereabouts, presumably in the mid-elevation forest where the bulk of snaring was then taking place. There is no pointer, when the difficulties of detecting this species by typical pre-camera-trap surveys are accounted for, to suggest that Owston’s Civet was not a common species throughout mid-elevation Vietnamese wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section), prior to the advent of intensive snaring.<br/><br/>Within its range, it evidently reached, and locally still reaches, high densities within favoured habitat. Bourret (1944) considered it to be the most common civet between the Fansipan mountains and the Black river in northern Viet Nam. Two camera-trapping surveys in Viet Nam around the turn of the century, one in the Hoang Lien mountains in the north-west of the country and the other in Pu Mat Nature Reserve in the northern Annamites found this civet to be among the most commonly photographed small carnivores in these areas (SFNC 2000, S. Swan pers. comm. 2004). Pu Mat NR has not been resurveyed, but this assessment&#160;is still appropriate for the highland areas of Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, both in/near the Hoan Lien mountains, in 2013 camera-trapping (B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). The same was found in 2012-2013 in Xe Sap National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b) and during the preceding decade in parts of eastern Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In some other areas that it has been found, it has been among the least recorded species by camera-trap, e.g. Quang Nam province, Viet Nam (Long and Minh 2006), western Nakai-Nam Theun NPA (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), and Nam Et-Phou Louey NPA in the northern highlands of Lao PDR (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). The patterns&#160;of the other hunting-sensitive species recorded by these surveys suggest that Owston's Civet abundance is highly heterogeneous dependent upon habitat, not that the low encounter rates in these areas are&#160;solely a result of overhunting (although this&#160;might be responsible in part or whole for the low encounter rate in Quang Nam).<br/><br/>However, hunting is likely to be the explanation for the stark temporal pattern shown by the review of camera-trapping in Viet Nam by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Of the five camera-trapping surveys operating in Viet Nam during&#160;1998–2006, all found Owston’s &#160;Civet; the four in 2006–2013 all did not. (Two additional sites surveyed in the latter period, Cat Tien NP and U Minh, also did not find&#160;Owston’s Civet but are excluded from the comparison as being outside the species's likely range.) Very recent (late 2013) camera-trapping in Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve (Kon Tum province, Viet Nam) and two northern highland sites,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, found Owston's Civet to be one of most commonly photographed small carnivores (Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014,&#160;B.M. Rawson pers. comm. 2014). These anomalies within the 2006-2013 time period, not available in time for the Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014) review, are both in very mountainous areas consequently less economically appealing to market hunters. Higher hunting pressures, notably snaring intensities, typify most of the survey areas included in Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). Excepting the results from Ngoc Linh NR,&#160;Mu Cang Chai and Muong La, the lack of Viet Namese records from 2006 onwards suggests a major recent decline in the species in sites across the country with large populations&#160;left only in forested steep highland massifs. This suspected decline&#160;is corroborated by the failure of over 15,000 camera-trap-nights of effort in wet evergreen forest (see 'Habitats and ecology' section) in the Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves, Viet Nam, since August 2012 to find the species (WWF pers. comm. to Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Nor has it been found in another lowland area of wet&#160;evergreen forest, Khe Nuoc Truong in Quang Binh province, where extensive camera-trapping recorded many other small carnivore species (Le Trong Trai pers. comm. 2014). For none of these 2006-2013 Viet Nam camera-trap survey areas is there evidence of a pre-intensive-snaring large population of Owston' Civet. However, assessing them based on habitat and other Annamite wet evergreen forest species' status (see 'Habitats and ecology' section; R.J. Timmins [pers. comm. 2014] has&#160;surveyed in most of them and studied all on aerial imagery), Khe Nuoc Truong, Hoang Son, and non-limestone forests in the Phong Nha-Ke Bang area,&#160;are&#160;probably&#160;prime Owston’s Civet habitat; Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves are very similar to Pu Mat NR; and Ke Go is hard to know, because few other sites are topographically similar, and the topography influences local climate. Even Crested Argus&#160;<em>Rheinardia ocellata</em>&#160;(among the least hunting-sensitive ground-dwelling wet evergreen forest species)&#160;has not been camera-trapped in the&#160;Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves;&#160;they are some of the most heavily hunted large forest blocks that R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2014) has&#160;ever been to.<br/><br/>A decline of such magnitude was not suspected during the last Red List assessment for this species, for 2008. At that stage, all camera-trap surveys within its range typically found the species, sometimes commonly. The high encounter rates in some areas suggests a high starting population and thus a long time until near extirpation (and the concomitant ability of generalised camera-trapping to note a paucity of records). Another factor weighed for the 2008 listing as Vulnerable was that one of the surveys camera-trapping the species commonly, in Hoang Lien Son of far northern Viet Nam, was amid highly degraded and fragmented forest which had been subjected to high levels of traditional hunting for decades (see Swan and O'Reilly 2004) and thus the species was resilient to hunting pressure. However, it now seems more likely that Owston's Civet differs in sensitivity to different styles of hunting (see 'Threats'). The current overall population trend is thus assessed to be steeply downwards. Probably, the main phase of decline in Viet Nam has already occurred, with most areas holding the species there now having only low numbers with large populations persisting only in the northern highlands and most rugged part of the Annamites, Lao PDR, retaining much larger areas of forest without road incursion and a much lower human population, still retains at least one large population, plausibly several (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b), but the national trend in 2015-2030 is likely to replicate that of Viet Nam in 1999-2014.<br/><br/>No information on the present population status in the Chinese part of the range was traced. Indeed, it is not clear that the species is still extant there.",Decreasing,"Owston's Civet is known to occur across a wide latitudinal range of both eastern Lao PDR (Sivilay&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b) and Viet Nam (Roberton&#160;2007,&#160;Dang and Le 2010), and in a small area of southernmost China, possibly only in Hekou, Luchun and Jinping counties of Yunnan province (Wang Ying-xiang 2003) but perhaps also in adjacent Guangxi province (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). It has not been found west of the Mekong river (Corbet and Hill 1992) and indeed occurrence in Lao PDR is restricted largely to the easternmost areas that have similarities in climate to Viet Nam. The range may also potentially extend into easternmost Cambodia: two individuals seen in the Phnom Tamao zoo (Phnom Penh) collection of stuffed mounts in the late 1990s were unlikely to have originated outside Cambodia (C.M. Poole pers. comm. to Dang and Le 2010). However, extensive surveys in Cambodia's eastern provinces have not found the species (e.g., Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a, E.H.B. Pollard pers. comm. 2012). Perhaps the most likely area of Cambodia, eastern Virachey National Park, remains very little camera-trapped. Suitable methodology (camera-trapping and/or spotlighting) has been applied widely enough in the southern half of Lao PDR to be confident the species is entirely or largely restricted to the east in the south and latitudinal centre; capable searches have been less widespread in the northern highlands.<br/><br/>Records come from the range 100-2,600 m, but, particularly west of the Annamites, only a subset of this full range is likely to be occupied in any given area (see 'Habitats and ecology').","Owston's Civet is taken for meat and traditional medicine (including its bones, scent gland, and penis) in all of its range countries; there is not suspected to be any targeted hunting of the species, but much hunting in its range is non-selective (e.g. snares) to supply the general wildlife meat market (Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011,&#160;B. Long&#160;pers. comm. 2006,&#160;S.I. Roberton pers. comm. 2006).",Terrestrial,"Owston's Civet is listed as Endangered on the China Red List and as Vulnerable in the Viet Nam Red Book (MOSTE 2000). It is protected in Yunnan province, but not in Guangxi (GMA Small Carnivore Workshop 2006). In Viet Nam the species is listed in group IIB meaning exploitation is regulated but not prohibited (Decree 32/2006/ND-CP). In Lao PDR, the species is listed in group I (Prohibition category) of the hunting regulations (Prime Minister Decree 81, 2008; Wildlife hunting regulation).<br/><br/>An international breeding programme, coordinated from Viet Nam, has been established with populations in Europe and Viet Nam. However numbers are still too low for long-term viability (J. Meek pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Owston's Civet has been recorded in many protected areas in Viet Nam and several in Lao PDR (Roberton 2007, Sivilay <em>et al</em>. 2011, Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b) but in none of these is trade-driven snaring yet under effective control. They have, however, somewhat to greatly slowed the expansion of the road system, and thus maintained areas in which it is only marginally economically viable to harvest wildlife meat in bulk; and they have reduced the chance of landscape-level habitat transformation projects such as concession plantations.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45197564,6635,Diplogale hosei,Vulnerable,C1,2015,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Hose's Civet is listed as Vulnerable because its population is likely to be lower than 10,000 mature individuals, based on an area of occupancy (AOO) estimated as 28,000 km²; the assumption of a very patchy distribution even within this area; an indicative population density of one individual per km² (based on studies of similar-sized, largely ground-dwelling civets such as Malay Civet <em>Viverra tangalunga</em> in Borneo; e.g., Colón 2002) in areas considered highly ‘suitable’ for the species; and the very low detection rates in other areas suggesting overall density to be much below this. It is also estimated that there will be an ongoing population&#160;decline&#160;of at least 10% over the next three generations (taken as 15 years). This decline is expected because of increased pressure on higher-elevation forests as a result of expansion of logging activities and monoculture plantations to higher elevations, coupled with increase in shifting agriculture and indiscriminate hunting practices using nets and snares as a result of human displacement caused by mega hydro-electric dam projects in the centre of Borneo. The combination of such human-induced activities poses the threat of a highly fragmented landscape through which habitat specialists such as Hose’s Civet may be less able to disperse than at present, leading to increasingly isolated populations. Although there are no figures to support this ongoing decline in population size, it is precautionary to acknowledge that these threats will probably take place within the next 15 years, and so to classify the species as Vulnerable.","The few records of Hose’s Civet and the paucity of research on the species render its habitat preference and ecology difficult to characterise. The full elevational range of existing records extends from 325 m (Samejima and Semiadi 2012) to 1,700 m a.s.l. (Dinets 2003) though whether this upper limit of 1,700 m is a real guideline occurrence limit or simply an artefact of search effort patterns remains to be ascertained. Current records suggest that a large proportion of the species may occur at elevations above 800 m. However, Samejima and Semiadi (2012) suggest that in some parts of the species’s&#160;range, such as the Schwaner Mountains in Central Kalimantan, areas below 450 m may be part of its main habitat. Hose’s Civet appears to exhibit little habitat plasticity with records mainly in natural forest (e.g., Yasuma 2004; Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005; Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010a,b; Brodie and Giordano 2010; Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2011) and rarely in logged-over forest (Samejima and Semiadi 2012, J. Mathai pers. comm. 2014). In a logging concession in the Upper Baram, Sarawak, for example, the species has been detected in logged forest (less than 10 years previously) where reduced-impact-logging techniques have been applied; frequency of detection is, however, much lower than in primary forest in the same logging concession (J. Mathai pers. comm. 2014). The species’s use of recently abandoned or current shifting agriculture and monoculture plantations remains unknown, given the low survey effort in them. The species is strictly nocturnal and thought to be primarily solitary and ground-dwelling. Its partly webbed feet and hair between its footpads have been speculated to be adaptations towards foraging among mossy streams and boulders (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985); recent studies appear to corroborate this with the species's&#160;presence being positively correlated with presence of moss and number of boulders (J. Mathai pers. comm. 2014). Yasuma (2004) speculated that the species dens in holes between rocks and/or tree roots.&#160;It is not known what the species eats in the wild. Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) suggested it forages for small mammals whereas Davis (1958) speculated that it primarily consumes arthropods. Based on captive observations of the single individual ever caught alive, Yasuma (2004) suggested that the species forages on small fish, shrimps, crabs, and frogs near streams, or catches insects and other animals on mossy ground.","Because of the few records of Hose’s Civet and the paucity of research on the species, it is difficult to characterise even the current major threats, let alone minor and future ones. Based on the GIS exercise as part of this assessment (see sections on 'Range description' and 'Population' for details of this GIS exercise), it was predicted that between 2000 and 2010, only around 3-7% of forests in potentially suitable land-cover classes&#160;were lost. This indicates that deforestation rates within the Bornean central highlands have been low. Although this may be the case, it is projected that higher-elevation forests will come under increasing pressure from the logging industry because much of the lowland forest has already been logged, and also from the expansion of oil palm plantations to higher elevations facilitated by climatic warming and improved cultivars (Brodie in review). Moreover, the construction of several massive hydro-electric dams in central Borneo will cause the displacement of several thousand indigenous people; this, in turn, is predicted to increase levels of unsustainable and indiscriminate hunting practices such as the use of nets and snares to which many largely ground-dwelling species, plausibly including&#160;Hose’s Civet, are highly susceptible. Human displacement caused by hydroelectric dams is also projected to increase shifting agriculture at higher elevations and this, coupled with habitat loss through infrastructure development linked to the dams, logging and oil palm expansion, poses the threat of a fragmented landscape through which habitat specialists such as Hose’s Civet might be less able to disperse than at present, leading to increasingly isolated populations. Based on a combination of such threats, a decline of more than 10% in the Hose’s Civet population is very likely over the next 15 years (approximately three generations).","There is almost no information on population estimates and breeding status of Hose’s Civet. It has rarely been detected; with the increasing number of studies in Borneo using camera-traps, encounter rates remain very low. The paucity of research on the species prevents reliable quantitative estimates. The wide altitudinal spread of records suggest that the species ought to be common in collections; the fact that it is not suggests very strongly that something renders it very localised, very low density, or both. Moreover, the large survey effort by capable researchers using appropriate techniques in areas that seemingly ought to hold the species (forest within the documented altitudinal and geographic range), still yield low encounter rates (if at all), further corroborating the hypothesis of a highly patchy distribution and low density. Unlike other civets, this species is apparently seldom encountered by native hunters. Again, this gives credence to the hypothesis of patchy distribution and low density, although other explanations are possible such as, until recently, local hunters not venturing far from their villages or high into the mountains when hunting.<br/><br/>As part of this assessment, a GIS exercise applying data from the Borneo Carnivore Symposium (June 2011), for which a habitat suitability analysis (incorporating a MaxEnt analysis and a respondent opinion assessment) was conducted (Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep.), estimated about 28,000 km² of broadly suitable habitat for Hose’s Civet, restricted to the higher-elevation forests of interior Borneo. Assuming that about two-thirds of the population are mature individuals, this would give a total of roughly 19,000 mature individuals if the population density is taken at 1 individual per km². For a ground-dwelling small carnivore with very low encounter rates, this density is likely to be much at the higher end (see Colón 2002 for a study on the much more frequently encountered Malay Civet <em>Viverra tangalunga</em> in Borneo). Hence, it is likely that the overall density in this 28,000 km² area is 0.5 individuals per km² (or less), giving a population size of less than 10,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The cryptic and elusive Hose's Civet is endemic to Borneo. It has been found in Brunei Darussalam, Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo – one record only; photographically validated; Samejima and Semiadi 2012) and Sabah and Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo). Records suggest it has a highly restricted and patchy distribution within the higher-elevation forests of interior Borneo, with occasional records at lower altitudes (Jennings <em>et al</em>. 2013, Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep.). It appears to exhibit little habitat plasticity with records mainly in natural forest (e.g., Yasuma 2004; Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005; Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010a,b; Brodie and Giordano 2010; Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2011) and rarely in logged-over forest (Samejima and Semiadi 2012, J. Mathai pers. comm. 2014); the species' use of recently abandoned or current shifting agriculture and monoculture plantations remains unknown, given the low survey effort in them. The full elevational range of existing records extends from 325 m (Samejima and Semiadi 2012) to 1,700 m a.s.l. (Dinets 2003). Most of the population may occur above 800 m a.s.l., based on the paucity of lower records despite high relevant survey effort there.<br/><br/>In Brunei, the species has been recorded in Ulu Temburung National Park at 450 m and 1,500 m a.s.l. (Francis 2002, Yasuma 2004). This, the largest protected area in the country, comprises lowland, upland and montane forest and is the site of the only live capture anywhere in its world range by 2014 (Yasuma 2004). Brunei remains poorly surveyed and Hose’s Civet should not at present be assumed to be restricted in the country to Ulu Temburung National Park.&#160;As of mid-2014, the only record from Indonesian Borneo has been from a recently logged (8 years previously) secondary forest in the Schwaner Mountains, Central Kalimantan (Samejima and Semiadi 2012), in 2011 at 325 m a.s.l. which is, as of late 2014, the lowest elevation recorded&#160;for&#160;the species.<br/><br/>The species has been recorded from a few localities in Sarawak, mainly in the interior north. The holotype is from Mount Dulit in north-eastern Sarawak, collected in 1891 at 1,200 m a.s.l. (Van Rompaey and Azlan 2004). The largest series of collected specimens - four - was from the Kelabit Highlands in northern Sarawak (Davis 1958). A logging concession in the nearby Upper Baram is one of the few places where the species has been among the most commonly camera-trapped small carnivores (Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010a,b, in prep.) although many of these detections were from pockets of natural forest within the logging concession. The species has also recently been camera-trapped in Pulong Tau National Park and the proposed protected area of Hose Mountains (Brodie <em>et al</em>. in prep).<br/><br/>In Sabah, the species has been recorded from&#160;several&#160;protected areas: Kinabalu Park (Dinets 2003, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005); Crocker Range National Park (A.J. Hearn pers. comm. 2014); Tawau Hills National Park (A.J. Hearn pers. comm. 2014); and the Maliau Basin-Imbak Canyon Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2010, Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2011). It has also recently been camera-trapped in the Ulu Padas Forest Reserve (Brodie <em>et al</em>. in prep.). Most of these records are from primary forests at elevations between 500 and 1,500 m a.s.l.<br/><br/>As part of this assessment, a GIS exercise applied data from the Borneo Carnivore Symposium (June 2011) for which a habitat suitability analysis (incorporating a MaxEnt analysis and a respondent opinion assessment) was conducted (Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep.). This analysis estimated about 28,000 km² of broadly suitable habitat for Hose’s Civet, restricted to the higher-elevation forests of interior Borneo. To estimate the potential habitat loss, the Miettinen (2011) dataset of land-cover change for the years 2000-2010 was used. This analysis estimated that there had been&#160;a loss in suitable land-cover classes of 3-7% (1,100 km² to 8,300 km²) during this period.",Hose's&#160;Civet is taken as part of general mammal hunting for food across its range. There is no evidence of specific targeting by hunters.,Terrestrial,"Hose’s Civet is not a CITES-listed species (CITES 2014), presumably because it is unlikely to feature in international trade owing to its rarity and rather plain pelage (Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep). The species was listed as ‘threatened’ in the <em>I</em><em>UCN Action Plan for the Conservation of Mustelids and Viverrids</em> as it was (then) known from only 15 specimens worldwide and there were, at that point, no direct sighting records of a live, wild individual (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989). It is found in some protected areas within its range such as Pulong Tau National Park in Sarawak (Brodie <em>et al</em>. in prep.), Ulu Temburong National Park in Brunei (Yasuma 2004), Kinabalu Park (Dinets 2003, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005), Crocker Range National Park (A.J. Hearn pers. comm. 2014), Tawau Hills National Park (A.J. Hearn pers. comm. 2014), and the Maliau Basin-Imbak Canyon Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2010, Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2011) in Sabah. However, it is not known how large any of these populations may be or whether any of them are viable populations. Possible strongholds where conservation efforts should arguably be concentrated have been identified (Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep.) although more research is required to ascertain population&#160;status&#160;in these areas to verify this. In Malaysian Borneo, the species is listed as ‘Protected’ under the Sarawak Wild Life Protection Ordinance (1998) and the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment (1997), implying limited protection. However, the species is not listed as a protected animal in Brunei under the Brunei Wild Life Protection Act (1978) nor Indonesian Borneo under the Appendix of the Government of Republic of Indonesia Regulation No. 7 (1999).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45198901,12592,Macrogalidia musschenbroekii,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd; C1,2015,2015-04-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Sulawesi Civet is listed as Vulnerable because of its&#160;presumed&#160;population decline rate and small population. A coarse estimate of forest loss on&#160;Sulawesi&#160;for the period 2000-2010 combined with evidence (from one site) that the species depends on forest indicates a decline in habitat of about 26% over a three-generation period, taken as 15 years (see ‘Population’); within surviving habitat, population losses, if any, from hunting and killing in retaliation for taking small livestock will be additional. Even though mammal hunting is pervasive in at least some parts of the species' range, there is no evidence that this species is declining through hunting for consumption (directly or as bycatch). However, the numbers killed in retribution for predation on small livestock may be significant, particularly with the extensive forest conversion and fragmentation meaning that a much higher proportion of the population is now in striking range of human habitation (animals will move at least 5 km from forest and take livestock). This factor is assumed to give an overall loss over the last three generations exceeding 30%. These rates are likely to continue for the next three generations.<br/><br/>It is also plausible that&#160;Sulawesi Civet is, overall, rare.&#160;About 40,000 km² of primary forest were recently assessed to persist on Sulawesi. Assuming Wemmer and Watling’s (1986) finding in Lore Lindu National Park of a strong association with old-growth forest applies across the species’s range, and that the evidence of absence from even some old-growth forest, e.g., Tangkoko, and the general rarity of records indicates a patchy distribution, the population is likely to be small enough for categorisation as Vulnerable under criterion C too. Specifically, if only half the ‘primary’ forest is occupied, at a density of one animal per 1.5 km², this gives a total population of 13,300 animals, of which perhaps about two-thirds (9,000) would be mature individuals. Indeed, it is even plausible that the number of mature individuals might be below the threshold for Endangered (2,500): this would be so if only a quarter of the forest were occupied, and at a density of one animal per 3 km², with one-third of the population not being mature individuals. There is no evidence of such low densities in occupied habitat or of such a low proportion of habitat being occupied, but this scenario is not inconceivable.<br/><br/>Pending further information, the existing Vulnerable categorisation is maintained. A better understanding of the&#160;species' conservation status and needs is a high priority.","The ecology of Sulawesi Civet is known mostly from one study in Lore Lindu. Information from elsewhere is insufficient to tell whether its natural history varies across the island. It has been recorded in lowland forest, lower and upper montane forest, grasslands and near farms (Wemmer and Watling 1986, Musser and Dagosto 1987, Lee <em>et al.</em> 2003), and indeed Lee <em>et al</em>. (2003) stated that “this civet is not a specialist, neither restricted by elevation nor disturbance regime”. While it clearly uses a wide elevation range, the implication that populations can persist in heavily degraded areas lacks any supporting information and is at variance with the opinion of Wemmer and Watling (1986), who considered it strongly associated with primary forest, while accepting that animals sometimes wandered outside (at least 5 km from forest), perhaps specifically to prey on livestock.<br/><br/>Wemmer and Watling (1986) proposed that it takes about 5-10 days for an animal to cover its home range, predicted this range to be ‘large’, and considered&#160;that the species does not preferentially use trails within the forest, but goes anywhere (this latter may have ramifications for interpreting unbaited camera-trap encounter rates).<br/><br/>This species is perhaps a specialist consumer of <em>Arenga </em>palm fruit, but eats a wide variety of other material: the percentage occurrence of food items in 47 faeces found in the Lore Lindu Reserve was: 47% rodents, 45% <em>Arenga </em>palm fruit, 15% <em>Pandanus</em> palm fruit, 4% Sulawesi Dwarf Cuscus (<em>Stigocuscus celebensus</em>), 2% birds, 2% unidentified fruit, and 2% grass (Wemmer and Watling 1986). It appears to be nocturnal and solitary (Wemmer and Watling 1986, Lee <em>et al</em>. 2003). Wemmer and Watling (1986) observed its great agility (in captivity) and characterised it as strongly arboreal. However, Wemmer and Watling (1986) made clear that they were finding ground-level tracks in unbaited circumstances, and concluded it came to ground to forage more often than do species like Binturong (<em>Arctictis binturong</em>) and African Palm-civet (<em>Nandinia binotata</em>).","Sulawesi Civet can safely be stated to be threatened by forest loss, degradation and fragmentation, and perhaps by lethal control as a predator of livestock. Hunting and the effects of introduced carnivores are less likely to be driving population declines. The species was considered forest-dependent by Wemmer and Watling (1986), and no subsequent information contradicts this. Ongoing fragmentation of forest can be assumed to expose an ever-higher proportion of the population to retaliatory killing; it is a documented predator of livestock, with three of six conflicts investigated by Wemmer and Watling (1986) resulting in lethal control of the&#160;Sulawesi&#160;Civet in question.<br/><br/>In North&#160;Sulawesi, the impact of hunting on this species is probably low. No information was traced for other parts&#160;of the island,&#160;and given that ethnic groups&#160;may differ in their consumption patterns, the&#160;situation in North&#160;Sulawesi&#160;should not be assumed to hold for the rest of the island. Wemmer and Watling (1986) found no evidence around Lore Lindu that Sulawesi Civet is specifically sought for food, and plenty of circumstantial evidence that it is not. Various more recent market trade and village consumption surveys in North Sulawesi corroborate this. In 2011 surveys of wildlife meat in north Sulawesi markets by Selamatkan Yaki, a programme through Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust (UK), did not find the species (T.A.C. Loffeld pers. comm. 2015). Two years of extensive trade surveys in North Sulawesi province in 2001–2003 detected nearly 7,000 wild mammals&#160;in road blockades of which fewer than 100 were (in total) small bats (Chiroptera), babirusas <em>Babyrousa</em>, macaques&#160;<em>Macaca</em>, cuscuses&#160;<em>Phalanger</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>S</em><em>tigocu</em><em>scu</em><em>s</em>, and civets, and almost 100,000 wild mammals in markets, of which only 1.2% were (in total) cuscuses, squirrels (Sciuridae), babirusas, macaques, tarsiers <em>Tar</em><em>s</em><em>iu</em><em>s</em>, civets, anoas&#160;<em>Bubalu</em><em>s</em>, and deer <em>Ru</em><em>sa timoren</em><em>si</em><em>s</em>&#160;(Lee <em>et al</em>. 2005). Similar surveys continued, and up to 2006 there seems to have been no record of Sulawesi Civet in any year (Wildlife Conservation Society per M. Leggett pers. comm. 2015). However, in 2007 one Sulawesi Civet was reported in a truck-load of wildlife meat inspected in Maelang, North Sulawesi province; the consignment was confiscated and buried (J. Tasarin pers.comm. 2015). In 2003,&#160;S.&#160;Siwu&#160;(pers. comm. 2015)&#160;photographed parts (including head and paws) of a&#160;Sulawesi Civet in Maeleng market.&#160;Based on almost continuous market surveys in Tomohon and Langowan from 2000 to 2014, L. Clayton (pers. comm. 2015) considers it to be, at most, rarely traded.<br/><br/>The Minahasans do not usually seek the species for consumption; their order of preferred wildlife meat is, in general, Sulawesi Wild Pig (<em>Sus celebensis</em>), fruit bats (Megachiroptera), white tailed forest rats (<em>Rattu</em><em>s</em> spp.), Reticulated Python (<em>Python reticulatus</em>),&#160;macaques, Water Monitor (<em>Varanu</em><em>s&#160;</em><em>salvator</em>), cuscuses, and anoas. Less preferred species such as babirusas, civets, Maleo (<em>Macrocephalon maleo</em>) (meat) or tarsiers, if they are trapped or shot by hunters, may be sent opportunistically to market (J. Tasarin pers. comm. 2015). This is corroborated by intensive surveys of village consumption by the Selamatkan Yaki programme in 2011–2015. These found only four respondents stating that they had eaten or kept ‘musang’ (which could also refer to Malay Civet (<em>Viverra tangalunga</em>), or, if present, Common Palm Civet (<em>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus</em>)) as a pet. Although if another name were used for Sulawesi Civet, records of consumption would not have been picked up, this suggests a low incidence of in-village consumption in the surveyed areas. In 2011–2012, villages were spread through North Sulawesi:&#160;Agotey (Pineleng), Kumu (Tombariri), Wawona (Tatapaan), Paslaten (Tomohon Timur), Tinoor (Tomohon Utara), Rurukan (Tomohon Timur), Pangolombian (Tomohon Selatan), Molas (Bunaken), Kawatak (Langowan Selatan), Kasawari (Aertembaga), Airmadidi (Airmadidi), Pinilih (Dimembe), Dua Sudara (Ranowulu), Kombot (Pinolosian), Lolak (Lolak), Tudo Aog (Boloang), Liberia (Modayag), Sinsingon (Passi Timur) and Tondey (Motoling Barat); in each village 40 respondents were interviewed, resulting in 760 respondents. In 2013, there were 781 respondents in Tomohon and Langowan, in 2014, 1,135 in Airmadidi and Bitung, and in 2015, 764 in Tomohon and Langowan. No respondents mentioned that the eating of any animal was culturally avoided (T.A.C. Loffeld, H. Hilser and V. Melfi pers. comm. 2015). In these areas, most hunting is believed to be with ground snares, nets and dogs (J. Tasarin pers. comm. 2015, L. Clayton pers. comm. 2015, T.A.C. Loffeld pers. comm. 2015). Sulawesi Civet is believed to be largely arboreal (Wemmer and Watling 1986) and thus is might be at low risk from these methods. There is considerable arboreal snaring for rats, but the nooses are too small to catch Sulawesi Civet except by a limb; air-gun hunting perhaps would result in most animals taken (J. Tasarin pers. comm 2015).<br/><br/>Live wildlife markets on Java and Bali trade many civets, including those from Indonesian islands other than Java; no Sulawesi Civet has been noted in these surveys (Shepherd 2012, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014, V. Nijman pers. comm. 2015), nor have any come to the Cikananga rescue centre in Java, which has received other Sulawesi species (W. Eggen pers. comm. 2015). There are some ‘civet-lover clubs’ on Sulawesi but whether a significant number of members keep captive Sulawesi Civet has not been established; their internet content does, however, include advice on how to keep it (V. Nijman pers. comm. 2015). If civet-keeping were to rise dramatically in popularity there (as it has on Java;&#160;Nijman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), and this species were to become a sought-after holding, then given the assumed low population of this species, targeted off-take might substantially exacerbate the rate of decline.<br/><br/>Non-native species of civet (Malay Civet and Common Palm Civet) and domestic cats and dogs might threaten&#160;Sulawesi Civet. However, given that it apparently is quite arboreal, none is likely to be a significant predator and the only likely strong competitor might be Common Palm Civet; but this&#160;species&#160;is scarce (probably not in fact naturalised) on Sulawesi (Wemmer and Watling 1986, Veron 2001). Moreover, on Buton island&#160;dogs and cats live in the forest only near villages and roads (Seymour <em>et al</em>. 2010); assuming this is true also for the mainland, they perhaps&#160;have little contact with Sulawesi Civet.","The overall population status of&#160;Sulawesi Civet&#160;is very poorly known. Published records are very scarce (Wemmer <em>et al</em>. 1983, Wemmer and Watling 1986, Lee <em>et al</em>. 2003) and only 28 museum specimens are known (Veron 2001). Unpublished records and reports include: (1) Bakiriang Wildlife Sanctuary, central Sulawesi: a single individual observed by night in 2013; (2) an unconfirmed record from Bantimurung-Bulusaraung National Park in 1993; (3) Feruhumpenai-Matano Nature Reserve; and (4) Karaeng-Lompobattang Protection Forest (P. Wood pers. comm. 2014, Jihad pers. comm. 2014). There are also unconfirmed reports (rare sightings by local people) from a forest near Tomohon, 25 km south of Manado (J. Tasirin pers. comm. 2014) and from the Togian archipelago and Buton island (see the Geographic Range section).<br/><br/>Sulawesi Civet is evidently rare in, or locally absent from,&#160;some areas within its general geographic range. In the well-studied Tangkoko Reserve, it was not found in the only camera-trap survey to date, of about 1,000 camera-trap-nights over 0–1,000 m a.s.l. (J. Brodie pers. comm. 2015). In many years of intensive wildlife watching, Jukber Lambaihang (pers. comm. 2015) has never seen Sulawesi Civet at this site, although he has observed it in Lore Lindu National Park.&#160;Similarly, R. Hutchinson (pers. comm. 2015) has&#160;seen it only in&#160;Lore Lindu NP.&#160;In five full nights of spotlighting on foot on Sulawesi, V. Dinets (pers. comm. 2015) never found the species, and in 3–5 hours of night driving through forest, he had only one record: near Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park, 1–2 km from the park office. In south-east Sulawesi, Lee <em>et al</em>. (2003) found it in three of the five survey areas in which they camera-trapped, suggesting that it could be relatively widespread there, although they had only one record at each. Their encounter rate has been considered to suggest that the species is scarce in this part of the island, but it is difficult to make any&#160;deduction about abundance from this information. Lee <em>et al</em>. (2003) reported that they set their camera-traps 1–1.5 m above the ground: this is so much higher than is ideal for surveying small carnivores that it is likely to have depressed encounter rates, and in the same programme, they photographed Malay Civet only once, and Common Palm Civet not at all (I. Hunowu verbally 2008). The low total number of Sulawesi Civet photographs might&#160;simply reflect&#160;the low total effort. This was given as 23,485 hours (= 9,653 + 5,187 + 8,645, in three areas), which equates to 979 camera-trap-nights. Comparison with figures for palm civet camera-trapping in a range of sites across Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008), where camera-traps were set 40–50 cm above ground, and thus more photographs of civets would be expected, gives no support that the results in Lee <em>et al</em>. of ‘only’ three photograph events indicate rarity of Sulawesi Civet. In roughly 27,700 trap-nights in Myanmar, there were 36 photograph events of Common Palm Civet <em>Paradoxurus hermaphoditus</em>, ten of Masked Palm Civet <em>Paguma larvata</em> and none of Small-toothed Palm Civet <em>Arctogalidia trivirgata</em> (which is almost wholly arboreal). For easier comparison, Lee <em>et al</em>. (2003) found Sulawesi Civet at 3.0 events per 1,000 trap-nights, exceeding Myanmar’s figures of 1.3 Common Palm Civet events per 1,000 trap-nights, 0.36 Masked Palm Civet events per 1,000 trap-nights, and 1.6 palm civet events (all species combined) per 1,000 trap-nights. If Sulawesi Civet is more active on the ground than are these palm civets, then a more relevant comparison with Myanmar would be with the ground-dwelling Large Indian Civet <em>Viverra zibetha</em>; Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) recorded this at 4.6 events per 1,000 trap-nights, only at 150% the rate at which Sulawesi Civet was being camera-trapped by Lee <em>et al</em>. (2003). This difference could simply reflect that in the heights at which the two survey programmes set their camera-traps. But in fact all evidence (notably Wemmer and Watling 1986) suggests that Sulawesi Civet is significantly arboreal, meaning that ground-level camera-traps (at least, non-baited ones) might well be less&#160;effective at detecting it than at finding <em>Viverra</em>&#160;civets. Moreover, the exact microhabitats at which camera-traps are set can have huge, though rarely quantified, effects on the frequency with which individual species are photographed. With only three events, the Lee <em>et al</em>. (2003) records do not allow any strong statement of the species’s abundance in this area. The considered opinion of Wemmer and Watling (1986: 8), based upon more field contact with the species than any other Western biologists, was that “in the Lore Lindu Reserve <em>Macrogalidia </em>was common”. Extrapolating this single-site conclusion to the whole island would be rash, but it underlines that there is as yet no real evidence that the species is genuinely rare in the areas where it occurs; nor indeed is there&#160;any that it is not rare. The paucity of records&#160;in trade or villages (see 'Theats')&#160;suggests that the&#160;species might be rare; although its part-aboreality might insulate it&#160;somewhat from the largely ground-operating traps&#160;used in most hunting on the island for animals of this&#160;size-class and above, it evidently&#160;spends&#160;significant time on the ground as&#160;shown by the finding of footprints by Wemmer and Watling (1986) and, perhaps, the camera-trapping of Lee <em>et al</em>. (2003), although it is not&#160;stated in the latter whether lures, which can bring arboreal animals&#160;to the ground, were used. Activity on the ground exposes it to various forms&#160;of trapping (see 'Threats'), and&#160;although in theory possible, it is implausible that bycatch&#160;Sulawesi Civets&#160;were abandoned in the field, it is more likely that few are caught.<br/><br/>There is no direct information on the population trend, but assuming that this species is indeed strongly reliant upon old-growth forest (see Wemmer and Watling (1986)), forest change can be used to suggest what might be the broad trend. According to Abood <em>et al</em>. (2014), Sulawesi lost about 20,000 km² of forest between 2000 and 2010, mostly in areas outside industrial concessions for timber, pulp and paper, oil palm and mining, According to the Ministry of Forestry (2011), Sulawesi had 101,172 km² of forest in 2010, of which 39,151 km² was primary, 61,854 km² secondary, and 167 km² planted forest. A total of 20,000 km² of forest loss between 2000 and 2010 would indicate that there was about 120,000 km² of forest in 2000, and that Sulawesi had lost 17% of its forest in this 10-year period. Assuming that these rates remained similar over a 15-year window (i.e., the last three generations, with one generation taken as five years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013), this indicates a decline in habitat of about 26%. Any losses within remaining habitat will be additional to this; given the level of conflict with livestock around Lore Lindu documented by Wemmer and Watling (1986) and increased fragmentation of Sulawesi’s forests since then, these losses are likely to be driving additional declines (see the Threats section).",Decreasing,"Sulawesi Civet is endemic to Sulawesi. It was previously known only from the north and central parts of the island (Wemmer and Watling 1986), but it is now known to occur also in the island's south-east: individuals were camera-trapped at Rawa Aopa National Park, Tanjung Peropa Wildlife Reserve and Mangolo Recreation Forest (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2003). There are no certain records from islands other than mainland Sulawesi, but a sighting potentially of this species on Kadiriri Island (Brugiere 2012, D. Brugiere pers. comm. 2015) indicates that it might also occur on the Togian archipelago; these islands do support other highly distinct mammals endemic to Sulawesi and adjacent islands, such as babirousas&#160;<em>Babyrousa</em> and black macaques <em>Macaca</em>. Similarly, many of the people living around the forest on Buton Island, off south-east Sulawesi, have a name for a second species of civet (additional to Malay Civet <em>Viverra tangalunga</em>) matching the description of the Sulawesi endemic (Seymour <em>et al</em>. 2010). Sulawesi Civet has not, however, been found in two years of camera-trapping on the island&#160;(3,000–4,000 camera-trap-nights over 100–900 m a.s.l.; J. Brodie <em>in litt</em>. 2015), and there is no even provisional sighting in over 20 years of multi-disciplinary biological fieldwork on the island (including investigations of the animals kept in homes and traded in markets; T. Martin&#160;pers. comm. 2015, N. Priston pers. comm. 2015, H. Hilser pers. comm. 2015). These remarks should be seen in the context of how this species has previously been overlooked; for example, the capable collector H.C. Raven collected intensively in 1915–1918 without finding the species, including much effort in what is now Lore Lindu National Park, an area in which the species was found to be ""common"" 60 years later (Wemmer and Watling 1986); it is unlikely to have colonised during the interim. Even villagers living close to&#160;the species&#160;are often not specifically aware of its existence (Wemmer and Watling 1986). Thus, lack of village familiarity should not be seen as an indication that it is not in any given area.<br/><br/>Skeletal remains in the Bola Batoe and Tjadang caves in south-west Sulawesi indicate a former wider distribution (Hooijer 1950); it should not be excluded that the species awaits rediscovery in that part of the island.<br/><br/>Sulawesi Civet is known to&#160;occur from sea-level up to 2,600 m (Wemmer and Watling 1986).","There is no evidence of&#160;significant use of this&#160;species, although those individuals taken in the process of hunting other&#160;species are likely to be consumed domestically or, exceptionally, traded (see the Threats section).",Terrestrial,"Sulawesi Civet is known from several protected areas including Rawa Aopa National Park, Tanjung Peropa Wildlife Reserve, Mangolo Recreation Forest, Lore Lindu National Park (NP), and Bogani Nani Wartabone NP (Wemmer and Watling 1986, Lee <em>et al</em>. 2003, V. Dinets pers. comm. 2015). This species is totally protected in Indonesia (Shepherd 2008).<br/><br/>Understanding of the conservation status of many Asian small carnivores&#160;has advanced greatly&#160;since the mid 1990s with the widespread use of camera-trapping. This&#160;camera-trapping has, however, rarely been targeted at&#160;small carnivores: it often focuses on&#160;big cats&#160;<em>Panthera&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>Neofelis</em>, Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>), and other high-profile species.&#160;None of these inhabit&#160;Sulawesi; consequently, camera-trapping&#160;has been rather limited on the island, and&#160;Sulawesi Civet remains very poorly known. Nonetheless, various large mammals of high conservation concern on Sulawesi (babirusas <em>Babyrousa</em>, endemic macaques <em>Macaca</em>, and anoas <em>Bubalus</em>) receive some level of conservation research and intervention; camera-trapping and activities concerning these genera should be encouraged to seek and collate records of the endemic civet to allow a more informed assessment of its conservation needs.<br/><br/>Maintaining the habitat integrity of the forest protected area network of Sulawesi is probably the most important conservation intervention for this species. More precise recommendations for intervention require further investigation before formulation.

This lack of records despite these surveys indicates that its population, if extant at all, is likely to number fewer than 250 mature individuals, with no subpopulation greater than 50 individuals. A continuing decline is inferred from the lack of any recent records (Nandini and Mudappa 2010). Its distribution and ecology are effectively unknown, because there are no reliable documented records, ever, of the species in the wild (Nandini and Mudappa 2010). The species is known only from eight specimens collected over a century ago and four more recently, with the last in 1989 (Nandini and Mudappa 2010).","There is no reliable information about Malabar Civet's habitat use or other aspects of its ecology. The several descriptions of habitat use are speculative or based in whole or part on confusion with other species. It seems that it once inhabited lowland forests, lowland swamp and riparian forests in the coastal plain districts of the Western Ghats. Village reports suggested occurrence in thickets in cashew plantations and in highly degraded lowland forests in northern Kerala (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). It could possibly occur in lowland riparian forests in the coastal plain districts (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Based on the natural history of congeners, the species is probably nocturnal, ground-dwelling and readily camera-trapped when present.<br/> <br/> Natural forests have completely disappeared from the coastal Western Ghats. Present vegetation is secondary in origin (Champion and Seth 1968), and is mostly plantations (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Of these, cashew plantations are the least disturbed, because they are not weeded, providing a dense understorey of shrubs and grasses for this ground-living species to take refuge in (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). The pelt records from 1980-1990 were in the region of river valleys, suggesting a possible association with shallow water courses (Ashraf <em>et al</em>, 1993). The closely related Large-spotted Civet is strongly associated with the forested level lowlands (e.g., Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014); whether this is also true of Malabar Civet, which occurs within a rather different small carnivore community (notably, no other species of <em>Viverra</em>&#160;overlaps with it) is unknown.","Assuming habitat use similar to that of&#160;Large-spotted Civet,&#160;Malabar Civet&#160;is likely to have undergone a massive<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;decline<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;a century ago because of extensive conversion&#160;of forest to agriculture.&#160;Coastal plain forest was never extensive in&#160;its presumed range&#160;because the Western Ghats hill range run quite close to the coast along its&#160;length.&#160;Natural forests have completely disappeared from the coastal Western Ghats (Champion and Seth 1968).&#160;Land-use and habitat changes have not been too drastic in the last century within the assumed distribution range of the Malabar Civet.&#160;The records late in this period, if they were of wild animals, therefore suggest an ability to persist in today's habitat matrix, specifically in deforested areas and/or forest above the plains. In either case, many areas of potentially suitable habitat persist. Thus, habitat factors alone are unlikely to have been an unlikely driver of<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;of its present extreme rarity.&#160;There may be significant loss of natural and semi-natural habitat over the next decade with many hydro-power projects being proposed in the region. Cashew plantations, which might hold most of the surviving populations of this species, are threatened by large-scale clearance (Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993).&#160;<br/> <br/> The use of civet-musk is said to have been widespread within this&#160;species's range&#160;during 1965-1970 (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the past, this species might have been used to collect civet oil, although there are no records to authenticate this claim. Small Indian Civet is still illegally ‘farmed’ and kept in captivity to extract civet, and any remaining Malabar Civets are likely to be at risk for the same reason.&#160;<br/><br/>Villagers report retaliatory killings of civets, taken by the interviewers to include Malabar Civet, for raiding poultry – although there is no hard evidence this species is killed for this reason. Once again it might be a case of mistaken identity between Malabar Civet and Small Indian Civet or even Common Palm Civet.&#160;The most recent skins apparently came from outside protected areas, suggesting that hunting is likely to remain a threat to this already rare species (Ashraf <em>et al</em> 1993). There are a few&#160;protected areas&#160;in the lowland of Kerala, but whether the species inhabits them is unknown.&#160;This species is not selectively hunted, but 10 of 22 reports of animals assessed by Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1990) to relate to this species and made&#160;during 1950 to 1990 were caught by dogs;&#160;there is no evidence that these reports actually relate even in part to Malabar Civet. Whatever the proportion of report of retaliatory killing and hunting that truly relate to Malabar Civet, that these practices occur in the species's presumed range means that they are likely to threaten any remaining&#160;Malabar Civets.</span>","The population status is unknown but the lack of any even possible record since the advent of widespread camera-trapping suggests that very few animals, at most, persist. Three recent attempts to find the species failed (Jayson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/> <br/> This species was formerly believed to be very common in the districts of Malabar and Travancore in southwest India, based on Jerdon (1874). However, Nandini and Mudappa (2010) concluded that&#160;Jerdon’s statements were a case of misidentification of the more common (even now) Small Indian Civet, supporting Pocock’s (1933) doubts about Jerdon’s report. But by the late 1960s it was thought to be near extinction. No sighting was claimed until 1987; then, and subsequently, there have been no confirmed records of wild or captive animals: only equivocal sightings&#160;(without any supporting evidence to confirm the species identification)&#160;and dead animals plausibly from captivity (Nandini and Mudappa 2010).",Decreasing,"Malabar Civet is believed to be endemic to the Western Ghats of&#160;southern&#160;India. All records lack precise locality (historical&#160;specimens all came from zoo animals with no information on original&#160;source)&#160;and most have little or no information on origin. Taken together they suggest a distribution in the lowlands from Kanyakumari in the extreme south north to Wayanad, Coorg, and Honnavar in Karnataka (Pocock 1933, 1939, Corbet and Hill 1992, Nandini and Mudappa 2010). There are only two reports of its occurrence in the higher elevations (over 600 m) of the Western Ghats, in the High Wavy Mountains (Hutton 1949) and at Kudremukh (Karanth 1986). The former is very likely to be in error and the latter was&#160;based on a single-observer sight-record left unidentified for some years&#160;(Nandini and Mudappa 2010). By the late 1960s, the&#160;species&#160;was thought to be near extinction. In the decades until the late 1980s, there were only two possible records, from Kudremukh in Karnataka (Karanth 1986) and from&#160;Tiruvella in Kerala (Kurup 1989); both lack objectively verifiable evidence.&#160;Rai and Kumar (1993) reported possible occurrence in the&#160;state of&#160;Karnataka based on the sighting by Karanth (1986) and unsubstantiated interviews with local hunters.&#160;In the late 1980s, skins of recently killed Malabar Civets were obtained in Elayur, in the lowland Western Ghats, in Malappuram district, Kerala (Kurup 1989) and near Nilambur, northern Kerala (Ahsraf <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993), although&#160;these&#160;seem subsequently to have been lost.","The use of civet-musk is said to have been widespread within this&#160;species's range&#160;during 1965-1970 (Ashraf&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993).

This species is not known to occur in any protected area and the declaration of large new protected areas in its range is unlikely because of the dense human populations (Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 1993). Ashraf <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. (1993) recommended the following conservation actions for this species: captive breeding (with the possibility of reintroduction if suitable undisturbed areas are identified), field surveys (to investigate whether this species occurs in protected areas) and ecological studies (to determine the threats to this species). An urgent conservation action plan is needed. Given that recently it has been not possible to find the species at all, the option of captive breeding is not currently practical. Reintroduction, assuming that some environmental threats have dissipated the populations, it would need considerable amount of work to nullify those threats having firstly established what they are. Field survey should be continued, although many in the last decade have not yielded any positive results (Jayson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Rao <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ashraf <em>et al</em>. 2009). As noted by Nandini and Mudappa (2010) in a detailed review of the knowledge of the Malabar Civet, none of the historical specimens have reliable provenance; and even for the more recent ones it is fairly vague: not one has&#160;a precise wild locality of origin. It therefore is imperative to assess the status of the specimens&#160;in various museums and collections using advanced techniques of molecular genetics. This should consider whether the species is in fact a valid taxon native to India, or an incidental result of the wide trans-shipment of various civet species that occurred around the Indian Ocean counties for many centuries.",Indomalayan,none certain,true,false,Global
45206655,41610,Herpestes brachyurus,Near Threatened,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Short-tailed Mongoose is listed as Near Threatened&#160;because&#160;in some parts of its range it is probably in a steep habitat-driven decline. Its global range and inferred population are both well in excess of the thresholds that would warrant even Near Threatened. The overall decline rate is not known, and needs to be considered separately for each land-mass. In Borneo it is inferred, from the species's&#160;use of a wide altitudinal range and of heavily modified habitats (at least, when some native forest remains&#160;nearby), to be way below the 25% per three generations (taken as about 13 years, following Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) that would indicate a Near Threatened categorisation. The peninsular Malaysia population might well be declining sufficiently fast&#160;to warrant a regional threat category, but has plausibly, in the last 13 years, exited its period of steepest decline. Whereas on Sumatra, conversion rates of forest in the lowlands and low hills (which are provisionally assumed to hold the bulk of the island's population) were very high during 2001-2014 and are expected to remain so for the subsequent three generations. An examination of loss of&#160;superficially suitable habitat (forest below 500 m in&#160;peninsular Malaysia and in Sumatra, with&#160;forest below 1,500 m in Borneo) between 2000 and 2010 based on information from&#160;Miettinen <em>et al</em>. (2011)&#160;suggests an overall habitat loss of 21% in the 10-year period (27% in&#160;13 years)&#160;indicating a categorisation of Near Threatened based on past decline rates which are expected to continue into the&#160;future.","Although little remains known on this species' natural history, it now seems very likely that basic habitat-use differs between land-masses.<br/><br/>On Borneo it occurs in many habitats, including highly degraded and fragmented areas such as gardens and suburbs, up to&#160;1,500 m (Payne&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1985, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. in prep., J. Ross and A.J. Hearn pers. comm. 2014).&#160;There seems to be no evidence of extensive use of interior oil palm plantation. In two such plantations in Sabah, it was found in one but not the other; in forest contiguous with the latter it was&#160;found&#160;only very rarely (Sepilok Forest Reserve), forestalling conclusion about its response to oil palm <em>per se</em>. In the former, it was found in plantation only close to the plantation–forest boundary (J. Ross&#160;pers. comm. 2014). Overall, the species on Borneo is perhaps dependent upon native forest but ranges freely into anthropogenic habitats. Further information might modify this conclusion.<br/><br/>By contrast, in peninsular Malaysia all records with habitat detail come from in or directly adjacent to&#160;primary or regenerating&#160;evergreen forest and from below 160 m (Wells 1989,&#160;Jennings <em>et al</em>. 2010). The high survey effort in altitudes above this (both direct observation and camera-trapping in ways successfully finding Crab-eating Mongoose) gives a high confidence in concluding that Short-tailed Mongoose is effectively confined to the extreme lowlands on the peninsula.<br/><br/>Little comparable information on distribution with respect to either habitat condition or altitudinal range has been traced for Sumatra, but&#160;Maddox <em>et al</em>. (2007) did not find the species in oil palm plantations despite 25 camera-trap records from forest in the same landscape and high survey effort in the oil palm&#160;plantation, indicating at least at this site that oil palm is eschewed. A.M. Mobrucker (pers. comm. 2014)&#160;camera-trapped it at 16 stations in the Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape, Central Sumatra, all in the lowlands, in secondary forest and scrub. M. Luskin (pers. comm. 2014) has camera-trapped the species in Leuser Landscape a few times, at 100-260 m a.s.l. On the available evidence, Short-tailed Mongoose habitat-use on Sumatra perhaps resembles that on the peninsula more than that on Borneo.<br/><br/>Five&#160;Short-tailed Mongooses&#160;radio-tracked in Krau Wildlife Reserve, West Malaysia, were diurnal, solitary and territorial. Their home ranges were amid forest (no information is given on trapping effort outside forest, however) from which they ranged somewhat into adjacent plantations within which they used remaining patches and strips of native vegetation. Nine night-time rest sites were recorded for four individuals; all were within lowland forest. A daytime rest site found for a female was situated within a hollow tree log (Jennings&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). There seems to be little comparable information from Borneo or Sumatra, although on Borneo (at least) the species is known to be almost entirely diurnal (J. Ross pers. comm. 2014).&#160;The diet includes invertebrates and small vertebrates (Davis 1962, Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985).","The different habitat use of this 'species' (see 'Taxonomic notes')&#160;between land-masses&#160;requires consideration of threats specific to each land-mass.&#160;There is no evidence that&#160;Short-tailed Mongoose&#160;can survive in plantations or other non-forest habitats remote from native forest in any land-mass. Similarly there is no evidence that it is&#160;hunted (as targeted quarry or as by-catch) in any land-mass at levels high enough to drive declines within remaining suitable habitat. Therefore, forest loss rates are likely to provide a reasonable indicator of population decline rates.<br/><br/>In Borneo the species is geographically and altitudinally widespread, and evidently occurs frequently in degraded and fragmented habitats (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. in prep.). While large-scale deforestation of Borneo in recent decades will have driven large declines in the Bornean population, there is no evidence of major threats within remaining suitable habitat. Some level of retributory killing as a (perceived or actual) predator of small livestock is likely.<br/><br/>In the Malay peninsula, the restriction to altitudes below 160 m and to native forest means that huge declines will have occurred in the latter half of the twentieth century, with the large-scale conversion of lowland forest to plantations. Rates of conversion have recently dropped considerably (because little remains to be converted outside legally protected areas), but the suitability of the present landscape to peninsular Short-tailed Mongoose is difficult to evaluate. There is no meaningful information on patch size required for viable populations, or on dispersal through habitats that cannot maintain the species. Although it is not known to be, it is quite plausible that the peninsular population is in ongoing decline and would warrant conservation attention.<br/><br/>The level of threat on Sumatra is unclear. Lowland forest loss on Sumatra is proceeding extremely rapidly, and if the species is tied to lowland forest there, major declines will be ongoing. However, if it has an altitudinal distribution similar to that in Borneo and if it uses anthropogenic habitats, declines in Sumatra will be much shallower. While an exhaustive presentation of Sumatran records with altitude and habitat condition remains to be conducted, those few records with precise altitude traced for this assessment were all from the lowlands&#160;and, because the species is evidently localized&#160;on the island, even in old-growth forest, it is possible that current rates and patterns of forest loss on Sumatra are causing serious reductions on the island.","Short-tailed Mongoose population status appears to vary between land-mass. In Borneo it is both geographically and ecologically widespread, and at least locally common (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. in prep.) and, particularly bearing in mind habitat use on Borneo&#160;(see 'Habitats and ecology' section), the population is evidently large. In West Malaysia, Wells (1989) traced rather few records, all from lowland forest; a pattern that has not changed. While the species still survives at one of the localities identified by&#160;Wells (1989), Krau Wildlife Reserve (Jennings <em>et al</em>. 2010), several camera-trap surveys (which record the species widely on Borneo;&#160;Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. in prep.) in various other parts of the peninsula have not found it, even though the camera-trapping style successfully found Crab-eating Mongoose <em>Herpestes urva</em> (e.g., Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004, Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013, K.&#160;Kawanishi&#160;pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Short-tailed Mongoose's occurrence on the peninsula is clearly ecologically localized (probably reflecting a restriction to lowland evergreen forest there; see 'Habitats and ecology' section). No detailed collation of Sumatran records exists. Whilst it evidently occurs widely there (Jennings and Veron 2011), it has not been found by camera-trapping in some large areas with high effort (Holden 2006, McCarthy and Fuller 2014, WCS Indonesia Programme pers. comm. 2006), although it has in others (Maddox&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007, A.M. Mobrucker pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>There is no direct information available on the population trend on any land-mass; some inference can be made from habitat trends (see 'Threats' section).",Decreasing,"There are records of Short-tailed Mongoose from Malaysia (both West [peninsular] and East [Borneo]),&#160;Indonesia (Borneo and Sumatra) and&#160;Brunei&#160;(e.g., Wells 1989, Van Rompaey 2000, Belden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jennings and Veron 2011, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. in prep.). Mongooses until recently generally placed within&#160;Short-tailed Mongoose&#160;occur in&#160;the Philippines&#160;(Palawan and Busuanga [Calamian islands]) (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998), but recent genetic and morphological investigations indicate these animals are closer to Collared Mongoose <em>H. semitorquatus</em>&#160;(Veron <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Wozencraft (2005)&#160;stated that&#160;Short-tailed Mongoose occurs in&#160;Singapore; whilst&#160;biogeographically plausible, this might have been based on animals held in the Singapore Zoo (Wells 1989); there are no records or plausible suggestions, historical or recent, of wild occurrence in the country&#160;(Medway 1983, M.A.H. Chua pers. comm. 2013, C.H.S. Low&#160;pers. comm. 2013).&#160;Short-tailed Mongoose&#160;is listed as&#160;also&#160;occurring in Viet Nam by Wozencraft (2005); there seems to be no primary indication of this, and biogeographically its occurrence is unlikely (S.I. Roberton pers. comm. 2006, D.H.A. Willcox&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014). The subspecies&#160;<em>H. b. javanensis</em>&#160;was described from a zoo specimen on Java, Indonesia, but there are no solid field records from the island (Van Rompaey 2000, Jennings and Veron 2011) and given the level of survey, historical and recent, on this island, it is highly unlikely that it is native there.<br/><br/>Wells (1989) drew attention to a mongoose specimen&#160;in the American Museum of Natural History&#160;labelled from&#160;Trang,&#160;Thailand, AMNH M-31597. This specimen has been accepted by some authors as evidence of the&#160;Short-tailed Mongoose’s occurrence in Thailand’s far south, which would not be surprising, given its occurrence in adjacent peninsula Malaysia north to&#160;4 to 5 degrees north (Wells 1989). However, the history of labelling of this specimen is inconsistent, and other implausible localities for other species from the same collector mean more detailed inspection of all relevant documentation is needed before considering this a valid Thai record&#160;(Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Extensive recent camera-trapping in Thailand's far south has not found&#160;Short-tailed Mongoose (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014), although effort (spatial spread and intensity) has not been sufficient to infer thereby the species's absence.&#160;<br/><br/>Across its distribution, it ranges from sea-level up to 1,500 m a.s.l., but altitudinal use differs&#160;between land-masses&#160;(see 'Habitats and ecology').","Short-tailed Mongoose is taken to some extent as part of the general hunting bag, but no targeted harvest is known from any part of its range.",Terrestrial,"Short-tailed Mongoose&#160;is protected in all of Malaysia and Indonesia, but receives little direct conservation attention. This is appropriate on Borneo, but not in West Malaysia. It has been found in many protected areas in Borneo, and several in West Malaysia and Sumatra.&#160;The most urgent conservation needs comprise:<br/><br/>Taxonomic clarification. Short-tailed Mongoose populations of (i) peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra and (ii) Borneo are distinct in mitochondrial DNA by a level suggestive of species divergence, and this is supported by dental differences (Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). If further information shows them to be distinct species, and if the habitat use of the form on Sumatra echoes that in peninsular Malaysia, then the peninsular Malaysia / Sumatra form is a cryptic species that is probably globally threatened (in common with many other peninsula/Sumatran lowland forest obligate mammals and birds).<br/><br/>Habitat-use clarification for Sumatra. The extent to which Sumatran Short-tailed Mongoose uses hill and montane areas, and anthropogenic areas at any altitude, warrants priority assessment, as these attributes have a large effect on how threatened it is on the island.<br/><br/>Site protection in peninsular Malaysia. All evidence suggests that the peninsular Malaysian Short-tailed Mongoose, whatever its taxonomic rank, occupies a narrow and threatened range of habitats. Effective protection of old-growth forest is vital.

45208027,41616,Herpestes semitorquatus,Near Threatened,,2015,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Collared Mongoose is restricted to the islands of Borneo, Sumatra and (dependent upon taxonomic treatment) the Palawan group in the Philippines. Given the scarcity of information on its status, ecological requirements, past declines and level of adaptability to modified habitat, the species was listed as Data Deficient in 2008. In recent years, there is ample evidence suggesting the species is widely distributed throughout Borneo over a wide altitudinal range, occurs in many protected areas, and is tolerant to some degree of habitat modification such as selective logging, but probably does not tolerate deforestation. Thus, forest loss is taken as a baseline surrogate for population trend. Based on a GIS exercise conducted as part of this assessment, about 16% of potential suitable habitat for the species was lost in Borneo between 2000 and 2010 (mainly through unsustainable logging and conversion to monoculture plantations), suggesting that the species is declining on the island at about 22% per three generations (taken as about 14 years),&#160;a rate consistent with listing as Near Threatened. This is expected to continue over the next three generations. There are rather few records&#160;from Sumatra. The GIS exercise estimated a 35% loss of potential suitable habitat in Sumatra between 2000 and 2010, implying a decline of about 49% in three generations which would justify, over three generations, an island-specific Vulnerable listing under Criterion A2c (and on future prospects, A3c and A4c). Based on the rate of habitat loss for the species in Borneo and Sumatra, weighted according to relative area on each (weighted average = 27%), through the threats of unsustainable logging, conversion of natural forest to monoculture plantations, expansion of human settlements and forest fires across its range, a global listing of Near Threatened based on past and future rates of decline is justified. There are two further complications in assessing this species. It has been suggested that the Sumatran population might have been introduced, in which case it would be irrelevant to the categorisation. It has also been suggested that the mongooses of the Philippines, previously considered conspecific with Short-tailed Mongoose <em>Herpestes brachyurus</em>, are better placed within Collared Mongoose (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2015). Even so, the percentage of the global population on Palawan is likely to be so small that it will not affect this species’ assessment under criterion A.","The paucity of research on Collared Mongoose means little is known about its habitat preference and ecology. On Borneo, this species has been recorded in a variety of habitats including primary and logged lowland mixed dipterocarp forest (Wells <em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010), high-elevation forest (Davis 1958, J. Ross pers. comm. 2014), burnt forest (Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010ab, J. Mathai&#160;pers. comm. 2014) and very occasionally in peat swamp forest (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010) (although not in mangrove forest), mixed secondary forest-acacia plantation mosaics (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007) and mixed mature <em>Albizzia</em>-cacao plantation (Stuebing and Gasis 1989). Hence, this species exhibits some tolerance to disturbed/modified habitat although the preference may be undisturbed forest (A. Wilting pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The species’ use of recently abandoned or current shifting agriculture and oil palm plantations remains unknown, given the low survey effort in them. The full elevational range of records from Borneo extends from 10 m asl (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010) to 1,400 m asl (J. Ross pers. comm. 2014), although it is thought to be more common between 100 and 500 m asl on Malaysian Borneo (J. Ross pers. comm. 2014; J. Mathai&#160;pers. comm. 2014); Jennings and Veron (2011) found most records of the few they traced to be at 300–600 m asl. In Sumatra, most of the rather few records are from below 300 m asl, from&#160;both&#160;primary and logged forest (e.g., Holden and Meijaard 2012, P.H. Pratje and A.M. Moβbrucker pers. comm. 2014), with one each at 666 m asl (Pusparini and Sibarani 2014) and at 915 m asl (G. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2015). Holden and Meijaard (2012) pointed out that all altitude records on Sumatra&#160;then known to them came from below 300 m asl; if this reflected the species' overall altitudinal distribution on the island, it would make it highly threatened there by ongoing forest clearance. However, the subsequent records at higher altitude indicate that it is not confined to the lowlands. But it does seem to be detected&#160;only rarely&#160;even where found (e.g., that in Batang Toru, north Sumatra, was the only record in about 10,000 camera-trap nights; G. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2015). This suggests the Sumatran population is much smaller than the Bornean population.<br/><br/>There are two colour morphs of the species. The warm-brown morph is the more common of the two on Borneo; in Sabah, it comprised 95% of all Collared Mongoose records in one spatially wide-ranging study (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2012). The few Collared Mongoose records from Sumatra have all been of the orange-red morph (Holden and Meijaard 2012,&#160;Pusparini and Sibarani 2014, G. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2015), suggesting a prevalence of this form on the island; it is not known whether the warm-brown morph even occurs on Sumatra. It is likely that the species has been under-recorded both in Borneo and, particularly, Sumatra because of confusion with the similarly coloured Malay Weasel <em>Mustela nudipes</em>&#160;(two of the recent Sumatran records were originally submitted as Malay Weasel; J.W. Duckworth pers comm. 2014)&#160;or with Short-tailed Mongoose; this latter means that the warm-brown morph might exist in Sumatra but have been hitherto overlooked. Collared Mongoose is mainly ground-dwelling (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985). It appears more active during the day when observations peak one to two hours before noon and two to three hours after (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hon <em>et al</em>. in prep.). In Deramakot Forest Reserve, Sabah, the species was recorded mainly during the daytime, dusk and dawn, and - once - at night (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010, Azlan M. pers. comm. 2014). It is usually detected as singletons (Davis 1958, Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007, Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010a) although duos have also been observed (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010, Pusparini and Sibarani 2014, J. Mathai&#160;pers. comm. 2014). Its diet includes small animals (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985) including ants, with&#160;grass&#160;also ingested&#160;(Davis 1958). A respondent opinion assessment conducted during the Borneo Carnivore Symposium (June 2011) to assess, among others, tolerance of species to human population, concluded that areas with human population density greater than 70 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> were not suitable for the species (Hon <em>et al</em>. in prep.). This suggests that unlike Short-tailed Mongoose, Collared Mongoose is not likely to wander into gardens and orchards of villages (and there are indeed few, if any, records from such habitats) and hence, unlikely to be persecuted as a result of direct conflict with humans (Hon <em>et al</em>. in prep.). However, its largely ground-dwelling nature is likely to increase its susceptibility to indiscriminate hunting practices such as nets and snares, which are present in parts of its range (e.g., Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010a).","Deforestation and forest degradation in the lowland and upland forests of Borneo and Sumatra have been extensive through factors including unsustainable logging, conversion of natural forest to monoculture plantations, expansion of human settlements and forest fires. Based on the GIS exercise as part of this assessment (detailed in the section on Range Description), it is predicted that between 2000 and 2010 roughly 16% of potentially suitable land-cover classes for Collared Mongoose were lost in Borneo, and&#160;35% in&#160;Sumatra. Although the species shows some tolerance to modified habitat and can presumably persist in selectively logged forest, there is no evidence to show that it can survive in clear-felled forest and oil palm plantations. This species’ use of secondary forest and higher elevations in Borneo, however, imply that it is not immediately threatened on the island.&#160;Another possible threat is indiscriminate hunting such as the use of snares and nets. Although it is unlikely that the species will wander into gardens and orchards of villages and get into direct conflict with people, suggesting that there will be only little targeted hunting as a pest, it is still exposed to these indiscriminate hunting methods, which occur deep within some forest-blocks in its range, due to its ground-dwelling nature.","Collared Mongoose&#160;populations are particularly poorly known, even compared with other Southeast Asian small carnivores. Although rising camera-trap use has increased the number of localities known to hold the species, it remains difficult to assess population size of unmarked animals based on camera-trap studies alone; the paucity of research on the species also prevents reliable quantitative estimates. This species is widespread in Borneo where it has been detected over a wide altitudinal range in a variety of habitat types. It is thought that in Borneo this species may be more common between elevations of 100 and 500 m asl (J. Ross unpublished data, J. Mathai unpublished data) and may occur less frequently in recently logged forest (J. Brodie pers. comm. 2014) and that, in general, it may occur primarily in less disturbed forest types (A. Wilting pers. comm. 2014). Encounter rates appear to be lower than the regularly camera-trapped and well-documented Short tailed Mongoose <em>Herpestes brachyurus</em> (J. Hon pers. comm. 2014, J. Ross pers. comm. 2014, J. Mathai&#160;pers. comm. 2014) although some camera-trap studies have found the reverse (J. Brodie pers. comm. 2014).&#160;On Sumatra, there is even less information on the population status of the species, at least in part reflecting the lower survey effort there and the lack of a record-collation process comparable to the Borneo Carnivore Symposium. While it is evidently widespread there, available data suggest a much smaller population than that on Borneo.",Decreasing,"Collared Mongoose is restricted to the islands of Borneo, Sumatra and (dependent upon taxonomic arrangement) the Palawan group in the Philippines. On Borneo, it has been detected in Sabah and Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo); it is presumed to occur in Brunei Darussalam although no records have been traced. The full elevational range of records from Borneo extends from 10 m asl (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010) to 1,400 m asl (J. Ross pers. comm. 2014), although on Malaysian Borneo, it is thought to be more common between 100 and 500 m asl (J. Ross unpublished data, J. Mathai unpublished data). It has been recorded in a wide range of habitats including primary and logged lowland mixed dipterocarp forest (Wells <em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010), high-elevation forest (Davis 1958, J. Ross pers. comm. 2014), burnt forest (Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010ab, J. Mathai unpublished data) and occasionally in peat swamp forest (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010) and mixed secondary forest-acacia plantation mosaics (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007). Records from Sumatra are relatively few; they are from localities spread widely across the island; those with altitudes are mainly from lowland forest below 300 m asl, although there are records at 666 m asl (Pusparini and Sibarani 2014) and at 915 m asl (G. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>In Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, Collared Mongoose has been recorded from the protected areas of Mulu National Park and Pulong Tau National Park, the proposed protected area of Hose Mountains (Brodie <em>et al</em>. in prep.), logged forests in Upper Baram (Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010ab) and Bintulu division (J. Hon pers. comm. 2014), burnt forests in Upper Baram (Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010ab) and very occasionally in mixed secondary forest-acacia plantation mosaics (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, this species seems never to have been recorded from the coastal regions, mangroves or peat swamps of Sarawak (Hon <em>et al</em>. in prep.). In Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, this species has been recorded from the protected areas of Kinabalu Park (Wells <em>et al.&#160;</em>2005), Crocker Range National Park (from where comes the highest elevational record to date, at 1,400 m asl; J. Ross pers. comm. 2014), Maliau Basin Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2010) and the Ulu Padas Forest Reserve (Brodie in prep.). Most of these records are from lowland and upland primary forests. This species has also been recorded in the sustainably logged forest of Deramakot Forest Reserve (Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010) and to a lesser extent in the more disturbed forest reserves of Tangkulap and Segaliud Lokan (A. Wilting pers. comm. 2014). In Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) this species has been recorded from scattered but widespread localities including Sanggau, Pontianak, Gunung Palung and Kendawangan, all in West Kalimantan; Kumai in Central Kalimantan; and Balikpapan and Kutai in East Kalimantan (in Medway 1965). Most of these records are from lowland forests. This species has also been recorded from peat swamp forest in Sebangau (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010) and from logged-over secondary forest in the Schwaner Mountains (Samejima and Semiadi 2012), both in Central Kalimantan.<br/><br/>The distribution on Sumatra is less clear. It has even been suggested that this species was perhaps introduced to the island (Veron <em>et al</em>. 2015); the precautionary stance is taken here of considering Sumatra as part of the native range. Two specimens, including the holotype of <em>H. s. uniformis</em>, were collected from West Sumatra adjacent to Gunung Paseman in 1917 (Robinson and Kloss 1919) and Jentink (1894) documented a specimen from Soekadana, South Sumatra. More recently (in 2010), a camera-trap image of the species was recorded in mixed lowland secondary forest with bamboo, in the Harapan Rainforest, Jambi province, east Sumatra (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2012). In 2012, two images of the species were recorded in primary forest in Jantho Wildlife Reserve, central Aceh, north Sumatra (Holden and Meijaard 2012). In 2013, the species was detected in selectively logged (more than 10 years previously) secondary forest in Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape, central Sumatra (P.H. Pratje and A.M. Moβbrucker pers. comm. 2014). In Gunung Leuser Landscape, a single camera-trap station photographed the species twice, three weeks apart, at 666 m asl (Pusparini and Sibarani 2014), and in August 2014, this species was video-recorded by camera-trap in Batang Toru, north Sumatra, at 915 m asl (G. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2015). A further possible record of the species is that of a singleton in a wildlife market in Medan between 1997 and 2001 (Shepherd <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>As part of this assessment, a GIS exercise was conducted applying data from the Borneo Carnivore Symposium (June 2011) for which a habitat suitability analysis (incorporating a MaxEnt analysis and a respondent opinion assessment) was conducted (Hon <em>et al</em>. in prep.). This analysis estimated 265,000-315,000 km<sup>2</sup> of broadly suitable habitat for the species across its range (roughly 250,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Borneo and between 15,000 and 65,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Sumatra, comprising mainly lowland and upland interior forest). To estimate potential habitat loss, the Miettinen <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2011) dataset of land-cover change between 2000 and 2010 was used. This analysis predicted a loss in suitable land-cover classes of roughly 16% in Borneo and of&#160;roughly 35%&#160;in Sumatra.&#160;The Philippine part of the range (Palawan and&#160;Busuanga)&#160;was not covered; it is very small compared with Sumatra and Borneo.","Hunting using various methods, some unselective, occurs across the range of this species and it is no doubt part of the general take. There is no evidence of specific subsistence or trade demand for the species.",Terrestrial,"Collared Mongoose is not a CITES-listed species (CITES 2014) presumably because it is thought unlikely to feature in international trade. It is found in some protected areas within its range such as Pulong Tau National Park and Mulu National Park in Sarawak (Brodie <em>et al</em>. in prep.); Kinabalu Park (Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005), Crocker Range National Park (J. Ross pers. comm. 2014), and the Maliau Basin Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2010) in Sabah; Sabangau National Park in Kalimantan (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010); and Gunung Leuser National Park and Jantho Wildlife Sanctuary in Sumatra (Holden and Meijaard 2012,&#160;Pusparini and Sibarani 2014). However, it is not known how large any of these populations may be or whether any of them are viable. Possible strongholds where conservation efforts should arguably be focused have been identified (Hon <em>et al</em>. in prep.) although population status in these areas remains to be verified.&#160;On Malaysian Borneo, the species is listed as ‘Protected’ under the Sarawak Wild Life Protection Ordinance (1998) and the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment (1997), implying limited protection. However, the species is not listed as a protected animal in Brunei under the Brunei Wild Life Protection Act (1978); neither is it protected in Indonesian Borneo or Sumatra under the Appendix of the Government of Republic of Indonesia Regulation No. 7 (1999).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45209459,70205537,Arctonyx collaris,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Greater Hog Badger is listed as Vulnerable because it is undergoing a hunting-driven population decline. Although rates in the eastern parts&#160;of its range, notably Viet Nam and Lao PDR, on average probably exceed 50% per 15 years (three generations), in large parts of the west and centre they may not even reach rates appropriate for Near Threatened listing (20-25%). Thus, Vulnerable is a global average. There is no reason to expect the decline rates to slow down; in particular, in Myanmar and Cambodia they may be increasing, fuelled by rising affluence and market connectivity. The situation in Cambodia is particularly likely to worsen, with increasing snaring in the eastern provinces that border Viet Nam, a known demand for traditional medicine that might be widespread in rural areas, and ongoing massive clearance of natural habitat for&#160;agro-industrial concessions.&#160;This species should be periodically reassessed for the Red List in light of ongoing threats and uncertainty about range-wide levels of exploitation and the effects these are having on wild populations. The change from the recent Near Threatened listing of <em>Arctonyx collaris&#160;</em>(<em>sensu lato</em>) reflects the taxonomic revision, excluding the populations of Sumatra (where ongoing declines are likely to be negligible) and most of China (where declines are also likely to be lower than average for Greater Hog Badger).","Greater Hog Badger is active throughout the day and night (despite past statements that the genus is nocturnal), ground-dwelling, and not very wary of people (e.g., Pocock 1941, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Helgen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Johnson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Holden and Neang 2009, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Gray <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014b).<br/><br/>Greater Hog Badger occurs down to the extreme lowlands (e.g. Bottom-Soaker National Park, Cambodia, and Kaziranga NP, Assam, India; Royan 2010,&#160;Choudhury 2013) up into the montane zone. The genus has been found up to 3,500 m, but Helgen <em>et al</em>. (2008) traced no record of this species above the relatively modest altitude of 1,500 m. Similarly, and based largely on different sets of records, the highest-altitude records traced for various countries are, Vietnam, 950 m (Roberton 2007); Cambodia, 1,200 m (Holden and Neang 2009); Myanmar, 1,500 m (Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008); and Thailand, 1,016 m (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) . However, as cautioned by&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008), relevant survey effort above 1,500 m has been relatively limited in Myanmar and this is generally true throughout this species's range. Thus, the typical upper altitudinal limit may be found to be somewhat, even considerably, higher, as supported by records in Lao PDR up to nearly 2,300 m (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Choudhury (2013) recorded the genus up to 2,000 m in India, but suggested that the higher-altitude records would be of <em>A. albogularis</em>.<br/><br/>This species occurs across a wide variety of habitats, from heavy forest (both deciduous and evergreen) to the non-forested 'countryside' in at least North-east India; this includes grassland-dominated floodplains such as Kaziranga NP in Assam (Choudhury 2013), where it is one of the most frequently camera-trapped small carnivores (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). There are also records in Bangladesh (assumed to be this species) from tea-gardens and other non-forest habitats (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014). In South-east Asia most records come from forests. The extent of actual and potential occupation of non-forest habitats is unknown: concerted survey in them is rare and off-take of mammals of this size is heavy in much of this species's range. Thus, it is possible&#160;that they would occur widely in non-forest parts of&#160;South-east Asia but are currently excluded by hunting levels.<br/><br/>The diet is poorly known, but Helgen <em>et al</em>. (2008) speculated that it might be partly to strongly vermivorous. This was based on morphological attributes more than on direct dietary information. A strong dependence on worms would neatly explain the pattern of current habitat use in Lao PDR (see 'population') - widespread and still locally common in montane areas but nearly or effectively extirpated from the plains. The country's plains have a harsh dry season, when the ground even within semi-evergreen forest (true evergreen forest is highly localised in the country's lowlands) bakes hard. Finding large numbers of worms under such conditions is presumably difficult and highly demanding of energy. By contrast, in the mountains, forest soil remains damper through the dry season, as a result of cooler temperatures, the sometimes frequent mists and cloud, and the fuller shading of true evergreen forest. Thus, in regions with a harsh dry season, it is reasonable to suppose higher population densities in hills and mountains than in plains and low hills, and a higher resilience to hunting. Such seasonality occurs almost across the species's range excepting most of Vietnam, the Thai-Malay peninsula and locally around massifs large enough to generate their own precipitation. Nonetheless, the species does occur in plains regions of Cambodia and Thailand with dry seasons as or more harsh than in Lao PDR; these areas have&#160;somewhat to much lower hunting pressure.","The heterogeneous pattern of Greater Hog Badger detections and the variation in encounter rates, with the lowest rates in the very heavily hunted countries of Viet Nam and Lao PDR, strongly suggest that the species is in hunting-driven decline. Based on Lao PDR, extirpation, or decline to densities making detections extremely unlikely, seems to have proceeded faster in areas with marked dry seasons than in mountain evergreen forests with a more benign dry season, presumably because starting populations were higher in the latter habitats than in the former (see 'Habitats and ecology'). In Viet Nam, trade-driven hunting rose to industrial levels&#160;a decade or so earlier than in Lao PDR. The low number of camera-trap survey areas in Viet Nam with records of the species indicate that even in the presumed optimal habitats of evergreen forest with only a mild dry season, steep declines and, presumably, extirpation can occur. To date, hunting is at much lower levels in the rest of this species's range. In Lao PDR and Vietnam, much hunting involves metal cable snares set in long lines linked by drift fences, an approach very effective in catching ground-dwelling animals (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014); these snares are, mostly, big enough to secure Greater Hog Badger, because large ungulates are amongst the main targets. The geographical use of such snaring has expanded rapidly over the last 20 years and evidently continues to do so. In much of the species's range, most people entering forest and other natural habitat for whatever reason are accompanied by dogs, many have firearms, and most secure opportunistically any animal of hog badger size-class that they come across. Being partly diurnal, ground-dwelling and not prone to shyness, hog badgers must be particularly at risk to such opportunistic off-take.<br/><br/>The threat which habitat change poses directly to this species is not clear. Indirectly, anything that opens up access to areas previously difficult to enter, in particular which allows vehicular removal of wildlife for sale, exacerbates the hunting threat. Almost all forms of habitat change by people co-occur with increased human access and presence, making the indirect threat from habitat change severe. Based on localities of specific records, it is unlikely that degraded and fragmented natural habitat are inherently unsuitable. These are not widely occupied probably because their higher densities of people, with concomitantly increased likelihood for badgers of lethal incidental encounters with people, prevent this. Outright conversion to entirely artificial habitat (agriculture, settlement and infrastructure) seems more likely to render an area unsuitable for Greater Hog Badger, but even this remains to be proven. Overall, the existence of large tracts of forest in the eastern parts of the species's range with at best low densities of this species indicate that there the chief threat is hunting. While perhaps this is not yet so in parts of the western range, it is increasingly likely to become so there, too.<br/><br/>In Kaziranga National Park, India, numbers die in the periodic inundation of this flood-plain (Choudhury 2013). While formerly such animals might have been able to move safely to higher ground, the increasing fragmentation of natural habitat probably leads to higher mortalities nowadays. Nonetheless, in total these are likely to be insignificant to overall decline rates of the species, and are only a potential threat at the most local of levels.<br/><br/>Hog badger hairs are used in European shaving brush manufacture (Domingo-Roura <em>et al</em>. 2006) but whether this species and wild populations are involved is unclear; the large farmed stock in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010) seems a more likely origin.","Greater Hog Badger populations have not been studied in sufficient detail for densities or trends to be known in any part of the range. Camera-trap encounter rates vary widely across its range: in some it is among the most commonly and widely photographed small carnivores, such as in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Nakai–Nam Theun National Protected Area, Lao PDR (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014), in others it is only rarely found if at all (e.g., modern Viet Nam: Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014: Table SOM3).<br/><br/>At least two factors might produce this heterogeneous recording pattern: (i) natural variation in densities and (ii) human-induced declines proceeding at different rates across the range.&#160;Both are probably important. Past information is rarely precise enough to assess even the coarse population trend directly. However, judging by patterns in better documented hunting-sensitive groups of ground-dwelling mammals (e.g., wild cattle <em>Bo</em><em>s</em>, Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em>, Sambar <em>Rusa unicolor</em>), it would be reasonable to expect human pressure to have depressed densities in Lao PDR and Viet Nam more than in Thailand and Cambodia. And this indeed seems to have happened. Recent camera-trapping has recorded the species in only very few areas in Viet Nam (Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014: Table SOM3, Nguyen T. pers. comm. 2014); Roberton (2007) had already drawn attention to the surprising paucity of records in the country in the 1990s and early 2000s. In Lao PDR, by contrast, all published large-scale camera-trap surveys have found the species (Nam Et–Phou Louey NPA,&#160;Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009; Nakai–Nam Theun NPA, Coudrat&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014; Xe Sap NPA, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b), indicating a healthier status than in Vietnam (as is typical for hunting-sensitive species). The three camera-trap survey areas are likely to hold amongst the least-depleted large mammal faunas in Lao PDR. All are in rugged mountainous areas and indeed all post-1990 Lao records of Hog Badger come from hill and montane areas; there has been none from the plains. This pattern, making due allowance for the distribution of survey effort, was already apparent in the pre-camera-trapping era by 1999, based on direct sightings and records of dead animals or their parts (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). By contrast, this species is commonly recorded at low altitudes, including in plains landscapes, of Thailand and Cambodia (Royan 2010, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a,&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014) and it is common in similar lowland terrain in Kaziranga NP, Assam (Choudhury 2013). This suggests strongly that the absence of recent Lao records from such terrain (where hunting is more efficient than in rugged terrain, meaning that hunting-sensitive species across a range of vertebrate taxa tend to have declined faster there) reflects steep declines (and plausibly widespread extirpation) there.<br/><br/>The occurrence in Myanmar is also patchy without obvious natural explanation (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008); thus far, the pattern of records has not been&#160;compared closely with those of species known to be sensitive to hunting.&#160;In&#160;Cambodia, while it has been recorded relatively commonly in some areas such as parts of the north-east (Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a), in the 'northern plains', west of the Mekong, it was not recorded in 6,000 camera-trap nights of survey in the 2012-2013 and 2013–2014 dry seasons, and the most recent record there seems to have been in 2001 (D. H. A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). Thus area abuts Lao PDR and this apparent range retreat corroborates the suggestion that it has been hunted out from such habitat in Lao PDR.&#160;In Thailand, it seems to remain generally common with no large landscapes of (semi-) natural habitat lacking records (when patterns in survey effort are allowed for) (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In North-east India the genus, although widespread, is generally not common (Choudhury 2013). The population status in its Chinese range (part of Yunnan province) seems poorly known, even at the level of genus.",Decreasing,"Greater Hog Badger occurs from Bangladesh and North-east India east through Myanmar, Thailand and Lao PDR to Vietnam and south to Cambodia and peninsula Thailand; it probably also inhabits Yunnan province, China. Inconclusive reports from the state of Perak, northernmost peninsular Malaysia, have never been confirmed (Helgen<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2008).<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<br/><br/>The range in Bangladesh and North-east India is provisional.&#160;Because&#160;Helgen <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2008)&#160;traced only a few hog badger records from this area&#160;that could be assigned to species, both mainland hog badger species might occur in this area:&#160;so&#160;the many recent records simply&#160;identified as 'hog badger' should not, at this&#160;stage,&#160;be identified to&#160;species&#160;on any presumption of range or habitat. In&#160;North-east India the genus is well distributed all over, with most records taken to be this species including animals observed in Manas NP, north(west) of the Brahmaputra (Choudhury 2013).

In Lao PDR, the palatability of this hog badger varies between ethnic groups, with some groups disliking the taste, whereas groups in parts of the Nam Theun basin (and presumably elsewhere) esteem the species as food (J.P.

45216918,41689,Hemigalus derbyanus,Near Threatened,,2015,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Banded Civet has a large geographic range that includes Borneo, Sumatra (including the Mentawai Islands), Peninsular Malaysia, Peninsular Thailand and Peninsular Myanmar. Across its distribution it occurs over a wide elevation range. Camera-trap surveys, particularly in Malaysian Borneo and Sumatra, have recorded Banded Civet frequently relative to other carnivores. They indicate that it is forest dependent, but can tolerate some habitat disturbance, although there is no evidence that it can survive in agricultural plantations. Continuing loss of natural forest throughout its range makes it reasonable to assume that its population is in decline. The decline rate, driven by loss of habitat compounded by hunting, is difficult to assess and possibly varies much within its range, but it is unlikely that overall it is exceeding 30% (the threshold for Vulnerable) over three generations (taken as 15 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is assumed to be more likely to be around 25%, thereby qualifying the species for Near Threatened (nearly meets criteria A2, A3 and A4).","Banded Civet has been found at elevations up to 1,660 m (WWF-Malaysia pers. comm. 2014). Most records traced by Jennings <em>et al</em>. (2013) were from below 900 m, although this could simply&#160;reflect low survey effort at higher elevations within most of its range. Where effort has been made in high-elevation areas it has&#160;been found to occur commonly well over 900 m. For example, in Crocker Range National Park, Sabah, Malaysia,&#160;it was detected at 75% of camera-trap stations and was the second-most frequently recorded civet; camera-traps in this survey were set between 383 and 1,452 m a.s.l. with 66% of them above 900 m a.s.l. (A.J. Hearn, J. Ross and D.W. Macdonald pers. comm. 2015). At high elevations in the Kelabit Highlands, Sarawak and the Ulu Baram, Sarawak, Banded Civet was the most frequently recorded civet; at high elevations in the Ulu Padas, Sabah, it was the most frequently recorded carnivore (J. Brodie <em>et al</em>. pers. comm. 2014). Banded Civet has been recorded in primary forest (e.g., Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014), logged forest (e.g., Brodie and Giordano 2011, Wilting <em>et al</em>. 2010, Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013) and infrequently from oil palm plantations (A.J. Hearn and J. Ross&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2014; Yue <em>et al</em>. in prep.) and acacia&#160;plantation landscapes&#160;(Belden <em>et al</em>. 2007), but abundance is likely to be lower in modified habitat (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2014a,b). In Sabah it was shown that its proportion of area occupied was greatly affected by the past logging histories and the species was distributed&#160;much more widely&#160;and was recorded&#160;more often in less disturbed, well managed forest reserves than in forests where conventional logging had caused greater disturbance (Sollmann <em>et al</em>. in prep).<br/><br/>It is nocturnal (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Ross <em>et al</em>. in prep. b). Davis (1962) found in Borneo that over 90% of its diet was insects, and no analysed stomach contents contained fruit or leaves.","Habitat loss and degradation have been assumed to be major threats to Banded Civet (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989). Reduction in primary forest has proceeded very fast throughout the lowland Sundaic region in the last 20 years, particularly at lower elevations (e.g. Holmes 2000,&#160;BirdLife International 2001,&#160;Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2001, McMorrow and Talip 2001, Lambert and Collar 2002,&#160;Kinnaird&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004, Fuller 2004, Eames <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stibig <em>et al</em>. 2014). This will have caused population declines. Local occurrence of Banded Civet in Borneo is lower in logged areas than in unlogged areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2014a,b). The Mentawai populations are impacted by economic development as human settlements expand into civet habitat, which also may result in conflicts since this species will prey on domestic livestock such as chickens (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989). Hunting, often for trade, also threaten this species. Because Banded Civet spends a lot of time on the ground, it is exposed to snares and other traps. The species is hunted for food by some people in Sabah (Murphy 2007). Banded Civet has recently been recorded in the pet trade in Indonesia and is sometimes captured, possibly opportunistically, for display in zoos and wild animal collections (C.R. Shepherd pers. comm. 2014).","Holden (2006) speculated that&#160;Banded Civet&#160;might typically be rare where it is found. However, Payne <em>et al</em>. (1998) stated that it was the second-most commonly recorded civet in the forests of Sabah and more recent surveys suggest that it is still relatively common in many areas across the state (Ross <em>et al</em>. in prep. a). All evidence suggests that it is forest dependent and so the population is likely to be in decline. Although it has been detected in logged forest (Ross <em>et al</em>. in prep. a) it is likely to occur at lower densities in these areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2014a,b).",Decreasing,"Banded Civet occurs in the Sundaic&#160;subregion: in Peninsular Myanmar (Pocock 1939), Peninsular Thailand (Kitamura&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), Malaysia (Peninsular: e.g., Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004, Hedges&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013; Malaysian Borneo: e.g., Mathai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Matsubayashi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011), Indonesia (Mentawai Islands [Sipora Island, South Pagai Island], Kalimantan, Sumatra; e.g., Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989, Holden 2006, Samejima and Semiadi 2012)&#160;and Brunei (Bennett&#160;2014). The northernmost Thai record is from 12°53′N (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) and the northernmost in Myanamr is from 10°09′N (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Several sources list Banded Civet for Vietnam, but no credible evidence of wild occurrence has been traced and it is unlikely to occur there naturally.<br/><br/>There are no recent records in Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). It has been camera-trapped at several locations in peninsular Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014) and Malaysia (Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013, S. Mohamad pers. comm. 2014). On Borneo, it is one of the most frequently detected small carnivores in most spot-lighting and camera trap surveys in Sabah, where it has been recorded across the state (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1998, Brodie and Giordano 2011, Ross <em>et al</em>. in prep. a). It is also one of the more frequently detected species in Sarawak (e.g. Mathai 2010). In Kalimantan it has not been recorded in the peat-swamp forests of Sabangau National Park (Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010), but it has been detected in peat swamp forest in Berbak National Park, Sumatra (ZSL Indonesia programme pers. comm. 2014). In Sumatra, Holden (2006) detected the species infrequently in lowland primary forest in Kerinci Seblat National Park; however in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park it is found commonly at higher elevations (McCarthy and Fuller 2014, H. Wibisono pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>It has been found from&#160;sea-level&#160;up to 1,660 m a.s.l.&#160;(WWF-Malaysia&#160;pers. comm. 2014).",Banded Civet is taken as part of general mammal hunting for food across its range. There is no evidence of specific targeting by hunters.,Terrestrial,"Banded Civet is listed on CITES Appendix II; additionally, it is protected by national law in Malaysia and Thailand. The Mentawai subspecies were listed as Threatened in the <em>IUCN Action Plan for the Conservation of Mustelids and Viverrids</em> (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989).

45217601,41692,Paguma larvata,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Masked Palm Civet is listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, evident large population, occurrence in many protected areas, tolerance to some degree of habitat modification (even to very heavy fragmentation and degradation in at least the north-eastern parts of its range), large proportion of population in hill forest away from the level lowlands&#160;where deforestation rates are&#160;fastest, and persistence in areas with heavy habitat degradation and hunting. Thus, it is unlikely to be declining at the rate required to qualify for listing even as Near Threatened.","Masked Palm Civet occupies a wide range of habitats across its large range. In South-east Asia, most records come from evergreen and semi-evergreen forest, including heavily degraded areas and strips of riverine evergreen forest through deciduous landscapes (Rabinowitz 1991, Ratnam <em>et al.</em> 1995, Heydon and Bulloh 1996, Grassman 1998, Duckworth 1997, Azlan 2003, Roberton 2007, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). In India, as well as evergreen forests, it also uses the deciduous Sal <em>Shorea robusta</em> forests of the Siwalik range in the western Himalayan foothills (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). It is commonly found in limestone forest in Guangxi, China (Bosco P.L. Chan per. comm. 2014). In central south-eastern China it uses farmland-dominated landscapes interspersed with remnant forest (e.g. Wang and Fuller 2003, Zhou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008); in Hong Kong where hunting pressure is very low, it even lives in residential area with remnant patches of natural vegetation (Bosco P.L. Chan per. comm. 2014). Survey has been too poor to determine the extent to which (if at all) such non-forest areas are used in South-east Asia. Emerging results from Malaysian Borneo suggest that local status is negatively affected by recent logging, although there is some recovery in forest logged more than 10&#160;years previously&#160;(Brodie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;In camera-trapping surveys&#160;across Sarawak and Sabah, J. Brodie <em>et al</em>. (pers. comm. 2014) found Masked Palm Civet at 23 of 96 (24%) unlogged camera-trap&#160;stations,&#160;but at only four of 57 (7%) logged ones;&#160;all four of the logged&#160;stations&#160;were in the Hose Mountains of Sarawak, a remote and little-accessed area where logging had taken place more than a decade ago. In Sabah, the species was recorded in Danum Valley but not in adjacent oil palm plantation (Yue <em>et al</em>. in press). It was not recorded in a camera-trap survey of two lowland oil palm plantations in central&#160;Sumatra (Jennings&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) or in another plantation-focused&#160;survey in Jambi province,&#160;Sumatra (Maddox <em>et al</em>. 2007), although it is&#160;possible it was naturally absent from the region of each Sumatran&#160;survey.<br/><br/>Two published radio-telemetry studies on this species found, in Thailand, a home-range of 5.9 km² for an adult male (Grassman 1998) and 3.7 km² for an adult female (Rabinowitz 1991). Both studies showed that Masked Palm Civet is nocturnal with occasional day-time activity; this finding based on only two individuals is probably applicable to the species as a whole, based on field observations (e.g. Duckworth 1997) and camera-trapping (e.g. Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Up to four young can be born per litter, with two breeding seasons per year (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Based on field observations and camera-trap records, the species sometimes travels and forages in duos, or even groups (Bosco P.L. Chan per. comm. 2014). Lifespan in captivity is up to 15 years (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). Wang and Fuller (2001) conducted a study on the ecology of this species in rural agricultural habitat near the village of Taohong in northern Jiangxi province, south-eastern China, from April 1993 to November 1994, and found that it ate some mammals and insects, but mostly fruit. Further investigations confirm its generalist diet, using whatever is the most readily available food at any given season, be it animal or plant (e.g. Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008).","Masked Palm Civet is threatened, potentially, by habitat reduction and by overharvest. It is likely that it&#160;cannot survive total deforestation, but at least in some parts of its range, it clearly persists in degraded and fragmented forest (albeit at lower apparent abundance, at least in northern Borneo; J. Brodie pers. comm. 2014) and makes ready use of adjacent non-forest habitats such as agriculture. It occurs over a wide altitudinal range including into the upper montane levels. With a large proportion of its population in tropical hill forest, which in South-east Asia is being converted to non-forest use more slowly than is lowland forest, while the species has lost a large proportion of its range a few centuries ago, current rates of loss are relatively low and do not threaten the species except locally. It is a major component of the 'wild' mammal restaurant trade in southern China, but most of the individuals seem to come from farms (e.g., Li and Li 1998, Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010), and is eaten widely elsewhere in its range, notably Viet Nam (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). General mammal hunting is very heavy across parts of its range (such as northern South-east Asia), but because Masked Palm Civet is quite arboreal, and so spends that proportion of its time outside the range of snares and most other traps, it is less exposed to hunting than are the more ground-dwelling small carnivores. Being largely nocturnal, it probably escapes the attentions of dogs and of much opportunistic hunting&#160;Thus, it is still detected widely even in heavily snared parts of Viet Nam (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3), which support among the highest levels of such hunting of anywhere in the species's range, and it remains secure in heavily hunted parts of south China where most other carnivores are now very rare (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). Overall, therefore, the level of threat from these factors is assessed as relatively low, despite the likelihood that in some areas (e.g., Viet Nam) they are likely to be causing widespread declines.","Masked Palm Civet is widely camera-trapped across its range and in many evergreen biomes it is amongst&#160;the more commonly recorded small carnivores (e.g.&#160;Holden 2006,&#160;Long and Minh 2006, Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010, Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sathyakumar <em>et al</em>. 2011, Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014b, McCarthy and Fuller 2014, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3). Nonetheless, its semi-arboreal behaviour takes it out of the range of ground-level camera-traps some, perhaps much of the time. Thus, in several areas in both Myanmar and Thailand where significant camera-trapping effort did not photograph the species, it was found by other methods (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Similarly, in Hainan (China) it is never camera-trapped in contrast to the convincing local opinion that it is as common there as is Common Palm Civet (Bosco P.L. Chan per. comm. 2014). Its degree of arboreality hinders assessing its local status by camera-trapping. The species is perhaps less common where it has been heavily hunted for the commercial food trade&#160;in southern China&#160;and in parts of Viet Nam,&#160;but still remains widespread and locally common in these areas&#160;(Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2006, Bosco P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2014,&#160;D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). Further north in China it is at least locally common and has been studied in landscapes comprising remnant forest patches mixed with agriculture (e.g. Wang and Fuller 2003, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008). The number of recent records in many parts of its range in, or in close proximity to, areas of heavy human activity suggest that its populations remain high within remaining habitat, including largely anthropogenic areas such as Hong Kong (Pei <em>et al</em>. 2010): here it lives even in suburban shrubby patches with groves of mainly exotic trees on retaining walls in residential areas&#160;(Bosco P.L. Chan per. comm. 2014). Although it readily uses non-forest habitats, at least in China, there seem to be no records within the southern part of its range far from forest. Thus, the extensive deforestation over much of its range in recent decades is likely to have caused population declines, which can be assumed to be continuing in areas still losing large areas of forest, such as Sumatra (McCarthy and Fuller 2014). Because in South-east Asia this is primarily a species of hill forest, where deforestation rates&#160;are much lower than in the level lowlands, its decline rate is likely to be less&#160;steep than that of lowland&#160;species. Hill forests are, however, still subject to widespread selective logging, and the response of the species to selective logging remains uncertain (see 'Habitats and ecology'&#160;section).",Decreasing,"Masked Palm Civet has one of the widest geographic ranges of any civet. It occurs in mainland China south-east of a line roughly along Beijing, Hebei, Sichuan and north-central Yunnan provinces; on Hainan, Hong Kong and Taiwan; west along the Himalayas and their southern foothills to Pakistan; in the hill ranges of North-east India; almost throughout mainland South-east Asia; and on Sumatra, Borneo, the Andaman Islands, and a number of small islands such as Koh Yao (9°00´N, 98°00´E) off Thailand and Rutland (11°25´N, 92°40´E) off India (Pocock 1939,&#160;Duckworth 1997, Wang 2003, Meiri 2005,&#160;Holden 2006,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Holden and Neang 2009,&#160;Patou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Choudhury 2013, Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014: Table SOM3, Bennett&#160;2014, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It occurs throughout North-east India excepting potentially Tripura, where there are records only from the north (Choudhury 2013).&#160;Bangladesh is often omitted from the range (e.g., Patou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009) but it occurs in the evergreen forests of the north-east (e.g., Al-Razi <em>et al</em>. 2014). Although conventionally the southern half of Borneo is omitted from the range (e.g., Patou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009), a recent collation traced many reports from this area (Semiadi&#160;<em>et al</em>. in prep.); these have not, however, been independently validated.&#160;There&#160;seems to be a distribution gap or at least great scarcity in the deciduous-dominated plains of Cambodia, Lao PDR and Thailand (Duckworth&#160;1997, Schank&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).&#160;It has been said to occur in Singapore but, whilst animals have been recorded at large on the island, there is no evidence that there has ever been a native population there (Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Brooks and Dutson (1994) spotlit a single individual in the Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park, Java, Indonesia; however, this distinctive and readily detected species has not otherwise been recorded wild on the island; it is traded in some numbers there (Nijman <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014), so this was presumably a released or escaped import. It has been introduced to Japan, where it is now widespread (Masuda&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The altitudinal use seems to vary across its range. It perhaps occurs mainly or solely in hills and mountains in some areas, e.g., Lao PDR (Duckworth 1997), non-Sundaic Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014), Cambodia (Holden and Neang 2009) and Borneo (Belden <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;J. Ross and A.J. Hearn (pers. comm. 2014), in extensive camera-trapping across Sabah, Borneo (see, e.g., Ross&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), recorded Masked Palm Civet from 59 (out of roughly 500) camera-trap stations; 76% of these 59 stations are above 500 m, a much higher proportion than that of all stations. The lowest elevation they have detected it is 208 m (but in a fairly rugged area), despite substantial survey effort down to sea level. J. Brodie <em>et al</em>. (pers. comm. 2015), in camera trapping across Sarawak and Sabah, recorded Masked Palm Civet over 230 to 1,700 m a.s.l., also despite extensive sampling at lower elevations. In a collation of records across Borneo (produced by the Borneo Carnivore Symposium 2011) the precisely located records show a clear association with hilly terrain. The extent to which this is a real association of the animal, rather than a pattern of survey is difficult to tell (A. Wilting pers. comm. 2013).&#160;In some other regions,&#160;Masked Palm Civet&#160;certainly occurs down to the lowlands, e.g. Hong Kong (almost to sea-level, although perhaps not in plains lowlands; Bosco P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2014), Myanmar (270 m; Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008), Vietnam (150 m; Roberton 2007), North-east India (90 m; Choudhury 2013) and Sumatra (100 m; Holden 2006). For most lowland records, the published information does not, however, indicate how common&#160;is&#160;the species at such altitudes, how rugged is the terrain where it occurs in the lowlands, and how far were the records from hill or mountain areas. There seem to be few records explicitly from lowland gentle terrain from anywhere in its South-east Asian range. In North-east India it has been recorded up to 2,700 m (Choudhury 2013), in Nepal up to 2,500 m (Y. Ghimirey per. comm. 2014), and in Sumatra up to 2,400 m (Holden 2006).","In a study on the dynamics of trade in live wildlife across the Guangxi border between China and Viet Nam during 1993 to 1996, Li and Li (1998) noted that ""the volume of trade in&#160;<em>Paguma larvata</em>&#160;was small, but the percentage of [it] in the restaurants was very large. This suggested that the supply of [this] species in the restaurants was partly from the domestic wildlife trade in China"". It is widely farmed in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010) and elsewhere, and used for food throughout its range. SARS is a major issue for this species, causing the trade and sale of it to be banned in order to control the disease, as well as many breeding farms being closed. It is heavily harvested in much of its range for local consumption, particularly&#160;in Viet Nam and southern China (Bosco P.L. Chan pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox&#160;pers. comm. 2014).",Terrestrial,"Masked Palm Civet occurs in many protected areas across its range. In China, it is listed as Near Threatened (A2cd). It is protected by law in Gansu, China (Li&#160;<em>et al</em>, 2000),&#160;and in Malaysia (Azlan pers. comm. 2006)&#160;but not Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014) or Nepal (Y. Ghimirey per. comm. 2014). The population of India is listed on CITES Appendix III. Given the lack of major threats, there is no immediate need for conservation interventions. Continued surveillance of trade levels, particularly internationally into southern China, and assessment of the extent to which it is used in civet coffee production (which has the potential for dramatic increase in off-take from the wild) is warranted. A clearer understanding of its adaptability to degradation and fragmentation, which perhaps varies across its range, could help identify if in any parts of its range it might be locally at risk from habitat change.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45220097,41707,Viverra megaspila,Endangered,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Large-spotted Civet is listed as Endangered because of an ongoing and projected future population decline, of more than 50% over three generations (taken to be 15 years) in the past and the future, inferred from range-wide over-exploitation and habitat destruction, and the interaction between these factors (hunting has more serious effects in fragmented landscapes), coupled with some evidence of range shrinkage (the lack of records from the northern extremity, China, since 1998; and the paucity of post-1990 records in the country elsewhere in its range with the heaviest hunting and habitat conversion, Viet Nam). Its main land-type of occurrence, level lowland, is also the main one sought for conversion to agriculture, infrastructure and settlement, driving therefore much faster declines than are seen in species otherwise similar but which occur widely in hill and mountain forest. In countries other than Cambodia, potentially Myanmar, and perhaps parts of Thailand, it is reduced to small isolated populations, many of which may have poor long-term prospects because suitable habitat is restricted in each area to small peripheral parts.&#160;The 2008 assessment, as Vulnerable, stressed the difficulty of determining the population loss rates through habitat and hunting. It noted specifically that ""if strong forest protection activities are implemented in Cambodia this [Vulnerable] will need revision. Conversely, this assessment may be overly optimistic ... better data might even indicate EN [Endangered] status"". Forest conversion rates in lowland Cambodia have indeed outstripped those predicted at the last assessment, with major incursion into even some formerly flagship protected areas. The regionally strengthening economy suggests that deforestation rates will continue to rise in Cambodia, and the rising level of external investment into Myanmar with the easing of economic sanctions guarantees rapid rates of conversion of level lowlands there (areas which are mostly not so far surveyed for the species). Trade-driven hunting, particularly cable-snaring, which is likely to have caused the declines of a large suite of ground-dwelling mammals in Viet Nam and other range states, is reported to be on the increase in several protected areas in Cambodia. Thus, while information is too imprecise to be sure that the species might not more appropriately be categorised as Vulnerable, Critically Endangered is also a possibility.","Several examinations of records over varying geographic scales have concluded that Large-spotted Civet is basically a lowland species, with records over 300 m a.s.l. relatively unusual and almost confined to areas of level or gentle terrain (Duckworth 1997, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, Jennings and Veron 2011, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is camera-trapped in large numbers in some areas, without the use of special techniques (Austin 1999, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, Jenks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014); this allows high confidence that the extreme paucity of records from above 600 m and from hilly terrain above 300 m, despite extensive camera-trapping in most range states in such areas, truly reflects a great rarity of Large-spotted Civet at these altitudes. Nonetheless, Large-spotted Civet has occasionally been found much higher. Some such records (e.g. Kon Ka Kinh, Viet Nam; probably within 700-900 m; Le Trong Trai pers. comm. to Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005) come from areas of mid-altitude plateau terrain, which also support other predominantly lowland species. The highest precise-altitude record is perhaps a camera-trap record in 2010 from interior Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, at 780 m; this area had been heavily camera-trapped over the preceding decade without finding the species and its occurrence so high is evidently exceptional (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Within suitable altitude and terrain, the species has been recorded in a number of different habitats: natural habitats assigned directly by observers include evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest, mixed deciduous forest, deciduous dipterocarp forest, <em>Melaleuca</em>-dominated swamp-forest, shrubland, wetlands and grassland. There are many records from degraded and edge areas as well as some from well within little-encroached blocks of habitat (Duckworth 1997, Austin 1999, Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Holden and Neang 2009, Jenks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Records from plantations (oil palm, teak and perhaps others) seem to come typically or invariably from close to natural habitat (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014,&#160;Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015).<br/><br/>Two recent investigations of habitat use, one (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010) for two parts of Cambodia, the other (Jennings and Veron 2011) across the species's non-Chinese range, assigned habitats from record coordinates and GIS habitat information, rather than directly by the surveyors. Both concluded the species is primarily one of deciduous forest. While there are many records of Large-spotted Civet from deciduous forest, there are also many from evergreen forest (see above) and, considering patterns of camera-trapping across habitats at altitudes below 300-400 m, it is certainly not, across its range, preferentially associated with deciduous forest.<br/><br/>Jennings and Veron (2011) provided no measure of relative survey effort between different habitat types, thus allowing the possibility that patterns of record distribution that they identified reflect patterns of survey distribution as much as or more than of animal distribution. Their habitat information source [Global Land Cover 2000 map for Southeast Asia (www.bioval.jrc.ec.europa.eu/products/glc2000/products.php; map 6)], was examined independently by J.W. Duckworth and R.J. Tizard (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;for areas of southern Lao PDR, Cambodia and adjacent Viet Nam with which they were familiar. Across much of the southern Indochinese lowlands, predominantly deciduous landscapes have strips of semi-evergreen forest along&#160;many&#160;rivers and patches on hill tops. Many of these were not, on the GLC map, distinguished from the surrounding deciduous matrix. Jennings and Veron's (2011) analysis cannot, therefore, determine the degree of evergreen versus deciduous habitat use in this large three-country area, and it is plausible that similar imprecision is present in the map for other plains biomes with extensive but not total deciduous forest. These evergreen forest patches and strips support some birds typical of evergreen forest and not of deciduous forest&#160;J.W. Duckworth and R.J. Tizard pers. comm. 2010); the same may be true of mammals although at least with carnivores this is less readily assessed.<br/><br/>Gray <em>et al</em>. (2010) used an apparently more precise source for habitats, and were able to build in some at least implicit measure of relative effort. It is therefore possible that in these two areas Large-spotted Civet is particularly associated with deciduous forest. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the apparent association may be an artefact if taken to be applicable across the&#160;species's range. The primary confounding variable is that terrain types on which deciduous dipterocarp and semi-evergreen forest occur within the Mondulkiri Protected Forest are significantly different. Semi-evergreen forest is primarily associated with rocky hill terrain (albeit at low elevation) in which slope angles and soil characteristics are unlike typical plains level semi-evergreen forest as occurs elsewhere in Cambodia and other parts of the species's range. In Mondulkiri PF, camera-trapping in semi-evergreen forest appears to have been located&#160;only&#160;in such hilly terrain. Such semi-evergreen forest might be ‘avoided’by Large-spotted Civet as a result of terrain type rather than vegetation type; whereas the deciduous forests in this areas are on gentle terrain as is typically occupied by this civet (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). That there may be significant undetermined factors driving the local-scale distribution of Large-spotted Civet in areas surveyed by Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) is suggested by the marked paucity of records from Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary compared with Mondulkiri PF. Although the habitats in these two areas are broadly similar, there are noticeable although somewhat subtle differences. Although Phnom Prich WS has a greater proportion of highly deciduous semi-evergreen forest (sometimes called mixed deciduous forest; poorly categorised and delineated on the JICA landcover maps) than does Mondulkiri PF, other differences suggest this factor alone may not be the most significant one in the apparent differences in <em>Viverra</em> civet occurrence data. Phnom Prich WS is on somewhat more rugged terrain than is Mondulkiri PF, especially when the camera-trap regions are compared (in part this may have some correlation with semi-evergreen forest/ highly deciduous semi-evergreen forest presence). Furthermore, deciduous dipterocarp forest differs between the two areas quite substantially: Phnom Prich WS has a much lower proportion of relatively open deciduous dipterocarp forest, and especially open ‘glades’, and a much higher proportion of the deciduous dipterocarp forest has an understorey dominated by small bamboo. Water sources are markedly fewer and more aggregated in Phnom Prich WS. Unless there was some bias in the camera-trapping protocol and camera placement, which is hard to imagine given the large numbers of Large Indian Civet <em>V. zibetha</em> detected, the paucity of Large-spotted Civet records from Phnom Prich WS suggests that the species may be relatively sensitive to further as yet unknown habitat characteristics.<br/><br/>Chutipong <em>et al</em>. (2014) intended also&#160;to assess the species's habitat use in Thailand by GIS, but the habitat types generated for the records, when checked by the original surveyors, produced far too many gross errors of classification for the method to be viable; this included the failure to distinguish between evergreen gallery forest and the surrounding extensive grassy deciduous dipterocarp forest, and multiple instances of semi-natural habitats being classed as plantations (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). Instead, R.J. Timmins (pers. comm. 2014), in conjunction with the surveyors, inspected the locations by eye. In Thailand, there is no suggestion of an association with deciduous forest over evergreen. This analysis of Thai records again suggests&#160;that the species may have an even more restricted niche than was&#160;previously thought. Although there is wide occurrence across Thailand, detection rates, especially the proportions of camera-trap stations with detections, are very low in almost all areas (in eight of the nine sites with detections, fewer than five camera-trap stations found the species). At Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary, the only site with extensive lowland gentle terrain, the species was detected at 41 camera stations. Plotting the locations of all Thai Large-spotted Civet detections on terrain maps placed almost all records unequivocally on gentle terrain, mostly at the edges of protected areas that are centred on hill or mountainous terrain. One of the best examples of this is Khao Yai Natonal Park, which has had some of the most intensive camera-trapping in Thailand, yet Large-spotted Civet has been detected at only three camera-trap stations: two on low elevation, very gentle terrain at the very edge of the park, and a third at 780 m in more rugged terrain amid the main research area in the park with very high levels of camera-trapping in many years: it is clear that Large-spotted Civet does not occur regularly in that sector. Vegetation association in Thailand is less clear, for two main reasons: most low-elevation gentle terrain habitat is significantly degraded (mostly perhaps secondary) and to a degree fragmented; secondly it appears that little to no deciduous or largely deciduous low-elevation gentle terrain habitat survives in the camera-trap survey areas (indeed, such habitat is now rare in Thailand). Thus, there is no way to compare occurrence between semi-evergreen/evergreen and deciduous habitats, or intact with degraded and fragmented habitats. The Thai data suggest a possible greater association with mosaics of different habitats, but this might simply be an artefact of the habitat types present and camera-trapping procedures.&#160;An additional survey not included in Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2014) or the foregoing, of Huai Kha Khaeng&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary (Wongchoo 2014), detected Large-spotted Civet at few camera-trap stations. These were all in deciduous forest, but in this site evergreen forest is very localised below 400 m and nearly all camera-trapping was in deciduous forest; analysis suggested low altitude, not forest-type, best explained the distribution of the species in the survey area.<br/><br/>There has been no investigation of diet, ranging, productivity or other aspects of natural history, all of which, particularly if compared across habitats, might usefully inform conservation planning and implementation for this species.","Throughout much of Large-spotted Civet's range, ground-dwelling small carnivores are exposed to heavy hunting, particularly with snares and dogs. Some level of hunting pressure is likely to be almost universal. A rapid, ongoing expansion of wealthy social strata in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam and China is in part driven by illegal trade in timber, wild meat and other forest resources, and by large infrastructure projects. This social change has driven a recent massive increase in demand for wildlife as luxury food in urban centres, particularly in China and Viet Nam; civets are a large part of this (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is no evidence that Large-spotted Civet is specifically sought (nor that it is eschewed); it is safe to assume that it comprises part of the general off-take, given that most methods are of low selectivity, such as lines of snares suitable for animals of this size class set at high density with drift fences (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Viet Nam “the free market economy has resulted in feverish periods of trade in wild species nationwide, with negative impacts on biodiversity” (Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 2004). In Cambodia, the same factor has fostered a thriving wildlife-meat market and hunting of species for international wildlife trade (Timmins and Ou 2001, Timmins 2006, Maxwell <em>et al</em>. 2007), and the intensity of hunting there for some species is likely to exceed even that in Viet Nam. This reflects the logistical ease of hunting and trading with few controls and the relative abundance of high-value quarry species (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In many countries, the species's habitat use means that in many forest blocks it occurs mostly round the margins (lowlands) with the interior (often mostly hill forest) being unsuitable. This may insulate it to some extent from the worst of industrial snaring, because the peripheral areas are mostly already defaunated of high market-value species. Set against this, it is more likely in these areas to be encountered during general subsistence forest resource-gathering activities (e.g., firewood, food for domestic consumption, construction materials); people engaging in these are in many areas invariably accompanied by dogs, carrying guns and alert for any opportunistic hunting possibility for animals of this size-class and over. Of its current range states, Cambodia and, presumably, Myanmar both have multiple large protected areas comprising extensive areas at suitable altitude and terrain for this species. This gives more solid long-term options, but few of these are effectively managed at present, and hunting in some is known to be at very high levels.<br/><br/>Hunting is compounded by habitat loss. From the 1970s and the 1990s, large areas of lowland forest were converted to agriculture across parts the species's range, particularly in China, Thailand and Viet Nam (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Roberton 2007, Wang Ying-xiang pers. comm. 2006). Large areas were also logged and otherwise encroached. While this might well have had little direct effect on suitability for Large-spotted Civet, heavy hunting almost invariably accompanies such operations. Post-logging, the typically increased accessibility and fragmentation of habitat increases the threat of hunting and the negative effects on susceptible species (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005). While large-scale conversion of the small remaining tracts of lowland forest has mostly slowed in these countries since the 1990s, Lao PDR and, in particular, Cambodia are still within their main phase of conversion; and political and thus economic changes in Myanmar suggest the start of a similar upsurge there. Cambodia is presently seeing massive deforestation of the lowlands, particularly for local and plantation-scale agriculture; this is unquestionably reducing the extent of suitable habitat for Large-spotted Civet both outside and inside protected areas (T.N.E. Gray&#160;&#160;pers. comm. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). In Myanmar, there is a major trend in conversion of forest to plant oil agriculture, particularly in lowlands (J.W. Duckworth and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006).","Recent camera-trapping in many areas within Large-spotted Civet's geographic range has greatly clarified its population status. The following comments are made in the light of survey effort in suitable habitat (forested gentle terrain below 300 m, exceptionally to 500 m or more; see 'Habitats and ecology' section) in each country.<br/><br/>Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) generated no records in extensive surveys across Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan, southern China, and were aware of none this century. It is possible that Large-spotted Civet has been extirpated from China.<br/><br/>Roberton (2007) traced only nine confirmed records from Viet Nam, only two of which were since 1990. Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2012) collated camera-trap records from across Viet Nam and found only two records: U Minh Thuong National Park (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004) and Yok Don National Park (Eames <em>et al</em>. 2004). Subsequent small carnivore-focused surveys in the U Minh <em>Melalueca</em>-dominated wetlands failed to record the species, as have similar surveys in lowland habitats e.g. the Ke Go-Khe Net Lowlands and Cat Tien National Park (Save Viet Nam’s Wildlife pers. comm. 2014). Large-spotted Civet is now evidently very rare in Viet Nam and is probably very close to national extinction if not gone already; most natural lowland habitats in Viet Nam have been converted into agriculture, and what is under protection is known or can be assumed to suffer from intense trade-driven hunting.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Duckworth (1994) and Austin (1999) found the species easily in both areas of suitable habitat surveyed with suitable methodology in the early 1990s, Phou Xang He and Xe Pian National Protected Areas. There has been little subsequent survey in habitat potentially suitable for the species since then, with most conservation activity occurring in hilly areas (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014). Of two incidental records since 2000, one was adjacent to one of the earlier areas, Xe Pian NPA (Duckworth 2008) and one was some distance from other records, on the Nakai plateau; although this animal was seen in trade, it is unlikely it had been brought from afar (Khounboline 2005). Subsequent survey of the plateau by camera-trap (Dersu 2008) and the rounding up of animals isolated by the filling of the Nakai dam (U. Streicher pers. comm. 2010) did not find the species, indicating that it was probably even then extremely rare there. The suitable habitat on the plateau has now been flooded. Intense trade-driven hunting and fragmentation of remaining lowland natural and semi-natural habitat across Lao PDR, in an environment of highly uneven law enforcement, suggests that the Lao population is likely now to be very low. Although many areas of terrain and habitat potentially holding the species remain and have not been appropriately surveyed (see, e.g., SUFORD 2010), these are mostly outside the protected area system and are heavily hunted; the likelihood of Lao PDR still holding a large undiscovered population of Large-spotted Civet is very low (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>A compilation of camera-trap records from 21 survey areas in Thailand found Large-spotted Civet records in nine of them. In most of these areas, however, suitable habitat is of limited extent and is mostly around the margins; populations are likely to be low. Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary stands out as by far the largest area of suitable habitat surveyed; most of the camera-trap stations recording the species anywhere in the country were in this protected area (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Away from this single protected areas, populations are likely mostly to be small. Based on habitat and terrain, it is unlikely that any areas holding large populations of the species remain to be discovered in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Cambodia is likely to hold the largest population of any range state except perhaps Myanmar. Suitable terrain is widespread. Much of it is still forested, although ongoing clearance imuch of it is still forested rapid. North-east Cambodia, with various protected areas, may be particularly important, notably the protected areas of the 'Eastern Plains Landscape', in particular Mondulkiri Protected Forest (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2014), as might be the ‘Northern Plains’ west of the Mekong (WCS Cambodia pers. comm. 2014). There are also records from gentle terrain around the Cardamom mountains (Holden and Neang 2009). The country’s population is not secure though and a possible, probably hunting-driven, decline has been noted for Mondulkiri Protected Forest (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014). Large-spotted Civet was the third most commonly&#160;camera-trapped small carnivore species in the northern plains during the 2013–2014 dry season (Ai Suzuki pers. comm. 2014). Hunting, particularly snaring, remains relatively less prevalent in the Northern Plains than in other Cambodian protected areas, particularly those that border Viet Nam, e.g. the Eastern Plains Landscape, which includes Mondulkiri Protected Forest. It is plausible that the country’s most significant and important population is now in the Northern Plains (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In Myanmar there are only a few records, from only a few sites (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Based on the extent of habitat on suitable terrain, many areas of habitat potentially suitable for Large-spotted Civet, including some large tracts, have not been surveyed by methodology appropriate to find the species (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Generalised trade-driven hunting for ground-dwelling mammals is generally less pervasive than in Vietnam and Lao PDR. In combination, these factors suggest that Myanmar might retain populations comparable to or exceeding those in Cambodia.<br/><br/>There seem to be only two series of recent records from Malaysia: these are from (i) two camera-trap stations in an oil palm plantation, and (ii) a road-kill record, all at the fringes of the Bintang-Hijau Range in the north-west of the country; the region is within the known range as clarified by Jennings and Veron (2011) (Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015).<br/><br/>As a ground-dwelling species, Large-spotted Civet is presumably readily snared. Thus, examination of markets is relevant to assessing the status of source populations. Despite the massive levels of non-specific hunting and of civet trade, and the often-taken opportunities to check large numbers of civets in trade, Large-spotted Civet has not recorded in the widespread trade in China (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010) or Viet Nam, which suggests that the populations are already reduced to overall extremely low levels in these countries (S.I. Roberton, Wang Y.-x., Nguyen X.D. and M.W.N. Lau pers. comm. 2006). Cambodia and Lao PDR both retain&#160;extensive (although fast-shrinking) degraded, heavily hunted lowland forest (large areas of Attapu, Salavan and Savannakhet provinces in Lao PDR, and of Kratie, Kompong Thom, and Stung Treng provinces in Cambodia) outside protected areas. The extent to which Large-spotted Civet persists&#160;within these non-protected areas is unknown. The insidious hunting throughout these landscapes (despite the occasional persistence of scattered populations of threatened species e.g. Eld’s Deer&#160;<em>Rucervus eldii</em>, White-shouldered Ibis&#160;<em>Pseudibis davisonii</em>), is likely to have caused declines in Large-spotted Civet as of most ground-dwelling mammals of similar and larger size. In addition, the widespread clearance of lowland forests for industrial agricultural concessions in Cambodia, both within and outside protected areas, will be reducing the extent of available habitat.<br/><br/>Throughout the twentieth century it is safe to infer an enormous decline in the species's global population, particularly in Thailand and Viet Nam, countries with large areas of suitable terrain which, during that century, were extensively converted to agriculture. This process proceeded somewhat later in the relatively smaller areas in Lao PDR. Cambodia has retained such a large proportion of the global total population in part by its large area of suitable terrain, but in particular because of the restraining effect of decades of civil unrest upon large-scale land conversion. With the stability since the late 1990s, such change is now proceeding apace. Similarly, Myanmar is emerging from a long period of international political sanctions that have held back finance for large-scale conversion of potentially suitable agricultural land; such activity is now gathering speed, particularly in the level lowlands (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, R.J. Tizard pers. comm. 2014). As well as habitat conversion, trends in hunting are relevant to inferring the population trend of this species. As a mobile (i.e. non-ambush predator) ground-dwelling species, Large-spotted Civet is presumably strongly susceptible to snaring. From the 1990s onwards, snaring levels have risen hugely across Viet Nam, Lao PDR and increasingly elsewhere, such as eastern Cambodia. While large areas of land in many range states have been declared protected areas, in most countries (notably excepting Cambodia) these are somewhat to greatly concentrated in hilly regions inimical to this species. Enforcement of wildlife laws is extremely lax in much of the species's range, and particularly outside high-profile protected areas. Thus, although there is no monitoring programme of this species directly, it is safe to infer from habitat and off-take trends that it has been in steep decline for decades and that this is ongoing.",Decreasing,"Large-spotted Civet has been found in southern China (e.g., Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010), Cambodia (e.g., Holden and Neang 2009, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2014), Lao PDR (e.g., Duckworth 1997, Austin 1999, Khounboline 2005), Peninsular Malaysia (e.g., Jennings and Veron 2011, Hamirul <em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015), Myanmar (e.g., Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008), Thailand (e.g., Lynam&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenks &#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and Viet Nam (e.g., Eames&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Nguyen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Roberton 2007). There was considerable confusion during the twentieth century about the southern extent of Large-spotted Civet occurrence, stemming in part from at least one author's treatment of <em>V. megaspila</em> and Malay Civet <em>V. tangalunga</em> as synonymous; Large-spotted Civet's documented range in Peninsular Malaysia is limited to the north-west of the country (Jennings and Veron 2011,&#160;Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015) and there are no records from Singapore (Chua <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>There are recent (post 1995) records from multiple localities in most range states, except for China, Viet Nam and Malaysia. In China the last record was in 1998 (Wang Ying-xiang pers. comm. 2006); Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) stated only that it might survive in the country. In Malaysia it has recently been found at only two localities, in the north-west and within the validated former range (Hamirul&#160;<em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2015). In Viet Nam, apparently the only confirmed record since 2003 is&#160;of two captives&#160;photographed near Takou Nature Reserve (in which they were reportedly captured) in 2010 (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). The distribution in most countries is now patchy, reflecting its habitat use (see 'Habitats and ecology'&#160;section) and the heavy conversion of these habitats (see 'Threats'&#160;section).<br/><br/>It has been recorded from sea-level to about 800 m a.s.l., although it is very scarce above about 500 m and occurs predominantly below 300 m (see 'Habitats and ecology'&#160;section).","Much of the species's range, particularly Viet Nam and Lao PDR but increasingly other areas, has seen very heavy market-driven hunting using often non-selective methods such snaring. This is resulting in huge declines and, evidently, widespread local extirpations of many ground-dwelling mammals (e.g., Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, there has been an increased demand for civets as luxury food in Chinese and Viet Namese markets (Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005). Although there has been no specific assessment of the extent to which Large-spotted Civet is taken, it is likely to be neither positively sought nor actively avoided. W. Chutipong (pers. comm. 2014) saw in an internet video of civet-coffee farming in Thailand a Large-spotted Civet; whether the animal was part of the coffee processing operations or was simply a quirky trophy-pet was not clear.",Terrestrial,"Large-spotted Civet has been found in many protected areas, particularly in Thailand and Cambodia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014, Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Most of these are not well managed, with some level of hunting, and many comprise largely unsuitable terrain and altitude for the species. Some of the PAs supporting it in Cambodia are afforded high ranking in conservation prioritisation, notably Mondulkiri Protected Forest, and Gray <em>et al</em>. (2010) called for Large-spotted Civet to be given specific consideration in management of this area. The species is nominally legally protected in most or all range states (excepting China, apparently), but these laws are widely flouted and over large parts of the species's present range have no deterrent effect on hunting levels. Recent great reductions in gun usage by civilians for hunting in Lao PDR and perhaps other countries have led to increased snaring efforts (in compensation); the latter is probably the more damaging form of hunting for this species (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>The overwhelming need is to secure multiple protected areas across its range by reducing hunting and habitat encroachment to levels not detrimental to this species. A firm legal basis already exists to do this in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar. Such PAs should include Khao Ang Rue Nai WS and, perhaps, Huai Kha Khaeng WS, Thailand (the latter already one of the best-protected areas in South-east Asia; the former not), Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Preah Vihear Protected Forest (Cambodia), some in Myanmar (currently with too little information to decide which), and perhaps Xe Pian NPA in Lao PDR (although recent information is lacking and regional trends suggest it is quite likely the species will now be very rare there).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45220284,41708,Viverra tangalunga,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Malay Civet is listed as Least Concern because it has a relatively wide geographic distribution, is commonly recorded in much of its range, is tolerant of degraded habitats, and occurs in many protected areas; the very high camera-trapping detection rates in many studies suggest high densities and stable and large populations. Although ongoing forest loss in its range is presumably causing its population to decline, its wide occurrence outside the level lowlands and use of degraded and fragmented areas means that it is implausible that decline rates could be sufficient even for Near Threatened, either in the past or future three generations (taken as 18 years).","Malay Civet occurs in a variety of habitats including primary and secondary forests, cultivated land and the outskirts of villages (Wemmer and Watling 1986,&#160;Colon 2002,&#160;Azlan 2003,&#160;Jennings <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Jennings&#160;and Veron 2011). It is widely and readily camera-trapped in old-growth forest&#160;on Borneo (e.g. Belden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Cheyne&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Mathai&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Wilting&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Brodie and Giordano 2011, Samejima and Semiadi 2012). By contrast,&#160;the number of reasonably intensive surveys that have not found it in superficially similar habitat on Sumatra suggests some patchiness of occurrence on that island: such surveys include Holden (2006), McCarthy and Fuller (2014), WCS Indonesia (pers. comm. 2008; many thousand camera-trap nights in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park) and G. Fredriksson (pers. comm. 2014; about 10,000&#160;camera-trap nights in Batang Toru);&#160;Holden (2006) had, however,&#160;some&#160;incidental records from degraded areas outside the camera-trapped old-growth forest of Kerinci Seblat.&#160;Similarly, it was recorded in a camera-trap survey of two lowland oil palm plantations in central&#160;Sumatra far from extensive old-growth forest; although records were&#160;strongly clustered around the plantation edge, indicating a need for microhabitats (perhaps&#160;dense undergrowth, fallen wood) absent from the plantations proper&#160;(Jennings&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015); another&#160;oil palm plantation-focussed&#160;survey&#160;in central&#160;Sumatra found it commonly in the landscape but did not record it in the plantation itself (Maddox <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;<br/><br/>In one area of Borneo, Malay Civet density in an unlogged forest was about twice that in a logged forest, perhaps because of lower fruit availability in logged forest; potentially, the species might survive in disturbed&#160;habitats only by continued inward dispersal from un- or little-disturbed forest (Colon 2002). Also in Malaysian Borneo, J. Brodie (pers. comm. 2014) found that local conservation status was affected negatively by recent logging, but had recovered somewhat in forests that were logged more than 10 years previously. In Sabah, Malaysia, the Proportion of Area Occupied seemed generally higher in less degraded than in more degraded forests, but other factors (as yet unclear) made this far from a perfect link (Sollmann <em>et al</em>. in prep.).&#160;In Peninsular Malaysia, radio-tracking of seven Malay Civets in an area of lowland forest abutting plantations found them to use both habitats, concluding that forest was essential, that the civets merely ranged into&#160;plantations&#160;perhaps primarily for nocturnal feeding, and that suitable day-bed sites might be limiting in them (Jennings <em>et al</em>. 2010), a pattern echoed in Sumatra (Jennings&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, on Borneo, Malay Civet was commonly found within oil palm plantations near the Danum Valley Conservation Area (J. Brodie pers. comm. 2014) and the Sepilok Forest Reserve (A. Hearn pers. comm 2015), mostly fairly close to (within 2 km of; but&#160;so were most camera-trap&#160;stations) forest or mangrove. These findings suggest that the use by Malay Civet of converted areas - a least of oil palm - may be less than is often assumed.<br/><br/>It has been recorded from sea-level to 2,100 m (Jennings &amp; Veron 2011) but the latter is perhaps exceptionally high; in Borneo, the highest record traced by Payne&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1985) was only 1,100 m; subsequent records go up only to 1,452 m (Crocker Range), although this was also the upper limit of camera-trapping, so it might occur still higher (J. Ross and A. Hearn pers. comm. 2014). In an area of Sarawak with significant highland survey, Mathai&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010) speculated that this species might occur mostly below 900 m. The highest record in the Philippines given by Rabor (1955), Rickart <em>et al</em>. (1993) or Heaney <em>et al</em>. (in press) was only 1,200 m.<br/>Malay Civet is solitary, omnivorous and primarily ground-dwelling (Kanchanasakha <em>et al</em>. 1998). Documented&#160;home-range sizes include, on Sulawesi, 24–189 ha, and on Borneo, 27–283 ha (Macdonald and Wise 1979, Nozaki <em>et al</em>. 1994, Colon 2002, Jennings <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). Mean home-range size for adults of both sexes was 110 ha in Sabah and 70 ha on Sulawesi (Colon 2002, Jennings <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Colon (2002) considered that the Malay Civet was not territorial in Sabah but Jennings <em>et al</em>. (2006) found low intra-sexual overlap on Buton Island. Malay Civet is mainly nocturnal, although more active during daylight on Buton Island, Sulawesi than in Sabah, East Malaysia&#160;(Colon 2002, Azlan 2005, Jennings <em>et al</em>. 2006). Day rest sites are typically situated at ground level and associated with some form of cover (Colon 2002, Jennings <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).","As a ground-living species, Malay Civet is exposed to snaring and other forms of ground-level trapping, to hunting with dogs, and to death from feral/stray dogs (e.g. Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010, Azhar <em>et al</em>. 2013). Leopard Cats <em>Prionailurus bengalensis</em> in oil palm plantations die from haemorrhaging through eating rats poisoned by Warfarin and other anti-coagulant baits (Duckett 1976), and these would presumably&#160;affect other mammalian predators such as this civet, if it uses such plantations heavily. However, the limited survey in areas heavily used by people suggests it is rather well able to persist in landscapes retaining some patches of native forest, at general levels of threat. The species is occasionally hunted for food and treated as a pest because it is perceived as raiding poultry. In recent centuries and particularly recent decades, much of its range has been deforested. While the species is frequently recorded in edge and degraded areas, there is no indication that it can survive in non-wooded landscapes, or that oil palm plantations (which have replaced forest in much of its range) can support populations in the absence of forest. Forest conversion rates have considerably slowed in some of its range (e.g. Sabah, Malaysia) but remain high in some other parts (e.g. Sumatra); throughout, the highest losses tend to be in the level lowlands, which comprise part of the core habitat of this species.","Malay Civet is often amongst the most commonly recorded small carnivores in camera-trap and other surveys on Borneo, including those in old-growth forest (e.g., Belden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Cheyne <em>et al</em>. 2010, Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wilting&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Brodie and Giordano 2011, Samejima and Semiadi 2012). It also seems to be common in West Malaysia (e.g., Low 2011). By contrast, some high-effort surveys - including several focused on&#160;old-growth&#160;forest - in Sumatra (e.g., Holden 2006, McCarthy and Fuller 2014, G. Fredriksson pers. comm. 2014,&#160;J. Holden pers. comm. 2014) have failed to find it at all. Without a clearer understanding of habitat use - which perhaps varies between land-mass - it is difficult to make firm statements about population trends. Whilst it evidently remains widespread and common in Borneo, there is insufficient information to be sure that this applies also to the other large landmasses to which it is native, peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra.",Stable,"Malay Civet is widespread on the large land-masses of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo, in all of which it is probably native; on&#160;Sulawesi&#160;(where it is introduced)&#160;and several of the large Philippine islands (where it is evidently introduced on some, but perhaps native on others); and on many smaller islands of the Philippines, on the Sunda shelf and east to Ambon (Indonesia). Although it is evidently native (and genetically distinct) on at least Belitung, the native or introduced status on many of these smaller islands, including Singapore, is not determined, but there is no evidence of natural dispersal east of Wallace's line. Overall, human-mediated dispersal has been very important in generating today's geographic range (Jennings and Veron 2011, Lim and Ou Yang 2012,&#160;Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). There are&#160;several records&#160;from Java, but there is no evidence of a native population there (Jennings and Veron 2011);&#160;a small level of (presumably imported) trade continues there (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Philippines, it has been recorded on Bohol, Busuanga, Camiguin, Catanduanes,&#160;Culion, Guimaras,&#160;Leyte, Lubang,&#160;Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Negros, Palawan, Panay, Samar, Sibuyan and Siquijor (Timm and Birney 1980,&#160;Heaney and Tabaranza 1991,&#160;Heaney&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1991,&#160;Jennings and Veron 2011). In Malaysia, it is found in Borneo, Banggi Island, Langkawi Island, Penang Island and on mainland Peninsular Malaysia (Corbet and Hill 1992, Nor 1996, Meiri 2005). In Indonesia, it has been recorded on Ambon, Bacan, Bangka, Bauwal, Belitung, Bintan, Borneo,&#160;Bunguran, Buru, Halmahera, Karimata, Kundur, Laut, Lingga, Natuna, Panebangan, Rupat, Sangihe, Seram, Siao,&#160;Sumatra,&#160;Ternate, and Watubela (Jennings and Veron 2011). Wozencraft (2005)&#160;listed it, in addition to its known range, for Cambodia and Thailand, and it was mapped for the southern portion of the latter by&#160;Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2014); but there is no evidence that it occurs in either of these countries (Holden and Neang 2009, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is perhaps more localised on Sumatra than on Borneo, occurring mainly in the east: J. Holden (pers. comm. 2014) knows of no recent records from the west, and Jennings and Veron (2011) traced only three records ever&#160;from this part of the island.<br/><br/>It has been recorded from sea-level to 2,100 m (Jennings and Veron 2011).","Malay Civet is perhaps not specifically sought quarry anywhere in its range, but because much hunting uses non-selective traps, it is part of the general catch of wildlife (e.g. Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010). The extensive introduction of the species in previous centuries outside its native range (Veron <em>et al</em>. in press)&#160;indicates it was presumably formerly perceived as of value.",Terrestrial,"Malay Civet is found in many protected areas across its range. This species is partly protected in Malaysia under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, meaning that anyone found killing this species will be liable to a fine not exceeding three thousand ringgit (Approx. USD 790) or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years, or both (Azlan, 2003).&#160;However, Section 55 of this Act allows farmers to shoot any wild animal that causes damage to their property, as long as reasonable efforts have been made to frighten the animal away, and many civets are considered as pests in Peninsular Malaysia, because they are perceived to prey on small livestock and raid fruit orchards (Azlan 2003). It is not a Totally Protected Species in Indonesia (Shepherd 2008) and neither is it a CITES listed species (CITES 2014). The wide persistence in encroached areas in close proximity to people indicates a lack of immediate conservation measures needed; and while the habitat use remains poorly clarified, there is no evidence that this lack of knowledge is placing the species at risk through obscuring the need for interventions.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
45220429,41709,Viverra zibetha,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Large Indian Civet's great rarity in parts of South China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong and Hainan) (Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010) and evident declines in Viet Nam and part of Lao PDR, in the context of the known heavy trade in the species as wild meat, led to a Near Threatened listing in 2008. Since then, large populations have been confirmed or can safely be predicted in multiple areas across Thailand, Cambodia and Bangladesh (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Rahman and McCarthy 2014, Hassan Rahman pers. comm. 2014), were already known in Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008) and North-east India (Choudhury 2013), and the species's Himalayan range has been documented to extend much further west through Nepal and northern India, including many well protected areas, than was then assessed (Bista&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Also, the species seems to be more resilient than was thought at the last assessment: in Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area, Lao PDR, an area with intensive market-driven snaring for almost two decades, it was the third most widespread small carnivore (in terms of number of camera-trap stations) during surveys in the previous decade (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014). Even in Viet Nam, it was detected by almost half the 13 camera-trap surveys collated by Willcox <em>et al</em>. (2014: Table SOM3). While this is lower than proportions for countries such as Thailand and Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014), it comes after 15-25 years of intensive trade-driven hunting in most survey areas. This indicates a longer time (than was assumed in 2008) until very low densities will be reached.&#160;The overall rate of global decline is now inferred to be much lower (and to have been so in 2008), insufficient to warrant categorisation even as Near Threatened. Even though, as a ground-dwelling species, it is exposed to heavy&#160;market-driven hunting&#160;pressure&#160;using non-selective methods&#160;in parts of its range (Lao PDR and Viet Nam; likely to&#160;intensify, on current trends, in Cambodia and Myanmar in particular), the population in the area where major declines have occurred or are in progress is much smaller than that in which the species remains common, meaning that the overall hunting-driven global decline rate is low. It also tolerates considerable habitat modification (although in the east of its range this is less apparent, because the most degraded areas are amongst&#160;the most heavily hunted, so the species is absent through the latter factor). Currently, region-wide habitat conversion is sufficiently high in the level lowlands to threaten ground-dwelling civets (e.g., Large-spotted Civet), but Large Indian Civet has a wide altitudinal range, with large populations in the hills and mountains. Therefore, habitat loss and fragmentation rates are also not sufficient to drive rapid declines. In sum, even the combined effects of hunting and habitat change are not considered to be resulting in decline rates sufficient to maintain the former categorisation as Near Threatened.","Large Indian Civet uses a wide variety of wooded habitats, both evergreen and deciduous, and primary and degraded. It has been recorded in primary forest (both evergreen and deciduous), secondary and degraded forest, scrubland and plantations (including those of tea) (Duckworth 1997, Azlan 2003, Jennings and Veron 2011, Choudhury 2013, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Sundarbans, Bangladesh, it uses mangroves as well as moist deciduous forest and mixed bamboo vegetation (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014) and there are records from <em>Melaleuca cajupti</em>-dominated peat swamp forest in Viet Nam (Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2004). It perhaps has even wider habitat use, Lekagul and McNeely (1977) indicated it was common around human settlements, and while hunting is probably too heavy in most of South-east Asia for this now to be so, recently one was found in a city park of Dhaka, Bangladesh (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014). There are several recent records in Nepal from the settled Kathmandu valley (Ghimirey and Acharya 2014), but all locations are connected to, or no more than 1-2, maximum 3, km from, large tracts of native forest, so plausibly involve roaming forest-based animals;&#160;there is no evidence of animals living independent of forest there (Y. Ghimirey pers. comm. 2014). Four animals radio-tracked by Simcharoen&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1999) in the Khao Nang Rum area of Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand (one adult male, two adult females and one sub-adult female) had home-ranges of 8.8, 3.6, 6.9 and 2.7 km², respectively. These animals were tracked for 13, 14, 8 and 3 months, respectively, and used evergreen forest much less than deciduous forest: 10%, 49%, 9% and 13%, respectively. Rabinowitz (1991) tracked one animal in the same area for seven months, which used evergreen forests in larger proportion (62%) than deciduous forests (mixed deciduous and dry dipterocarp). In sum, individual Large Indian Civets seem to vary considerably in habitat use.<br/><br/>It has been recorded up to&#160;2,420 m in Nepal (Appel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), to 3,080 m in India (Khatiwara and Srivastava 2014), but in South-east Asia perhaps only to at least&#160;1,800 m (Jennings and Veron 2011).<br/><br/>It is solitary and nocturnal although there are occasional day-time records of active animals (e.g. Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008, Gray&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b) and it is usually active on the ground (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Duckworth 1997). Its diet consists of a wide range of animals, including fish, birds, lizards, frogs, insects, scorpions (and other arthropods), and crabs, as well as poultry and rubbish (Lekagul and McNeely 1977). It is&#160;believed to breed throughout the year, with two litters per year, and two to four young per litter (Lekagul and McNeely 1977).","Hunting, mostly for food but to a lesser extent for scent glands, is the main threat to this species in South-east Asia and probably almost throughout its range.&#160;There has been an increased demand for civet meat in Chinese and Viet Namese markets (Bell&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Lynam&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). Ground-living small carnivores are exposed to high levels of non-specific hunting, particularly with snares, throughout most of northern South-east Asia, both inside and outside protected areas (e.g., Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014, B. Kanchanasaka pers. comm. 2006). Dogs, which among many ethnic groups in this species's range invariably accompany people entering the forest for any reason, not just on hunting-specific trips, are widely likely to be a problem for this ground-dwelling species, even though it is largely within burrows by day. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh, local people kill Large Indian Civets (for meat consumption) with poison (S. Chakma per H. Rahman pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Forest conversion to uses such as agriculture has been variably heavy across the species's range, and reduces the potential population of this species, and fragmentation facilitates access by hunters and exacerbates the effects of hunting. Because it has a large range in hill forests on rugged terrain, which have much lower clearance rates than do forests on level lowlands, it has lost a lower proportion of its habitat than has the lowland relative Large-spotted Civet <em>V. megaspila</em>.&#160;In most of its range, certainly Viet Nam, Lao PDR and China, hunting is the more pervasive threat because large areas of suitable habitat are now empty of the species or nearly so. By contrast, in the better protected areas of Thailand, Myanmar and widely in its range further west, where the species remains common, habitat is more likely to be limiting. The various recent peri-urban records from Nepal (Kathmandu), albeit all within 1-3 km of native forest, contrast strongly with the situation in today's Lao PDR and Viet Nam, where it is now probably largely restricted to the more remote areas.","Large Indian Civet lives at a naturally fairly high density for a carnivorous animal and was almost universally considered common by historical collectors (Pocock 1939). It remains common in much of its range and is often among the most commonly encountered small carnivores in camera-trap surveys, in Cambodia (e.g. Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014a), Lao PDR (Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b), Thailand (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008), north-east Bangladesh (Rahman and McCarthy 2014) and Nepal (Babu Ram Lamichhane pers. comm. 2014); it is perhaps less commonly encountered in Malaysia, the southern extremity of its range (see Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004, Low 2011, Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013) and in the western extent, in the Indian terai (Bista <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is still common over much of North-east India (Choudhury 2013) and Bangladesh (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014), and judging by recent locality records, Nepal (Ghimirey and Acharya 2014). Whilst it was formerly one of the most commonly recorded civets in Viet Nam (Roberton 2007), it is by no means ubiquitous in recent camera-trap surveys (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3), suggesting recent decline there. Unquestionable is the large population decrease in southern China (Guangxi, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Hainan), where it has become effectively extinct over large areas (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). Few other parts of the range are as severely affected by habitat fragmentation and degradation coupled with hunting, but it is likely that populations are widely reduced in the most heavily hunted other parts of its range, particularly where habitat has been heavily fragmented, e.g. much of Viet Nam, lowland Lao PDR and perhaps northern Thailand (although this remains meaningfully unsurveyed;&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). So far, the proportion of the range where major declines have occurred or are in progress is much smaller than that in which the species remains common, meaning that the overall global decline rate is low. The decline is likely to intensify with, on current trends, increased market-driven hunting, using non-selective methods, in Cambodia and Myanmar in particular; but the species's use of rugged hill forest, where the effects of such hunting are slower than in gentle terrain, and its large extent of occurrence in well-protected parts of India and Nepal will mean that overall the global population decline will remain much shallower in the next 10 years or so than for the related Large-spotted Civet <em>Viverra megaspila</em>.",Decreasing,"Large Indian Civet occurs across the southern Himalaya Terai from the Nandhour region, India, east through Nepal and Bhutan, locally in southern China, and widely in Bangladesh (north-east, south-east, middle and Sundarbans),&#160;North-east India and mainland South-east Asia including peninsular Malaysia (Duckworth 1997,&#160;Azlan 2003, Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Feeroz <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012, Jennings and Veron 2011,&#160;Bista&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Choudhury 2013, Tempa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ghimirey and Acharya 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a,&#160;Rahman and McCarthy 2014,&#160;Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3). In China, it has been recorded from the provinces of Anhui, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Xizang, Guangxi, Gunagdong, Hainan, Fujian, Zhejang, and Jiangsu (Wang 2003), but is perhaps now extirpated from some or even most&#160;of these (e.g., Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010) although it still occurs at least locally in the country (e.g., Wen <em>et al</em>. 2014). Singapore is also typically included in the range, and animals have certainly occurred in a wild state there, but Chua <em>et al</em>. (2012) queried, given historical statements of large trade in the species into Singapore in the past, whether it is native to the island. It has been introduced to the Andaman Islands, India (Lever 1985).<br/><br/>Ghimirey and Acharya (2014) highlighted the confusing and inconsistent treatment of this species's&#160;western range limit in various sources. A&#160;specimen-based&#160;claim from west of the known global distribution, from Himachal Pradesh, India (Archana <em>et al</em>. 2000) in fact refers to a palm civet (Bista <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>It occurs down to sea-level in some areas, and to 2,420 m in Nepal (Appel <em>et al</em>. 2013) and to 3,080 m in India (Khatiwara and Srivastava 2014).","Many Large Indian Civets are taken (particularly, in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, by snaring) for food, both for sale in local markets and for sale in urban and international markets. In northern&#160;South-east Asia the vat majority of the harvest goes for luxury consumption in urban Viet Nam and China (D.H.A. Willcox per. comm. 2014). In North-east India, it is occasionally sold in local markets of Nagaland and hill districts of Manipur (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm.. 2014).&#160;Another use is now minor by comparison with hunting for food: like Small Indian&#160;Civet&#160;<em>Viverricula indica&#160;</em>and African Civet&#160;<em>Civettictis civetta</em>, but to a generally much lesser extent, Large Indian Civet has been used as a source of civetone, an oil-like substance secreted by the perineal gland used by the animal for territorial marking.",Terrestrial,"This species is totally protected in Malaysia under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 (Azlan 2003) and in Bangladesh under the Wildlife Conservation and Security Act 2012 (Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014). It is protected in at least Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014), Viet Nam and Myanmar (GMA Small Carnivore Workshop 2006). China listed it as ‘Endangered’ under criteria A2acd, and it is a&#160;Category II&#160;protected State species under the&#160;China Wildlife Protection Law (1988), because of&#160;trapping for food and scent glands&#160;(Li&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2000).&#160;The population of India is listed on CITES Appendix III.&#160;It is found in very many protected areas (e.g., Duckworth 1997, Azlan, 2003, Kawanishi and Sunquist, 2004,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Bista&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Choudhury 2013, Tempa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Ghimirey and Acharya 2014, Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014a,b, Khatiwara and Srivastava 2014,&#160;Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3,&#160;Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014). There are some differences between countries in their effectiveness at reducing hunting within protected areas. Those countries which have greater commitment to this have healthier populations of Large Indian Civet whereas some of the South-east Asian countries are losing the species within many of their protected areas (e.g., Couldrat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014).

50043570,12561,Macaca sylvanus,Endangered,A2bcd,2020,2016-08-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Overall, the population of this species is estimated to have declined at a rate exceeding 50% over the last 3 generations (24 years). Consequently it qualifies as Endangered under criterion A2bcd. The status of this species varies in different parts of its range, but overall this decline is expected to continue in the future.","<p>This species is found in high-altitude cedar and oak forests, coastal scrub, and overgrazed rocky slopes with vestigial vegetation. It is confined to inaccessible rocky areas, gorges, and montane areas (from sea level up to approximately 2,600 m asl) due to habitat use conflicts with humans in more favourable areas. All the areas occupied by the Barbary Macaque are under growing pressure from human activity and habitat availability for <em>M. sylvanus</em> has decreased markedly in recent decades (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). <br/><br/>In Algeria, occupied habitats include mixed cedar (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>) and oak forests; Humid Zen Oak (<em>Quercus canariensis</em>) and Cork Oak (<em>Quercus suber</em>) mixes; Algerian Fir (<em>Abies numidica</em>), cedar and Zen Oak mixed forests; and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Taub 1977b, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Moroccan habitats include high cedar forests (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>), cedar/Holm Oak (<em>Quercus ilex</em>) mixtures, mixed oak forests (Qu<em>ercus suber, Q. canariensis, Q. ilex </em>and<em> Q. pyrenaica</em>) and cliffs and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Waters 2013). In habitats with cedar, macaques can reach densities of 25–40 individuals per km² or greater, whereas in habitats without cedar much lower densities of 5–7 individuals per km² are reported (Fa 1984). Densities in the mixed oak forests of Bouhachem Natural Reserve appear to be much higher than previously reported for the region (Waters unpublished data). In all occupied habitats, there is a species of oak available.<br/><br/>In Algeria, <em>M. sylvanus</em> lives in mixed-sex groups of up to 80 individuals with a modal size of 40 individuals (Ménard 2002). In Morocco, in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve, group size of four study groups was 52–73 with a mean of 62 (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Middle Atlas Mountains, group size ranged between 14 and 54 animals with a mean of 25 (Majolo <em>et al</em>. 2013). Life span in the wild is known to be up to 22 years (Lindenfors 2002). Females reach sexual maturity between 3.5 and 4 years of age and males between 4.5 and 7 years of age. In the wild, average age at first birth is 5.3 years for females (Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996; Lindenfors 2002) and the interbirth interval is 1.3 years (Taub 1974 in Fa 1984, Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996).</p>","<p>The destruction and degradation of the Barbary Macaque’s forest habitat is the most serious threat to the species. The severity of different threats varies in different parts of the species' range. <br/><br/>Severe habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation have been caused by domestic and industrial consumption of wood, use of fire, clearing for cultivation and overgrazing by sheep and goat herds (Taub 1977a, Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Ménard and Vallet 1993). This is exacerbated by poor forestry management; often <em>Cedrus atlanticus</em> is favoured and efforts are made to reduce <em>Quercus ilex</em>, but the latter species is a crucial resource for Barbary Macaques in some areas of their distribution (Ménard and Vallet 1986, 1996). In Morocco, severe habitat loss is also caused by extensive logging of cedar trees, occurring within and outside national parks (B. Majolo pers. obs. 2014).<br/><br/>As well as habitat degradation resulting from overgrazing by livestock is a major threat to the species (and a problem which is exacerbated by drought), in recent years, shepherds have increasingly settled near water sources. As shepherd tribes move into the forest, they often enclose open water sources with cement wells to be able to extract water for their herds. As a result, Barbary Macaques and other wildlife have been excluded from water sources in areas where it was previously accessible to them (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Conflicts with local people have been reported in Algeria, as a result of crop-raiding by macaques (e.g., villages in Djurdjura National Park in the Grande-Kabylie region: F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Crop raiding by Barbary Macaques has been reported by farmers in the area of Ouzoud (El Alami and Chait 2014) and other areas of the High Atlas. As a consequence, the shooting of Barbary Macaques as a result of crop raiding and cedar bark stripping was reported by Deag (1977) and must be seen as an ongoing threat to the species’ future.<br/><br/>In Algeria, national park officials indicate that the primary problem faced by Barbary Macaques is the conflict with mountain settlers, agricultural farmers and crop producers. Recently, regulation of forest use and access in Algeria has changed and it is now easier for people to use the forest areas. During the 1980s and 1990s, Algerians faced public curfews and restricted access to mountainous/forested regions due to civil war. Until recently, settlers were allowed to return to homes once occupied by their relatives in areas where Barbary Macaques are present. For example, in Chréa National Park, the human population increased from 550–600 individuals in 1993 to over 6,000 in 2015. Growth in human populations has resulted in a rise in infrastructure development in and around these areas, increasing the chances of macaque and human interaction through crop raiding, feeding interactions, as well as vehicle accidents (Benrabah 2015). Development of infrastructure has been shown to negatively impact wild macaques. For example, between 2008 and 2015, 31 incidents were recorded by park officials in Chréa National Park, including vehicle-related deaths of macaques (12 incidents) and 11 attempts of illegal capture of wild monkeys (Benrabah 2015). <br/><br/>The illegal live primate trade is also a significant threat to Barbary Macaques, as is their exploitation as photo props in tourist areas. Reports of capture for the international pet trade date back to 1977 (Deag 1977), and since then the trade has increased markedly (van Lavieren 2004). The Barbary Macaque was the most commonly confiscated mammal recorded by breeding programmes in European zoos between 2006–2010 (Zimmerman 2011). Infant <em>M. sylvanus</em> are offered both openly and covertly for sale on markets across Morocco, and prices of up to 200 Euros per animal have been recorded (van Lavieren 2004). Prices of about 100 Euros per animal have been recorded in Algeria, with Chaabet-el-Akhra gorges (Béjaïa) and Yakouren (Akfadou) cited as critical locations where illegal trade occur (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Additional threats include persecution, predation by dogs (Waters 2014), unmanaged primate tourism (Marechal <em>et al</em>. 2011, Borg <em>et al</em>. 2014), and pollution of the wadis (rivers) associated with forests (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Barbary Macaques seem to be rarely used for food, except as noted in some old reports in Algeria (Deag 1977).</p>","<p>In 1975, the Moroccan population of Barbary Macaques was estimated to be about 17,000 (Taub 1975). In Algeria, the population was estimated at 5,500 animals around 40 years ago (Taub 1977a). Alhough Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. (1999) estimated the species at around 15,000 individuals in 1999, this estimate was based on incomplete data.<br/><br/>Two population surveys conducted in 2013 and 2015 at 23 locations in Algeria estimated the Algerian population to be 1,336–3,506 animals (Benrabah 2015, Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), representing an average population decrease of 50% in comparison to the last published survey (Fa 1984). Algerian subpopulations are highly fragmented (Fa 1984, Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). In 1999, just seven widely separated isolated populations existed, whereas 35 years ago they were found in at least six additional locations in Algeria (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). Currently, in Algeria there is a remaining isolated population in Gorge Chiffa and the Park National of Chrea (131–352 individuals) (Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). The populations of Djurdjura, Tikjda, Akhfasou, Bejaia, Gouraya, Yakouoren, Kherrata, Draguina, Taza, Ait Alouane, Guerrouch and el Babor are fragmented.<br/><br/>In Morocco, a number of surveys have documented marked declines in population density, along with losses of a number of sites (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999, Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). Fourteen isolated populations were identified in the High Atlas (Cuzin 2003). A recent survey in the Central High Atlas Mountains reported direct observations of 644 individuals in 23 groups with a mean group size of 21 individuals. However, irregular surveys over a long period may have resulted in an overestimate of the population (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The cedar forest area of the central Middle Atlas represents the largest refuge of the North African forest ecosystem. In the 1980s, it was estimated that 65–75% of the world's remaining population of <em>Macaca sylvanus</em> lived in this area (Camperio Ciani 1986). In the mid-1970s, population densities in the central Middle Atlas cedar forest were variously estimated at 60–70 individuals per km² (Deag 1974) or 43 per km² (Taub 1975). The most recent population estimate for the Middle Atlas is 5,000 macaques with densities of up to 23.4 individuals per km² (Menard <em>et al</em> 2013a). These data indicate that, in the central Middle Atlas, average population density is three times less than it was 30 years ago (<em>ca</em> 15,000; Taub 1977). In addition, Menard <em>et al</em>. (2013b) estimated that 46% of immatures were removed from macaque groups habituated for tourism in Ifrane National Park by poachers for the pet trade.<br/><br/>In the Rif Mountains, recent and current surveys are revealing that the populations are not as fragmented and low as previously thought. A recent survey has estimated a population of ~1,500 macaques in contiguous mixed oak forest in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve where there is very little poaching pressure for the pet trade (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>On Gibraltar, the population is maintained at <em>ca</em> 300 animals but now occurs in more and smaller groups. Some of these groups often range in built-up areas and have caused serious conflict with residents. One such group has been captured and sent to a captive collection in the UK (Waters 2015).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Barbary Macaque is the only surviving primate in Africa north of the Sahara Desert, the only native species of primate to occur in Europe, and the only member of the genus <em>Macaca</em> that can be found outside Asia. In prehistoric times, this species inhabited Southern Europe and all of North Africa (Delson 1980, Camperio Ciani 1986). In historic times, it was widespread throughout North Africa from Libya to Morocco, but its current distribution is limited to small relict patches of forest and scrub in Algeria and Morocco (Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Scheffrahn <em>et al</em>. 1993, Menard and Vallet 1996). A semi-wild population lives in Gibraltar, which is a long established introduced population (Fa 1981, von Starck 1990, Hodges and Cortes 2006).<br/><br/>In Morocco, <em>M. sylvanus</em> is found in the Rif mountains (northern Morocco) and the Middle and High Atlas Mountains (central Morocco). More specifically, in Morocco the High Atlas populations (two anciently separated populations) are found from Demnat to El Ksba (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013) and around the Ourika Valley. In the Rif, Barbary Macaques are found in the protected areas of Bouhacham Natural Reserve, Talessemtane National Park, and Djebel Moussa (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Algeria, the species is found in the Tellian Atlas (Petite Kabylie and Grande Kabylie Mountains, and an isolated population in the Chréa National Park) in the north. From west to east, Barbary Macaque populations in Algeria are distributed as follows: Park National of Chrea (Gorge Chiffa), Park National of Djurdjura (Djurdjura and Tikjda), Park National of Bejaia, and Gouraya, Forests of Akhfadou, Yakouren, Gorges of Kherrata Forests of Draguina, Forests of Toudja, Park National of Taza (Ait Aloaune, Guerrouch and El Babor) (Benrabah, 2015). Additionally, a Barbary Macaque population might still occur in Djebel Bouzegza (Boumerdes, Grande-Kabylie) (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>The species occurs from sea level to 2,600 m asl (Cuzin 2003).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Macaca sylvanus</em> receives protection under national and international legislation, but law enforcement is inadequate. The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES. In 2000, the European Community suspended imports of <em>M. sylvanus</em> from Algeria and Morocco under the provisions of Article 4.6b of EC Regulation 338/97 because such trade was deemed to have a harmful impact on the species' status.<br/><br/>In both Morocco and Algeria, the national forestry departments are responsible for the management and the protection of flora and fauna. The Moroccan HCEFCLD collaborates with a Barbary Macaque conservation NGO to confiscate illegally-held macaques. The Moroccan NGO, Barbary Macaque Conservation in the Rif (BMCRif), has had success using social media to raise awareness among the Moroccan public who now regularly report illegally-held macaques in the Rif region, which are then confiscated by the forestry authorities (Waters and El Harrad 2013). The wildlife protection law in Morocco has recently been strengthened and confiscations take place more often. Some individuals are then released into the wild if they meet basic criteria. This strategy is successful for animals under one year of age due to the Barbary Macaque’s allo-parenting behaviour (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>With the rise in human presence and economic development in these regions, there may be an increase of fragmentation and separation, further isolating Barbary Macaques populations and preventing migration/dispersal (Benrabah 2015). However, with careful planning, the highly fragmented populations in Algeria could be reconnected via ecological corridors composed of forest patches, gorges, river basins and scrub regions. Ecological corridors are available for migration/dispersal of animals, provided the necessary actions are undertaken to protect those areas to assure they are suitable for the stable presence of macaques.<br/><br/>There has been some success recorded in Morocco with carefully-planned community projects; although crop raiding by Barbary Macaques does occur, community conservation activities are proving adequate to decrease human-macaque conflict in Bouhachem and persecution of the macaques by shepherds has ceased (Waters 2014).<br/><br/>A number of activities have been undertaken to increase public awareness and reduce illegal trade in this species. The Moroccan NGO BMRif collaborates with both regional and national forestry authorities to raise awareness about the Barbary Macaque including its status as a protected species. AAP (a Netherlands-based sanctuary for exotic animals) has initiated a project to combat illegal trade of Barbary Macaques into Europe, involving inter alia awareness raising among potential buyers, cooperation with authorities in consumer countries and training of customs officers in Spain (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006). The NGO Moroccan Primate Conservation Foundation has trained local ecoguards whose task is to prevent attempts to capture macaques in Ifrane National Park for the illegal primate trade.<br/><br/>Most Barbary Macaque habitats in Algeria have national park status. Protected areas in Morocco harbouring populations of this species include the Toubkal National Park, Eastern High Atlas N.P., Ifran N.P., Talassemtane N.P., Bou Hachem Natural Reserve and Djebel Moussa SIBE in Morocco, and the Djurdjura, Taza, Chréa, and Gouraya National Parks in Algeria. However, the parks in Algeria and Morocco suffer from significant human impact, and these areas require much stricter protection than is currently in place.<br/><br/>In Algeria, there is increasing awareness of the importance of protecting Barbary Macaques. For example, managers of the national parks of Chrea, Djurdjura and Gouraya/Bejaia have recently started filling in systematic incident reports any time monkeys are observed being killed, injured or have disappeared as a consequence of human activity (Benrabah 2015). Such records give useful estimates of the type/intensity of threats faced by the monkeys. Although a trend of population decline in Algeria and Morocco has been documented over the last 30 years, the rate of decline has been lower in Algeria than in Morocco. Threats facing Barbary Macaques in Algeria slightly differ from those of the Moroccan population. Tourism impacts are less noticeable in Algeria due to the lack of development of a tourist industry. In addition, surveillance by military and policing authorities is comparably higher in Algeria, contributing to a lower risk of poaching and illegal trade. Habitat degradation and human conflict over agricultural habitats are the primary causes of macaque population decline. Access to mountain and forested regions has increased since the civil strife of the 1990s in Algeria, thus increasing competition between humans and macaques in relation to the use of habitats for agriculture, domestic herd grazing and garbage disposal. <br/><br/>The Moroccan High Commission of Water and Forests along with a Dutch NGO, Moroccan Primate Conservation (MPC), published an action plan for the Barbary Macaque in 2012, focusing on the population in Ifane National Park. In 2016, the Algerian authorities are organising an action planning workshop assisted by IUCN. The Moroccan NGO BMCRif will collaborate with stakeholders to organise action planning workshops in 2017 and 2018 for the Rif populations.</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Mediterranean

A severe paucity of recent records in Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Java, and, if the species occurs there at all, Lao PDR, indicate that these populations are very small, and have been since at least 2000. There are no recent records from Sumatra (Indonesia), where the species has never been confirmed to occur, although in the light of only limited appropriate survey effort in these areas, the species’s current status should be considered unknown. In South Asia, although relatively widespread, it occurs largely in human-dominated landscapes (often hugely so), which are under locally severe threat from urbanization (Sri Lanka and India) and industrialization (India). Estimates of population size and trend, and of extents of habitat, are very speculative, given that research on this species has been initiated only in 2009 (Cutter 2015). Yet, research reveals a declining population facing an array of severe threats from habitat destruction to active persecution due to perceived conflict (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Cutter 2015, Adhya 2016). Poaching and retribution killing were the major causes for a high Fishing Cat mortality of 84% in Thailand, where 16 individuals have been monitored over a three-year radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015). <br/><br/>The current known global Fishing Cat strongholds are Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Bengal in India and the Terai-Duar belt of the Himalayan foothills in India and Nepal. Habitat loss along with the killing of Fishing Cats because of conflict with local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside these strongholds, declines may be considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta and 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal are likely in the next 15 years (Ashan Thudugala, Anya Ratnayaka, Tiasa Adhya, Shomita Mukherjee, Murthy Kantimahanti, Giridhar Malla, Rama Mishra, Sagar Dahal pers. comm. 2015). These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a decrease of a further 30% in the global Fishing Cat population. Thus, the species is categorized as Vulnerable under A2cd+3cd+4cd. <br/><br/>The change in Red List category is a non-genuine change reflecting the very recent increase in information quality; it does not indicate an improved conservation status for the species since the last assessment.","In India the Fishing Cat is strongly associated with water bodies, marshlands constituting tall bed-forming graminoid species like the reed <em>Phragmites vallatoria</em>, the reedmace <em>Typha elephantina</em> and locally cultivated grass species like <em>Saccharum narenga</em> and swamps (Adhya 2015). Most known records are from the lowlands, but in Sri Lanka Fishing Cat occurs also in wetlands in hilly areas (Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is largely nocturnal (Mukherjee 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Lynam <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). It is a dietary generalist consuming a variety of prey such as murid rodents, birds and fish (Mukherjee 1989, Haque and Vijayan 1993, Adhya 2015). Two species of rodents that figured prominently in the diet of the Fishing Cat from the Howrah district of West Bengal, a rapidly developing urbanised zone, were <em>Rattus rattus</em> (sensu lato) and <em>Bandicota bengalensis</em>. A conservative estimate of rodent consumption by the Fishing Cat suggests that each individual eats between 365 and 730 rodents per year (Adhya 2015).<br/><br/>A radio-telemetry study on four Fishing Cats in Chitwan National Park in Nepal showed that they mostly used dense tall and short grasslands; the home ranges of three females was estimated at 4-6 km² while that of a single male was estimated at 16-22 km² (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A more recent radio-telemetry study in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, demonstrated that protection of resources such as food and daytime resting sites and reduction of poaching can ensure the persistence of the Fishing Cat in human-modified agricultural areas (Cutter and Cutter 2009). A 84% mortality of radio-collared cats, due to poaching and unknown causes, was reported during the three-year study (Cutter 2015).<br/><br/>Generation Length (GL) was estimated at 5 years, using the Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) formula, GL = AFR + [z *Rspan], [where z (slope) is estimated at 0.3]; Rspan (Age at Last Reproduction – AFR), assuming 12 years as the average life span of the Fishing Cat in the wild and the Age at First Reproduction (AFR) around 1 year.","The Fishing Cat faces a high risk of extinction throughout its range and is thought to be amongst the most vulnerable of the small and medium-sized cats in Southeast Asia, reflecting the very low overlap of occupied habitat with protected areas and other conservation interventions, rather than any particular inherent higher susceptibility than shown by the other small cats (e.g. Duckworth <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The major threat across its South Asian range appears to be habitat loss and fragmentation by developmental activities such as urbanization, industrialization, agriculture and aquaculture (prawn and shrimp farms), whereas in Southeast Asia persecution is the major threat (Melisch <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014, Willcox <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, Thailand, Cutter (2015) reported 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats during the study period. Of 16 Fishing Cats that were radio-collared, three could not be located and could have either dispersed or died. Of the remaining 13, only two survived the almost three-year study period while five were poached and six died of unknown causes. Five dead cats were located. In one case the poacher who shot an animal reported the cause of death when he returned its ear tag. &#160;<br/><br/>In India, much of its habitat comprises freshwater marshlands which are categorised as ‘wastelands’ under land use policies and are thus subject to conversion and degradation (Adhya 2015). Linked to this is conflict with humans, which is believed to be aggravated by habitat fragmentation and sharing of resources such as space (wetlands) and food (fish, goats, poultry) (Melisch <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Kolipaka 2006, Cutter and Cutter 2009, Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). Poisoning, trapping and clubbing seem to be common methods to kill Fishing Cats across the species’ range. A survey in West Bengal recorded 27 deaths of Fishing Cats between April 2010 and May 2011 in that year in the Howrah district (1,600 km²) (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In Bangladesh, a compilation of reports from newspaper articles and web-based searches on the Fishing Cat (deaths, captures, rescues and releases) revealed 82 records and 30 confirmed deaths over a three-year period from January 2010 to March 2013 (Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). In both areas, almost all deaths could be traced to local people killing the cats (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). It should be taken as the minimum number killed because not all instances are recorded. In the Sundarbans of India, local people from Sagar Island admitted to having exterminated the cat from their island (Mukherjee <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). Chowdhury <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2015) noted that in Bangladesh and India more than 70% of the deaths occurred during the dry season, perhaps when Fishing Cat and human resources overlap maximally. A recent study (Adhya 2015) in the Howrah district of West Bengal reveals that Fishing Cat diet is largely composed of small mammals, fish and birds with a negligible portion (less than 5%) comprising of livestock and surmises that the killings are based on a perception of conflict because of the presence of the cat.<br/><br/>In Cambodia the Fishing Cat is killed by locals for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Such killings probably occur throughout its Southeast Asian range.","Fishing Cat populations and habitat in Southeast Asia are severely stressed and the species’ current stronghold is in eastern and southern parts of South Asia. According to Melisch <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1996), in West Java, Fishing Cat populations were fragmented and restricted to coastal areas. However, this was in the 1990s and the evidence was based solely on visual identification of tracks and scats, which may not be reliable; the last photographic evidence of the species in the wild on Java dates to 2000 (A. Compost <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2012). The Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016). It is unclear the extent, if any, to which these surveys covered microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat. In sum, it is impossible to speculate on current population size in Java, if the species even survives there at all. In Viet Nam the species is perhaps extinct in most or even all of its former range but it was confirmed to persist in the Mekong Delta until at least 2000 (Willcox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). It is not known if it ever occurred in the Red River Delta; given general levels of hunting and persecution in the country it seems unlikely that any large population remains anywhere in Viet Nam (Daniel Willcox <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). <br/><br/>In Thailand too, the species seems to be highly localised and recent surveys and incidental records suggest that it is restricted to coastal parts of Central and Southern Thailand (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Buatip <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Tantipisanuh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). There is at least one historical Thai specimen identified as this species from well inland (Duckworth <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010), but the extent to which the species ever occurred widely across inland Thailand, if at all, remains unclear. Outside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, coastal Thailand, (Cutter 2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared Fishing Cats due to poaching and unknown causes over her three-year study period.<br/><br/>Its presence in the Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar was recently confirmed (Than Zaw pers. comm. 2016), but there is no indication of the population size there, although given the extent of the habitat it could be large. <br/><br/>Extensive camera-trapping in the general area of the only historical locality record from Myanmar, the Hukaung Valley, did not find the species, but camera-traps were not set to target this species, so it is unclear whether it persists there (Than Zaw <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South Asia, the Fishing Cat is currently widespread in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The Pakistan population of Fishing Cat was feared to be close to extinction (Roberts 1977), but there are camera-trap records of Fishing Cat from the Chotiari Reservoir in the Sindh Province of Pakistan (Islam <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015) and recent reports of individuals being sold in local markets in Karachi (Faraz Zubairi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). In Sri Lanka and in India there are small populations of Fishing Cat in densely human-populated urban areas (Adhya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Ratnayaka 2016). In Nepal it occurs along a narrow stretch bounding India, in the Terai region (Sagar Dahal <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). It seems to be relatively safe in some protected areas in India, especially those under the Project Tiger scheme, such as Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, at the Indo-Nepal border and the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve bordering Bangladesh. In Bangladesh the Fishing Cat seems to be relatively safe in mangrove forests of the Sundarbans and in the north-eastern swamps (Rahman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). However, on both sides of the India-Bangladesh border, very few surveys have been undertaken to assess the status and distribution of the Fishing Cat across the salinity gradient of the mangrove region.<br/><br/>A molecular analysis of population connectivity in India suggested that in the past Fishing Cat populations within India were connected from the Terai region of the Himalayan foothills to the Coringa mangroves in Andhra Pradesh on the east coast (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). However, this analysis was restricted to the mitochondrial genome and is not comprehensive. Several small pockets of populations survive across the eastern coast and eastern states of India, and many are perhaps yet to be discovered (Adhya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Murthy Kantimahanti and Giridhar Malla <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2015). Similarly, in the western semi-arid part of India a recent record in Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve (Sadhu and Reddy 2013) and protected wetlands in the areas neighbouring Rajasthan such as Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary near Agra (Baiju Raj <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) suggest that populations either exist in pockets or are long-distance dispersers tracking suitable habitats. Extensive surveys are required to clarify this. Fishing Cat was thought to be extinct in Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Rajasthan, by 2007 (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), but a later survey recorded an individual, and though numbers may be drastically reduced, some individuals may still persist there (Mukherjee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Abrar Khan pers. comm. 2011). North-eastern India is another region where the species is recorded from pockets e.g. Manas (Qamar Qureshi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) and Kaziranga Tiger Reserves (Qamar Qureshi <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2016) in Assam and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Choudhury 2003, Aparajita Dutta <em><em>in litt.</em></em> 2012). Though there have been several camera-trap surveys in this region targeting Tiger, these may not have adequately covered the habitat of Fishing Cat. Focussed surveys along the several river courses in the region are required to gauge population connectivity and status of Fishing Cat.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and destruction along with the killing of Fishing Cats by local people throughout the species’ range has led to a global population decline suspected to be 30% or more, in the past 15 years (three generations). Outside the strongholds, declines may have been considerably steeper, but such populations are believed now to comprise such a small proportion of the global population that they will have negligible effect on the overall global population decline rate. Habitat destruction and retaliatory killings continue currently, and the process of reducing this loss through several measures is likely to be very slow. Irreversible losses of around 10% of Fishing Cat habitat in Sri Lanka, 10% in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion of India and Nepal and 30% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta are likely in the next 15 years. These rates being compounded by ongoing retaliatory killing, it is likely that in the next 15 years there will be a drop of a further 30% in the global population.",Decreasing,"The natural distribution of the Fishing Cat is unclear throughout its global range, with many unauthenticated, ambiguous and erroneous records clouding understanding (Pocock 1939, Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016, Duckworth 2016, Willcox 2016). In addition the species is not well recorded by typical modern general faunal surveys, meaning that absence of records from areas without specific Fishing Cat surveys should not be taken to imply absence of the species (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010, Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Appel 2016). Other factors also hinder determination of current range: putative introductions, sporadic records from regions not included in past distribution assessments, persistence in small pockets but with drastically reduced numbers and potentially amid areas of widespread extirpation, and possible recent extinctions through much of its range (Adhya <em>et al.</em> 2011, Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014, Adhya 2016, Duckworth 2016, Kantimahanti 2016, Mukherjee 2016, Willcox 2016). &#160;<br/><br/>The Fishing Cat is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia from Pakistan in the west to Cambodia in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to Sri Lanka and peninsular Thailand in the south. Its distribution was probably always patchy because of its strong association with wetlands. Current known occurrence is extremely localized across the range except for West Bengal in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.&#160; Results of a molecular analysis of Fishing Cat faeces from five protected areas in India indicated that in the past Fishing Cat populations were connected from the Terai in northern India to the Coringa mangroves on India's east coast; it is unknown whether contemporary populations are still connected physically (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mukherjee 2016). Also unknown is whether population units in the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands ecoregion at the base of the Himalayas are connected outside protected areas or along river courses.<br/><br/>More recently, the species has been recorded in areas where it was never observed before, such as in southern Andhra Pradesh, India, and in the far south of coastal Thailand. It had presumably been overlooked in these areas previously; they are unlikely to indicate recent range extension. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia its occurrence is likely to be extremely patchy in Viet Nam, Lao PDR (if it occurs there at all), Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Java, Indonesia.<br/><br/>Detailed country-wise distributions are provided below:<br/><br/>Pakistan: this population was thought to be close to extinction in the early 1970s (Roberts 1977), but Islam <em>et al.</em> (2015) camera-trapped individuals in the Chotiari Reservoir area in the Sanghar District of Sindh Province. There are also reports of individuals being sold and seized in a wildlife market in Karachi (Bhatti 2015, Faraz Ubairi <em>in litt.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Nepal: intensive camera trapping surveys for Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> monitoring since 2008 corroborated the Fishing Cat's presence in Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in the far western Terai, but failed to record it in Bardia National Park (Babu Ram Lamichhane and Shailendra Yadav pers. comm. 2016). It is present in and around Jagadishpur Reservoir, a Ramsar site in south-western Nepal (Dahal <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in Chitwan National Park in the central Terai (Dahal and Dahal 2011, Mishra 2016). In south-eastern Nepal, it has been recorded in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (Pandey <em>et al.</em> 2012, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2016, Sagar Dahal and Angie Appel <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Whether these populations are connected outside protected areas remains unknown.<br/><br/>India: protected areas hosting Fishing Cat populations include Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Baiju Raj <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Corbett Tiger Reserve, Uttarakhand (Abishek Harihar <em>in litt.</em> 2012), Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in West Bengal (Yadavendradev Jhala <em>in litt.</em> 2015), Keoladeo Ghana National Park (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012) and Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan (Sadhu and Reddy 2013), Kaziranga Karbi Anglong Landscape (Jimmy Borah <em>in litt.</em> 2012) and Manas Tiger Reserve in Assam (Qamar Qureshi <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar (Qamar Qureshi <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary in Andhra Pradesh (Mukherjee <em>et al.</em> 2012, Malla and Sivakumar 2014) and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh (Aparajita Datta <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Outside protected areas, records exist from Pilibhit Forest Division in Uttar Pradesh (Meraj Anwar <em>in litt.</em> 2011), in small wetland patches in West Bengal near Kolkata and its suburbs like the Howrah and Hooghly districts (Anonymous 1989, Adhya <em>et al.</em> 2011), in Medinipur and Nadia districts and in the human-dominated north-eastern part of Chilika Lake and Tangi district in Odisha (Tiasa Adhya <em>in litt.</em> 2016). The Fishing Cat has also been recorded recently in areas lacking historical records viz. the Krishna River mangroves in Andhra Pradesh (Kantimahanti 2016). There are also historical statements of occurrence in the Western Ghats and the western coast of India (Pocock 1939), which have not been confirmed by recent targeted searches and may have been in error (Janardhanan <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In the Duars of north-eastern India, superficially suitable habitat may extend into Bhutan, but a number of general surveys there have not recorded the species (e.g. Tempa <em>et al.</em> 2013, Banerjee and Bandopadhyay 2016).<br/><br/>Sri Lanka: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas along the coast and in the island's interior (Andrew Kittle <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Individuals have also been recorded in densely human-populated urban areas of Colombo and outside protected areas in Kandy, Mathle and Nuwaraeliya districts (Ratnayaka 2016, Thudugala 2016).<br/><br/>Bangladesh: Fishing Cat is present in protected areas of the Sundarbans (Rahman 2016, Adam Barlow pers. comm. 2016), in unprotected wetlands in the Brahmaputra river basin (Rahman and McCarthy 2014, Chowdhury <em>et al.</em> 2015) and in the Chittagong hill tracts (Chakma 2015, Karim and Ahsan 2016). However, Chakma (2015) obtained only three potential records of which two were pugmarks and one was a video from a camera-trap which was not authenticated as Fishing Cat and could have been a Leopard Cat P. bengalensis.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, there are only two certain field records: one from the early 20th century in the Hukaung Valley in the north, and one from Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary in the Ayeyarwady (= Irrawaddy) delta in or around 2015 (Than Zaw <em>in litt.</em> 2016). This corroborates reports that a few captive individuals in the country are said to be descendants of animals captured in or around the 1990s in the Ayeyarwady delta (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Thailand: during targeted surveys Fishing Cat was recorded inside Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park and Thale Noi Non-Hunting Area along the coast, but not in protected areas farther inland that were previously thought to harbour Fishing Cat (Cutter and Cutter 2009, Tantipisanuh <em>et al.</em> 2014). An incidental record came from the coast in southern Thailand (Buatip <em>et al.</em> 2013; confirmed by photograph examined by J.W. Duckworth and W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2016), which constitutes the southernmost valid record with a precise locality to date in mainland Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Cambodia: camera-trap records are scarce and limited to Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in the country's north-east (Rainey and Kong 2010), and mangrove habitats in Peam Krasaop Wildlife Sanctuary and Ream National Park on the coast (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). Despite extensive camera-trapping in eastern and northern Cambodia including Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary in recent years, Fishing Cat was not recorded. (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2012, Simon Mahood pers. comm. 2016). A kitten found orphaned in Botum-Sakor National Park was identified as Fishing Cat, but may have been a Leopard Cat (Royan 2009). Of many other claims in the last 15 years, most are certainly in error, but a critical evaluation of all has not been performed.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR most claims are either in certain error or non-assessable; only one sounds credible but this is a sight-record that cannot be validated (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Viet Nam: Fishing Cat may persist in the Mekong Delta, where it was last camera-trapped in 2000 (Willcox 2016). There is a very small possibility that it occurs in the Red River Delta (where it has never been confirmed), though there have been no targeted surveys to be confident of genuine absence or local extinction (Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Indonesia: it is known to have occurred only along the west and north coast of Java within 15 km of the coast (Sody 1936, Melisch <em>et al.</em> 1996), but there are no records of wild-living individuals since 2000. The inferences of Melisch <em>et al.</em> (1996) are based on a single track and some scats, neither of which can be treated as conclusive evidence. Alain Compost photographed Fishing Cats in Java in the 1990s and suggested that some may still survive in the Banten Bay region and in Ujung Kulon National Park (Alain Compost <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Until 2000, he photographed Fishing Cats in Pulau Dua Bird Sanctuary, a protected mangrove forest on the northern coast, but learned of all Fishing Cats been poisoned there by 2006 (Alain Compost <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Fishing Cat was not recorded during intensive camera-trapping targeting Javan Rhinoceros <em>Rhinoceros sondaicus</em> in Ujung Kulon National Park (Jim Sanderson <em>in litt.</em> 2016); the overlap, if any, of camera-trap stations with microhabitat suitable for Fishing Cat is not known.<br/><br/>There is no certain record from Sumatra, but historical testimony from a hunter who was familiar with the species from Java, and a captive individual in the 2000s in a local zoo indicate that the species might inhabit the island (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009, contra Sanderson 2009).<br/><br/>Occurrence in Peninsular Malaysia is also open to doubt (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009), but the Thai locality record in Buatip <em>et al.</em> (2013) is very close to the Malaysian border. Past claims for Borneo, Taiwan and China lack any credible basis (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Jutzeler <em>et al.</em> 2010). <br/><br/>The species is known from sea level in parts of its range, and in the northern parts it is likely to occur only in the lowlands. Recent reliable elevation records in the Terai of India and Nepal are all from below 150 m, such as Pilibhit Forest Division and Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (Meraj Anwar <em>in litt.</em> 2016), Jagadishpur Reservoir area, Chitwan National Park (Dahal <em>et al.</em> 2015, Dahal and Dahal 2012) and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve area (Angie Appel <em>in litt.</em> 2016), except one at 330 m on the southern edge of Corbett Tiger Reserve (Abishek Harihar <em>in litt.</em> 2012). However, Pocock (1939) accepted a Fishing Cat skin from Barkot near Dehra Dun on the banks of the upper Yamuna river as evidence of at least occasional high-altitude occurrence at about 5,000 ft (ca. 1,500 m), but did not explain whether this individual was killed there, or whether there was any possibility that, while a skin had been procured at that altitude, the animal had originated elsewhere. In Sri Lanka, Fishing Cat has been recorded at elevations up to 1,800 m (Ashan Thudugala <em>in litt.</em> 2016). However, the Sri Lankan altitudinal range seems to be an exception as all other authentic locality records are much lower than that.","The Fishing Cat is killed for consumption and a very recent report from Howrah district, India, reveals the rampant killing of the species outside protected areas in human-dominated landscapes for consumption as part of a cultural practice. Such cases most often go unnoticed or are ignored unless some interested people and non-governmental organisations pursue the case until the perpetrators are convicted (Adhya 2015). In Cambodia, the Fishing Cat is killed by local people for consumption or in retaliation for damaging fishing nets (Thaung and Herranz Muñoz 2016). In Thailand a radio-telemetry study (Cutter 2015) demonstrated that poaching is a major threat when five of 16 radio-collared individuals were killed by poachers (for consumption and retaliation) within the three-year study period. Cutter (2015) documented 84% mortality of radio-collared individuals attributed to poaching and unknown causes. Opportunistic trading of skins and potentially other parts is likely to occur in mainland Southeast Asia, where such trading is at very high levels and involves a wide diversity of species (e.g. Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2014), but there is no evidence of its being particularly sought after there. Similarly, in Java individuals are sometimes seen in the island’s intensive live animal (‘pet’) trade (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2009), but again there is no indication that it is (yet) a specific target.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Fishing Cat is included in CITES Appendix II and protected by national legislation over most of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. In Viet Nam Fishing Cat has the highest level of protection under the main species protection law (decree 32/2006/ND-CP) and is included in appendix I B. This completely prohibits any exploitation or commercial trade. There is no protection afforded outside protected areas in Nepal (Karan B. Shah, pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Since 1985, the Fishing Cat has been confirmed to occur in protected areas (but it should not be assumed necessarily to survive in all) including the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and India; Suklaphanta, Chitwan and Koshi Tappu in Nepal; Corbett, Dudwha, Keoladeo Ghana, Coringa and Kaziranga in India; Yala, Wilpattu, Maduru Oya, Horton Plains, Dunumadallawa, Kalametiya, Sinharaja, Bundala and Uda Walawe in Sri Lanka; Khao Sam Roi Yot and Thale Noi in Thailand; Kulen Promtep, Peam Krasaop and Ream in Cambodia. Several wetlands that hold Fishing Cat populations are listed under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of important wetlands, e.g. Sundarbans in Bangladesh, Chilika Lake, Keoladeo Ghana and East Kolkata Wetlands in India, Jagadishpur Reservoir in Nepal and Chotiari Reservoir in Pakistan.<br/><br/>The survival of the species depends on adequate protection of remaining wetlands in Asia, and prevention of indiscriminate trapping, snaring and poisoning.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Climate change also poses a threat to the species, as the dry seasons are becoming longer and the rainy season has become more erratic and unpredictable.

Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout this species' range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type.

A forest fragment outside the reserve where this species was recorded is entirely surrounded by cleared land  (C. Vásquez Almazán pers. comm. March 2011). The edges of the reserve itself are under increasing pressure from human encroachment from both the resident population and new communities migrating into the area. The extraction of timber from forest at the reserve edge is widespread, and in some areas so intensive that the forest is completely cleared and subsequently converted to agriculture (C. Vásquez Almazán pers. comm. March 2011). Forests further into the reserve are exploited for ferns and other forest products (C. Vásquez Almazán pers. comm.

Vásquez Almazán pers. comm. March 2011). However, the difficulty in finding these animals in drier conditions suggests that this species is highly sensitive to humidity, and as it is wholly reliant on good-quality cloud forest it will be rapidly driven to extinction if climate change modifies this habitat beyond its ability to persist.<br/><br/>The pathogenic amphibian chytrid fungus has been detected in this area (C.

Nevertheless, land conversion and forest degradation throughout its small range suggest that overall the population is likely to be declining. The effects of climate change are unclear, but large numbers of individuals are only found in years with unusually high rainfall, and the species cannot be found at all in the dry conditions which are increasingly frequent in this region (C.

There are inferred to be fewer than 1,000 mature individuals (and certainly fewer than 10,000) in the population. Colonies are usually small, numbering only a few individuals. The greatest number of mature individuals counted at a single site was ± 40. All recorded colonies are suspected to comprise the same subpopulation. An ongoing decline is inferred to be taking place as a result of loss of habitat due to poor land-use management practices, mining activities, agricultural intensification as well as infestation by alien invasive plant species. Further field surveys and vetting of museum records are needed to more accurately delimit the distribution range of the species. Currently, we list the species as Vulnerable C2a(ii) and D1.</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">The species mainly occurs in the Mesic Highveld Grassland Bioregion but also occurs in the Lowveld Bioregion and the Central Bushveld Bioregion. Key roosting sites include subterranean habitats like caves and old mine adits. They have been recorded day-roosting in rock crevices and fissures, and are occasionally observed in old buildings. Thus its occurrence is in most cases subject to suitable sheltered and/or subterranean habitats. Regions with rock habitats that form cavities are of utmost importance for the survival of this species. Artificially created habitat such as abandoned mine or prospecting shafts/tunnels within various vegetation types also serve as important/essential habitat sanctuaries. <em>Rhinolophus cohenae</em> requires suitable natural habitat outside roost sites for foraging. Individuals are normally encountered in very small groups of which around 40 was the highest number counted at one locality consisting of a maze of old mine tunnels.&#160;</p>","The Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) mapped all development applications received at a cadastral scale over a 14-year period (2000-2014), which showed that greatest pressure for land-use change has come from prospecting applications (54% of the land surface area) and mining (25% of land surface area) (Lötter <em>et al</em>. 2014). A major threat within this species’ range is mining (legal, illegal and recommissioning of old mines). Future developments at the above rates or even higher are likely to cause further detriment towards natural ecosystems and processes and in particular, disturb or destroy foraging grounds and roosting and maternity sites, or alter key micro-climates needed by the species. Additionally, loss of natural habitat around roost sites through poor land-use management practices, (such as inappropriate burning regimes, overgrazing and alteration of vegetation structure negatively affect foraging areas and prey base), land development activities including agricultural intensification (Driver <em>et al</em>. 2012), and alien invasive plant infestations are causing a decline in available habitat for foraging.<br/><br/>Climate change may also influence micro-climate distribution. This species is very dependent on suitable subterranean environments for roosting and maternity requirements and associated natural habitats for foraging. These sites are limited throughout its distribution range and beyond. The effects of climate change can severely impact on the survival of this species if the above is not provided for and not adequate for habitation any more.","<p><span lang=""EN-ZA"">In total, 240 individuals have been counted in surveys but this is an underestimate.

It is  diurnal, despite earlier statements that it was nocturnal.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, this species is found in evergreen forest (including degraded areas), mainly near water; most of the recent records are from hill and mountainous areas (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Thailand, Cambodia and southern Viet Nam this species is found in&#160;similar habitats and&#160;also in deciduous forest and down to the plains (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). In India it occurs&#160;in lowland wet evergreen forest, secondary forest and areas around industrial areas (e.g., oil refineries). In&#160;some countries, there are records from rice fields and other agricultural areas, and even near human settlements (Pham-Chong-Ahn 1980, Thapa 2013). Little is known about its breeding, although the gestation period is thought to be about nine weeks; probably meaning that this species reproduces more slowly than does <em>Herpestes javanicus </em>(sensu lato; Lekagul and McNeely 1977). It feeds on fish, frogs, crabs, molluscs, insects and crayfish (Van Rompaey 2001). <br/><br/>In some areas it is readily approached by people because of&#160;its apparent near-sightedness (Van Rompaey 2001) and fearlessness (Pocock 1941), but in areas where hunting with projectiles and/or dogs is common it is shy and not approachable, e.g. Lao PDR (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014). It has lived up to 13 years and four months in captivity (Jones 1982). Wang and Fuller (2001) studied its&#160;ecology in a rural agricultural area of southeastern China (near the village&#160;of&#160;Taohong in northern Jiangxi province), from April 1993 to November 1994. Wang and Fuller (2003) studied its food habits in this area&#160;between June 1992 and November 1994, by analysing its faeces; it ate mammals, reptiles, insects and crustaceans. In Taiwan, Chuang and Lee (1997) found that it ate mainly crustaceans, insects, amphibians and reptiles. It remains little studied elsewhere.","In northern Southeast Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, southeast China and perhaps Myanmar), hunting is probably the main potential threat to Crab-eating Mongoose. This is widespread and intense, particularly in Lao PDR and Viet Nam but, even there, this species persists widely, including in areas with heavy human use. As a ground-dwelling animal, potentially suffering from widespread market-driven trapping in this region (where many other species have declined steeply), this suggests a strong resilience. However, it is evidently absent from, or at least very rare in, the plains of Lao PDR. These are more accessible&#160;than are the hills&#160;and, in general, hunting of mammals has been even more damaging in them. The rarity or absence there of&#160;Crab-eating Mongoose&#160;might reflect hunting-led extirpation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); this is probably more likely than a natural absence from such areas, given the species' occurrence in lowland plains parts of Cambodia and Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). There is no demand for its meat in restaurants in Viet Nam (S. Roberton pers. comm. 2008) and no evidence of directed hunting of the species. Retaliatory killing for raiding poultry on farms occurs, but is not a&#160;population-level&#160;threat.&#160;There are no records from wholly agricultural or otherwise anthropogenic landscapes, indicating a degree of dependence on forest. Many recent records are, however, from highly fragmented and/or degraded forest. In Nepal and, formerly, in Viet Nam there are records from agricultural land (Pham-Chong-Anh 1980, Thapa 2013); nowadays, in its core range of northern Southeast Asia,&#160;such areas are mostly&#160;heavily hunted and are unlikely to support resident populations. It is possible that the species is widely excluded from farmland by hunting. In sum, with the exclusion of outright deforestation, the threats to this species from habitat change (degradation and fragmentation) are mainly indirect, through the increased hunting and trading that occurs in accompaniment over most of Southeast Asia.","Crab-eating Mongoose is common in Northeast India, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand (Choudhury 1997ab,&#160;Duckworth 1997,&#160;Choudhury&#160;1999, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).  However, in some parts of the periphery of its range, it is believed to be uncommon, e.g. Jalpaiguiri District, Bengal, India (Inglis <em>et al</em>. 1919), Bangladesh (Khan 1982), Nepal (Thapa 2013) and Malaysia (Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013). This species is one of the most frequently detected small carnivores during both camera-trapping and direct-observation surveys (the majority of data unpublished) in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, in quite a sharp contrast to another ground-dwelling species of similar habitat use, Large Indian Civet <em>Viverra zibetha</em>; this is highly suggestive of much greater resiliency to the current levels of hunting pressure (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).",Decreasing,"Crab-eating Mongoose is found in southeast China including Taiwan, Nepal, Bhutan,&#160;Bangladesh,&#160;Northeast India and all countries of mainland Southeast Asia (e.g., Duckworth 1997, Van Rompaey 2001, Wang and Fuller 2001,&#160;Wang and Fuller&#160;2003, Duckworth and Robichaud 2005, Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Jennings and Veron 2011, Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2011, Choudhury 2013, Thapa 2013). In Malaysia, it has been recorded south only to Terengganu (Hedges&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;It is altitudinally wide-ranging. Although there are apparently few records from high mountains (Van Rompaey 2001), it has been collected at 1,650 m asl (Kurseong, Bengal, India; Pocock 1941), with records from up to at least 1,800 m asl (Jennings and Veron 2011). Its range extends down to sea level in at least Hong Kong.","In northern Southeast Asia Crab-eating Mongoose is subject to widespread heavy hunting as part of the general take from non-selective trapping methods. There is no evidence of directed harvest. General hunting levels are lower to the south and west of its range, although there is some evidence of targeted hunting of mongoose species in India where the hairs are used to make traditional paint brushes.",Terrestrial,"This species is protected in China, Thailand, Myanmar and Peninsular Malaysia.

The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour </strong>Most populations of this species are fully migratory and migrate to wintering grounds from late-August to November, returning north from February-May, and arriving again on breeding grounds between March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) with breeding occurring between May and August (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds in separate territories in solitary pairs or family groups (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998), although in favourable habitat nests may be placed as close as 30-35 m apart (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species is usually seen singly (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) although it may occur in groups on migration and in the Autumn it sometimes associates with Spotted Crake <em>Porzana porzana</em> (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in the lowlands (up to 2,000 m) in temperate and steppe zones (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), extending into boreal regions if conditions are favourable (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It inhabits natural or semi-natural eutrophic freshwater wetlands with still or slow-flowing water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), and requires tall stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. <em>Scirpus</em>, <em>Typha</em>, <em>Carex</em>, <em>Sparganium</em> and <em>Phragmites</em>) (Taylor and van Perlo 1998) in or near fairly deep water in which to breed, preferably with a mixture of dead and living stems and a layer of broken stems at ground or water level (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Suitable habitats include the margins of lakes and rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), small pools and oxbows in regularly inundated floodplains (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), marshes (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), flooded woodland (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) such as alder <em>Alnus</em> coppices (Taylor and van Perlo 1998) and flooded rice-fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season this species inhabits flooded rice-fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), seasonally flooded grasslands (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), swamps and small pools overgrown with reeds, bulrushes, sedges and rank grass (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986), and sewage ponds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species may occur in more atypical habitats on migration (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). <strong>Diet </strong>The diet of this species consists mostly of insects (especially waterbeetles, Hemiptera, Neuroptera, and adult and larval Diptera), as well as the seeds and shoots of aquatic plants (<em>Carex</em>, <em>Sparganium</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> and <em>Nymphaea</em>), worms, gastropods, spiders and water mites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a shallow cup of plant matter (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) placed in thick vegetation on or near water (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986), or occasionally raised on a tussock or platform of dead material, preferably in sites only accessible by swimming (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). <strong>Management information </strong>The species prefers to breed in tall reedbeds that are not regularly cut or burnt (i.e. with mixtures of dead or living stems) (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).","In its breeding range the species is threatened by wetland degradation and destruction such as lake drainage for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian <em>et al.</em> 2002), and intensive reed harvesting (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).","The European population is estimated at 55,000-82,900 calling or lekking males, which equates to 110,000-166,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Holmes pers. comm. 2011). The cutting of large trees for timber is taking place in every forest reserve or protected area that has high quality wood, even within the Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park (B. Wilson pers. comm. 2020). Selective harvesting of Red Canela (Mountain Cinnamon) at higher elevations within the national park may be causing fragmentation of this species' habitat (D. Calder pers. comm. 2020). Loss of forest cover may lead to a reduction in humidity, which may also impact this species.&#160;<br/><br/>Threats outside the park include pollution from pesticides used in coffee  farming. However, it is thought that the population may be resilient to this degree of habitat disturbance (S. Koenig pers. comm. 2011). Disturbance as a result of tourist activities is also a threat, since visitors to the park have a marked influence on the habitat and leave a great deal of litter behind along trails; however, at this time this is considered to be a relatively minor threat (I.

The habitats throughout its range have experienced ≥30% loss and degradation, and human population size in the range countries increased by 120% during the same period. The species, however, still has a wide distribution, is adaptable and can persist in some degraded habitats such as farmbush as long as hunting pressure is low or non-existent. The predicted future trajectory for populations of <em>Cercopithecus campbelli</em> is an accelerated rate of decline as larger-bodied primates are being depleted from their shared forests</p><p></p>","<p>Campbell’s Monkey is found in a wide variety of habitats, including lowland forest, gallery forest, mangroves, woodland, woody savanna and farrow lands (Oates 2011, Campbell 2013). It also occurs in secondary forest, in areas of subsistence agriculture, and in farmbush. The highest elevation area where this species occurs is the lower latitudinal locations (up to 600 m) in the Guinea Highlands. The estimated home range size for two groups in Taï NP was 52 ha and 67 ha (Buzzard and Eckardt 2007). <em>C. campbelli</em> mainly feeds on fruits and insects. In Taï NP, the diet of this species was found to be 46% fruits, 33% animal matter and 8% leaves (Buzzard 2006). Foraging for insects often involved unrolling curled-up leaves.<br/><br/>The typical group structure is a one-male group, but the species is sometimes found in multi-male groups, and all-male groups outside heterosexual groups have been observed (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985, Buzzard 2006). In Taï NP in 1976, mean group size was 11.4 individuals (5–33, N=8) (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985), but had decreased to 9.3 (N=3) in 2001 (Buzzard and Eckardt 2007). Group size in Guinea-Bissau ranged from 1–20 (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003). On Tiwai Island, mean group size recorded in 1982–1984 was 14 (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990).<br/><br/>This species is preyed upon by Leopards (<em>Panthera pardus</em>), Western Chimpanzees (<em>Pan</em> <em>troglodytes verus</em>), and Crowned Hawk-eagles (<em>Stephanoaetus coronatus</em>) (Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002).</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Cercopithecus</em> <em>campbelli</em> has been impacted by, first and foremost, bushmeat hunting, and secondly, habitat loss. <br/><br/>Due to its relatively small body size, it was not a prime target for hunters until quite recently, but because the larger-bodied primates such as the Upper Guinea Red Colobus (<em>Piliocolobus badius</em>) and the King Colobus (<em>Colobus polykomos</em>) have been decimated or even extirpated from many areas due to unregulated hunting, even this small-bodied guenon (adult male ~4.5 kg) has now become a target for hunters. In Mount Nimba, Liberia, Bené <em>et al</em>. (2013) monitored hunters’ activities in 2009–2011 and found a high rate (0.7 per km) of encountering hunters carrying the carcasses of this species. In Konobo District in Liberia on the border with Côte d’Ivoire, an unsustainable level of hunting is taking place (Covey and McGraw 2014). During Tweh <em>et al</em>.’s (2015) primate surveys, conducted across Liberia in August-December 2010, hunting signs (empty cartridges, gunshots, poachers’ camps, and snares) were the most frequently observed anthropogenic signs. Due to unregulated hunting, logging and mining operations, the Lagoas de Cufada NP in Guinea-Bissau is becoming an “empty forest” (Starin 2010). Minhós <em>et al</em>.’s (2013) study using a DNA bar-coding method estimated that 1,550 individual primates, which included<em> C. campbelli</em>, sold in two markets in Guinea-Bissau, were consumed by the inhabitants during the 2010 dry season. Hunting pressure has been exacerbated by an increase of 120% in human population size in the habitat countries during the last three decades (World Bank 2019).<br/><br/>Habitat loss through deforestation and forest fragmentation is due to creation of road networks, agriculture and mining (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003, Starin 2010, Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013, Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). This species once thrived in disturbed habitats and farmbush, but many of these habitats have been converted to plantations of non-native species.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Cercopithecus</em> <em>campbelli</em> is still common in some areas, although its total geographic range has been reduced by deforestation, forest fragmentation and forest conversion. In Senegal, other than the fact that this species is present in the Parc National de Basse Casamance and several forest reserves, information on this species is scarce (P.I. Ndiaye pers. comm. 2019). In Guinea-Bissau, the species is still widespread except in the highest latitudinal areas in the northeast (Limoges 1989 cited in Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003, Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013), but Bersacola <em>et al</em>.’s (2018) survey in 2015 at Dulombi and Paiai in Dulombi National Park found low encounter rates of 0.38 and 0.18 groups per km, respectively. This species is widespread and still common also in many parts of Guinea, even though hunting pressure is increasing, while many forests are fragmented and degraded (Campbell 2013, WCF 2015a).<br/><br/>In Sierra Leone,<em> C. campbelli</em> occurs at Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary (hereafter Tiwai), the Gola Forest National Park, Loma Mountains Forest Reserve (FR), Bumbuna in northern Sierra Leone, where the hydroelectric dam is being upgraded, and several other protected areas. Encounter rates vary between 0.02 to 0.54 groups per km (Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2015, Ganas-Swaray <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the early 1980s, population density at Tiwai was 39-44 per km² (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990). In Gola Forest NP, surveys made before and after the 1991–2001 civil war obtained various group sighting data (Davies 1987, Klop <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lindsell <em>et al</em>. 2011). For example, Klop <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported an average encounter rate of 0.34 groups per km for their surveys conducted between October 2005 and June 2007, but the use of different survey methods and the manner in which auditory and visual sighting data were presented in different reports make it impossible to gauge with precision any changes in population numbers of this species. Nevertheless, Lindsell <em>et al</em>. (2011) concluded that primates “continue to have healthy populations in the forest… and showed little or no sign of reduced abundance"". For this reason, the data are still insufficient to assess the current status of this species across the rest of Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>In Liberia, this species occurs in a number of protected areas including North Lorma National Park, Gola National Park, Grebo-Krahn National Park, Krahn-Bassa National Forest, and Sapo National Park. Group encounter rates obtained in the early 2000s in all of these forests were in the range of 0.10–0.33 (Waitkuwait 2003, Barrie <em>et al</em>. 2007, Vogt 2011, WCF 2015b).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire,<em> C. campbelli</em> occurs in several protected areas including Goulaleu and Krozialé Forêt Classées (FC or Classified Forests), Taï National Park, Goin-Débé FC, Cavally FC (Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002, Normand 2010, Kramoko <em>et al</em>. 2017) and community forests. However, Campbell’s Monkey appears to have been extirpated from Monogaga FC, Rapide Grah FC, Mont Péko NP, Kani-Bandaman Rouge FC, Séguéla FC and Koba FC, as all were converted into cocoa plantations (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015). The most important population is found in Taï NP, where a density of 24.4 individuals per km² was reported more than 15 years ago (Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002). More recent surveys conducted in Goin-Débé FC found that encounter rates had declined from 1.65 groups per km in 2007 to 1.31 in 2009–2010, and from 3.08 to 1.93 in Cavally FC (Normand 2010). Outside the protected areas in Côte d’Ivoire, this species persists even in areas where hunting occurs regularly (Soiret <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Campbell’s Monkey ranges from the Gambia and Senegal, just north of the Casamance River in the west, through Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to the Cavally River on the Côte d’Ivoire-Liberia border in the east (Oates 2011). Between the Cavally and Sassandra-Nzo Rivers in western Côte d’Ivoire is a region where individuals of this species and of <em>Cercopithecus</em> lowei occur, as well as individuals with intermediate features (Oates 1988, 2011). This species also occurs on the island of Caravela in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003).</p>","<p>Campbell’s Monkey is hunted for bushmeat in all its range countries (see Threats). It costs 2,000 CFA (equivalent of US$ 3.6 as of 2019) to purchase four or five pieces of monkey meat at a market in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau (Starin 2010), while a small individual of this species is sold for about 3,000 CFA (US$ 5.3), and an adult male for 5,000 CFA (US$ 8.8) in markets in southwestern Côte d’Ivoire (S. Soiret pers. comm. 2019).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Cercopithecus campbelli</em> is listed on Appendix II of CITES and Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.<br/><br/>This species occurs in many protected areas in its geographic range (e.g., Gola Forest NP, Loma Mountains NP, and Tiwai Island in Sierra Leone; Sapo NP and Grebo NP in Liberia; Taï NP in Côte d'Ivoire), but anti-poaching enforcement is poor in Sapo NP and in the northern sections of Taï NP away from the research station. Rigorous law enforcement against poaching and in protected areas is needed throughout the range.

Hunting is an additional pressure. <p></p>","It is resident in tall, wet, natural grasslands, particularly those dominated by <em>Phragmites</em>,<em> Arundo</em>, <em>Saccharum</em> and <em>Narenga</em>, and also occurs (at lower densities) in wet agricultural areas dominated by sugarcane and paddy interspersed with natural vegetation. Surveys in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Nepal, recorded seasonal shifts  in habitat preference, with woodland-grassland and wet grassland  favoured in the breeding season and summer, and dry grassland and  woodland preferred in the monsoon season (Dahal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). It is predominantly known from the lowlands (generally below 250 m), but moves to slightly higher altitudes during periods of high flood. Its range size is small compared with other Galliformes, offering hope for the species's conservation. A matrix of habitat including some agricultural areas is capable of supporting the species; however, in human-modified areas retention of some natural grassland habitat associated with wet areas appears to be critical <strong></strong>(Iqubal <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2003).<br/><p></p>","Most remaining habitat within its range is subject to intense pressures from drainage for agriculture, human encroachment, fire, grass harvesting, grazing by domestic stock (especially during chick rearing), commercial forestry plantations and dam and irrigation schemes. Significant populations reported from outside the protected areas in Assam in the 1990s (Choudhury 2000) have virtually vanished in recent years due to conversion of habitat into farmland (A. Choudhury<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2012). Hunting and trapping for sport (cock fighting), food and the aviculture trade also occur (A. Rahmani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Agricultural pesticides may be affecting its numbers, either through direct mortality or the reduction in potential food sources (invertebrates), and poisoning of wetlands for fishing is a threat reported from Nepal <strong></strong>(Singh 2004). The drying out of swampy areas during the breeding season represents a threat that may become more severe owing to climate change. In August 2008, the Koshi River breached its eastern bank, resulting in the flooding of 3-4 km<sup>2</sup> of habitat in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Nepal. Work to repair the breach brought construction traffic and labourers into the reserve, with a subsequent increase in hunting levels. A decrease in sightings of this species in the affected area suggests that birds had shifted to alternative habitat elsewhere (Dahal 2009). A negative correlation between numbers of this species and numbers of people present in part of Koshi Tappu suggests that disturbance and/or habitat alteration may significantly impact the species; however, the same effect was not found for the presence of livestock (Dahal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><p></p>","The population size is preliminarily estimated to fall into the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.

Dowell <em>in litt.</em> 2007, Dai Bo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). <p></p>","Until recently the main threat was habitat destruction through commercial clear-felling of primary forest, as most remaining primary broadleaved forest within its known range was at risk from logging within 20-25 years. In 1998, a government-imposed ban on logging in the upper Yangtze Basin led to a complete halt in deforestation throughout its range <strong></strong>(<strong></strong>S.

There is now a major forest plantation scheme in operation aiming to re-forest ridges and steeper slopes <strong></strong>(S. Dowell <em>in litt.</em> 2007).  In general though, habitat is still declining (S. Dowell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). In some areas, forest is still being cleared for agriculture or illegally logged, although this is on a small scale. Many people enter the forest to collect bamboo shoots, firewood and medicinal plants in spring and early autumn, which creates substantial disturbance during the breeding season, and additional disturbance is caused by livestock either grazing in, or moving through, the forest. It is also illegally hunted. Hydroelectric schemes and the resulting reservoirs in the valleys below its mountain forest habitat cause indirect future threats as the people they displace will be moved to higher locations in close proximity to the remaining forest, putting it under increased pressure <strong></strong>(S. Dowell <em>in litt.</em> 2007). <p></p>","Surveys in 1996 and 1997 estimated densities of 0.48 and 0.24 calling males per km<sup>2</sup>, respectively.

Although reliable, this is the highest density recorded for this species and it is known to occur at much lower densities further west, so it is probable that Laojunshan represents optimal habitat within the bird's preferred altitudinal range (about 1000 to 2000 m).  Nevertheless, the 1996/7  population estimate is likely to be too low, hence it is best placed in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.

Some forestry practices may be of benefit to its conservation, notably leaving strips of primary forest along ridge tops and replanting with native broadleaved trees. In 2001, Laojunshan Nature Reserve (35 km<sup>2</sup>) in Pingshan County was established specifically to protect Sichuan Partridge and this reserve now contains the highest known population densities of this species.

Apparently suitable habitat is widely available throughout its range, yet it is never common, thus its rarity remains unexplained. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is mostly sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992)<strong></strong>, but moves seasonally within wetlands, apparently in response to rains (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a), which cause seasonal variation in habitat conditions (Tyler 2005)<strong></strong>. However the movements are in general poorly understood. It occurs year-round in some areas (such as Zambia) where it is not known to breed  (Tyler 2005<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span>Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Occasional records from Malawi, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa indicate that the species has a tendency to vagrancy (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).<strong> </strong>Breeding appears to be irregular, but most often occurs during the months of March-June, coinciding with high flood-levels (Randall and Herremans 1994, Harrison <em>et al.</em> 1997, S. J. Tyler <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. It breeds in small colonies of 1-60 nests, and usually forages in small groups of 4-8 individuals (Hancock and Kushlan 1984)<strong></strong>, although it may forage solitarily or occasionally in larger aggregations of up to 60 individuals (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Tyler 2005<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits river floodplains, marshes, and temporary shallow wetlands, preferring areas where water levels are receding from their seasonal peak (Hancock et al. 1978, Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It tends to avoid open water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), being most often found in areas where there is ample cover of short, emergent vegetation (Dowsett 1981, Martínez-Vilalta and Motis 1992) such as <em>Cynodon dactylon</em> and <em>Panicum repens</em> (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). The availability of this habitat is increased by fire and high grazing pressure, however there has so far been insufficient data to confirm important links between these factors and the species's abundance, although it has been observed to be more abundant on burnt floodplains, and it often occurs in association with Red Lechwe <em>Kobus leche</em> (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). It forages in water less than 10 cm in depth (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <em>Breeding</em> It breeds in temporary wetlands at the time of - or shortly after - maximum water levels (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Its preferred breeding habitat is <em>Phragmites</em> reedbed (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a), but it will also nest on islands of vegetation such as water figs <em>Ficus verruculosa</em>, <em>Acacia</em> spp. (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a, Reed 2006) and date (tsaro) palms <em>Phoenix reclinata </em>(Atkinson 2003<strong></strong>, Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006b).<strong> Diet </strong>When possible it feeds mainly on young fish (Dowsett 1981, Mathews and McQuaid 1983), especially cichlids (Hancock 2006c)<strong></strong>, but in temporary wetlands where fish do not occur, its diet consists of frogs, aquatic invertebrates (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a, 2006c)<strong></strong> and tadpoles (Mathews and McQuaid 1983<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,&#160;</span>Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Tyler 2005, Hancock 2006c<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>. It locates prey by sight in clear, shallow water (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a, 2006c)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Additionally it will glean snails from lily pads and uses ""standing flycatching"" to catch dragonflies and other insects (Mathews and McQuaid 1983, Kushlan and Hancock 2005<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>).&#160;<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span>It forages diurnally, often in association with other heron and wader species (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).<strong> Breeding Site </strong>The nest is a bowl lined with fine plant material (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006b), usually on a platform constructed from sticks, and the species shows high nest-site fidelity (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Clutch size has been recorded as 1-4 eggs, with a mean of 2.4 (n = 16) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a, 2006b)<strong></strong>, and the incubation period in one nest was recorded as 22-24 days<strong></strong> (Hancock 2006a).<strong> </strong> <p></p>","The wetlands inhabited by this species face many threats, including flood regulation (P. Leonard <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, water abstraction, land-claim for agriculture (S. J. Tyler <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, reed-cutting (through disturbance and burning) (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a), fire (Randall and Herremans 1994)<strong></strong>, rice production and disturbance from tourists (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). It is known to have disappeared from part of the Kafue Flats due to flood control by humans, which involved damming the Kafue River (Tyler 2005<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span> Kushlan and Hancock 2005)<strong></strong>. At the Okavango Delta (Botswana) food availability appears to be limited and any decrease would impact the survival of adult and immature birds (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). The aerial spraying of Deltamethrin to eradicate tsetse flies has not had any discernible impact on populations as yet (Hancock 2008), despite being known to affect small fish and aquatic invertebrates (Hancock 2006b)<strong></strong>. The presence of <em>Salvinia molesta</em> in some areas reduces visibility by covering the water surface and probably affects foraging by the species (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Breeding success is erratic, and can be significantly affected by human interference, poor floods and predation of nests and adults (Martínez-Vilalta and Motis 1992, Randall and Herremans 1994,<strong> </strong>R. E. Simmons <em>in litt.</em> 1999). In Botswana, two major historical breeding sites in reedbeds have been destroyed by human-induced fire and their regeneration prevented by decreased flood levels, whilst other sites have suffered human disturbance (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Feeding and trampling by elephants <em>Loxodonta africana</em>, which have expanded their range since the moratorium on elephant hunting, and to a lesser extent buffalo <em>Syncerus caffer</em>, renders reedbeds and trees unsuitable for nesting (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Productivity may be limited by high levels of predation by raptors and other species at some colonies (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a). The species may also be threatened by climate change in the long term (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2006a).  <p></p>","A population estimate of 3,000-5,000 individuals follows new surveys and replaces Collar and Stuart's (1985) estimate of 5,000-10,000 individuals.

It appears to prefer closed-canopy, primary montane, oak dominated forest, frequently on steep slopes. Its movements are poorly understood. Records from south Luzon (which may refer to wintering individuals) suggest that there is some intra-island migration. <p></p>","The chief threat is habitat loss, compounded locally by hunting with snares. In 1988, an estimated 24% of Luzon remained forested. In the Cordillera Central, montane forest is threatened by logging, agricultural encroachment and mining (M. van Weerd <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Large areas in the southern Cordillera Central have been converted for cultivation, and the species is likely to be rare or locally extinct there; however, the northern Cordillera Central is sparsely populated, and there are large areas of undisturbed forest.

Forest cover in the Sierra Madre has declined by 83% since the 1930s; however, illegal logging activities in the Sierra Madre target lowland tree species, rather than montane species, and there is reportedly no agricultural encroachment above 800 m in the northern Sierra Madre, suggesting that the species could be secure there (M. van Weerd <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). At Hamut Camp, forest  cover remains very good from c.500m and above,  although hunting pressure from  local trappers remains a problem (C.  Gooddie <em>in litt</em>. 2014). In Isabela Province and most of Cagayan Province, montane forest is  covered by strict protection zones in and, although law enforcement  is  weak, there is reported to be no direct threat to montane forest, as both loggers and   farmers do not convert high elevation areas in the Sierra Madre (M. van   Weerd <em>in litt</em>. 2012). Major road-building plans pose a further threat. Several key sites are suffering serious habitat degradation (e.g. Mt Diapalayag, Maria Aurora Memorial Natural Park and Mt Isarog).

In Kigezi district, Uganda, and neighbouring regions in Rwanda and DRC, more than 75% of wetlands were drained between the early 1980s and 2001 (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013). Geographical variation in the conversion of wetlands points to agricultural development being the main cause. On-going and future habitat losses are likely, particularly in western Kenya. Yala Swamp, the largest remaining area of intact papyrus,  is highly threatened by on-going agricultural developments, with further plans to construct dams and embark on aquaculture and industrial development projects, which could render the entire site unsuitable for papyrus (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013). Papyrus swamps are also reported to be declining rapidly in Rwanda, primarily through conversion to agriculture, especially sugar cane plantations, as well as subsistence farming (J. Anderson <em>in litt</em>. 2013, J. Hogg<em> in litt</em>. 2013, C. Nsabagasani <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Papyrus in Rugei Marsh has been completely cleared, followed by the disappearance of the species, and Akanyaru and Nyabarongo have also been heavily affected by crop  production (C. Nsabagasani <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Similar trends and threats are noted in Burundi (L. Ntahuga <em>in litt</em>. 2013). In addition to outright conversion, many smaller swamps are subject to the harvesting of sand and vegetation, with papyrus culms used in construction, handcrafts and fuel, as well as periodic burning and use for fish ponds (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013, M. Odino <em>in litt</em>. 2013). It is noteworthy that, around Lake Victoria, many of these activities have been catalysed by the collapse of the region's fisheries (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013, M. Odino <em>in litt</em>, 2013). Another threat, particularly in urban areas, is dredging for brick-making clay, which is fuelled by rapid economic development (Maclean <em>et al</em>. 2013).

Tourism activities, illegal moss collection for traditional or commercial purposes, and naturally occurring landslides may also represent minor threats. Trout farms located within the park may also contribute to habitat degradation as these use intense illumination (field observation made by Gustavo Fermín in 2013).&#160;<a name=""_Hlk33716982"">While this  species has not been tested for the presence of the chytrid fungus, <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis </em>(<em>Bd</em>), </a><a name=""_Hlk33716982"">this pathogen is widespread in the Venezuelan Andes (</a><a name=""_Hlk32326706"">Lampo <em>et al. </em>2008</a>).

110023718,714,Ailurus fulgens,Endangered,A2cde+3cde+4cde,2015,2015-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Red Panda is listed as Endangered because its population has plausibly&#160;declined by 50% over the last three generations (estimated at 18 years) and this decline is projected to continue, and probably intensify, in the next three generations. There is no credible quantification of decline rate from anywhere in the species' range. The overall forest loss rate at appropriate altitudes&#160;in the species' range is suspected to be sufficient for Near Threatened status (about 25% in the last three generations), but Red Panda populations are suspected to be declining much faster, reflecting a battery of direct threats, this species' fragmented present range, and poor survival in fragmented areas. (1)&#160;Red Panda diet is 98% bamboo. These plants&#160;show mass flowering followed by die off. Red Pandas will not readily find new feeding grounds in a highly fragmented landscape and are exposed to other threats when crossing unsuitable habitat. These bamboos do not easily re-establish after flowering in areas of environmental degradation and deforestation, which are now widespread across the&#160;species's range. (2)&#160;Red Pandas are highly susceptible to canine distemper (even developing the disease after vaccination with&#160;domestic dog vaccine), which is lethal to them. As more people, particularly herders, encroach Red Panda habitat, contact between domestic dogs (and their excreta) and Red Pandas increases. Unless all dogs (including feral ones) in Red Panda habitat are vaccinated against this disease the chance that it will enter and spread in the wild Red Panda population with catastrophic consequences are high. (3)&#160;Red Panda has specific habitat requirements for forest type, altitude, slope gradient and aspect, proximity to water courses, precipitation and presence of tree stumps. The gentle slopes and rich bamboo understorey of Red Panda habitat make it also a prime choice for herders with their dogs. Cattle also prefer these more gentle slopes, so trample bamboo, which is also collected extensively by herdsmen and used for fodder. In addition tree stumps are often collected by local villagers for firewood. (4)&#160;Hunting for trade seems to be increasing, Red Pandas are starting to enter the pet trade, perhaps partly in response to the increasing number of ‘cute’ images on social media. Deforestation and road building are easing access to Red Panda habitat. There are reports of poachers capturing Red Pandas in Nepal and Myanmar to satisfy the Chinese demand for the species (as wild meat, for medicine and for skins). The smaller population fragments, such as in&#160;Nepal, can support little or no off-take. (5)&#160;The human population in the Eastern Himalayas is growing at an average rate of 2.1% (doubling time 33 years). With this growth more people are moving into Red Panda habitat for their livelihoods, thereby exacerbating the above threats. Yonzon and Hunter (1991) showed that Red Panda mortality is high in disturbed areas; in their study area only three of the 12-13 cubs born survived to&#160;six&#160;months and only five of the nine adults survived the study period. They stated that 57% of these deaths were directly related to human causes. Comparable figures from undisturbed habitat are not available; but annual mortality rates such as these cannot possibly be&#160;sustainable.<br/><br/>The Ailuridae comprises a monospecific family. In part for this reason of conservation priority, with the evidence of precise decline rate being inadequate for certain discrimination between Vulnerable and Endangered, the precautionary course is taken of categorisation as Endangered, pending more precise information.","<p>Red Panda is closely associated with montane forests (oak mixed; mixed broad-leaf conifer; and conifer) with dense bamboo-thicket understorey (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). Conifer/fir forests seem to be preferred (Yonzon and Hunter 1991). Habitats above the tree-line are probably not consistently occupied given that Red Panda is essentially arboreal (Choudhury 2001). A dead Red Panda at 4,325 m asl in Arunachal Pradesh, in an area where the species is not generally known and far from any typical Red Panda habitat, was presumably a dispersant (Dorjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Six studies reported that Red Panda prefers to live near (typically within 100–200 m of) water (e.g., Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001). Five indicated a preference for canopy cover above 30%, with some suggesting cover as high as 70–80% may be preferred. Three suggested a preference for slopes of below 45%. Several indicated a preference for slope aspect: most suggest avoidance of south-facing slopes in favour of the cooler climate of the north, northwest and northeast aspects (Yonzon and Hunter 1991, Pradhan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001,&#160;Mahato 2004,&#160;Mallick 2010,&#160;Jhoshi and Sangam 2011,&#160;Subedi and Thapa 2011,&#160;Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Panthi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sharma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Sagamartha National Park, Red Panda was found on south-facing slopes in only one of six study areas, at lower density than at similar altitudes on north-facing slopes. In another area where both north- and south-facing slopes had otherwise similar habitat, Red Panda was found only on the north-facing slopes (Mahato 2004). Only in China have there been reports that Red Panda prefers south-facing slopes (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013). All studies investigating aspect took place in a similar altitude range. Also in China, in contrast to the rest of the range, steep slopes of more than 45% seemed preferred. Perhaps this relates to sympatry with Giant Panda <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>&#160;(in the Minshan, Qionglai, Liangshan, Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling ranges in western Sichuan; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a, 2000), which uses the more gentle slopes. Zhang <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that Red Panda prefers microhabitats with higher densities of fallen logs and tree stumps.</p><p> Red Panda is largely vegetarian, eating chiefly young leaves and shoots of bamboo. It also takes fruit, roots, succulent grasses, acorns, lichens, birds' eggs and insects (Hodgson 1847, Sowerby 1932). It is largely arboreal (Hodgson 1847).<br/> <br/> Gestation in captivity lasts 114–145 days (Northrop and Czekala 2011), suggesting a variable delay in embryo implantation. The animals breed once per year giving birth in the summer (late May to early August in northern hemisphere zoos). In captivity, litter sizes range from one to four, most commonly one to two; quadruplets are exceedingly rare. In the field, Yonzon and Hunter (1991) reported litters usually of singletons or twins. The young are sexually mature at 18 months and females can give birth for the first time around their second birthday. In captivity the generation length is around five to six years and its average longevity around 12–14 years. This slow reproductive rate and relatively long generation time are typical of a k-selected species, adapted to a stable environment and less capable of survival when that environment starts changing rapidly.<br/> </p>","<p>Each of the three recent&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs)&#160;listed the threats to Red Panda assessed to be most prevalent in their country/countries. Several problems occur throughout the species's range, albeit with some variation in assessed impact. The major threats are habitat loss and fragmentation; habitat degradation; and physical threats. These are all compounded by the region's increasing human population;<span class=""a1""> climate change; natural disasters; inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations; mostly low political will and interest; political instability (in some regions); low coordination of stakeholders, funding and human resources; trans-boundary issues facilitating poaching, illegal collection of non-timber forest products, and Red Panda trade (skins and other body parts); and the movement of cattle herders/grazers during the breeding season.<br/> <br/> <span class=""a1"">Natural disasters include cyclones; landslides; floods; heavy snowfall and rainfall; bamboo flowering (which results in death of the plant and typically occurs synchronously across large areas); forest fires; poor regeneration of shelter trees; weed infestation and invasive alien species; and disease outbreaks. Although most of these have been in operation throughout Red Panda existence, their effects are increasingly severe as an ever-larger proportion of the distribution is outside contiguous habitat blocks&#160;large enough&#160;for recolonisation to occur post-disaster.</span></p><p><span class=""a1""><span class=""a1""> In some areas, habitat is lost and degraded by commercial logging. In the Emaw Bum region of Myanmar more&#160;than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> have been logged since 1999–2000, resulting in many new roads into mountain areas, e.g. between the May Hka river and the China border. These logging roads not only&#160;destroy&#160;habitat&#160;directly, they also facilitate access for hunters and can destabilise the substrate. A recent video report from FFI shows two young Red Pandas crossing a landslide, the result of foreign road-building in the area.<br/> <br/> As human populations grow, more people move into mountain regions to live. They clear land for habitation, bring domestic herds to roam in the forests where they trample and eat bamboo. Herders collect bamboo for fodder and other necessities. The herds are protected by dogs that attack pandas and, if not vaccinated, potentially carry canine distemper, fatal to Red Panda. The lack of annual vaccination in India, at least, leads to a high incidence of canine distemper in dogs of one to five years of age (Latha <em>et al</em>. 2007). Spillover of canine distemper into wild species is already well documented, such as to Indian Fox <em>Vulpes bengalensis</em> (Vanak <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>&#160;(e.g. Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Himalayan bamboos, the Red Panda’s dietary staple, are sensitive to environmental degradation, deforestation, fire and overgrazing (Stapleton 1996). Reduced canopy cover increases wind and water stress for the bamboo. In these situations, seedlings are destroyed by the harsh conditions coupled with grazing pressure.<br/> <br/> Reports of Red Panda poaching and smuggling seem to be increasing, perhaps through demand in China.&#160;F. Momberg (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;saw Red Panda carcases and skins in&#160;villagers'&#160;homes in eastern Myanmar. One hunter allowed him to accompany him while he caught a Red Panda with his hands; apparently these villagers regularly take Red Pandas. Wildlife trade is rampant in Myanmar (about 30 tons of wildlife products per month), facilitated by wildlife habitat proximity to the Chinese border. Before Red Panda was upgraded to Appendix I of CITES in the early 1990s, individuals captured in Myanmar were traded by China to zoos around the world.&#160;<br/> <br/> Ang Phuri Sherpa (pers. comm. 2015) &#160;reported an increase in illegal trade over the preceding three years, based on the number of poachers and traders caught in Nepal. These incidents mostly involved skins and the items were headed for China. One incident involved a live Red Panda. A general increase in interest in Red Panda skins and meat in China could fuel more trade. A US businessman reported Red Pandas on offer in a restaurant. In the 'Threats' discussions during the 2012 Red Panda PHVA in China, many Chinese participants indicated that Red Panda meat was fairly widely available in restaurants, although no details are available. &#160;<br/> <br/> The live Red Panda trade, for pets, also seems to be increasing. Ian Lee (Chinese representative for Red Panda Network, pers. comm. 2015) found several reports in Chinese newspapers and social media of Red Pandas for sale as pets. This corroborates indications that Red Panda is increasing in popularity as a pet in China and other Asian countries, notably Thailand (YouTube videos and Instagram photos).<br/> <br/> Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) considers hunting and poaching the major threat to the Red Panda in Myanmar, in two ways: in one area, Red Panda is not a target species but is caught in iron traps, and some of skins are traded; in another, live Red Pandas are traded to China, motivating local people to go to catch them whenever they have time.<br/> </span></p>","<p>Red Panda was “estimated to be more common in the eastern part of its range, especially along the Myanmar-Yunnan border, yet it cannot be considered a common species” (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). There have been four undertakings to estimate, per country, the area of occupied habitat and from this the approximate Red Panda population: Choudhury (2001), Mahato (2010), the recent Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs; held in Nepal in 2010, China in 2012, and India in 2013) and Kendal <em>et al</em>. (2015). These show very little concordance (<span style="""">see Table 1 in the&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Supplementary Material</span>) and whilst some differences might reflect real change between earlier and later assessments, most must stem from differing assumptions and techniques. The PHVA figures are taken here as the most realistic guides, although none has been corrected for suitability of gross area of broadly suitable habitat accounting for specific preferences. Yet Red Panda is selective in forest used with regard to level of annual rainfall, percentage canopy cover, and density of bamboo (e.g., Yonzon <em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). These would ideally all be taken into account when estimating area of potential habitat. In addition, Red Panda is usually found near water-courses and in areas with many tree stumps, and apparently prefers medium-gradient or shallower, north-facing slopes. In combination, these factors will make the area occupied at average to high densities substantially below that of potential habitat. For example, taking into account forest type, altitude, precipitation and slope aspect, Yonzon <em>et al. </em>(1991) estimated only 68 km<sup>2</sup> of the 1,719 km<sup>2</sup> Langtang National Park to comprise suitable Red Panda habitat.</p><p> Regardless of the uncertainty of actual area occupied, increases in human population and the continuing spread of human activity has driven habitat loss and degradation since the assessment of Choudhury (2001).<br/> <br/> <strong>Nepal</strong>. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i), with numbers low (317–582 – similar to the prediction by Yonzon <em>et al.</em> 1997) and a declining population fragmented into 11 subpopulations. These data are extracted from the PHVA report. Subsequent surveys of Api Nampa (Arjun Thapa pers. comm. 2014) and Khaptad (Hari P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011) did not confirm the survival of these two subpopulations. The following estimates of density/numbers have been reported:&#160;<strong>Rara: </strong>about one animal per 3 km<sup>2</sup>, mostly between 3,100 and 3,600 m asl because of fragmentation and disturbance below this, and reduced habitat suitability above; a maximum of 11 Red Pandas in a 35&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;study area (Sharma 2008, Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014). <strong>Langtang</strong>: one per 2.09&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;giving a total of 68 Red Pandas in the park (Yonzon 1989), but Yonzon <em>et al</em>. (1991)&#160;reassessed the Langtang population at 24. This apparent decline, of 65% in less than two to three years, was probably real, reflecting high mortality resulting from anthropogenic disturbance in the park. <strong>Panchthar – Ilam – Tapeljung:</strong>&#160;one per 5.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;– 100 animals in 178&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Williams 2003, 2004). <strong>Dhorpatan: </strong>animals present but no density or population estimates available<strong>.</strong> Most Red Pandas occur over 3,200–3,400 m asl (Subedi and Thapa 2011) or 3,000–3,800 m asl (Panthi <em>et al</em>. 2012), and suffer disturbance from local people for livestock and collection of forest products. <strong>Bhotkola:&#160;</strong>135&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;good Red Panda habitat holds about 30–46 Red Pandas (Joshi and Sangam 2011).<br/> <br/> <strong>India: the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh</strong>. Participants in the 2013 PHVA calculated that the amount of habitat available for Red Panda in Sikkim and Arunachal was 6,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. More rigid constraints on assessing habitat as 'suitable' gave merely 2,600&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. Even with the more relaxed habitat conditions, this area is only half that proposed for India by Choudhury (2001), although the comparison is complicated by the non-availability of 2013 figures for West Bengal. Given the changes in land use in the last 20 year, the area of potential Red Panda habitat has undoubtedly declined, although direct comparison between PHVA data and those published by Choudhury is unwise: Choudhury estimated Red Panda habitat from forest service maps and national park maps, whereas the PHVA evaluation used current satellite imagery. In Sikkim, 225–370 Red Pandas in 650&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable forest were calculated by Ziegler <em>et al</em>. (2010); the PHVA estimate was of 44–415. In West Bengal (<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">not included in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material</span>), a statement of 78 Red Pandas in Singalila (Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001) contrasts with a more recent one of 27 animals (Roka and Jha 2014) and a similar number stated by Bahaguna <em>et al</em>. (1998). This figure plus the 28–32 animals stated to live in the Neora Valley by Mallick (2010) gives a total of 55–60 Red Pandas in West Bengal. In Arunachal Pradesh there have been fewer site-specific studies. This state is presumed to hold the largest Red Panda population in India. According to Choudhury (2001) it was relatively common in Tawang and northern West Kameng districts and in the Mishmi Hills, especially Dibang Valley and Lohit districts. Ghose and Dutta (2011) reported sightings of Red Pandas from&#160;several&#160;districts, all from before 2000. Habitat maps suggest that most Red Panda habitat is in the east of the state, with a second concentration in the west, around Tawang and Eaglesnest. The habitat between these two regions looks more sparse and fragmented.<br/> <br/> <strong>Bhutan.</strong> Red Panda seems to be widely distributed, mostly at 2,400–3,700 m asl. Bhutan is a very small country with a fast developing economy. The road system is expanding fast and the growing rural population depends on forest and forest products. Even in this country, the pressure on Red Panda habitat is marked.<br/> <br/> <strong>Myanmar</strong>. The area where Red Panda is found (northern Kachin province) is remote, with recent locality records from Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, Mount Majed and Emaw Bum, mostly above 3,000 m asl. The number of villager captures suggests the species may be common in Hkakaborazi National Park, but none was camera-trapped there despite substantial effort at suitable altitude (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008). Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) believes Red Panda is still fairly common in the Emaw Bum region, albeit much disturbed by logging and hunting. Red Panda is presumably less common than formerly in Myanmar and, although apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, it is still caught and killed.<br/> <br/> <strong>China. </strong>China is the only country for which the PHVA estimated much higher forest cover than did Choudhury (2001). Choudhury’s (2001) estimates were supported by Wei <em>et al</em>. (1999, 2011). As Wei <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported, reforested lands (which are increasing, reflecting government policy) do not provide suitable Red Panda habitat. Red Panda perhaps decreased in China by as much as 40% in the second half of the twentieth century, through massive habitat loss, increased human activity and poaching (Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999). Wei <em>et al.</em> (1999) estimated 3,000–7,000 Red Pandas in China.<br/> </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The current Red Panda distribution is detailed in three Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs) since 2010, covering all range states holding the species: Nepal (2010), China and Myanmar (2012), and India and Bhutan (2013). As discussed by Roberts and Gittleman (1984),&#160;Red Panda&#160;distribution range should be considered disjunct, not continuous. Reports, including a shot animal of undoubted identification and provenance, of a population on the Meghalaya Plateau of northeastern India, in anomalously tropical habitat (Choudhury 2001, Duckworth 2011) warrant investigation as soon as possible. Captive&#160;Red Pandas from the main distribution and habitat do not breed well in tropical conditions (Princee and Glatston in prep); the Meghalaya Red Pandas, if native, might be a separate taxon.</p><p> In Nepal&#160;Red Panda&#160;has been reported from 23 districts, but a number lack confirmed specific records. A further district, Darchula, contains suitable habitat but so far lacks any Red Panda reports. The westernmost global reports are from the Api Nampa Conservation Area and Khaptad in far western Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), but specific verifiable records there have not been traced since the 2010 PHVA,&#160;even though local people had affirmed Red Panda in these areas in the recent past. Two post-PHVA surveys failed to find the species in either area (H.P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011,&#160;A. Thapa pers. comm. 2014). The westernmost confirmed records are from Kalikot and Jumla at about 81°E (Dangol 2014); both are west of the formerly accepted range. In Bhutan it is found in 13 districts (Haa, Thimphu, Paro, Punakha, Wangdiphodrang, Gasa, Trongsa, Zhemgang, Bumthang, Mongar, Lhuntse, Trashigang and Trashiyangtse); high-elevation areas in other districts (Chukha, Tsirang, Dagana, Samtse and Samdrupjongkhar) require further surveys (Dorjii <em>et al. </em>2012). In India it is found in only three states: Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. In Myanmar it is known only from the northernmost state, Kachin, and is locally distributed even there (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). In China it is found in three provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan and Tibet. Sichuan is its main homeland. In this province its range extends through the Minshan and Liangshan to Qionglai and the Lesser and Greater Xiangling mountains (Wei <em>et al</em>.1999, 2011). It is believed to be extinct in the rest of its historical range in China, e.g. Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces (Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999). The Xiaoxiangling population appears isolated from the other <em>A. f. styani </em>population(s). It is a small population and represents a different genetic type that should be considered as a separate conservation unit (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda was&#160;stated to inhabit Lao PDR by Cheminaud (1942) and Deuve (1972). Re-examination of Cheminaud (1942) reveals many significant internal inconsistencies and flaws. Hence, there is no evidence that Red Panda has ever occurred in Lao PDR (Duckworth 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda occurs in a narrow altitude band. Roberts and Gittleman (1984) gave a range of 2,500–4,000 m asl. Prater (1948) mentioned occurrence down to 1,500 m asl and Choudhury (2001) gave a typical range of 1,500–4,800 m asl, up to nearly 5,000 m asl in the summer. However all recent publications, excepting those discussing animals from Meghalaya, support the Roberts and Gittleman range as that typically occupied, notwithstanding sporadic reports above 4,000 m asl and down to 2,300 m asl. The occupied altitude varies across the range. This might result from any of: disturbance at lower altitudes; time of year of assessment (several authors indicate that Red Pandas migrate seasonally up and down the mountainside; e.g., Yonzon and Hunter 1991); aspect (with animals occurring higher on the warmer south-facing slopes); and potentially other factors.<br/> </p>","Red Panda is taken for various purposes including wild meat, medicine, pelts and pets. Levels of offtake are not well documented; nor are trends in offtake or geographical patterns of harvest and use. It has been&#160;suggested that the rising numbers in the internet pet trade in China are captive-bred, but this remains&#160;to be confirmed.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Red Panda is included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I (www.cites.org). It is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972, the highest protection possible for a species in India (Choudhury 2001). It is also legally protected in Bhutan, China (where it is classed as a Category II species under the Wild Animal Protection Law; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a), Nepal (Glatston 1994) and Myanmar (by the Wildlife Act of 1994). In China, the species is Red Listed nationally as 'Vulnerable' under A2ace. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i),&#160;<br/> <br/> In Myanmar it is found in at least three protected areas: Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and Emaw Bum proposed National Park. It is difficult to determine how much of the Red Panda’s range in the country these protected areas cover. Hunting and, in Emaw Bum, logging are widespread within their confines.<br/> <br/> In Bhutan it is found in the following protected areas: Jigme Dorji, Thrumshingla and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Parks, Bumdeling and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuaries, Toorsa Strict Nature Reserve, biological corridors connecting these reserves, and the biological corridor connecting Thrumshingla and Royal Manas National Parks. It has also been recorded in the Royal Botanical Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Wangchuck Centennial Park (Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012). Potential Red Panda habitat in the country modelled using MAXENT and ArcGIS 9.3 revealed 46% of predicted Red Panda habitat is under protected areas (PAs), 16% is in biological corridors and 38% lies outside the PA system. However, even protected areas are subject to activities such as road construction, livestock grazing, subsistence agriculture (slash-and-burn in some areas), collection of forest resources such as timber and NTFPs, and domestic dog presence.<br/> <br/> In India it is found in 19 protected or otherwise managed&#160;areas: Lachung Reserve Forest, Kanchendzonga National Park (NP), Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary,&#160;the buffer and transition area of the latter two,&#160;Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), Pangolakha WLS, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary, Singalila NP, Neora Valley NP, Kamlang WLS, Eaglesnest WLS, Zemithang Valley Community Forest, Nuranang Valley Community Forest, Mehao WLS, Mandla-Phudung CF, Anjaw Reserve forest, Mechuka-West Siang CF, Mouling NP and Dibang WLS. It might also inhabit Taley Valley WLS, Pakhui WLS and Sessa Orchid Sanctuary. These protected areas cover about one-third of the species’s total potential habitat in India (Choudhury 2001). In the 2013&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA)&#160;workshop, 22 protected areas (outside Meghalaya) were identified as having potential habitat for Red Panda, some with only very small areas. Furthermore, the workshop participants identified medium to high levels of threat in these areas from&#160;two or more of development activities; fire; herders; firewood and non-timber forest product collection; illegal trade/'accidental' hunting; dogs (very prevalent); refuse; and habitat reduction. In Arunachal Pradesh (the state believed to have the largest Red Panda population in India) around 60% of the forest is under community ownership rather than having PA status. Also in Sikkim, 60% of potential Red Panda habitat falls outside the PA system. Enforcement of protective legislation, especially outside protected areas, is almost non-existent (Choudhury 2001).</p><p> China has 46 protected areas containing Red Panda (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2011), covering about 65% of the species’s habitat in China. Poor law enforcement in PAs was listed as a problem during the 2012 PHVA workshop (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2014). Livestock grazing and collection of non-timber forest products occur widely in these areas.<br/> <br/> Red Panda has been confirmed in nine of Nepal’s PAs: Sagarmatha NP; Makalu Barun NP; Langtang NP; Rara NP; Kangchenjunga Conservation Area (CA); Annapurna CA; Gaurishankar CA; Manaslu Conservation Area; and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. In all these PAs, habitat loss and degradation, poaching and dog problems and developmental activities have been rated as moderate to severe by participants in the Red Panda PHVA workshop (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Currently there is a Global&#160;Species&#160;Management Plan (GSMP) for Red Pandas held in zoos around the world. This plan is closely allied to&#160;current field&#160;conservation efforts. The three PHVAs were largely the initiative of, and funded by, the zoo community. The aims of the GSMP are to contribute both directly and indirectly to Red Panda conservation by: providing a genetically and demographically sustainable and behaviourally competent back-up population for the wild population; holding the potential to supply individuals for genetic or demographic supplementation or reintroduction programmes; educating and the raising of public awareness of Red Panda, its uniqueness and conservation needs; and providing financial, technical, scientific and other support and expertise to the planning and implementation of <em>in situ</em> conservation and research &#160; <br/> <br/> Priority conservation actions fall into four main categories:<br/> <br/> 1. <u>To protect against habitat loss</u>: improve and manage Red Panda habitats (including within corridors); improve connectivity, including across international borders; balance developmental activities by promoting eco-friendly and sustainable development with minimal impact on Red Panda habitat; increase areas under protection; implement better Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for all development programmes; engage political willingness and win support;  develop and implement landscape-level conservation policy, identifying unprotected Red Panda habitat and &#160;making legal provision for the declaration of Red Panda Community Conservation Areas.<br/> <br/> 2. <u>To reduce habitat degradation</u>: restore degraded habitats, plant bamboo; regulate tourism by the use of entry permits; zone PAs to define&#160;restricted-access zones in core areas for Red Pandas, facility  zones, and resource use zones, with restricted visitor access during the breeding season (set quotas for&#160;non-timber forest products); educate, sensitise, and promote community participation to reduce and mitigate threats to Red Panda and its habitat; promote the use of alternative energy and building materials; provide sustainable livelihoods; enhance range-land management, using native species; reduce livestock numbers, especially of&#160; unproductive breeds; develop an integrated agriculture, pasture and  agroforestry system; develop proper rubbish disposal systems; improve community stewardship in natural  resources management; improve fire-fighting, in part by training communities, developing a national fire fighting strategy, ensuring PA&#160;management plans include comprehensive coverage of forest fire (the implementation of a fire strategy including forest fire alert and monitoring system, forest fire mapping and zoning, provision of fire fighting equipment, and controlled burning to prevent fires).<br/> <br/> 3. <u>To reduce deaths of Red Pandas:</u>&#160;strengthen law enforcement and improve physical protection; enhance transboundary cooperation on both of the former; strengthen coordination/collaboration between  line agencies and other stakeholders; implement a reward and punishment system both for  communities and forest department; establish anti-poaching units (in community forests and PAs) with capacity building for front-line, anti-poaching staff; train customs officials; reintroduce captive-bred individuals to reinforce local populations; formulate a dog management plan to control, sterilise and vaccinate dogs; engage army personnel in border bases to keep their dogs in check and not let them roam free in Red Panda areas.</p><p> 4. <u>To improve awareness</u>: design and implement a dedicated awareness programme using radio, pamphlets, posters, and documentary film; secure adequate funding; improve conservation education (with a focus on Red Pandas) in schools; establish/strengthen Green Force Clubs; implement a Red Panda research programme, identifying priority research topics, and including regular monitoring of its habitat; develop a trans-national ‘Project Red Panda’.<br/> </p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In strongly euthrophic habitat the species is more or less dependent on human management to maintain open habitat, while in poorer areas water table variation may be sufficient to maintain suitability; however the species avoids very poor mires (BirdLife International 2008). Targeted agri-environment schemes can maintain suitable breeding habitat for the species in central Europe, especially where conservation action has already taken place (BirdLife International 2008). The highest densities of singing males were found where vegetation was between 60-90cm high and densities increased with percentage ground cover by water (Kloskowski <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;On migration the species uses low stands of sedges and reeds, seemingly the latter for resting and the former for feeding (Bargain 2002). The sites where it is found during migration are mostly coastal marshes, lagoons and estuaries, but there are also regular records at sites along large rivers (de By 1990).&#160;It winters in the grassy saline <em>Scirpus, Eleocharis </em>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Oryza</span><em> </em>marshes of the Senegal and Niger deltas (Flade <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).  <p></p>","The most important threats are loss of breeding habitat owing to drainage for agriculture and peat extraction, damming of floodplains, unfavourable water management and the canalisation of rivers<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>.

Similarly, grazing at too high an intensity, cutting too early or too frequently may cause significant local reductions in breeding success (BirdLife International 2008).&#160;In the wintering grounds, agricultural cultivation and irrigation (creation of rice and sugar cane plantations), drought, wetland drainage, intensive grazing, succession to scrub, desertification and salinisation of irrigated soils are all potential threats<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Aquatic Warbler Conservation Team 1999, M.

The west Siberian population in European Russia is thought likely to have disappeared, with the last confirmed record in 2000 (J. Krogulec&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In Hungary, the population collapsed in the period 2002 - 2007, and zero calling males were estimated in 2011 - 2012 (BirdLife International  2015, Végvári and Flade 2012). Within Europe declines are continuing, if at a slower rate than previously in the central European strongholds in eastern Poland and Ukraine, but in Belarus the population declined by 47-55% between 2000-2011 (BirdLife International 2015) and the Pomeranian population of northwest Poland  and northeast Germany has declined to critical levels. <br/>Post-nuptial migration initially occurs in a westerly and south-westerly direction with birds passing both north and south of the Alps (Jiguet <em>et al. </em>2011, Salewski <em>et al.</em> 2013) and it has been recorded from all European countries except Malta and Cyprus.

It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable. However, data are scarce and some birds may have relocated to alternative wintering sites. Apparent increases in Iraq and the western Mediterranean population probably reflect improved observer coverage rather than genuine changes. This population has suffered a long-term decline and widespread loss of habitat.  <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour&#160;</strong>This species is dispersive and partially migratory (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992). It shows variable, nomadic movements and is capable of dispersal in search of suitable habitat at any time of year as changing conditions require<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>&#160;(Kear 2005, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992)<strong></strong>. There is a general tendency for a more southerly distribution during the non-breeding season and a more northerly distribution during the breeding season. It is highly gregarious post-breeding and during the non-breeding season when it occurs in large monospecific flocks (Kear 2005) of up to 2,000 individuals (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Green<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;et al.&#160;</span>2002), and potentially &gt;5,000 individuals (A. Green&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). During the breeding season it is more dispersive, although paired birds often mix with conspecifics (Kear 2005). Nests are sometimes built in close proximity to one another, although they become increasingly spaced out as population density declines (Kear 2005,&#160;<strong></strong>Green 2007). Nesting has been recorded from mid-April to late June, and broods from mid-April to mid-September (Kear 2005). The species exhibits drastic population fluctuations, partly in response to annual variations in rainfall.&#160;<strong>Habitat&#160;</strong><em>Breeding&#160;</em>It is adapted to temporary, unpredictable, Mediterranean-type wetlands<strong></strong><strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Green 2000, 2007)<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>and breeds in fairly dry, steppe-like areas on shallow freshwater, brackish or alkaline ponds with well vegetated shorelines<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong><strong></strong>(Green 1993), and rich emergent and submergent vegetation (Kear 2005). It also breeds on delta marshes where receding waters leave behind large areas of shallow water with abundant sedges and bulrushes&#160;<strong><sup></sup></strong><strong></strong>(Johnsgard 1978). In addition it may use slow rivers and saline coastal lagoons, and man-made wetlands including fish-rearing ponds, small reservoirs and sewage farms (Green 1993, Y. Perlman&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2013). Although it favours brackish wetlands, it tends to avoid waters of high salinity. Microhabitat requirements are strongly influenced by diet.&#160;<em>Non-breeding</em>&#160;It uses similar habitat during the non-breeding season, although may make more use of shallow, mixed zones of emergent and saltmarsh vegetation during the summer (Sebastián-González&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).<strong>&#160;Diet&#160;</strong>Diet varies considerably between seasons and sites and additionally with age. Diptera are an important component of the diet , especially before and during the breeding season. Small seeds become increasingly important after the breeding season with faeces of post-breeding birds in Turkey composed of 95% dry weight&#160;<em>Scirpus</em>&#160;seeds<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Green and Sánchez 2003, Fuentes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Green and Selva 2000)<strong></strong>. Newly hatched chicks are highly dependent on emerging chironomids<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Green 2000).<strong>&#160;Breeding site</strong>&#160;Nests are usually constructed on the ground at the water's edge, beneath a covering of vegetation (Kear 2005, Green 1993). They may also occur above water in&#160;<em>Typha</em>&#160;stands (Kear 2005) and are reported to have been found in the roofs of reed huts (Hawkes 1970, Kear 2005<strong><sup></sup></strong>)<strong></strong>. Mean clutch size was recorded in Spain to be 11.8<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Green 1998).<p></p>","Over 50% of suitable habitat may have been destroyed during the 20th century. Wetland drainage for agriculture occurs across its range, most significantly in Iraq where the species remains threatened by fluctuating water levels and local water shortages. Hydrological work has severely affected breeding sites in Tunisia, Turkey, Morocco and Spain. In Iraq, the species is also threatened by illegal hunting and persecution, exacerbated by it being the principal wildfowl target for hunters during the summer months (Salim 2010). Reed-cutting, reed-burning and grazing commonly reduce the amount of habitat for nesting. Pollution from agricultural, industrial and domestic sources is a threat at many sites. When breeding, it is vulnerable to shooting and egg collection. Further mortality results from birds caught in fishing nets and lead poisoning<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Svanberg <em>et al</em>. 2006, Mateo <em>et al</em>. 2001)<strong></strong>. A lack of habitat following hot, dry summer months probably results in high juvenile and adult mortality post-breeding (Green 2000, 2007). Lack of water availability for the El Hondo reservoirs in Alicante have led to a major decline in Spain since 1998 (Ballesteros<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2008).    <p></p>","The global population is estimated at c.55,000-61,000 individuals, based on estimates of 3,000-5,000 in the west Mediterranean and West Africa (T.

Surveys in the winter of early 2010 recorded c.44,000 individuals in southern Iraq (Salim 2010), more than the previously estimated world population of 14,000-26,000 (in 2002). This may not represent a genuine population increase, but is perhaps more likely a product of the restoration of the marshes of southern Iraq since 2002, which has probably now resulted in the concentration in this area of most of the&#160;<em>M. angustirostris</em>&#160;population wintering in south-western Asia, combined with improved observer coverage. Prior to 1991, the estimated population was 34,000-40,000 birds.

It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable. <p></p>","<em></em>The species is totally dependent on tall, dense grassland with wet soils (Rahmani 2016). It inhabits tall grassland (often dominated by <em>Imperata</em> and <em>Saccharum</em> species) and reed <em>Phragmites</em>, particularly in riverine and swampy areas, and intermixed with low thorny scrub or standing crops of rice. In Nepal, it occurs in relatively open, short grasslands, mostly on dry soils, but also in moist areas with tall reeds and scattered bushes. It is generally encountered singly or in pairs and is difficult to observe, except when song-flighting or breeding in May-September. In Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand, pairs have been observed in courtship in May, with the presence of juvenile birds recorded in July (M. Sharma <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The species has been recorded song-flighting in March-June (P. Thompson <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Assam it is thought to be breed from March to May, possibly up to June (Rahmani 2016). In Tanguar Haor, north-east Bangladesh an active nest was found in April. It consisted of a semi-ball structure made of grass and found approximately 8 cm from the ground at the base of grasses (M. M. H. Khan <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The species has been recorded breeding in Uttar Pradesh during  August-October, and observations suggest that some males may be  polygamous (Arya 2010). It nests on the ground in dense vegetation (Arya 2010). It makes some nomadic local movements in response to rainfall patterns, often appearing at sites for only a few months then disappearing again. The lack of records during mist-netting surveys in the winter in Bangladesh haors where it has been recorded breeding raises the possibility of local or more distant movements (P.

Its movements are not fully clear but is thought to be mainly a breeding visitor in the north of its range, including north-east India, Nepal and Bangladesh (Rahmani 2016). Recent photographs from Katampally and Kole Wetlands in February-March indicate that the species winters as far south as Kerala, and has evaded detection owing to its secretive behaviour (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">per</span> Praveen J. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Records of a single bird at a site in Kerala have been made in December, January, February and March over the period 2008-2010 (Rajeevan and Khaleel 2012).

The population in Bangladesh is estimated at approximately 500 individuals (M. M. H.

Migrating birds breed from April to July (Sánchez <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kear 2005) (its mating system is unconfirmed) (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.

Habitats include saline inland lakes, coastal lakes and lagoons, and even the coastal waters of inland seas (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, although it is not found on areas of coast that are subjected to heavy wave action (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996)<strong></strong>.

It consists of a cupped platform of leaves and stems, over which a roof may be formed by bending down overhead leaves (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996)<strong></strong>.

Both male Ruddy Ducks and male hybrids are socially dominant over male White-headed Ducks during courtship (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996)<strong></strong>. The threat from the Ruddy Duck is extremely serious, given that, if allowed to proceed beyond a certain point, the Ruddy Duck's spread across the Palearctic will become unstoppable, especially if the species was allowed to become established in White-headed Duck range-states such as Algeria, Turkey or the Russian Federation, where the huge size and area of the wetlands and their infrequent monitoring would make control impossible (Hughes<span style=""FONT-STYLE: italic""> et al.</span> 2006).

A 1989 study in the main Pakistani wintering lakes showed that suitable habitat had decreased because of lowered water levels due to reduced water supply, and that fisheries had increased disturbance (A.A. Khan, A. Parveen, and R. Yasmeen <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. Water abstraction for agriculture and other uses has affected water levels in many important sites throughout the range. The genetic diversity of the Western European population is low (Muñoz-Fuentez <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong> owing to its having suffered a bottleneck in the 1970s and early 1980s when only a few dozen individuals remained in the wild (Johnsgard and Carbonell 1996, <strong></strong>Muñoz-Fuentez <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. This may lessen the adaptive potential of the population, rendering it less able to withstand environmental change (Muñoz-Fuentez <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Further threats include drowning in fishing-nets, hunting and ingestion of lead shot (Green <span style=""FONT-STYLE: italic"">et al. </span>1996, J.

Isenmann <em>in litt. </em>2002); 5,000-10,000 individuals in the east Mediterranean and south-west Asia, and 10 individuals in south Asia (Wetlands International 2016). This totals 7,900-13,100 individuals, roughly equating to 5,300-8,700 mature individuals. Within Europe the breeding population is estimated at&#160;250-610 pairs, which equates to 500-1,200 mature individuals. The number of wintering birds in Europe is estimated at 7,500-15,900 individuals (BirdLife International 2015). However, a count of over 20,000 individuals were counted on the Tengiz-Korgalzhyn Lakes, Akmola region, Kazakhstan in September 2016 (ACBK 2016).",Decreasing,"This species&#160;is resident in <strong>Spain</strong>, <strong>Algeria</strong> and <strong>Tunisia</strong>.

It occurs on passage/in winter in the eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East, and central and south Asia. <br/><br/>The global population was probably over 100,000 in the early 20th century, falling to an estimated 20,000 birds in 1996 (Green and Hunter 1996)<sup><span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""></span></sup>, since then numbers were thought to have declined to around 8,000-13,000 individuals<strong> </strong>(Li and Mundkur 2003), however a coordinated count of 20,000 individuals in Kazakhstan in 2016 (ACBK 2016) suggest that the previous global estimate was likely too low. Concurrently, breeding populations have become extinct in Italy, France, Hungary, Albania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Israel and Egypt, and probably also in the Ukraine and Armenia. Exact population trends are difficult to calculate given that numbers on wintering grounds often change dramatically in line with altered water availability (Li and Mundkur 1993, <strong></strong>Schielzeth <em>et al.</em> 2003, E. Kreuzberg-Mukhina <em>in litt.</em> 2005). At the former key wintering site, Burdur Gölü, Turkey, numbers steadily declined from 10,927 birds in 1991 to 653 in 2001 (M.A. Tabur <em>in litt.</em> 2005).&#160;The total Turkish wintering population in 2005 was only 1,006 birds, down from over 9,000 in 1988<span style=""FONT-WEIGHT: bold""> </span>(S.

121745669,712,Ailuropoda melanoleuca,Vulnerable,C2a(i); D1,2016,2016-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) produced an estimated range-wide population of 1,864 Giant Pandas, excluding dependent young &lt;1.5 years of age (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although no formal demographic analysis is available, there are demographic data available to enable estimation of age-related population composition (Sichuan Forestry Department 2015): if the population consists of 9.6% cubs, then the total population of Pandas is approximately 2,060. Mature adults are estimated to compose 50.5% of the total population, yielding an estimate of 1,040. Although this estimate does not contain confidence intervals, clearly the lower confidence interval would fall below 1,000 mature individuals, which meets the small population size criteria (D1) for Vulnerable.<br/><br/>Additionally, the species falls under criteria C2. The Panda population is fragmented into subpopulations, each of which contains &lt;1,000 adults (given that the total population is &lt;1,000 adults); however, the size of the largest population is unknown given uncertainty in how much connectivity remains. It appears that at least one distinct populations in the Minshan mountains contains &gt;400 mature individuals (State Forestry Administration 2015), so the species does not meet the criteria for Endangered (EN). The most tentative part of listing under C2 is a continued population decline.<br/><br/>Evidence from a series of range-wide national surveys indicate that the previous population decline has been arrested, and the population has started to increase (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although inconsistencies in data collection methods, analysis, and sampling area make direct comparisons from survey results difficult, population estimates have consistently increased across survey since the Second National Survey conducted during 1985-1988. Initial uncertainties regarding whether modest population increases observed in the Third National Survey (2000-2004) were real warranted maintaining the Endangered status for the Giant Panda in the previous Red List assessment. Recent data from the Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) remove this uncertainty (State Forestry Administration 2015), and it is widely believed that the population has stabilized and has begun to increase in many parts of the range.<br/><br/>An increase in available habitat and an expanding occupied range provide further support for the contention that Panda numbers are increasing. Forest protection and reforestation measures have increased forest cover in China (FAO 2010), and have supported an 11.8% increase in occupied habitat and 6.3% increase in unoccupied but suitable habitat between the Third and Fourth National Surveys (State Forestry Administration 2015). A survey of expert opinion among Giant Panda experts in the IUCN Bear Specialist Group was consistent with the results of the national survey: all believed that the Panda population was stable or increasing and that available habitat was increasing.<br/><br/>Although the population is currently increasing, climate change is predicted to eliminate &gt;35% of the Panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years, and thus the Panda population is projected to decline (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Under this scenario, the species fits the criteria for VU under C2a(i).<br/><br/>Whereas the decision to downlist the Giant Panda to Vulnerable is a positive sign confirming that the Chinese government's efforts to conserve this species are effective, it is critically important that these protective measures are continued and that emerging threats are addressed. The threat of declining bamboo availability due to climate change could, in the near future, reverse the gains made during the last two decades. The Giant Panda will remain a conservation-dependent species for the foreseeable future. The Chinese government's plan to expand existing conservation policy for the species (State Forestry Administration 2015) should receive strong support to ensure its implementation.","A member of the order Carnivora, Giant Pandas have evolved to specialize on a diet of bamboo (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Bamboo is a poor food source, low in protein and high in lignin and cellulose, and wild Giant Pandas can only digest an average of 17% of dry matter and about 27% of hemi-cellulose (Dierenfeld <em>et al.</em> 1982, Schaller <em>et al</em>. 1985). Thus, to meet their daily energy requirement, Giant Pandas must consume a large amount of bamboo, up to 12.5 kg per day, and defecate more than 100 times daily (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Pandas have large, muscular jaws with skeletal features to accommodate the musculature and its famous “pseudothumb” used to hold and manipulate bamboo for processing. However, compared with other herbivores, the Panda has very low digestive efficiency because its digestive tract still resembles that of its carnivorous ancestors. The Panda’s feeding strategy emphasizes volume, requiring it to allocate much of its time to foraging (approximately 14 hours daily).<br/><br/>While morphological and behavioural adaptations provide some compensation for poor digestive efficiency, the Panda’s ability to survive on such a low-quality food source remained mysterious for decades. Even whole-genome sequencing found no specific genes responsible for the digestion of cellulose and hemi-cellulose (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010). An explanation was uncovered in a recent metagenomics study that found the Panda’s gut microbes play an important role in digesting bamboo fibers (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011a). Additional adaptations to poor quality diet are found in the Panda’s extreme strategy of energy conservation, with daily energy expenditure comparable to that of a sloth or reptile (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Pandas demonstrate a suite of adaptations to reduce energy expenditure. The thick pelage conserves energy lost through body heat, and it has long been known that pandas are conservative in movement and physical activity. Smaller than expected organs also are indicative of energy-conservation adaptation, and down-regulation of resting metabolic rate has been achieved through a mutation in the synthesis pathway for thyroid hormones.<br/><br/>Giant Pandas also compensate for digestive inefficiency by selecting the most nutritious parts of bamboo plants and by altering diet selection seasonally commensurate with changes in nutritional profiles of bamboo species (Schaller<em> et al.</em> 1985, Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015b). They demonstrate strong preference for seasonally available new bamboo shoots, rich in nutrition and energy and low in fibre. Outside the late spring bamboo shoot season, Pandas favour leaves, although more stems are incorporated into their diet during the winter months when leaf quality and quantity diminishes. This convergence of foraging strategies across variations in climate, bamboo species, and topographic profile indicates an adaptive strategy that serves the species well. Still, as an energy-limited species that spends more than 50% of its time foraging, Panda numbers may be limited by the availability of high quality bamboo and the time required to process bamboo in the digestive system.<br/><br/>Early coarse-scale radio tracking using VHF transmitters provided foundational data on home range size and documented the solitary nature of the Panda’s existence (Schaller<em> et al</em>. 1985, Yong <em>et al. </em>1994, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). Although Panda home ranges overlap generously, direct encounters between individuals are rare. Seasonal elevational migration has been documented in the Qionglai (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985) and Qinling mountains (Yong <em>et al.</em> 1994, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2002, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). At both sites, the seasonal movements track changes in resources, providing access to bamboo species that provide greater nutritional value. Research integrating behavioural, nutritional, and movement data provide new insights into these seasonal migration patterns, demonstrating that these movements facilitate consumption of higher concentrations and/or a more balanced intake of key nutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Calcium (Ca) (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014). Female-biased dispersal has been demonstrated with genetic data in the Minshan and Liangshan Mountains (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007, Hu <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Fine-scale documentation of |Panda movement behaviour had to await the advent of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Published accounts using high-resolution GPS telemetry revised and added to previous findings (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Hull <em>et al. </em>2015). VHF-based radio tracking inevitably leads to large amounts of missing data when animals at more distant locations are not detected, thus it is unsurprising that GPS tracking substantively revised home range size upwards, and that core area overlap and opportunity for social interactions is now understood to be greater than previously believed. Other interesting phenomena were also detected, such as the documentation of female-biased dispersal (confirmed with genetic data; Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007), and sudden, large movements that temporarily took a female far outside of her home range during the mating season. Fine-scale movement data showed that Pandas exhibited individualistic and multiphasic movement paths within seasonal core habitats and large-scale movements between habitats. Tortuous movement paths indicated when pandas searched for and found foraging resources. Pandas frequently return to the same foraging patches, indicating that they likely have well-developed spatial memory.<br/><br/>Using various measures of habitat suitability, efforts to map Panda habitat have proven valuable for guiding the establishment of the Panda reserve system (Shen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Feng <em>et al.</em> 2009, Qi <em>et al.</em> 2012). Giant Pandas typically occupy temperate montane forests at altitudes of 1,500–3,000 m (Hu and Wei 2004). Range-wide analysis of ecological covariates associated with Panda presence suggested that Giant Pandas are associated with old growth forests, a finding previously unrecognised in studies implemented on smaller spatial scales (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). As an obligate bamboo specialist, the Giant Panda’s reliance on this resource is clear, yet it has usually been ignored in habitat suitability models because mapping bamboo understory using remote sensing techniques is difficult (Linderman<em> et al. </em>2005). Including understory bamboo in habitat models dramatically decreases estimates of available habitat and increases measures of fragmentation. Advances in remote sensing techniques, such as Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), combined with new analytical techniques, such as artificial neural network analysis, have helped remove obstacles to including bamboo understory in maps of habitat suitability (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2009; Viña <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). Enhanced understanding of Panda habitat requirements and improvements in mapping technologies provide managers and policy makers with better tools for conservation decision-making (Loucks <em>et al.</em> 2003, Xu <em>et al.</em> 2006, Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Qi <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>Giant Pandas are a solitary and seasonal-breeding mammal, only coming together during the breeding season, from March to May, for reproductive purposes (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Male Pandas occupy large home ranges overlapping several females and are known to congregate around oestrous females. Male Pandas are able to locate females across large areas, and demonstrate fierce and injurious aggression in competition for access to females. Early in these encounters escalated aggression is common, but, in a possible strategy to conserve energy and minimize risk of injury, once dominance is established, contact aggression is largely replaced with non-contact aggression. Individual males are able to locate and mate with multiple females sequentially, so the mating system might be considered scramble competition polygyny.<br/><br/>Because Pandas live a solitary existence, they must rely heavily on chemosignals to communicate with one another without necessitating face-to-face encounters. Giant Pandas make use of a system of traditional communal scent mark stations that provide them with reliable locations they can visit to deposit signals and investigate signals left by other Pandas (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985). Studies documenting habitat characteristics of preferred marking sites, including tree species and microhabitat (Nie <em>et al. </em>2012a), extend our understanding of habitat requirements for the species. If habitat that promotes communication is not maintained, then poor communication may hinder breeding in the wild, as has been shown for captive Pandas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Denning ecology is an important field of study among ursids, and other species giving birth in dens, because access to adequate dens can be important for offspring survival. Forest management practices that affect the availability of suitable dens can either significantly harm or enhance cub survival (White<em> et al. </em>2001). Ursid young, being extremely altricial, are particularly vulnerable. The Giant Panda lies at the extreme end of this continuum, with the mother weighing nearly 1,000 times the cub’s weight at birth (Gittleman 1994). Den quality may therefore be critical for Pandas. Giant Pandas do not hibernate, but females use rock caves or tree cavities to rear offspring that are produced every 2–3 years (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Zhu <em>et al. </em>2001). Preferred dens are characterized by a small opening to buffer against the elements and provide a warmer and drier environment for rearing offspring (Zhang<em> et al. </em>2007). Dens tend to be located close to water, presumably so the mother can leave the vulnerable cub (almost always a single cub) unattended for a shorter period of time while she drinks. It has also been proposed that tree dens, once more numerous in primary forests before logging converted many forests in Panda habitat to second growth, are a limiting resource for Giant Pandas (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). The importance of this resource may explain why national survey data indicate that pandas are more often found in primary than secondary forest.<br/><br/>It was once believed, and sometimes still mis-stated, that Pandas’ biological deficiencies were responsible for their own decline. Because of early problems with captive breeding, Pandas gained a reputation for having notoriously low levels of interest in mating; however, Pandas in the wild experience no mating problems and have high reproductive rates (Wei and Hu 1994, Pan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Once a better understanding of the biology and behaviour of the species was incorporated into husbandry practices, captive Pandas began to mate naturally and experienced exponential population growth (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2006, Zhang and Wei 2006, Martin-Wintle <em>et al.</em> 2016). Moreover, its well-known specialization on bamboo is not (as once thought) an evolutionary cul de sac, as it opens up a foraging niche with plentiful resources and few competitors (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014). Dietary specialization is often seen as an extinction risk factor, but this may not be the case for the Panda, which specializes on widespread and abundant bamboo. Thus, pandas are well-adapted to their environment and have reproductive rates sufficiently high to explain the recovery of populations once bans on poaching and habitat restoration efforts commenced (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014).","The primary threat facing Giant Panda populations is the continuing effects of previous habitat loss, resulting in highly fragmented habitat and, in many cases small, isolated populations. According to the Fourth National Survey (State Forestry Administration 2015), the Panda population is composed of as many as 33 subpopulations, 18 of which contain fewer than 10 individuals. The extent to which these are demographically separate populations remains uncertain, but this fragmentation certainly increases vulnerability to extinction through environmental and demographic stochasticity and loss of genetic diversity.<br/><br/>Although microsatellite analysis (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Shan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and genomics (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013) have now determined that the Giant Panda has substantial genetic variability, without increased migration and connectivity, many of these smaller populations will have rapidly eroding evolutionary potential. Three genetic clusters have been recognized: the Qinling Mountains population (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007) which diverged ~0.3 million years ago; the Mishan mountains, which diverged ~2,800 years ago into the Mishan and Qionglai populations (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013); and the other four combined populations, including Qionglai, Daxiangling, Xiaoziangling, and Liangshan (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, in this larger cluster, further sub-structuring is manifest (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011b). Population divergence is the product of several operating factors, including climate change, natural barriers, and anthropogenic habitat loss.<br/><br/>Threats associated with edge effects, human disturbance, and small population size are most severe in these small, isolated populations. Increased fragmentation from roads, hydroelectric dams, mining, and other infrastructure projects further threaten Panda populations (State Forestry Administration 2015), but these trends are partially counterbalanced through the successful implementation of ecocompensation programs that curtail some activities such as fuel wood collection (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007) and efforts to increase habitat connectivity between some populations (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Tourism is increasing in some areas and if not managed properly, could negatively impact Panda populations (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2012). Pathogens and parasites may be an emerging problem compromising Giant Panda health and survival, particularly in areas where dogs, livestock, and other domesticated animals may introduce novel pathogens (Qin <em>et al.</em> 2010; Zhang, L. <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2015). Air- or water-borne environmental contaminants may also exert negative impacts on Panda populations, but little is known about their prevalence. Livestock grazing, inside and outside of protected areas, represents another, potentially growing threat (Hull <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wang <em>et al.</em> 2015). It should also be noted that protected status of nature reserves does not always confer protection, and some threats have continued even after Panda reserves were gazetted (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2001). These continuing human activities may have cumulative effects that further degrade Panda habitat.<br/><br/>Pandas' reliance on bamboo as a primary food source puts them at risk during this plant's characteristic mass synchronous flowering and die-off events, which occur at intervals of 15 to 100 years (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1989). Before human expansion confined Pandas to high elevations, Pandas had access to more species of bamboo adapted to different elevation zones. When one bamboo species experienced a die-off, Pandas could easily migrate up or down slope to access a different species that was not affected. Confined to its more limited elevation range today, Pandas are sometimes put at risk of starvation, especially when more than one bamboo species flowers at the same time. Although past bamboo die-off events were alarming and caused starvation and mortalities in Pandas, populations recovered (Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and these population bottlenecks did not compromise genetic diversity (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>These primary threats associated with habitat fragmentation and degradation may be exacerbated by climate change-mediated effects on Panda habitat in the future. Several models indicate significant losses to Giant Panda habitat, with estimates of loss of bamboo habitat ranging from 37% to 100% by the end of the century (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although these models are simplifying and may not adequately account for distributional shifts of bamboo species adapted to lower elevations and southern latitudes to replace current habitat that might be lost (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a), managers should be concerned about large-scale environmental changes facing Panda populations in the future. In addition, climate change may alter the agricultural value of current Giant Panda habitat and bring about intensified human pressure for cultivation. For example, some models indicate that much of Panda habitat will become suitable for viticulture, a high-value crop (Hannah <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Although poaching impacted Pandas in the past (Li <em>et al.</em> 2003), its impact declined rapidly since the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act, which bans poaching and carries severe punishments. However, Pandas may sometimes be caught in snares set for musk deer or other species.","The Giant Panda is the subject of one of the largest, most intensive efforts to estimate population size for an entire species. The Chinese government has carried out four national surveys, approximately every 10 years since 1974. The most recent, the Fourth National Survey conducted from 2011 to 2014, mobilized more than 2,000 people who spent more than 60,000 person-days surveying 4.36 million ha. The population estimates derived from these surveys should be considered rough estimates due to difficulty associated with extrapolating sign survey data to determine the number of individuals. Idiosyncratic feeding styles among individual pandas produce bamboo fragments that vary somewhat distinctively in size (“bite-size”) between individuals and thus provide some information that helps distinguish faeces from different individuals, especially when combined with information about home range size. However, as a population census tool, this method has never been fully validated (Pan<em> et al. </em>2014). Evidence suggests that sign survey data may have under-estimated population size in one reserve (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Wei <em>et al. </em>2012), but it is not known to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other reserves. Although DNA has been extracted from faeces collected during the Fourth National Survey, these data have not yet yielded a population estimate because most of the faeces collected were not sufficiently fresh to provide adequate DNA. Thus, the best available population estimate for the species relies on bite-size analysis.<br/><br/>Another limitation of the national survey data is that the methods have been altered and improved since they commenced in 1974, and the range and effort of the survey have been inconsistent. The same methods were used for the third and fourth national surveys; although survey effort increased in the fourth survey, most of this increase can be attributed to the larger area covered to capture the expanding range that Pandas now occupy. Thus, comparisons between surveys may not be completely valid, but they are still informative. The first survey (1974–1977) produced an estimate of 2,459 pandas, which decreased dramatically in the second survey (1985–1988) to 1,216 individuals. This approximately 50% drop in population size provided the impetus for the 1988 Wildlife Protection act, which banned Panda poaching, and China’s <em>National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat</em>, which established a reserve system for Pandas (Reid and Gong 1999). By the time of the third survey (2000–2004), the population estimate increased to 1,596, indicating that these protective measures may have been successful. However, uncertainties remained due to the inconsistencies in the methods by which the surveys were implemented (as well as a lack of confidence limits on the point estimates). Although these same limitations still apply, the recent fourth survey showed the Panda population increased further to 1,864, removing most remaining uncertainties regarding population trend. Additionally, Pandas have been documented in many areas outside their known range, including an animal shot in 2015 in Yunnan Province, where they have not been recorded for centuries. An increasing population was not surprising, given that available and occupied habitats have increased. <br/><br/>The optimism engendered by these positive trends is dampened by evidence indicating that some Panda populations are decreasing, particularly those found in the smallest and most degraded habitat patches such as Liangshan, Xiangling and Niuweihe. Approximately 223 pandas occupying 23 isolated habitat patches are considered at high risk of local extinction, and will require increased protection and management (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011b; State Forestry Administration 2015).",Increasing,"Once widespread throughout southern China, and as far north as Beijing and south into Southeast Asia, the Panda’s distribution is now confined to its previous western extremity in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Pleistocene range shifts were associated with the disappearance of the Panda’s principal source of food, bamboo, due to warming climate; whereas rapid range contraction in the past several hundred years is attributed to the conversion of bamboo forests to agricultural cultivation and rapid expansion of human populations (Li <em>et al.</em> 2015). The largest populations are currently found in the Minshan, Qinling, Qionglai mountain ranges, and smaller, more isolated populations remain in the Liangshan, Daxiangling, and Xiaoxiangling mountain ranges (State Forestry Administration 2015).<br/><br/>The Giant Panda’s range is highly fragmented, resulting from centuries of human encroachment and loss of forested habitat at lower elevations. Rapidly expanding industrialization, beginning in the early 1900s and accelerating since 1949, is associated with severe contraction of the Panda’s range (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li<em> et al. </em>2015). While they once occupied forests below 1,000 m in elevation, current populations are restricted to mountain ranges, separated by valleys and flatter landscapes that have been altered by human activities. China lost more than 30% of its forests between 1950 and 2004, coinciding with a precipitous drop in Panda populations, but forest cover has increased in the past two decades (FAO 2010).","Although historically the Giant Panda was sometimes hunted for its pelt, law enforcement mechanisms appear to have eliminated this trade.",Terrestrial,"The Giant Panda has been the focus of one of the most intensive, high profile efforts to recover an endangered species. In 1981, China joined the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which made trade of Panda skins illegal. Enactment of the 1988 Wildlife Protection Law banned poaching and conferred protected status to the Giant Panda (listed as Category I, the highest level of protection). The National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat of 1992 laid out a masterplan for Panda conservation and established a Panda reserve system, which today has grown to 67 reserves. Enlarged by more than 50% since the Third National Survey, this reserve system currently protects 67% of the Panda population and nearly 1.4 million hectares of Panda habitat (State Forestry Administration 2015). The biological diversity of these reserves is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems (Mackinnon 2008), thus making the Panda an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on many other sympatric species (Noss 1990).<br/><br/>These efforts to end poaching and protect Panda habitat played a significant role in Panda recovery. The Chinese government also invested in infrastructure and capacity building for reserve staff, established anti-poaching patrol, curtailed human activities inside reserves, and in some cases relocated human settlements from inside to outside of reserves. Other measures directed at broader conservation problems also benefited the Panda. The Natural Forest Conservation Program was implemented in 1997 to reduce the devastating impacts of flooding on human communities due to deforestation and erosion. The program banned logging in most forests in Panda habitat, slowing habitat degradation. Additionally, the Grain-to-Green Program incentivized farmers to plant trees on steep slopes to slow erosion. The result of these policies was the addition of 3 million hectares of forest cover in China annually, an increase of 1.6% per year from 2000 to 2010 (FAO 2010). As a consequence, Panda habitat is recovering and the total occupied habitat has increased by 11.8% between the Third and the Fourth National Surveys; an additional 6.3% increase in suitable but unoccupied habitat was also observed. In the Wolong Nature Reserve, implementation of the Grain-to-Green Program brought about measurable increases in connectivity of Panda habitat (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007). Thus, these habitat conservation policies are associated with increasing Panda population size, increasing range, and better habitat connectivity. Efforts have also commenced to restore habitat corridors (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a) and to reintroduce captive-born pandas to increase genetic diversity in small, isolated populations.<br/><br/>Ecocompensation has been proposed as an important component of a conservation strategy for pandas (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015; Liu <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2015; Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2015). Approximately 15% of the remaining unprotected habitat occurs in collectively-owned forests. Payment for ecosystem services, which has already been shown to benefit Panda conservation under the Grain-to-Green Program, could extend conservation measures into these unprotected areas.<br/><br/>Finally, the Giant Panda has been the beneficiary of a massive scientific effort conducted in partnerships between the Chinese government and institutions and international conservation NGOs and zoos (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2010, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a, State Forestry Administration 2015). Once poorly understood, there has been an explosion of scientific studies across many disciplines, and this knowledge has increasingly been applied management and policy decisions. Future directions would benefit from even better coordination between science and policy, and the application of adaptive management principles in which experiments are conducted to evaluate management actions that may increase carrying capacity inside protected areas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a).<br/><br/>China's State Forestry Administration, while rightfully proud of its accomplishments, fully realizes that more work needs to be done to further Panda conservation and to avoid losing ground so painstakingly gained. They plant to continue investing in habitat protection, population monitoring, and protection patrols, and to further develop capacity of reserve staff (State Forestry Administration 2015). They recognize the challenges the future holds, and in particular will seek to address problems of habitat connectivity and population fragmentation.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Given the inherent difficulty of assessing this species, the normally low density with which it occupies the landscape and the effects that small population and habitat degradations can have on the species, our minimum assessment of population decrease could be a significant underestimate.<br/><br/>Since the previous Red List assessment in 2008, the threats to Jaguars have continued or intensified. The first expert mapping of Jaguar range took place in 2002 (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002), and the resulting map was used for the 2008 Red List assessment. Today, more is known about Jaguar distribution and abundance, allowing us to retrospectively classify areas as Jaguar range in 2015 that were previously identified as non-range or gaps in knowledge (Supplementary Material Figure 1). The 2015 mapping exercise also reflects updates to range recommended by Jaguar experts, with sufficient evidence (i.e., tracks, camera-trap photos, sightings of live or dead animals) to warrant inclusion/exclusion of range. The updated range indicates increasing fragmentation of Jaguar populations, particularly in eastern and southeastern Brazil, northern Venezuela and the Maya Forest (Selva Maya) of Mexico and Guatemala. Comparing 2015 Jaguar range to the extent of “known” range from the 2002 exercise, thereby controlling for the difference in knowledge extent, there is a 20.0% decline in Jaguar range over the past fourteen years (2002-2015), from 8.77 million km² to 7.02 million km² (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). With a more robust range map from which to begin the next assessment, the species will likely qualify for VU in the near future.<br/><br/>With a generation length of 6.84 years, we suspect at least a 20-25% loss in mature individuals over the past 21 years (three generations) because there are documented population declines together with habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Paviolo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Jedrzejewski <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales (de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2017a, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","The Jaguar has a stocky, heavy body with short massive limbs associated with reduced cursorial behaviour and dense forest habitat, and robust canines and large head allowing a more powerful bite than other large cats (Seymour 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Mean body weight varies by up to 100% across their range, those living further from the equator tend to be larger (Iriarte <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1990). This extreme variation in size may reflect variation in the availability of large prey in different habitats: the largest Jaguars occur in open flood plains areas, the Llanos in Venezuela and the Pantanal in Brazil, and take the largest prey, and the smallest Jaguars inhabit the dense forest areas of Central America and Amazonia and take smaller prey (Hoogesteijn and Mondolfi 1996, Oliveira 2002).<br/><strong><br/><u>Habitat</u></strong><br/>Jaguar habitat is typically characterized by dense forest cover (mainly primary and secondary forest), the presence of water bodies and a sufficient prey base (Swank and Teer 1989, Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). However, they are found in range of habitats from rainforest to seasonally flooded swamp areas, pampas grassland, thorn scrub woodland, and dry deciduous forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars mainly inhabit tropical lowland forest, followed by dry tropical forest, xeric habitats and finally arable lowland pastures (Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Although Jaguars have been reported from elevations as high as 3000 m (Brown and Lopez Gonzalez 2001), they typically avoid montane forest, and have not been found in the high plateau of central Mexico or above 2700 m in the Andes (Ceballos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>, 2011). The species is more strongly associated with water in comparison to any of the other Panthera cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), indicated by their higher densities within tropical moist forests than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest (Maffei <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Even within drier areas they are only found around the main water courses. This characteristic quickly brings them into conflict with expansion of high intensity agriculture, having the same requirements of nearby water sources for irrigation.<br/><br/><u><strong>Home range</strong></u><br/>Jaguar home ranges vary in size across their geographic range, often according to the season and availability of resources (e.g. Crawshaw and Quigley 1991, Núñez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). Generally males range further than females.<br/><br/>In the dry tropical deciduous forest of Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, female home range size ranged from 25 km² (dry season) to 60 km² (wet season) (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Nunez et al 2002). In the semi-deciduous and seasonally flooded forest of Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, male home range size ranged from 33 to 41 km² for males and 32 to 59 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Ceballos <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>In the tropical broadleaf moist lowland secondary forest of Belize, male home range size ranged from 28 to 40 km² (radio telemetry; Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). In the mosaic landscape (secondary broadleaf forest, savannah and agriculture) of Central Belize, male home ranges ranged from 103 to 194 km² in the dry season and 179 to 386 in the wet season, and from 86 to 99 km² for a single female in the dry and wet seasons respectively (95% MCP, GPS collars, Figueroa 2013).<br/><br/>In the llanos of Venezuela, home range size ranged from 93 to 100 km² (males, dry season) and ranged from 51 to 80 km² for females in the wet season and dry season respectively (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Scognamillo <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>There are numerous studies of home ranges from the seasonally inundated landscape of the Brazilian Pantanal: females 25 to 38 km² (radio telemetry; Schaller and Crawshaw 1980), females 5km² and males 20 km² for males in the wet season, and 70 and 79km², respectively, in the dry season (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw and Quigley 1991), female 38km² and male 67km² (95% fixed kernel, radio telemetry; Azevedo and Murray 2007), 57 to 176 km² (95% MCP, GPS collars; Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006), and females 34 to 101 km² in the wet season, and 42 to 89 km² in the dry season, and males 79 to 149 km² in the wet season, and 58 to 263 km² in the dry season (90% adaptive kernel estimator, GPS collars, Cavalcanti and Gese (2009).<br/><br/>In the semi-deciduous rainforest of the Brazilian Atlantic forests, male home range size ranged from 87 to 139 km², and from 44 to 133 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Cullen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). It can be seen in the above review that the more recent studies using GPS technology show considerably larger range sizes compared to older VHF studies, this is especially indicative for recent GPS studies from areas where previously VHF studies were carried out. The differences are ranging from ~4-6 times larger. It is therefore reasonable to assume that these older ranges are considerably underrepresenting Jaguar home ranges. Densities based on these ranges are therefore equally overestimated.<br/><strong><br/><u>Diet</u></strong><br/>Jaguars are opportunistic hunters. Over 85 prey species (wild and livestock/domestic), including mammals, reptiles and birds, have been recorded in their diet across their geographic range (Seymour 1989).<br/><br/>Jaguars take a wide variety of prey species but large-sized ungulates are preferred when available (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The intake of large prey likely helps Jaguars save energy, since it is estimated that 50% of kills are larger prey on which they will feed for up to 4 days (Schaller and Crawshaw 1980, Nunez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Nevertheless, Jaguar diet is highly variable, depending on prey availability, ease of capture, and a variety of additional factors (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Seymour 1989). In some areas cattle (<em>Bos</em> sp.) comprise an important item in their diet (Polisar <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Palmeira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Cavalcanti and Gese 2010). The decline of wild prey below a minimum threshold increases livestock depredation by big cats (Khorozyan <em>et al</em>. 2015), which in turn may lead to retaliatory killings of felids by livestock owners. High frequency of smaller prey species is frequently reported in Jaguar diet, e.g. armadillo (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Novack <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Foster <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b). The species has therefore gained a reputation of being able to persist in relatively disturbed areas with incomplete prey assemblages (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). However, most diet studies rely on scat analysis. Palomares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) showed that the high majority of these scats are from males. Diet studies are therefore highly biased towards male diets. As males do not contribute anything to the rearing of young, as single individuals, they are able to sustain themselves better at a varied diet of small species. Mothers with cubs will likely require the larger ungulates but this important component of the populations is extremely poorly represented in diet studies of scats.<br/><br/><u><strong>Reproduction</strong></u><br/>There are few studies on the reproductive ecology of Jaguars in the wild. Males and females may come together for breeding opportunities at any time of the year (e.g. Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). The female is in oestrus 6-17 day period, and gestation lasts 91-101 days (in captivity), after which the female gives birth to up to four cubs, usually two, which will stay with her for up to 24 months (Mondolfi and Hoogesijn 1982, Seymour 1989, Kitchener 1991, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cubs are fully dependent on their mother’s milk for the first 10-11 weeks, and continue to suckle until 5-6 months old (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cycling could resume 2-3 weeks following lactational anestrus (Soares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). However, inter-birth intervals documented in the wild are approximately two years (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Carrillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). By 15-18 months, Jaguars travel and hunt independently within their mother’s range, although they may still come together at kill sites (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars are usually independent by the age of 24 months, however the age of dispersal or the social circumstances associated with it are poorly known (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Dispersal does not appear to be linked with the onset of sexual maturity, estimated at 24-30 months for females and 36-48 months for males (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Few data are available on dispersal distances however telemetry studies in the Brazilian Pantanal suggest that males disperse further than females (Quigley and Crawshaw 1992, Quigley and Crawshaw 2002). Dispersal through human-dominated landscapes may increase the likelihood of conflict with humans, particularly in areas where the habitat is highly fragmented (e.g. Sáenz and Carrillo 2002). The maximum age of last reproduction of a female recorded in the wild is 13 years (Brown and Lopez-Gonzalez 2001).<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013). Values for age at first reproduction and longevity were agreed to by experts at the 2012 National Action Plan workshop for Jaguars in Brazil, and can be used for generation length calculations as:<br/><br/>GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs<br/>R<sub>span</sub> = 15 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 11.5 yrs<br/><br/>Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013)<br/>Thus, GL = 11.5*0.29 +3.5 = 6.84 yrs for Jaguars.","Jaguar populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010a, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Nijhawan <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press), killing for trophies/illegal trade in body parts, pro-active or retaliatory killings associated with livestock depredation (Zimmermann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2008, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015), and competition for wild meat with human hunters (Jorgenson and Redford 1993, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Deforestation rates in Latin America are the highest in the world together with tropical Africa (FAO forest update, D’Annunzio <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Industrial agriculture, along with subsistence agriculture, is the most significant driver of deforestation in tropical and subtropical countries, accounting for 80% of deforestation from 2000-2010. The current contribution of agriculture to deforestation varies by region, with industrial agriculture being responsible for 30% of deforestation in Africa and Asia, but close to 70% in Latin America. The most significant agricultural drivers of deforestation include soy, palm oil, and cattle ranching, all highly prevalent throughout Latin America (http://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture). The produce is mainly used for export as raw products for developing countries, not to feed local populations. Fragmentation and displacement frequently leads to lowering of densities of Jaguars and prey in leftover forest patches due to easier access and Jaguars feeding on the replaced livestock. Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Latin America is characterized by relatively low population densities with high population growth (http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). This means that the increased agricultural expansion will likely not be used to feed the expanding population of Latin America. Increased pressure on wildlife as a food source will increase. Even in low population countries like Belize, 75% of the yearly wildlife offtake can be attributed to humans, while Jaguars only account for 25% (Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Increases in human population within these thinly populated countries means, increased fragmentation for agriculture, industry and urbanization necessary for sustaining the increased number of people, making the wildlife easier accessible for hunting. The greater need for food and potential increase in wealth for a proportion of the population means increased commercialization and increased prizes for wildlife game species, which are all Jaguar prey species.<br/><br/>Habitat loss is reducing and isolating Jaguar populations range wide (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Jaguars have lost about 49% of their historic geographic range (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em>et al.</em> 2016; current assessment). The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) an important Jaguar prey (e.g. Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010b), has been extirpated from 21% of its historical range during the past century and changed from NT to VU under the latest IUCN assessment (Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Keuroghlian <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Jaguars have become extinct in El Salvador, Uruguay, and the United States (where there are still periodic individuals present as presumed dispersers from Mexico) (TSJRT 2012, Campbell 2015). There are documented population declines and habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales. For example, the connectivity of Jaguar habitat between Honduras and Guatemala is almost gone; similar losses have been documented across the Chaco, Iguazu and Atlantic Forest, and between Tamaulipas and Veracruz (Haag <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press). Many Jaguar populations require connectivity between core sites to survive in the long term and these connectivity corridors are most of the time outside protected areas, and therefore vulnerable to human impacts (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>The vulnerability of the Jaguar to persecution is demonstrated by its disappearance by the mid-1800 from Uruguay (Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016), El Salvador and by the mid-1900's from the south-western US (Johnson and Van Pelt 2016). Disappearance from these countries catches the current trends in a nutshell. These countries were the first areas to show rapid population increase with large scale land conversion. Retaliatory killing of the remaining exposed Jaguars led to their extinction. These processes are now taking place on a continental scale and therefore there are few areas within Jaguar range that can be considered safe. With limited technological expansion in the region, the main source of income will be industrial agriculture. With every (local) economic crisis, it means that the last Jaguar strongholds will be eroded further. Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, there is still demand for Jaguar paws, teeth and other products, especially in local markets where canines are still considered interesting jewellery. On top of this, Jaguars are starting to be considered a replacement for tiger bone for traditional medicine purposes by the increasing Asian community in Latin America.","<u><strong>Historic assessment of Jaguar viability </strong></u><br/><strong>High chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that populations in 70% of the Jaguar range (over 6 million km²) had a high probability for survival. Most of that area consists of the Amazon Basin rainforest, and adjoining areas of the Pantanal and Gran Chaco (Torres <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Other areas considered by Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) to have a high probability for long-term Jaguar persistence included tropical moist lowland forest in Mesoamerica (the Selva Maya of Guatemala, Mexico and Belize) and a narrow strip of the Choco-Darien of Panama and Colombia to northern Honduras.<br/><br/><strong>Medium chance of survival: </strong>Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that Jaguar populations in 18% of the Jaguar range (1.6 million km²) had a medium probability of long-term survival. These areas are generally adjacent to the areas considered to have a high-probability probability of survival and include a large portion of the northern Cerrado, most of the Venezuelan and Colombian llanos, and the northern part of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. In Central America and Mexico, they include the highlands of Costa Rica and Panama, southern Mexico, and the two eastern mountain ranges of Mexico, Sierra de Taumalipas and the Sierra Madre Oriental.<br/><br/><strong>Low chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) classified the remainder of Jaguar range (12%) as having a low probability for Jaguar survival, and of most urgent conservation concern. These areas include the Atlantic Tropical Forest and Cerrado of Brazil; parts of the Chaco in northern Argentina; the Gran Sabana of northern Brazil, Venezuela and Guyana; parts of the coastal dry forest in Venezuela; and the remaining range in Central America and Mexico.<br/><br/><strong><u>Current assessment of Jaguar populations</u></strong><br/><strong>Mexico</strong>: Jaguar densities in Mexico have been estimated from 0.75 to 6 adults per 100 km² (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2016). The Jaguar population in the Selva Maya in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico was estimated in 2000 individuals (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Rodriguez-Soto <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). In the Greater Lacadona Ecosystem in southern Mexico, Jaguar density was estimated at 1.7-4.6/100 km², with an estimated population of 62 to 168 Jaguars within the protected areas of this region (de la Torre and Medellín 2011). Overall, Mexico’s national Jaguar census estimated at 4,000-5,000 individuals in 2011 (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press). The northern and central areas of Mexico are however becoming increasingly isolated with Jaguars disappearing where they were previously still detected (Grigione <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Rosas-Rosas and Bender 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Central America</strong>: Estimates of Jaguar density from Mesoamerica from 27 studies conducted from 2000 to 2010 range from 0.74 to 11.2 /100 km², however most of the studies did not cover the minimum area to ensure unbiased density estimates (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Nevertheless, across these sites density estimates were higher in tropical moist forest than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest, and higher in national parks compared to those from other multiple use areas (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Densities in the Belizean Selva Maya rainforest were estimated at 7.5-8.8/100 km² (Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). Jaguar density estimates in the protected lowland moist tropical forest of the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize range from 3.5 (+/- SE = 0.7) to 11.0 (+/- 3.1)/100 km² (Harmsen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Jaguar density was found to decline across the human-influenced landscape, a mosaic of unprotected forest, savannah, agriculture and settlements with distance from the protected forest (Foster 2008). The Talamanca Mountains of Costa Rica and Panama support a Jaguar population, but the probability of long-term persistence is medium to low (Gonzalez-Maya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Similarly the Jaguar populations located in protected areas in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua are under a great pressure from deforestation and hunting (Petracca <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>South America</strong>: Jaguar density in the Brazilian Pantanal has been estimated as 6.6-6.7 /100 km², or 10.3-11.7/100 km² depending on the method used (telemetry versus camera traps, respectively, Soislao and Cavalcanti (2006). In the Bolivian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 2.8/100 km² (Madidi National Park Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004), and in the Colombian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 4.5/100 km² and 2.5/100 km² (Amacayacu National Park and unprotected areas respectively; Payan 2008). Estimates of Jaguar density are 2/100 km² in the savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, 3.5/100 km² in the semiarid scrub of the Caatinga, and 2.2/100 km² in the Atlantic Forest (Silveira 2004), and 2.2-5 per 100 km² in the Bolivian Gran Chaco (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). The Atlantic Forest subpopulation in Brazil has been estimated at 200+/- 80 adults (Leite <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002). Jaguar populations in the Chaco region of northern Argentina and Brazil, and the Brazilian Caatinga, are low-density and highly threatened by livestock ranching and persecution (Altrichter <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, T. de Oliveira pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><u><strong>Historic methodological biases</strong></u><br/>Unfortunately, many of these reported density estimates have inadequate sample sizes of area or capture and recaptures. Careful reviews have shown that these estimates tend to be biased positively rather than negatively (Foster and Harmsen 2012, Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Tobler and Powell 2013). This means that many of the older publications from before 2010 tended to overestimate densities at an unknown quantity. It also means that previous assessments have been overly optimistic about Jaguar status throughout their range.<br/><br/><u><strong>Subpopulation status</strong></u><br/>De la Torre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2017) identified 34 Jaguar subpopulations where there is little likelihood of demographic or genetic exchange, and assessed each against Red List criteria. Overall, 97% met the criteria for Critically Endangered (25 subpopulations) or Endangered (eight subpopulations) (see Figure 3a-e in the Supplementary Material). The large Amazonia subpopulation, estimated to hold 89% of the total species population (57,000 out of 64,000), was assessed as Least Concern.",Decreasing,"The Jaguar is the largest cat of the Americas, and the only living representative of the genus <em>Panthera </em>in the New World (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Historically it ranged from the southwestern US (where there are still some vagrants close to the Mexican border) through the Amazon basin to the Rio Negro in Argentina (McCain and Childs 2008, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Its extent of occurrence (EOO) (updated with the collaboration of 44 experts—see the lists of Assessors and Contributors and the Assessment Rationale section for a thorough description) is estimated at 9.02 million km², with its stronghold the rainforest of the Amazon basin, which comprises 57% of its total EOO. The Jaguar has been virtually eliminated from much of the drier northern parts of its range—Arizona and New Mexico in the United States, and extreme northern Sonora state in Mexico—( Johnson and Van Pelt 2016), as well as northern Brazil, the pampas scrub grasslands of Argentina and throughout Uruguay (de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016). In 2002, Jaguars were estimated to occupy only about 46% of its historic range (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). With our improved knowledge of Jaguar range (see the Assessment Rationale and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), this percentage is set at 51% currently.<br/><br/>Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002) defined the most important areas for conservation of viable Jaguar populations (Jaguar Conservation Units or JCUs). These 51 areas cover 44.49 million km², or 49% of Jaguar range according to present calculations.","Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996).

The Jaguar is fully protected at the national level across most of its range, with hunting prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, United States, and Venezuela, and hunting restrictions in place in Guatemala and Peru (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Specific conservation plans for the species have been developed in Mexico, Panama, Honduras, and Brazil. <br/><br/>With habitat fragmentation a major threat, and taxonomic research suggesting little significant differences among Jaguar populations, an ambitious program has been launched to conserve a continuous north to south habitat corridor through the species range (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010).<br/><br/>Addressing livestock management and animals that prey on livestock is a high priority for conservation efforts in many Jaguar range countries due to the impact of retaliatory killing of Jaguars and other predators.<br/><br/><strong><u>Jaguar Conservation Actions</u><br/></strong>The following is a list of actions that a variety of Jaguar range countries have put in place to enhance Jaguar conservation. <br/><ol><li>Respond to reports of livestock depredation, and provide advice and assistance to improve livestock management practices, thereby reducing depredation and associated retaliatory killings of Jaguars; </li><li>Understand and address the hunting of Jaguar prey for sport, commercial and subsistence uses, and raise awareness about the laws governing the hunting of wildlife and the need for adopting sustainable hunting practices;</li><li>Monitor and safe-guarding Jaguar core populations, Jaguar Conservation Units, or JCUs (see Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010);</li><li>Maintain national and regional population connectivity through the identification of corridors for Jaguar movement between JCUs and applying conservation actions in those corridors through the engagement of corridor stakeholders as in the development of a Conservation Action Plan for the Central Belize Corridor (Kay <em>et al.</em> 2015);</li><li>Develop national, regional and local monitoring programs for Jaguars and their prey.</li></ol>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Swe (2004) observed a mean clutch size of 4.4 eggs, and females deposited one to six clutches each season (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018).

Juveniles are in especially high demand in the pet trade, whilst larger adults enter food and medicinal markets. Although harvesting has declined dramatically recently, due to the extirpation of wild populations, continued commercial demand poses a serious impediment to reintroduction into the wild (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2011). In addition to over-exploitation, habitat degradation and fragmentation, as the result of conversion to agricultural lands, threaten <em>G. platynota</em>.","<p><em>Geochelone platynota</em> was extremely rare as early as the 1980s and suffered significant declines to the point that it was considered ecologically extinct in the wild as early as 2000. Since 2013,&#160;<em>G. platynota</em> has been successfully reintroduced into former localities of Minsontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary. About 2,100 reintroduced subadults (about five years old) were reintroduced, and these are reproducing in the wild, with 51 hatchlings encountered in surveys during 2017 (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018).

An attempt in 2007 to reintroduce <em>G. platynota</em> into Minsontaung was unsuccessful, with all tortoises poached, or disappearing within six months (Platt<em> et al</em>. 2011). A licensed commercial captive breeding operation exists in Bagan, however, there are no exports currently from this facility following the CITES Appendix I listing.<br/><br/>Captive breeding of the species has been greatly successful.

123815345,39430,Geochelone elegans,Vulnerable,A4cd,2020,2018-03-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This assessment has considered recent documented levels of exploitation and the suspected future reduction in population size that could occur because of this activity. Available information indicates that this species has a relatively large population size of &gt;10,000 with an extent of occurrence (EOO) &gt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of more than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>. These populations are present in both protected areas, in agricultural landscapes and in some anthropogenic habitats in India and Sri Lanka and as a small subpopulation in Pakistan. However, studies have shown that the illegal wildlife trade is increasingly targeting this species to meet apparently increasing international demand for use as ‘exotic pets’. In 2014, more than 55,000 individuals were known to have been collected from just one location (comprised of 16 villages) in India during one year alone (D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2015). Extensive conversion of their natural habitat (scrubland) to less suitable orchards and croplands is likely to reduce populations further in the future. Based on recent past and predicted future declines, a listing of Vulnerable A4cd is proposed given concerns that population reductions of&#160; &gt;30% are likely over three generations if this exploitation and other threats (road kill, brush remover, etc) continues or expands.&#160;</p><p><br/></p><p></p>","<p>Adult males typically reach up to 26 cm and adult females typically up to 32 cm in carapace length (Moll 1989). Observations made from nearly 400 star tortoises from various parts of the country indicate that the female is larger and heavier than the male. In Sri Lanka so far the record is of a female measuring 380 mm straight carapace length and weighed 6.6 kg kept in a tourist hotel in Hambantota (South East Sri&#160; lanka) (Jayawardena 1997). In India, Vyas (2011) reported of the largest recorded star tortoise from Sayaji Baug Zoo, India with a body weight (8.96 kg) that had a straight carapace length of 41.0 cm. Matz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(1971) reported a star tortoise from India which weighed 7.0 kg and 38.0 cm carapace length. Frazier (1987) reported of another specimen from Jasdan, Rajkot District, Gujarat with 42.9 cm curved carapace length. All these&#160;<em>Geochelone elegans</em>&#160;of exceptionally large size were females. Comparing local as well as world records of exceptionally large star tortoises, it is certain that the star tortoise from Lunugamwehera National Park, Sri Lanka is the currently known largest and heaviest star tortoise in the world (Curved carapace length 57.5 cm and weighed 14 kg) (de Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Females attain sexual maturity at around 6–7 years of age (possibly earlier) (Das 1991, R. Vyas pers. comm. 2005). However, in captivity this may be attained by the age of three years (B.C. Choudhury pers. comm. 2005). Nesting seasons coincide with the monsoons that vary depending on the geographic location (e.g., May to June in western India, March to June and October to January in southeastern India) (Das 2002). Annually, females typically produce two clutches (exceptionally up to four clutches) comprising 2–10 eggs (exceptionally up to 24 eggs; Andrews, B.C. Choudhury, R. Vyas, pers. comm. 2005). Generation time has been estimated to be around 10 years (B.C. Choudhury, pers. comm. 2005). A detailed overview of natural history is presented by Das (2002), de Silva (2003), Deraniyagala (1939) and Fyfe (2007).<br/><br/>Star tortoises inhabit a variety of dry vegetation types, including scrublands, grasslands, desert edges and agricultural landscapes of fields, hedgerows and plantations (de Silva 2003, Fyfe 2007). It is a highly generalized habitat preference species (Moll 1989, de Silva, 2017).<br/><br/>Most localities occur under 200 m altitude, but records from 450 m and even as high as 900 m have been reported (Andrews pers. comm. 2005). In Sri Lanka, this species occurs throughout the dry habitats mainly up to 270 m altitude (Rathnayake pers. comm. 2005, de Silva 2003). Indian Star Tortoises feed mainly on a variety of grasses, herbaceous, succulent vegetation and fruits supplemented with some animal matter (Das 1991, de Silva 2003). Although the star tortoise is largely herbivorous they have been observed feeding on dry dog faecal matter. They come to road sides searching for faecal matter of dogs in fact some villagers around the Mihintale Sanctuary informed us that they have seen the star tortoise feeding on dry dog excreta on the road (Jayawkrama <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Choudhury and Rao (2005) recorded several species of indigenous plant that were preferred by Indian Star Tortoises in a soft release site in Andhra Pradesh.&#160;</p>","<p>Threats to this species survival include illegal collection and habitat loss&#160;and&#160; habitat modification (WWF 1994, Sekhar 2004, Anand 2005, Fyfe 2007, Vyas 2010). “Illegal collection” can be subdivided into two further categories: collection for utilisation by local people and collection for the international wildlife trade (D'Cruze<em> et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Locally, in rural areas, tortoises are sometimes eaten for subsistence, recent surveys in Sri Lanka indicated that some people have started eat the flesh and eggs of the star tortoise&#160; (Ekanayake <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, de Silva, 2003,A. de Silva unpub. data. 2018). However, In Sri Lanka, earlier the majority of people consider the flesh of the star tortoise to be poisonous. It should be noted here that the Royal Air Force (1942) in their book on tips for the servicemen in Sri Lanka also record that the flesh of the star tortoise should not be eaten. In Sri Lanka, during the Andigama study, of the 105 marked specimens of wild <em>Geochelone elegans,</em> sixty two (59%) specimens had their carapaces damaged. These ranged from minor to grievous injuries. Of these 62 injured specimens, 29 individuals had damage that was inferred to have been caused by agricultural implements (de Silva 1995, 2003).<br/><br/>The following is a new threat to the Indian Star Tortoise which was not documented earlier. During inquires with villagers regarding threats that they have observed to the species, we were informed that many star tortoises get killed while clearing shrubs using a locally made brush remover, several star tortoises cut into pieces were observed. It is assumed that appreciable number of star tortoises are getting and will get killed due to this new method of clearing the undergrowth in star tortoise areas, and this may now be the main threat to the species in Sri Lanka (de Silva 2015, A. de Silva pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Star tortoises are also kept as pets in many homes, their owners believing that they bring good luck and fortune (e.g. Anand 2005). Over 100 hatchlings have been observed in one urban household in India alone (D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition, for many people the Indian Star Tortoise plays an even more spiritual role in some societies as they are thought to represent a reincarnation of the Hindu God “Vishnu” (D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2015, researchers observed a total of 22 animals at three different Shiva temples in the state of Gujarat, India (D'Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2015). However, in Sri Lanka, some consider that if a star tortoise comes into one's garden it is extremely unlucky and brings ill effects to the householders. Tamils in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka believe that a tortoise will bring bad luck if it comes into the compound.&#160; In fact one Sinhalese name for the star tortoise is Hooniyam ibba (= magic or witchcraft tortoise) (de Silva 2011).<br/><br/>It is illegal collection for the international wildlife trade that is of most major concern. Widespread collection and export occurs for local and global pet trade, mainly to Malaysia (Shepherd <em>et al. </em>2004), Singapore and Thailand, as well as other countries in Southeast and East Asia. Das (1989) estimated an annual turn-over of 10,000 animals in Calcutta’s New Market alone in the late 1970s, before enforcement of domestic legislation nearly eliminated this domestic trade. Export trade seems to have developed into the replacement trade outlet (Choudhury and Bhupathy 1993); by 1993, about 5,000 tortoises were estimated as illegally exported. A recent conservative estimate of annual pet-trade export is 10,000 to 20,000 animals, and four confiscated shipments in 2002–2003 comprised between 305 and 1,090 animals per shipment (Shepherd<em> et al.</em> 2004). Between 2011 and 2015 over 13,000 individuals were confiscated in India (Mendiratta <em>et al</em>. 2017). Most of the pet trade involves small to medium-sized animals, few exceeding 10 cm carapace length. D'Cruze<em> et al.</em> (2015) reported the illegal collection of at least 55,000 (mostly juvenile) tortoises from just one location (comprising 16 villages) from the state of Andhra Pradesh in India over a period of one year. This figure is three to six times larger than the 10,000–20,000 individuals previously estimated to be poached throughout the entire range of this species each year (Sekhar <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>In 2017, two thousand and eighty-nine (2,089) live star tortoises (<em>G. elegans</em>) packed inside seven travelling bags were discovered by Sri Lankan Navy officers on a boat about five nautical miles from Kalpitiya at 19:30 hours on 17th June, 2017. Subsequently, the seized animals were handed over to the Sri Lankan Customs Department, Colombo on 18th June, who in turn handed the animals over to the Department of National Zoological Gardens on 19th June, 2017. Subsequently another approximately one thousand captive&#160;<em>G. elegans&#160;</em>were found by the police at Kalpitiya. These too were handed over to the Department of National Zoological Gardens. The tortoises were in a highly stressed, dehydrated and malnourished condition and additionally, some had upper respiratory tract infection and eye infections (Malsinghe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). These incidents are cited to provide evidence of the scale of poaching that is ongoing for this species.<br/><br/>There are concerns that this species is being illegally smuggled from India through Sri Lanka into pet markets in Asia, Europe and the United States (de Silva 2003, Horne <em>et al.</em> 2012, Vyas 2015). However, the majority of animals appear to be destined for use as exotic pets in Asian countries, such as Thailand and China (Shepherd <em>et al.</em> 2004, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2015). This species was the most frequent illegally traded tortoise seized by Thai authorities between 2008 and 2013 (5,966 individuals during 15 cases) and is the most commonly observed tortoise at the infamous Chatuchak Market in Thailand (Chng 2014).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is occurring throughout the species' range; scrub forest habitat is being converted to orchards and cash crop agriculture, leading to reduction of available area of the preferred habitat type. Although this is a relatively adaptable species, able to tolerate anthropogenically altered habitat, continued habitat loss is likely to further impact wild numbers.</p><p></p>","<p><em>Geochelone elegans</em> naturally inhabits scrub forests, grasslands, and some coastal scrublands of arid and semi-arid regions throughout its wide range (Das 2002), but also commonly inhabits&#160; human-dominated landscapes (Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000, de Silva 2003). Frazier (in Das 1991) recorded estimated densities of 4–12.5 animals per hectare in Gujarat. Populations in Sri Lanka are also generally considered common, although the 1998 Sri Lankan CAMP Assessment noted the species as declining and rated it Vulnerable A2cd. Any populations in Pakistan appear to be extremely localised and small (Moll 1983, 1989). It is suspected that population reductions of&#160; &gt;30% are likely over three generations from the recent past and into the future.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Star Tortoises are found in three broadly disjunct (and possibly taxonomically recognizable; Gaur <em>et al.</em> 2006) areas of geographic occurrence: northwestern India (Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Madhra Pradesh) and adjoining southeastern Pakistan; eastern and southern India from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and eastern Karnataka to Odisha (Orissa); and Sri Lanka, where it is found mainly in the dry zone lowlands (de Silva, 1995, 1996, 2003; Iverson 1992; Das 1991, 2002; Vyas and Parasharya 2000; Fyfe 2007; Vyas 2010).</p>","<p>Illegal collection for the international wildlife trade is of most concern. Widespread collection and export occurs for local and global pet trade, mainly to Malaysia (Shepherd <em>et al</em>. 2004, Jansen and de Silva 2019), Singapore and Thailand, as well as other countries in Southeast and East Asia. Das (1989) estimated an annual turn-over of 10,000 animals in Calcutta's New Market alone in the late 1970s, before enforcement of domestic legislation nearly eliminated this trade. The export trade seems to have developed into the replacement trade outlet (Choudhury and Bhupathy 1993); by 1993, about 5,000 tortoises were estimated as illegally exported. A recent conservative estimate of annual pet-trade export is 10,000 to 20,000 animals (mostly juveniles), and four confiscated shipments in 2002–2003 comprised between 305 and 1,090 animals per shipment (Shepherd <em>et al.</em> 2004). Most of the pet trade involves small to medium-sized animals, few exceeding 10 cm CL (D'Cruze <em>et al. </em>2015) reported the illegal collection of at least 55,000 (mostly juvenile) tortoises from just one location (comprising 16 villages) from the state of Andhra Pradesh in India over a period of one year. This figure is three to six times larger than the 10,000–20,000 individuals previously estimated to be poached throughout the entire range of this species each year (Sekhar <em>et al. </em>2004, Vyas 2015). The bulk of the trade involves the southern Indian (Andhra Pradesh) populations; there is little evidence of trade from northwestern Indian populations (Gujarat). Trade from southern populations presumably also involves animals from Karnataka, although this needs confirmation.<br/><br/>Northwestern populations appear to be less attractively coloured, and therefore perhaps less in demand for the international pet trade. However, in the capital of Gujarat you can often still find star tortoises in family gardens.&#160; It is also found in markets in Pakistan (U. Noureen pers. comm.). There are concerns that this species is being illegally smuggled from India to pet markets in Asia, Europe, and the United States (Horne <em>et al. </em>2012, Vyas 2015). Recent detections in Sri Lanka indicate that Sri Lanka is one base in the smuggling triangle (A. de Silva pers. obs.). However, the majority of animals appear to be destined for use as exotic pets in Asian countries, such as Thailand, China, and Malaysia (Shepherd <em>et al.</em> 2004, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2015, Chng and Bouhuys 2015, Jansen and de Silva 2019). In 2017, Two thousand eighty nine (2089) live star tortoises packed inside seven travelling bags were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy officers about five nautical miles from Kalpitiya at 19:30 hours on 17th June, 2017. Subsequently, the seized animals were handed over to the Sri Lankan Customs Department, Colombo on 18th June, who in turn handed the animals over to the Department of National Zoological Gardens on 19th June, 2017. These tortoises were in a highly stressed, dehydrated and malnourished condition and additionally, some had upper respiratory tract infection and eye infections (Malsinghe<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2017). Within few months, most of these confiscated tortoises died due to ill health.&#160;Subsequently another thousand or so&#160;<em>Geochelone elegans&#160;</em>were found by the police at Kalpitiya. These too were handed over to the Department of National Zoological Gardens (A. de Silva pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>This species was the most frequent illegally traded tortoise seized by Thai authorities between 2008 and 2013 (5,966 individuals during 15 cases) and is the most commonly observed tortoise at the infamous Chatuchak Market in Thailand (Chng 2014, Shepherd and Nijman 2008). Although the species is less frequently observed at Chatuchak Market now, online trade in Thailand persists. Between 2008 and 2013, Thailand seized more than 6,000 Indian Star Tortoises (Nijman and Shepherd 2014). Additionally, legal loopholes in Thailand's national legislation enables domestic trade in illegally-sourced species, as non-native species are generally not covered by national legislation in Thailand (Nijman and Shepherd 2015).<br/><br/>Trade in Indian Star Tortoises in Indonesia has been well documented, though the scale of online trade is difficult to measure (Shepherd and Nijman 2007, Stengel <em>et al. </em>2011). Regulation of domestic trade of the species is difficult as non-native species are not adequately covered by national law.<br/><br/>In some countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore, there is a reduction in open trade of this species in pet stores, although some level of online trade persists. However, in other countries, the trade continues openly and without any signs of reduction. The species remains common in trade in Indonesia, Hong Kong, mainland China and many other parts of Asia. Trade levels of this species in other parts of the world are poorly understood and more research is needed.&#160;Online trade in this species is common and allows for a broader global market. The scale of the online trade at a global scale is not known, however, this species is readily available online and often in considerable quantities.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Since 1975, this species (as Testudinidae spp.) has been included on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (UNEP-WCMC 2011). Consequently, international trade in specimens can take place if an export permit or re-export permit is acquired (CITES 2015). The species was uplisted to CITES Appendix I in 2019, which prohibits all international trade . This listing came into effect on 26 November 2019. In the interim, to safeguard its wild populations, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan had chosen to adopt stricter domestic measures than CITES (WWF 1994). For example, the species was placed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and for over 40 years it has been illegal to possess and commercially trade this species either within or from India (Sekhar 2004). However, threat perceptions from illegal trade seem to have substantially increased over this period and there is a case for upgrading the species to Schedule II.<br/><br/>The Government of Sri Lanka is a signatory to CITES, (signed on 2nd August 1979) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (signed in 1992). However, it is well known that the enforcement of this legislation is weak (CEA 1988 and Ministry of Environment 1991). The Department of Wildlife Conservation is the Government agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of all turtle conservation measures.&#160;<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>&#160;(Leatherback Turtle) was the first species of turtle to be protected in Sri Lanka, which law was enacted in 1970 and subsequently, under the amendment of Fauna and Flora Protection Act of June 1972. However, the 7th amendment to the Act (No.49 of 1993) gave total protection to all chelonian species.</p><p>The Forest, Environment and Wildlife Department of the Government of Sindh, Pakistan through a notification issued on September 2014, included <em>Geochelone elegans</em> along with other chelonian species of Pakistan in Schedule II (Protected Animals) of Sindh Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1972. However, there are concerns that legislation in other Asian countries is being exploited to facilitate illegal wildlife trade (Nijman and Shepherd 2015, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2015). A review of existing legislation relating to the commercial use of this species in key consumer countries is warranted.<br/><br/>Given the scale and apparently increasing nature of illegal collection for international wildlife trade, increased cooperation between relevant national enforcement bodies in collaboration with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ Wildlife Enforcement Network (ASEAN-WEN) is also required. However, this enforcement activity should be accompanied by targeted public awareness initiatives that address the increasing consumer demand.<br/><br/><em>Geochelone elegans</em> has been recorded from Sasan Gir National Park (Gujarat), Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary (Rajasthan), Marine National Park, Kalakkad, Mudumalai, and Point Callimere Wildlife Sanctuaries (Tamil Nadu) in India (Das 1995, Hanfee 1999), in all terrestrial protected areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in Peninsular India (Choudhury, pers. comm.) and from Yala National Park, Bundala National Park, Dimbulagala, Lungamwehera, Udawalawe, Gal Oya,&#160;Giritale and Wilpattu National Parks in Sri Lanka (de Silva <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>In addition, more detailed quantitative research should be carried out in order to establish the impact that this unregulated activity is having on wild populations of this species in range countries. A systematic screening of the genetic differentiation of wild star tortoises should also be undertaken across its entire distribution range to provide a sound basis for the relocation of confiscated tortoises (Vamberger <em>et al</em>. 2020). In light of continued habitat loss, status information and monitoring of populations throughout their range, particularly inside protected areas, is also urgently needed. To aid this activity, a taxonomic review of variability between various subpopulations of Indian Star Tortoises (and Burmese Stars) also seems warranted (Gaur e<em>t al.</em> 2006, Fyfe 2007).</p><br/><p></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The species' extent of occurrence and area of occupancy are both considered to be below 10 km<sup>2</sup>, and it is considered to occur at a single location defined by multiple agricultural activities leading to a continuing decline in the quality of its habitat. Although there is evidence of recent reproduction, it is unknown whether the species is genuinely able to persist as a viable population in coffee plantations and its closest relatives are not known to be tolerant of deforestation. In addition, some of the coffee plantations in this area are being replaced with pepper farms which will not retain shade or leaf litter thought to be necessary for this species' persistence.","All specimens in the type series were taken from the trunks of coffee trees in a sun-grown coffee farm, between 19:30 and 22:00 hrs (Luu <em>et al. </em>2017). The image of the species' habitat in Luu <em>et al.</em> (2017) indicates that animals were taken in a shaded situation. V. Luu (pers. comm. 2018) reports that animals shelter under dry leaf litter by day. Other members of the <em>Cyrtodactylus irregularis </em>group appear to be at least somewhat reliant on primary forest and have generally been found in protected areas (Luu <em>et al. </em>2017). The presence of a breeding population of the new species in a coffee farm may suggest this species group is more adaptable than previously recognized (Luu<em> et al</em>. 2017).","The known locality lies in a coffee farm, and&#160;Google Map images suggest there is no good forest in the surrounding area (V.

Although the presence of juveniles and subadults in the type series indicates that a breeding population of this species can survive in this habitat, it is unknown whether this population is viable in the long term. Forest conversion for agriculture and clearance (through burning or collection) of leaf litter are considered threats to this species, and some of the coffee farms in this area are being converted to pepper cultivation (V. Luu pers. comm. 2018). Irrigation practices on the farm flood the species' habitat several times a week (every 4-6 days) in the dry season (V.

Until better data can be obtained, it is listed as Vulnerable since its population appears to have undergone a rapid decline which, with threats continuing or increasing, is projected to continue. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is generally not migratory but those that inhabit seasonal wetlands are irregularly nomadic in response to water availability (<strong></strong>del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. The Ethiopian population, however, does appear to migrate locally<strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). It breeds in May-October, leaving the breeding area in November-December when the wetlands dry up, and returning with the rains in May-June<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> </strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996).  Other populations breed in territorial pairs (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong> between July and December with a peak during the months of August and September coinciding with the peak of the floods<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). The most southerly populations often breed a little earlier in July-August <strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). During the non-breeding season the species is fairly congregatory, occurring regularly in flocks of 10-50 individuals (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>, and there are reports of flocks of up to 1,000 in the Okavango Delta in April-May (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <strong>Habitat </strong>In South Africa this species was found to occupy large home ranges of approximately 16 km<sup>2</sup>, which consist largely (75%) of grassland with a small core of essential wetland breeding habitat <strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>McCann and Benn 2006).<strong> </strong><em>Breeding </em>It nests in shallow sedge-dominated wetlands, often above 2,000 m altitude (<strong></strong>del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>. In South Africa and Zimbabwe it breeds on undisturbed small permanent wetlands surrounded by grassland or miombo (<em>Brachystegia</em>) woodland in high rainfall areas with plateau topography (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005), where human disturbance is minimal<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> (</span>Archibald and Meine 1996)<strong></strong>. Ephemeral and seasonal wetlands may be used opportunistically by breeding pairs or serve as important post-breeding dispersal areas<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). In South Africa it relies on relatively undisturbed mid-altitude wetland-grassland mosaics<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>McCann and Benn 2006). Elsewhere in its range it breeds on large low-lying tropical, seasonal flood plains such as the Okavango Delta (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong> where wetlands are bordered by grasslands<strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). It may use man-made habitats such as dams (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Ethiopian population uses high-altitude wetlands in the Bale Mountains<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season the species continues to rely on wetland habitats surrounded by grassland<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>McCann and Benn 2006)<strong></strong>. It congregates at large wetlands on riparian floodplains, but also requires pristine or semi-pristine, high-altitude wetlands and grasslands in some places<strong>&#160;(</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996;&#160;Barnes 2000; Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 1998). It frequents dambos (depressions), permanently isolated wetlands (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006) and vleis<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>) as well as using grasslands, pastures, and occasionally cultivated fields for foraging (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Dams and pans are used as roosting sites during the non-breeding season (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Ethiopian population is less dependent on wetlands during this season, generally moving to drier, lower elevation habitats including ploughed fields<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). Birds that breed in the Okavango Delta often move to recently burnt ground in the dry season (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <strong>Diet </strong>The species feeds on rhizomes, roots and bulbs of sedges (<em>Cyperus</em> and <em>Eleocharis</em> spp. [Bento 2002]), and grass sward and seed (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). It will also take animals including small aquatic snails, fish and frogs<strong> </strong>(Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Chicks are reported to eat insects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>).<strong> Breeding site </strong>Preferred nesting sites are where grass and sedge marshes are bordered by drier, flat to sloping grassland meadows, with medium height vegetation and water up to 1 m in depth (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The nest is a large mound of plant material (reeds and sedges), 1 m in diameter and protruding 20 cm above the water surface, usually with a moat of open water about a metre in diameter around it. A significant proportion of nests in the Okavango Delta are on small mud islands two or three metres in diameter, exposed by 20-30 cm as floodwaters recede, and in these cases, the eggs are laid on few pieces of reed or sedge stems. Fidelity to the previous year's nesting area is suspected. The clutch size is one or two (68% and 32% of nests respectively, in Botswana)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>)<strong></strong>, however only one chick is raised from clutches of two and the other egg is abandoned<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Pittman 2007)<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong><strong></strong>.

Reproductive maturity is reached at about the age of seven and the species is monogamous, pairing for life.  <p></p>","The primary threat is loss and degradation of wetlands as a result of upstream river regulation, intensified agriculture, mining, drainage, invasive species such as <em>Mimosa pigra</em>, and rice cultivation (Burke 1996<strong>, </strong>W. R. J. Dean <em>in litt. </em>1999<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span><strong> </strong>Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002, McCann and Benn 2006, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Uys 2012). Other threats include nest disturbance<strong> </strong>(P. Leonard <em>in litt. </em>1999, P. Mundy <em>in litt. </em>1999,<strong> </strong>McCann and Benn 2006); grass-burning regimes (M. Herremans &amp; R. E. Simmons <em>in litt. </em>1999, T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), though in the non-breeding season burnt floodplains are used for feeding in some areas<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003); poisoning; collision with utility lines<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996); direct consumption of chicks; persecution, and traditional medicine<strong> </strong>(A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998). Increasing livestock farming, wars, desertification and agrochemicals are additional threats to the species's habitats<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Nest destruction through trampling by livestock is believed to be a problem<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The population is threatened by the illegal removal of eggs and chicks for international trade<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). Adults are also taken for trade and are hunted<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The level of exports from Tanzania is believed to exceed known legal exports<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The destruction of vegetation by fires probably leaves adults more susceptible to predation and hunting, and flood levels in turn influence the extent and intensity of fires (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Recent potential threats that could extensively affect a large portion of the Okavango Delta include the proposed hydroelectric scheme at Popa Falls in Namibia, papyrus cutting, channel modification, and the extensive aerial spraying of pesticide to eradicate the tsetse fly<strong> </strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The extent of suitable breeding habitat in the Zambezi Delta (Mozambique) and Kafue Flats (Zambia) and the suitability of remaining habitat for feeding is believed to have declined as a result of the interruption of the natural flooding regime by the Cahora Bassa (Tete province), Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe), and Itezhi-tezhi (Zambia) dams upstream, and hunting is also a threat in this country<strong> </strong>(Parker 2005, Bento <em>et al</em>. 2007). Breeding success appears to be low in the species<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b).<strong> </strong>A pre-fledging chick:adult ratio of 5.8% on the Okavango Delta in January 2003 indicates a low chick survival rate<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock 2003). However, each pair of this long-lived species needs to raise only two chicks that survive to adulthood over the course of their lifetimes for the population to remain stable<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The species is highly sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon home ranges which are impacted by adjacent land-use (Morrison and Bothma 1998).   <br/><p></p>","Its present world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals (Pittman 2007) or fewer (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), fewer than 8,000 individuals (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100, placed in the range 9,000-10,000. This increase though may not be a true increase in the population and further research to better understand the movements between the key flood plains in south-central Africa and the seasonal movements whereby cranes come together in large flocks in the drier season needs to be explored further (Morrison in press).

The total population appeared stable from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996), however when estimates from the 1980s are compared with those from 2006, it is judged to have declined significantly<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), perhaps indicating declines in the last 10 years. The key Zambian population at the Kafue Flats reportedly fell in the mid-1990s (Archibald and Meine 1996, Burke 1996) and was estimated at c.1,000 individuals in 2002<strong> </strong>(Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002), but may now be as high as around 2,900 individuals (Shunangu <em>et al. </em>2015). Significant populations elsewhere in Zambia include the Liuwa Plains (1,900 individuals [Viljoen 2015]) and the Bangweulu Swamps (African Parks Foundation pers. comm.<em> </em>to K. Morrison 2016). The Okavango Delta in Botswana also holds a significant population, of between 1,200 and 1,300 birds (Hancock 2008). The comparison of 2002 estimates with those from 1993 suggests marked declines in Mozambique, Zambia and possibly Botswana (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The substantial reduction in numbers since 1993 apparently reflects real declines at individual sites and regions, although the 2002 estimate may be influenced by an improvement in accuracy relative to previous estimates (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007) or fewer<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), not more than 8,000 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals<strong> </strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100 (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). It exists in three disjunct populations, the large south-central population and small Ethiopian and South African populations<strong> </strong>(Jones <em>et al.</em> 2006, Pittman 2007), which may be relicts from its former range<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. Protected areas (including Ramsar Sites) have been established in several key wetlands, notably in Zambia, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996; T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000; T. Fakarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). A major environmental flows initiative is underway for the Zambezi River basin, addressing the restoration of natural flooding patterns, conservation of basin wetlands, and control of invasive species in the Zambezi River basin (Beilfuss and Brown 2010).&#160; Key wetlands targeted by the program include the Kafue Flats, Zambezi Delta, Liuwa Plain, Busanga Swamps, and others, covering about 40% of the global Wattled Crane population. The initiative is a partnership between Zambezi basin dam operators and water authories, NGOs (World Wide Fund for Nature, International Crane Foundation), universities in the basin countries, and other stakeholders. In South Africa, and some other countries, action has included legal protection, marking and relocation of powerlines, awareness programmes, and encouragement of habitat protection, security and management by private landowners (Archibald and Meine 1996, Barnes 2000<strong>,</strong> Burke 1996). In the Kafue Flats, more than 800 ha of invasive <em>Mimosa pigra</em> was eradicated through aerial spraying and community-involvement in manual cutting (Shanungu 2009), although much of this has regrown due to a lack of follow up action (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). A conservation group conducted aerial surveys, field research and a community awareness programme in the Kafue Flats (Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002). Aerial surveys, nest monitoring<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Motsumi and Hancock 2004a, Nkape 2004) and monitoring of adult:juvenile ratios<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b) took place annually on the Okavango Delta in the early 2000s. Surveys and monitoring occur in several countries in south-central Africa (Zambia [International Crane Foundation (ICF) / Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) Partnership, in partnership with the Zambian Department of National Parks and Wildlife; African Parks Foundation], Zimbabwe [BirdLife Zimbabwe], Namibia [Namibia Crane Working Group], South Africa [ICF/EWT Partnership; Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, in partnership with the Endangered Wildlife Trust; KwaZulu-Natal Crane Foundation]), and also aim to drive more awareness amongst local communities (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 1993, an action plan was developed for the species at the African Crane and Wetland Training Workshop (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 1996). A continent-wide programme for the species was launched in 2001 to monitor the species's status and threats, and help develop effective conservation programmes for the management of wetland systems<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). National conservation plans have been developed for Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Following a workshop in July 2000, the Wattled Crane Recovery Programme was initiated for the South African population<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Pittman 2007). There are currently five partners in this South African programme, one aim of which is to establish a viable captive population and supplement the wild population (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2012). The Johannesburg Zoo has also built a dedicated chick-rearing facility, and several captive management facilities throughout South Africa now participate in the breeding programme<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). In 2005, it was announced that a veterinary fence would be constructed to the east of the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park in Botswana, effectively extending the park boundary and protecting grasslands used by the species from the high density of livestock in the area<strong> </strong>(BirdLife Botswana 2006).

Improve protection of birds outside of protected areas such as the Jao/Boro rivers of Botswana<strong> </strong>(Gibson <em>et al</em>. 2002). Increase educational campaigns (A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998), targeting landowners with breeding cranes,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>as well policy makers (Burke 1996, T. Fokarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). Employ satellite tracking to study the species's movements across its range (BirdLife Botswana Crane Working Group 2004, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006).

It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered.  <p></p> <p></p>","It inhabits lowland dry, or seasonally inundated, natural and semi-natural grasslands, often interspersed with scattered scrub or patchy open forest. Some Indian populations appear to be resident, but the species may make short distance movements away from breeding areas with the arrival of the monsoon as vegetation becomes too dense for it (R. Jha <em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). These movements may take the species into areas of low human density with short-grazed grasslands and low-intensity agriculture (A. Rahmani and R. Jha <em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). In Cambodia, the species is known to make relatively local seasonal movements in response to the flooding regime of the Tonle Sap lake: in the dry season, the species breeds in grasslands in the inundation zone of the lake and then moves to nearby agricultural and degraded deciduous dipterocarp forest during the wet season (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016). During the breeding season, males preferentially select habitats related to low-intensity human activity, chiefly burned grassland, whereas females primarily select unburned grassland, but also use unburned, uncultivated grassland in dry-season rice head-ponds (Gray<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2009), although anecdotal evidence suggests that eggs are laid in small pockets of medium to tall grass in recently burnt areas (R. van Zalinge <em>pers. obs.</em>).<br/><p></p>","In South Asia, most populations are small, isolated and vulnerable to local extirpation. The key threats are the extensive loss and modification of grasslands through drainage, conversion to agriculture and plantations, overgrazing, inappropriate cutting, burning and ploughing regimes, heavy flooding, invasion of alien species, scrub expansion, dam construction and inappropriate and illegal development (Brahma and Lahkar 2009, Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Ibbett <em>et al. </em>2017). In particular, the spread of dry season rice cultivation in Cambodia is rapidly converting existing grassland habitat (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). An increase in the area of scrub vegetation between 1995/1996 and 2005 was responsible for 65% of grassland loss in Cambodia (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2013). Land sales and concessions are often pushed through despite resistance from local villagers (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Excessive hunting for sport and food may have triggered the species's decline, but owing to advocacy and law enforcement this is no longer a serious threat, at least in Cambodia. Other threats may include human disturbance and trampling of nests by livestock. Detailed research into the species's ecology in Cambodia demonstrated that the effects of human disturbance are weak and annual burning is important for maintaining suitable habitat, supporting the idea that community-based grassland management that maintains traditional agricultural practices will benefit the species. This has implications for management in South Asia, where remaining (and declining) populations are largely confined to strictly protected areas in which such practices may not be occurring (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Further study has revealed that, whilst burned grassland is selected by males during the breeding season, unburned grassland and other habitats providing cover are selected by females, demonstrating the need for management that provides a variety of habitats (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009b). Proposed development of powerlines in Cambodia could prove to be a significant emerging threat to the species there (Mahood <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><p></p>","The population in Cambodia was estimated at 294 displaying males or c. 600 individuals in 2009 (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2009a), but recently an extensive survey has reported a total of only 432 individuals (95% CI 312-550) (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). 75-96 individuals remain in Nepal (Baral<em> et al. </em>2013). No recent total population estimates are known from India, but &gt;100 males were recorded in the country in recent surveys, with the population in D'Ering Wildlife Sanctuary potentially holding 50-60 territorial males (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). Given these estimates, the total global population for this species is tentatively placed in the range 250-999 mature individuals. This equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species&#160;has two disjunct populations, one in the Indian Subcontinent, the other in South-East Asia (BirdLife International 2001). The former occurs from Uttar Pradesh, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>, through the terai of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nepal</span>, to Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, India, and historically to <strong>Bangladesh</strong>. It has declined dramatically and only survives in small, highly fragmented populations; although modelling work suggests that there are large areas of suitable habitat that could contain larger populations, especially in areas around the Brahmaputra River (Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). Declines have apparently continued even inside protected areas e.g. Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, Dudhwa and&#160;Pilibhit parks, India&#160;(Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, R. Jha&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016). Surveys and interviews with staff at four protected areas in the North Bank area of Assam suggest that the species has been largely absent from three of them since 2000 (Brahma and Lahkar 2009).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Recent surveys in Assam, India (2014-2016), found 33 adult territorial males in Manas Tiger Reserve, 32 adult males in Kaziranga National Park, 10 territorial males in Orang National Park, and 4-6 birds in Laokhawa-Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). Additionally, island surveys of the Brahmaputra River in 2015 revealed the presense of 5-6 birds in as many river islands, while 12-15 adult male birds were found on the Sadia plains and river islands (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Arunachal Pradesh, 5-7 male floricans were seen in a private grassland in Nizambhat, and a new population with up to 29 territorial males was found in April-June survey in 2016 in D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary in East Siang District (Rahmani 2016). It is estimated that 60-70 territorial males could be present in D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary, making it one of the most important areas for <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">floricans in India (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Uttar Pradesh, India, the numbers appears to have declined, as only 8 territorial males were seen in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, down from 24 seen in 2001, while a small population of 5-6 males was found in Pilibhet Tiger Reserve. As females are extremely difficult to see, their number was not recorded as part of these surveys.&#160;An estimate from 2007 put the Nepalese population at just 28-36 mature individuals (restricted to a few widespread sites) (Poudyal 2007), down from 32-60 individuals in 2001. Recent intensive survey effort in Nepal has recorded 47 individuals in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, including 14 birds outside any protected area and an estimate of 60 individuals in total (Baral <em>et al. </em>2013). This is almost double the numbers from a survey of the area in 2012 when around 12 pairs were estimated (Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012), but this is due to a more rigorous survey methodology (Baral <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;This is the largest population in Nepal (Baral <em>et al. </em>2013) and, if numbers from the 2007 survey are still accurate, this would put the total number of mature individuals in Nepal at 75-96.&#160;<br/>The South-East Asian population occurs in <strong>Cambodia</strong> and may be extant in southern <strong>Vietnam</strong>. The population in the Tonle Sap region, which supports the vast majority of the population of Cambodia, was estimated at between 312 and 550 based on surveys in 2012, with only 216 displaying males recorded (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). This represents a 44% decrease from the previous survey in 2005, and a minimum of 294 displaying males had been recorded in 2007 (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009a). If the population continues to decline at the current rate, it may become extinct in Cambodia within 10 years (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). More than 80% of the Cambodian population occurs on seasonally inundated grasslands within Kompong Thom province (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016). This estimate, based on the extent of available habitat in 2005 and known habitat loss between 2005 and 2007, represents a rapid decline owing to habitat loss, from a projected 3,000 individuals in 1997 (T. Gray, T. Evans and H. Chamnan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2006). Given accelerating post-2005 grassland loss of 28% within 10 grassland blocks holding 75% of the estimated population (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a), and a further 11% of habitat lost in four protected areas in 2008 (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009), projected rates of decline will equate to over 80% during a three generation period (T. Gray, T. Evans and H. Chamnan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2006). Recent assessment of habitat loss indicates that it has indeed been widespread and extensive between 2005 and 2012, and a number of sites identified as having blocks of grassland in excess of 10 square kilometers now contain little or no grassland (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013). Stoung-Chikreang BFCA and unprotected grasslands at Sankor support the highest populations (45 and 69 displaying males respectively in 2014), but estimates vary from year to year and population of the two sites is probably 100-150 displaying males (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Annual monitoring of Bengal Florican populations in Bengal Florican Conservation Areas (BFCAs) and adjacent areas in Cambodia during March-April 2008-2016 indicates that whilst populations in some protected areas are stable, in other locations population declines are ongoing. Outside of protected areas there is very little suitable grassland habitat remaining (Mahood<em> et al.</em> 2012). <br/><p></p></span>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. Several populations occur within protected areas, the most important being the Bengal Florican Conservation Area (BFCA) network in Cambodia (see Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012), Chitwan National Park, Royal Bardia National Park and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, Nepal, Kaziranga, D'Ering, Dibru-Saikhowa and Dudwa National Parks, India. Tiny, perhaps unsustainable populations may still remain at Ang Trapeang Thmor Sarus Crane Reserve, Cambodia, and within the Mekong Delta at Boeung Prek Lapouv Sarus Crane Reserve, Cambodia, and Tram Chim National Park, Vietnam. A research project investigating movements and habitat requirements in the non-breeding season began in 2007, where individuals were fitted with satellite or radio transmitters; the data from which have revealed previously unknown non-breeding sites (see Packman 2009). The Wildlife Conservation Society, BirdLife International and their government partners are engaged in a programme of conservation activities in the Tonle Sap floodplain of Cambodia, aimed at reducing habitat loss and hunting pressure on the species (A. W. Tordoff <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Achievements so far include the designation of 173 km<sup>2</sup> of breeding and 138 km<sup>2</sup> of non-breeding habitat as Bengal Florican Conservation Areas (BFCAs). Populations in the BFCAs and in adjacent areas have been monitored annually since 2008 using a survey which employs a randomised sampling design to measure occupancy of 1 km<sup>2</sup> squares by displaying males, which allows results to be extrapolated within and across sites to obtain accurate population and trend data. These data indicate that the population is probably stable at some BFCAs and possibly declining in others and in adjacent areas (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009, 2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Suitable habitat in BFCAs continues to be lost to various threats, including the expansion of dry season rice cultivation and dam construction (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2010), although overall habitat loss outside BFCAs has been much greater. <br/><br/>Work is on-going to maintain effective management structures for these areas and build constituencies of support for their conservation among local stakeholders. Official patrol teams are now operating in Kampong Thom and Siem Reap, and in both provinces the Forestry Administration, working through provincial commissions, has already halted several proposed developments which would otherwise have destroyed vital breeding habitat (Eames 2007, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, 2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Changes in land use in the Tonle Sap floodplain and in the BFCAs in particular are also monitored with the aid of aerial and/or satellite images (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). When land encroachment in the BFCAs is detected through patrols or satellite-monitoring, WCS facilitates meetings between the parties concerned to resolve disputes and reverse encroachment. An in-depth socio-economic study has been conducted by the Centre d'Etude et de Développement Agricole Cambodgien. The report highlights the economic benefits local communities derive through the traditional use of grasslands and is used to build support among key decision makers and local communities. An awareness programme covering 71 villages and over 3,200 people was conducted in 2008/2009, and outreach activities in schools and villages are ongoing. Training in selected villages was conducted to improve agricultural systems and reduce the immediate pressure on grasslands from people wanting to convert grasslands into agriculture (BirdLife International 2009). Villagers receive financial rewards for reporting nests which they incidentally find as a deterrent against collecting and eating the eggs; finders receive an additional financial reward if the nest fledges successfully, although nest-finders are discouraged from protecting the nests directly to reduce accidental disturbance to birds (van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). <br/><br/>At the four breeding season BFCAs, community management committees have been established to act as intermediaries between WCS, government partners and the communities, they assist in awareness raising, patrolling and reporting illegal activities in the BFCAs. At one of the BFCAs rice is purchased at a premium from local farmers abiding by conservation agreements under a wildlife-friendly rice initiative and community members gain an additional income from acting as guides to birdwatchers visiting the site through the Sam Veasna Centre. These activities appear to be having some early success in arresting the rapid decline of the species in Cambodia, but their long-term outcome remains to be seen.<br/><br/>In 2012, a Darwin Initiative project was initiated to look at the species's distribution and habitat requirements in India and Nepal (Barber 2013). In Nepal, two male birds were satellite-tagged in April 2013 (Barber 2013), followed by two females and a male in 2014 and three males in India in 2014 (Barber 2014), and a further two males have been tagged in Nepal and one male in India (R. Jha&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). As a result of the tagging work, conservationists will be able to identify important areas for the species and propose suitable management regimes. Trial habitat plots have also been established to understand habitat preferences.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue annual monitoring of the population in the BFCAs, Cambodia, and replicate the monitoring protocol in key sites in India and Nepal. Conduct research on breeding productivity and habitat utilisation in breeding and non-breeding BFCAs. Introduce a protected area management regime, including appropriate rotational burning, grazing and cutting based on research findings; and promote appropriate land-management actions in non-protected areas, e.g. low intensity agricultural areas that are used in the non-breeding season (see Jha <em>et al.&#160;</em>&#160;2018). Promote grassland conservation awareness initiatives in all range countries. Strengthen the legal protection for existing BFCAs and expand the network (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2009, 2010, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Continue surveys for populations, particularly in Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve and Koshi Barrage, Nepal (Poudyal 2007). Identify additional important sites for birds in the non-breeding season in Cambodia. Land acquisition outside the BFCA network and/or conservation concessions may be required to protect important areas for the species (Handschuh 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Extend, upgrade, link and improve enforcement in protected areas in India and Nepal, and establish new ones. Devise and promote a conservation strategy for all Asian bustards. Share best practice guidelines for management of small bustards in grassland habitats across Europe and Asia. Encourage community engagement to try to improve the level of protection within protected areas, and investigate potential initiatives to promote conservation-friendly development, such as the Sustainable Rice Platform (Ibbett <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><p></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Former commercial plantations were ceded to an international oil-palm  producing company in 2009, who apparently plan to restore c.2,000 ha of  plantations on the south coast, potentially either reducing hunting and  other pressures on the forest through creating local employment, or  alternatively increasing impacts as people move to the area in search of  work (Olmos and Turshak 2010). Recent clearing of secondary growth and  abandoned oil-palm  plantations  to  plant new oil-palm has resulted in illegal logging in  areas occupied by  the species, such as Monte Carmo, with resulting loss of  habitat  quality and potential for further encroachment (F.

The species departs from its breeding grounds in northern Scandinavia and Arctic Russia in late August to early September. The Fennoscandian population follows several routes: either south (through Hungary), or east and then south, through the Russian Taimyr Peninsula in northern Siberia, northern Kazakhstan and finally the Black Sea<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Snow and Perrins 1998, Øien <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, to reach wintering grounds in south-east Europe.

Mikander <em>in litt. </em>2016). Disturbance by hunters can be a significant limiting factor on survival and breeding output<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Ebbinge and Spaans 1995, N. Petkov<strong>&#160;</strong><em>in litt.</em>&#160;2007). Illegal spring hunting and round-ups of moulting birds are taking place on the Russian breeding grounds (Jones <em>in press</em>) and illegal shooting continues in Norway (T. Aarvak <em>pers. comm.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In autumn and winter, illegal killing (including by poisoning; A. Fox <em>in litt. </em>2016) and accidental shooting on the staging and wintering grounds is the most important threat<strong></strong>&#160;(Madsen 1996, Aarvak&#160;<em>et al.</em>1997, Lorentsen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, <strong></strong>Kear 2005, Morozov 2006, Jones <em>in press</em>)<strong></strong>. In the Western Palearctic, at least 20-30% of the population are shot each year (Mooij 2010), often accidentally during hunting of other species. Habitat deterioration, as a result of land cultivation and increased water-levels in the Caspian Sea, is a further threat (Madsen 1996), as is habitat loss through the creation of reservoirs for hydroelectric power in Scandinavia (Madsen 1996). The species may also be threatened by nest predation from the Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em>&#160;and Arctic Fox <em>Alopex lagopus&#160;</em>(Madsen 1996, V. Morozov <em>in litt. </em>2016). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and others dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 28% of the habitat for this species could be lost by 2070<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Zöckler and Lysenko 2000).&#160;The wintering population at Dongting Lake, China, is considered to now be relatively stable, but the concentration of the majority of birds in this population at one site makes it extremely vulnerable to any factor that could affect this locality (Cong <em>et al. </em>2012), most notably with changing hydrology and water quality of the Yangtze River (A.

It has already been extirpated from some sites, and declines are likely to continue as a result of habitat loss and degradation, hunting and invasive predators.<p></p> <p></p>","<p>Field investigations on Hispaniola suggest that Black-capped Petrels lay eggs in mid- to late January, chicks hatch in mid- to late March and fledglings depart the colony sites in mid-June to early July (Simons <em>et al.</em> 2013). All nests located to date are at high elevations (&gt;1,500 m), and while most are in inaccessible areas (steep slopes, heavily forested) some are not (E. Rupp, <em>in litt.</em>). Nesting success from monitoring over 4 years was 70-77% (n = 47 nests) with abandonment and predation causing most failures (E. Rupp, <em>in litt</em>.)</p><p>Nesting birds commute long distances from breeding to foraging sites, typically feeding in flocks. It is primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, feeding on squid, fish, crustaceans, and <em>Sargassum</em>. In its primary foraging range, the Black-capped Petrel is most influenced by the position of the Gulf Stream, a dynamic current system, and not sea surface temperature or depth. (Simons <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p></p>","<p>The increased frequency of fires represents a significant threat to the Black-capped Petrel through habitat loss, degradation and direct mortality. Fires and electric lights can cause the birds to become confused and disorientated causing mortality through collisions or grounding of the birds (Wingate 1964). Once grounded, many birds are unable to regain flight, leaving them vulnerable to predation and starvation. A number of electric communication towers are located on mountaintops close to petrel breeding grounds and are often stabilised with multiple guy wires and well lit (Goetz <em>et al.</em> 2012). These towers appear to be a considerable source of mortality, with a two-night investigation in 2013 finding several dead and grounded birds below a single tower, as well as hearing birds hitting the guy wires (A. Brown <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Mitigation efforts are in place for some towers and have greatly reduced the impact at these locations however further towers require investigation and modification (A. Brown <em>in</em> <em>litt</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Small-holder farming, cattle ranching and logging for charcoal are all significant sources of habitat loss, despite being illegal within the forests of Sierra De Baoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic (BirdLife International 2016). Rats and Feral cats are abundant at all known Black-capped Petrel breeding locations and, although their current impact on the species is unknown, in other ecologically similar petrels these species are responsible for nest failure and fledgling and adult mortality (Goetz <em>et al.</em> 2012). Dogs, pigs and mongoose may also predate the species. Direct consumption by humans is implicated in the extirpation of Black-capped Petrel on Martinique and Guadeloupe (Lee 2000), and this intentional use is ongoing in other areas. The gathering of terrestrial plants across the Black-capped Petrel’s range is not thought to cause significant declines.</p>  <p>Mercury concentrations in tissues from specimens of the species were found to be considerably higher than in other species studied (Whaling <em>et al.</em> 1980, Simons <em>et al</em>. 2013) but impacts are unclear and likely restricted to lowered reproductive success rather than direct mortality.</p>  <p></p>","The population is estimated as no more than 1,000 breeding pairs, perhaps as few as 500, and a total population of 2,000–4,000 birds.<p></p> <p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pterodroma hasitata</em> is confirmed as breeding in Hispaniola (comprising the nations of <strong>Haiti</strong> and the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>). The population there is estimated as no more than 1,000 breeding pairs, perhaps as few as 500, and a total population of 2,000–4,000 birds. The highest density of nests and most of the population occurs on La Visite Ridge in the western extent of the Massif de la Selle, Haiti. Smaller populations occur eastward along the Massif de la Selle and across the border in the Sierra de Bahoruco of the Dominican Republic, as well as around Pic Macaya in Massif de la Hotte in western Haiti. Radar surveys and aural observations indicate that small populations occur in other areas to the north and east in the Dominican Republic but nests have yet to be located (E. Rupp <em>in litt.</em>) Taking into account each of these known and suspected breeding sites, all of which are quite small, an area of occurrence estimate of 20 km<sup>2</sup> is reasonable (E. Rupp <em>in litt.</em>).</p><p>Radar surveys conducted in Dominica in January 2015 strongly suggest that Black-capped Petrels persist there; hundreds of petrel-like targets were recorded over 17 separate coastal and inland flight corridors, and eight individual Black-capped Petrels were observed over 5 locations (Brown 2015). These data, when coupled with recent observations of downed Black-capped Petrels on the island, suggests that there are still individuals breeding on the island, although the last confirmed nesting date was 1862.</p><p>Black-capped Petrels previously nested on Guadeloupe and Martinique, but have not been documented there since before 1900. However, hope persists for rediscovery on Guadeloupe (A. Chabrolle <em>in litt.</em>) based on offshore observations and the presence of inaccessible island peaks. Likewise, hope persists for Cuba. Though there is no documentation of Black-capped Petrels nesting in Cuba in the past or currently, there have been observations of birds flying inland at dusk from a known foraging area.&#160;</p><p>Black-capped Petrels are highly pelagic and undertake long-distance foraging trips. A compendium of about 5,000 at-sea observations indicates that waters in or adjacent to the Florida Current and the Gulf Stream between northern Florida and southern Virginia provide a distinct and relatively confined foraging range of Black-capped Petrels, with concentrations observed there throughout the year. In the Caribbean Sea, Black-capped Petrels can occur within the inter-island regions, straits and offshore zones of both the Greater and Lesser Antilles, but still primarily east of 80°W. The first satellite tracking of this species (three individuals) suggest a similar, but more spatially expansive range, including regular occurrence in the Caribbean Sea between Hispaniola and South America and regular occurrence east of primary foraging area indicated by the at-sea observations (Jodice <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;</p><br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway&#160;</strong></p><p>An International Black-capped Petrel Conservation Group has formed and facilitates communication and coordination among researchers and conservationists concerned about the species.

It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered. If conservation efforts succeed in bringing the largest remaining populations, in north-eastern Cambodia and along the Mekong channel, under effective protection and predicted rates of decline are therefore lower, the species may warrant downlisting. <p></p> <p></p>","Wetlands and grassland, such as pools, marshes, open grasslands or watercourses including wide rivers with sand and gravel bars were formerly important for the species; however, at least in Indochina deciduous dipterocarp forest now appears to be of major importance (H. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. <em>Trapaengs</em> (seasonal pools) are particularly favoured during the dry (breeding) season when the species forages in the substrate around the edge of pools that are drying out (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2013a), with a shift to matrix sites such as long- and seasonally abandoned rice fields, grasslands (often inundated after high rainfall) and the dipterocarp forest itself after rainfall events (Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010) and in the wet season (H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. The species has been recorded along large rivers such as the Mekong in Cambodia and on the Mahakam in Kalimantan. It has also been recorded from the mosaic of shrub and grasslands on the Tonle Sap floodplain. In Cambodia, it has been recorded nesting during the dry season (December-May) in remnant dry forest close to seasonally abandoned wet season rice paddy fields, large contiguous areas of dry forest, and in flooded forest within the Mekong channel. Two nests in Kalimantan were located at heights of 30 m and 40 m in tall trees along tributaries of the Mahakam river - the main breeding here may be during September-December at least (Sutrisno <em>et al. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. It has been observed feeding in soft substrates on the forest floor as well as at small waterbodies (T. Clements <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>; also in sediment formations in river channels. Amphibians (e.g.&#160;<em>Microhyla</em> frogs and Paddy Frogs <em>Fejevarya limnocharis</em> from around <em>trapaengs</em> [Wright <em>et al</em>. 2013a]), form the majority of their prey in the dry season, along with invertebrates such as molecrickets, insect larvae and occasionally eels, snakes and leeches, all of which are found at <em>trapaengs</em> (H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Wet season prey obtained from terrestrial habitats remains uncertain but ibis have been observed catching large worms and beetle larvae (Sum, P. and H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).  <br/><br/>In South-East Asia the species may be associated with large ungulates which may help to create and maintain seasonal pools within the dry forest landscape (T. Evans <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, and its preference for <em>trapaengs</em> with bare substrate and low vegetation supports this theory (Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Large wild ungulates have now all but disappeared from the region, and the species may now be more closely associated with domestic livestock (Wright <em>et al. </em>2010)<strong></strong>. Traditional, anthropogenic fires are likely to influence habitat suitability at foraging sites in grassland and dipterocarp forest, increasing coverage of bare ground that the ibis prefers (Wright<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2010, H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> &#160;2012). Available evidence gives no suggestion that the species undertakes major seasonal movements. The species aggregates into large flocks in the non-breeding season (the wet- and early dry seasons) (max. count of 185 individuals just south of Western Siem Pang IBA in September 2010 [H. Wright unpublished data]).  <p></p>","This species has declined as a result of habitat loss, through logging, widespread piecemeal clearance of lowland forest, conversion of wetlands for agriculture (most of the Mekong floodplain in southern Lao PDR has been converted to rice-paddy) and agro-industrial and infrastructure development (BirdLife International 2010). The proposed Lower Srepok 3 Dam is expected to cause the flooding of a large area of Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary (BirdLife International 2010), and the Xavaburi Dam in Lao PDR is expected to disrupt habitat in the Mekong River channel (Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Logging, the encroachment of plantation agriculture and settlement&#160; through the granting of economic land concessions is a significant and widespread threat, affecting all of the four largest known populations at Western Siem Pang IBA (BirdLife International 2010), Kulen Promtep and Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuaries and the dry forest around the Mekong River channel (Wright 2012, H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). In September 2012, more than 40% of the individuals recorded were found in roosts that were inside economic land concessions and more than 15% were within 5 km of a concession boundary (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<br/><br/>Habitat loss has been compounded by hunting of adult birds, eggs and chicks for food, and disturbance, leading to the loss of secure feeding, roosting and nesting areas (Clements <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Hunting pressure is exacerbated by the fact that their primary habitats appear to also be a focus for people: large rivers, forest pools and grassland/field complexes with high densities of ungulates and domestic livestock. However, hunting may now be less of a threat in Cambodia following education initiatives and the confiscation of weapons (H. Wright <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. However, poisoned baits set for hunting continue to affect some populations (Wright 2012). In addition, hunting may not be a serious threat in East Kalimantan, but fishing through poisoning and electro-fishing may negatively impact the population there (Sutrisno and Imanuddin 2002). Recent evidence suggests that forest fires in Borneo resulting from an El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event shifted the distribution of this species to unburnt stretches of rivers (Sözer and Nijman 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>There is considerable evidence that the species is associated with large ungulates in South-East Asia, which create and maintain the short-sward grassland feeding areas that the ibises depend upon within the dry forest landscape (T. Evans <em>pers. comm.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Hence, the demise of wild ungulates within the region may have catalysed its rapid decline resulting in few remote refugia for the species (R. Timmins<em></em>; T. Clements, <em>in litt</em>. 2007). Moreover, its dependency on herbivore-altered habitats means that remnant areas are close to people and associated with domestic livestock, making it more vulnerable to human-induced habitat modification (R. Timmins<em></em>; T. Clements, <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>, and a large proportion of the population occurs outside of protected areas (Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Of 609 individuals counted in 2011-2012, more than 80% roosted outside protected areas (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Probably the most significant threats currently come from land concessions for logging or plantations, and infrastructure development such as dam construction, which threaten even those areas that currently have protected status<strong> </strong>(Wright <em>et al. </em>2013b). <p></p>","The Indonesian population was estimated at 30-100 individuals but has apparently declined (Sozer and Nijman 2005). Nationwide coordinated surveys for the species in Cambodia recorded a total of 973 individuals in 2013 (Anon. 2013).

It was previously widely but patchily distributed across much of Thailand, Lao PDR, south and central Vietnam and Cambodia, parts of Myanmar, Kalimantan (Indonesia), Sarawak (Malaysia) and south-west Yunnan, China, but has declined dramatically during the 20th century. It is extinct in Thailand and there are no recent records from Myanmar; and it has been described as the most threatened large waterbird in South-East Asia based on the widespread declines observed (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>It is almost certainly extinct as a breeding species in Viet Nam and now only occurs as a rare non-breeding visitor. In Cambodia, significant populations are known from Western Siem Pang (491 individuals counted in the 2015 census [BirdLife International, unpublished data)<em></em>, Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary in Ratanakiri (at least 242 individuals counted in September 2011 [Sum P. and H.

Wright<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012), and around 150 recorded during the national coordinated census to 2017 (BirdLife International unpublished data)<strong></strong>. In 2009, 13 nests were found in Western Siem Pang, seven successfully fledging a total of 14 chicks (V. Bou <em>in litt.</em> 2009), increasing to 30 nests in 2011 with greater search effort<strong></strong> (H. Wright <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Tmatboey, in the Northern Plains, Cambodia, supports a small breeding population (up to 5 nests per year) with a maximum of 39 individuals recorded in the wet season (H. Wright <em>in litt</em>. 2012). Additional groups (1-10 birds each) have been recorded elsewhere; along the Mekong between Stung Treng and the Lao PDR border, eastern Siem, Pang district, the south-eastern shore of the Tonle Sap lake, Rovieng (Preah Vihear Province), Srepok river, Seima Protection Forest (Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007) and the O Te lowlands, Mondulkiri Province. Further birds may yet be found in Kompong Cham province along the Mekong (R. Timmins<em></em>; T.

It is depicted on public awareness material distributed in Lao PDR and Cambodia. The species is considered to be the most threatened large waterbird in South-East Asia and was a priority species during the designation of Cambodian IBAs and priority areas for conservation in the 'dry forest ecoregion' of South-East Asia (Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. Research has been conducted into the species's nesting ecology in Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary and PhD research (2008-2012) studied the value of traditional land management and the species's foraging and nesting ecology, focused primarily on Western Siem Pang, Cambodia. Nest protection schemes with incentives to local people for finding and protecting nest-sites along the Mekong central section, in Western Siem Pang and Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary have been established.

This has been achieved through a concerted programme of lobbying and community awareness raising including producing and distributing a poster about the international conservation importance of Western Siem Pang, placing large information boards in five key villages informing local people about development plans and threats to their land from proposed concessions and working closely with the Forestry Association and Ministry of Environment in Cambodia.&#160;<br/><br/>Research and monitoring<strong> </strong>continues to be carried out, focusing on the foraging ecology of the species, nesting and flock size at roost sites and examining the value of trapeangs to the assemblies of waterbirds at the site. Pilot conservation work to deepen two key <em>trapaengs</em> in 2015 provided habitat for longer through the dry season and 15 further <em>trapaengs</em> have been deepened in 2017-18 (BirdLife International unpublished report).&#160;<br/><br/>A Local Conservation Group<strong> </strong>at Western Siem Pang has been supported since August 2007, and conducts monthly patrols to the most important trapaengs to record key species and any illegal activities. A Site Support Group is being established in Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary in order to support management, protection and monitoring at the sanctuary. In 2009, one chainsaw, 6.834 m<sup>3</sup> of luxury wood, four guns, and one ox-cart were confiscated and destroyed in Western Siem Pang as result of information provided by the patrol team (BirdLife International unpublished data)<strong></strong>. Coordinated roost counts have taken place in the wet season since 2009 (Wright 2012, BirdLife International Preventing Extinctions Programme).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue monitoring the known populations in Siem Pang, Northern Plains, Mekong channel, Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary and in other parts of its range using coordinated roost counts (Wright 2012). Establish a species working group to assist coordination and cooperation between conservation stakeholders, as well as researching the ecological requirements of the species in the wet season, the impacts of the human harvesting of amphibians and the value of domestic livestock grazing in areas of low-intermediate livestock density (Wright 2012)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Conduct further surveys in Borneo, central, northern and eastern Cambodia and the Satay area of Viet Nam to quantify remaining populations, only in areas where conservation intervention is considered reasonable and there are grounds for considering a significant population might be found. Focusing on areas close to settlement with traditional rice cultivation may be more productive than for core areas of remote forest. Establish further protected areas or integrated conservation development projects covering landscape-level habitat tracts supporting populations, particularly in northern Cambodia, the Mekong channel and along the Mahakam river, East Kalimantan. Enforce strict protection at important sites. Promote widespread conservation awareness programmes aimed at reducing wetland disturbance and large waterbird exploitation in Indochina. Engage with the agro-industry sector regarding the management and use of concession lands (Wright <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<p></p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is likely to continue to decline extremely rapidly owing to on-going deforestation and human disturbance. It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered. <p></p> <p></p>","Singles, pairs or small parties occur in marshes, pools, wide rivers and seasonal water-meadows in open, predominantly deciduous, dipterocarp lowland forest, although it seems to be dependent on soft mud around seasonal pools (<em>trapaengs</em>). Its diet comprises a variety of invertebrates, crustaceans, eels, small amphibians and reptiles. It frequently feeds in soft mud, but forages on all substrates at <em>trapaengs</em>. It nests in trees, with a preference for large <em>Dipterocarpus</em> (Keo 2008) (90% of nesting trees are common deciduous dipterocarp species [Loveridge and Ty 2015]), generally more than 4 km from human habitation (<strong></strong>Keo 2008). Females almost always lay two eggs per clutch in the wet season <strong></strong>(Keo <em>et al.</em> 2009). Pools and seasonally flooded grassland with earthworm mounds are important in the breeding season, from June to September <strong></strong>(Keo 2008). It appears to be largely resident, but apparently wanders widely in response to local disturbance and seasonal water-levels. Generally territorial, the species remains in pairs or small family groups year-round. However, in the dry (non-breeding) season it may be found in small flocks of up to seven individuals or more (H. J. Rainey <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).<p></p>","This species has declined as a result of hunting and egg collecting, wetland drainage for agriculture and deforestation. Habitat conversion by large-scale economic land concessions was recently identified as the greatest threat to the species (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Clearance of very large areas of lowland dry forest, including parts of the Northern Plains (Preah Vihear Protected Forest, Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary) and other areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Siem Pang IBA, Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary, O Ya Dao Protected Forest [Loveridge and Ty 2015]) where the species occurs has already taken place for conversion to agro-industrial uses including rubber, cassava, wood pulp and teak plantations. Small-scale agricultural expansion for subsistence agriculture is also considered a threat (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Generally the human population is increasing within the range of this species mostly through immigration from other provinces in Cambodia, resulting in more infrastructure and development projects that contribute to forest loss. Subsequent expansion of agricultural land and increasing hunting  pressure and disturbance at feeding sites is causing the loss of  breeding habitat for the species (An Dara 2008, Clements <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>in prep.). Construction of new roads through Siem Pang and Seima Protected Forest threaten the species's habitat and potentially expose it to increased disturbance (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Construction of hydroelectric dams in the upper Mekong tributaries (Lower Se San 2 Dam and Lower Sre Pok 2 Dam) could lead to the loss of suitable habitat along the Srepok and Sesan rivers (Loveridge and Ty 2015). <br/><br/>It relies on seasonal pools (<em>trapaengs</em>), which in the past were perhaps maintained by the now much depleted megafauna.&#160;The species appears to be very sensitive to human disturbance<strong></strong>  (An Dara 2008, Wright <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ty 2013), particularly during the dry season when both birds and  humans are concentrated around available waterholes rendering much  apparently suitable habitat unusable. The frequency of burning in deciduous dipterocarp forest has recently increased, potentially having a negative impact on food resources for the species (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Suitable nesting trees may be removed by commercial timber extraction operations or for subsistence housing construction, resulting in the species having to use suboptimal nesting trees (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Nest predation by Common Palm Civet <em>Paradoxurus hermaphroditus </em>and/or Yellow-throated Marten <em>Martes flavigula</em> on two occasions in 2004 suggest that loss of nestlings to mammalian carnivores might be a significant constraint on breeding success <strong></strong>(Keo 2008), a theory supported by a study which found that the number of young fledged per nest was 50% higher for protected nests <strong></strong>(Keo <em>et al.</em> 2009). A prolonged drought in the 2009-2010 dry season appeared to dramatically lower the breeding success of Giant Ibis, by approximately 50%; climate change may therefore pose an additional long-term threat to the persistence of this species (H. Rainey <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012).<p></p>",An assessment of the global population was made in 2014 based on newly collected data and expert opinion (including estimates of 48 and 35 mature individuals at the highest density sites) (Loveridge and Ty 2015). The population was estimated at a minimum of 194 mature individuals which is equivalent to approximately 290 individuals.,Decreasing,"The species is mostly confined to northern and eastern&#160;<strong>Cambodia</strong>, where it is probably still fairly widespread but extremely rare; with a few birds from the same population observed in extreme southern <strong>Lao PDR</strong>&#160;(BirdLife International 2001). It has also been recorded from Yok Don National Park, <strong>Viet Nam </strong>(Anon 2003), with the most recent sighting of a single bird in 2011 (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Its historical range spanned southern Viet Nam and south-eastern and peninsular Thailand, where it is now extinct. <br/><br/>Available data suggest that it has a patchy distribution across Cambodia <strong></strong>(T. Clements <em>et al.</em> <em>in litt. </em>2007). Some areas of high density exist in the Northern Plains, including Preah Vihear Protected Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary (with 30-40 nests monitored annually [T. Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012] and 24 pairs monitored in 2014 [WCS 2014 in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) and&#160;Prey Siem Pang Khang Lech Wildlife Sanctuary (formerly Western Siem Pang IBA) (where a slight decline has been detected from around 40 pairs [H. Wright<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2012] to 49±10 individuals in 2014 [Ty <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016]). Other areas appear to have relatively low density populations, which may be clustered in some cases: Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary&#160;(approximately 10-15 pairs [Sum and Bou 2012]), Seima Protection Forest (estimated at five pairs [T. Evans, H. Rainey, R. Vann and H. Wright&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012 in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) (WCS/FA 2006,&#160;Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007), Mondulkiri Protected Forest (anecdotal reports suggest a population of approximately 50 individuals [Gray personal communication in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) (T. Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> per T. Evans) and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (estimated at five pairs&#160;[T. Evans, H. Rainey, R. Vann and H. Wright&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012 in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) (Claassen and Ou 2007,&#160;T. Clements <em>et al.</em> <em>in litt. </em>2007, T. Clements <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>in prep.). <br/><br/>Additional recent records have come from Veunsai proposed Protected Forest in Ratanakiri Province (estimated at five pairs [T. Evans, H. Rainey, R. Vann and H. Wright <em>in litt</em>. 2012 in Loveridge and Ty 2015]) and the first observation south of Tonle Sap Lake since the 1920s was made by camera trap in 2011 (L. Perlman per T. Evans<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span>, Hance 2012). Further surveys may confirm other localities in suitable areas such as O Ya Dao Protected Forest (although the majority of suitable habitat in this area has now been converted to economic land concessions [Loveridge and Ty 2015]) and the unprotected areas west of Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary (T. Evans <em>in litt.</em> 2012). Owing to large scale habitat loss the species's range is likely to have decreased between 2008 and 2015 (Loveridge and Ty 2015).<br/>  <p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong>The species was listed as Critically Endangered in Cambodia by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in 2007 and hunting of the species was prohibited in Cambodia in 1994&#160;(Loveridge and Ty 2015). A 10-year Giant Ibis National Action Plan was published in 2015 (Loveridge and Ty 2015). The plan aims are that by 2025 the Giant Ibis population will be stable or increasing and the species will inhabit a network of well-protected sites. These objectives will be achieved via three channels: 1) protecting key habitat where the species is present; 2) implementing management interventions to increase survival and breeding success; 3) conducting research to inform conservation actions. The delivery of these activities will be monitored by the Ibis Working Group which is currently being established (Loveridge and Ty 2015).<br/><br/>Actions are ongoing to protect the species's breeding and foraging habitats. The Forestry Administration and Ministry of Environment in Cambodia are working to strengthen protected area management at key sites for the species, with support from organisations including Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity, BirdLife International, Conservation International, Wildlife Conservation Society and the World Wildlife Fund (Loveridge and Ty 2015). The entirety of the Western Siem Pang IBA has been designated as Wildlife Sanctuary, with the&#160;Prey Siem Pang Lech Wildlife Sanctuary forming the southwestern area of 65,389 ha., and the northern half (66,932 ha) upgraded from Protected Forest to Wildlife Sanctuary in the same decree on 9th May 2016 (BirdLife International Preventing Extinctions Programme, unpublished report).&#160;It occurs at least seasonally in Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA) and Dong Khanthung proposed NBCA, Laos, and Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Preah Vihear Protected Forest, Kulen Prumptep Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri Protected Forest in Cambodia. Ecotourism projects in the Northern Plains landscape (Tmatboey, O Koki and Prey Veng) and certified wildlife-friendly ""Ibis Rice"", sold for a premium, also benefits the species through restricting small-scale habitat conversion. Restoration of foraging habitats around waterholes is being trialled.<br/><br/>Management to improve breeding success currently involves targeted actions to protect nests and engaging with local communities. Ongoing community nest protection activities are taking place in the Northern Plains (Clements <em>et al. </em>2013), where&#160;local community members are paid to protect Giant Ibis and other waterbird nests. This not only removes a primary threat to the population, but instils local ownership and pride in the charismatic large waterbirds in this landscape. However there is some concern that additional people visiting the nest guardian may lead to additional disturbance. Giant Ibis is depicted on public awareness materials in Lao PDR and Cambodia as part of an on-going campaign to reduce hunting of large waterbirds. A predator-exclusion experiment in 2005-2006 found that nests with predator-exclusion devices (a smooth, hard plastic belt fixed around the base of the nest tree) were more likely to survive than those without (<strong></strong>Keo 2008). Such devices may alert hunters to the presence of nest sites and must be combined with community engagement work to deter hunting (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Work to improve habitat by deepening <em>trapaengs </em>has taken place at 19 of the water holes so far to early 2018 through the implementation of Species Guardian action and funding via the Darwin Initiative and Fondation Segre.&#160;<br/><br/>Monitoring is undertaken to assess the effectiveness of actions designed to benefit the species. Reproductive success is assessed through direct monitoring of breeding pairs whilst important populations are surveyed during the dry season (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Changes in forest cover are monitored using remote-sensing techniques (Loveridge and Ty 2015). Following the discovery of an individual in the Kampong Som Valley in Koh Kong Province, Cambodia, Wildlife Alliance plan to survey the area for breeding Giant Ibises (Hance 2012).<br/><br/>'Giant Ibis Transport' took on the role of Species Champion in 2013, agreeing  to provide $51,000 of funding over a three year period (Sartori 2013). It was nominated as the national bird of Cambodia in 2005 (Loveridge and Ty 2015).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Key actions as identified by the Giant Ibis National Action Plan are: to establish protected areas around key habitat for the species; at the site level, implement conservation actions designed to benefit the species and list the species as a conservation priority at these sites; improve law enforcement; encourage sustainable management of forest resources; provide support to local communities to reduce overexploitation of key habitat for the species (Loveridge and Ty 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Improved commitment to conserve protected areas in Cambodia is required by all stakeholders to stabilise the Giant Ibis population. Advocacy with the Cambodian government to raise the profile of the ecological needs of Cambodia’s national bird will help improve protection of the large undisturbed areas of deciduous dipterocarp forest that this species requires. Establish further protected areas encompassing large tracts of habitat found to support populations of the species, including strict protection of suitable permanent wetlands, especially in the dry season. At key sites, designate some suitable pools as for use only by wildlife. Ensure some pools remain wet during the dry season (e.g. by preventing people from draining them for fishing, and also potentially managing pools to increase their depth)&#160;<strong></strong>(Keo 2008). Restore foraging habitat. Protect and install anti-predator belts on all nest-trees and work with community groups to deter hunting behaviour (belts around trees may attract hunters to the species's nesting trees) (Loveridge and Ty 2015).&#160;Consolidate and promote further public awareness initiatives to reduce hunting of large waterbirds and wetland disturbance.<br/><br/>Conduct further surveys to locate and quantify remaining populations in Laos and Cambodia (particularly undersurveyed areas such as Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary [planned for 2018], Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Mekong Bird Nest Protection site near Kratie [Loveridge and Ty 2015]). Investigate its breeding requirements (including breeding season foraging ecology), demography and seasonal movements.&#160;Assess longer-term risk from climate change (T. Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Monitor the abundance of frogs, eels and mole-crickets in the dry season (<strong></strong>Keo 2008), and the impact that local harvesting of frogs may have on prey abundance (H.

The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","For breeding, this species appears to require copious low dense vegetation with patches of open ground. It breeds in ecotone habitats between forests and plain or open areas at the tree-line, including wooded tundra, mountain steppe, subalpine scrub, marshland with low woody cover, clumps of willow (<em>Salix</em>), alder (<em>Alnus</em>) and birch (<em>Betula</em>) on floodplains, riverbank thickets, reedy and shrub-dominated lakeshores, bushy sites near water. The breeding season lasts from late April to July in central Europe, from late May in Scandinavia, early April to June in Armenia, June to July in Ladakh, May to July in China and May/June to August in North America. The nest is a deep cup of leaves, small twigs, dry grass, rootlets, plant down and moss, which is occasionally lined with animal hair. It is placed among grass and scrub on wet ground and is commonly associated with topographic features such as a hummock, gulley, lip of a bank, or tussock. Clutches consist of four to seven eggs. The diet is principally invertebrates, particularly insects, but it does take some seeds and fruit in the autumn (Collar 2015). The species is mainly migratory, with west Palearctic populations wintering in patches across the Mediterranean Basin and the northern Afrotropics and eastern populations in the Indian subcontinent (Snow and Perrins 1998).","In Europe, Bluethroat experiences pronounced, but largely unexplained, population fluctuations (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Collar 2015). Some negative trends appear to be explained by natural succession in marshland, drainage and management practices such as reed-cutting, seedling removal and cattle grazing (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), but recovery has taken place without the reversal of these circumstances. In Spain, during the 1990s Bluethroat may have suffered from degradation of habitat through grazing. In Austria, significant losses occurred during the 19<sup>th</sup> century due to drainage. Now, the species faces threats there due to the stabilization of lake levels and the subsequent loss of the reed-belt, as well as due to the occupation of secondary habitats on arable land and subsequent elevated nest predation (Collar 2015).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number&#160;4,460,000-7,760,000 pairs, which equates to 8,930,000-15,500,000 mature individuals&#160;(BirdLife International 2015).

From its reproductive dynamics, this is a species that is slow to recover from population impacts, even by tortoise standards. An 80% decline over the past three generations is a minimum estimate for total population reduction; remaining subpopulations may continue declining in some areas as human population grows, converts more forest, and harvests more animals. This species qualifies for listing as Critically Endangered under criterion A2cd.</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Elongated Tortoises inhabit primarily deciduous forest types (Sal, Dry Dipterocarp, Mixed Deciduous forests) with open, broken canopy allowing sufficient light for a moderate to very dense undergrowth of grasses and herbs; during the dry, leafless season animals may retreat to evergreen stream gallery forest. Records are mostly from hilly areas from low altitude to about 600 m altitude. In the Himalayas it has not been recorded over 500 m (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2018). In Cambodia they are considered predominantly a lowland species in gentle sloping terrain. Local and seasonal movements are modest and seemingly random, tortoises apparently being confined to particular areas by features of habitat and topography (Moll 1989, Das 1991, van Dijk 1998).&#160;<em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is primarily crepuscular, with activity in the early morning and late afternoon, avoiding extremely high air temperatures of up to 48°C in the forest in the middle of the day. During periods of inactivity, tortoises retreat into dense vegetation, alongside fallen debris, in buttresses of trees, in caves or burrows. The species appears to have large home ranges (Ihlow <em>et al.</em> 2014), signifying a need for large areas of suitable habitat to be protected. Historically the species has benefited from disturbance of evergreen forest in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam, as it prefers primarily deciduous forest types (R. Timmins pers comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Elongated Tortoises consume a wide diversity of foods, feeding mainly on soft leaves and fruits, while mushrooms, carrion and carnivore scats are eaten when available. (van Dijk 1998).<br/><br/>Elongated Tortoises of both sexes reach maturity at about 20 cm carapace length and a weight just over 1 kg, at an estimated age of 10-14 years (van Dijk 1998). Maximum size is usually 30 cm, but exceptional animals reach 35 cm carapace length. Hatchling size is approximately 4-5 cm (S. Schoppe pers. comm. 2018). Females produce one or possibly two clutches of 1-5 eggs towards the end of the rainy season (van Dijk 1998). Generation length is estimated to be a minimum of 30 years, but is likely to be substantially longer.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>The foremost threat to <em>Indotestudo elongata</em> has been the intensive collection almost throughout its entire range for trade to East Asia, starting in 1989 the intensity of which has started to decline only since 2016. The volumes of trade may have appeared to reduced, but investigations into captive farms and legal trade reveal that trade levels&#160;for these sources may be higher than reported.<br/><br/>This intensive commercial exploitation came on top of the impacts from long-term (decades to centuries) low-intensity collection for subsistence consumption throughout its range (review in Das 1991, Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). In India, <em>I. elongata</em> is associated with Sal forest (<em>Shorea</em> spp); Sal flowers are collected for pharmaceutical purposes, leading to extensive opportunistic collection of tortoises. However, deliberate hunting also occurs, often with the aid of dogs (Pawar and Choudhury 20000; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2012). The species is collected both for local use and international wildlife trade. In the 1990s <em>I. elongata</em> was considered to be the most common chelonian species in the Vietnamese wildlife trade (Hendrie 1998), and large numbers have been reported in trade in Cambodia (Ihlow and Dawson 2016). Worldwide, a total of at least 918 live specimens, in 20 shipments, were reported as seized from illegal trade during the period 2000-2015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73). The Elongated Tortoise is also available in the international pet trade. However, the impact of trade as pets in minimal compared to the volume of trade for food (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Animals in Nepal, northeast India and Uttar Pradesh, are extensively traded for release at religious institutions; presumably as a result of targeted collection for this purpose.<br/><br/>Habitat impacts have been extensive as deciduous forests have been logged and cleared for settlement with seasonal, dry-land (slash and burn) agriculture; available habitat for the species has shrunk by more than half in the past 50 years in Thailand, and this percentage is probably comparable in other range countries, and even higher rates of habitat loss in Cambodia. Remaining habitat including in managed protected areas is widely impacted by human-associated wildfires, which create very high mortality among juvenile tortoises, to the extent that a population may be reproducing but is barely recruiting (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). This species appears to be absent from areas of dense human population and intensive cultivation (Ihlow<em> et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Other threats to&#160;<em>I. elongata</em> are minor and localised in comparison, with reports of decorative masks produced from the carapace available for sale in Nepal, although the species is not particularly favoured for this purpose (Mitchell and Rhodin 1996).&#160;</p>","<p>Despite having a wide distribution, and considerable suitable habitat remaining, severe population declines has occurred recently due to human activities (Ihlow <em>et al.</em> 2016). Scattered available information indicates that the species is depleted and now uncommon to rare throughout its range; survey findings consistently conclude that the species is rare and declining in India and Bangladesh (Moll 1989, Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). A 50-70% decline in population is believed to have occurred in the India/Bangladesh part of the range in the past 20 years (S. Singh pers. comm. 2018). There have been a few reports of <em>Indotestdo elongata</em> individuals in Bhutan's Royal Manus National Park but abundance is low there (Wangyal&#160;<em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>The best subpopulations in Thailand were estimated to have a density of one or a few animals per km<sup>2</sup> (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). The sex ratio in this population was also heavily female biased at 1:2.45 (van Dijk 1998). The species is somewhat abundant within protected areas in Thailand, but is collected for consumption outside of protected areas. Habitat destruction has led to a severe reduction in population in northeastast Thailand (M. Cota pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>In the latter part of the 20th century <em>I. elongata</em> in Lao PDR and Viet Nam were already scarce and localised (R. Timmins pers comm. 2018). Throughout most of Cambodia and parts of southern Viet Nam, the species was relatively widespread and common. Subpopulations in Lao PDR and Viet Nam and Cambodia have since been severely depleted and possibly locally extirpated.<em> Indotestudo elongata</em> is not uncommon in Myanmar, and subpopulations appear to be relatively stable (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). In Bangladesh, <em>I. elongata</em> is relatively common in good habitat, but not in areas of habitat degradation (S.C. Rahman pers. comm. 2018). The species' survival is not compatible with human land use (other than responsible tourism in national parks) and will eventually become exclusively restricted to protected areas throughout its range. Overall, a population reduction of 80% is suspected to have occurred over the species range in the past three generations (90 years) as a result of habitat loss and harvest for food.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia. The western most limit of the species range is in in Kaleshar Wildlife Sanctuary in the foothills of Himalayas in the Arravali Range. It has localised occurrences in northern and eastern India, Nepal and Bangladesh, Bhutan and much of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia, and scattered occurrences in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and extreme northwestern Peninsular Malaysia (Iverson 1992). Records from PR China (Guangxi) are derived from market animals. In Nepal,&#160;<em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is restricted to the terai vegetation zone; much of the terai has been converted to agriculture, and the species is now restricted to terai habitat in Chitwan National Park. A disjunct subpopulation occurs on the Chota Nagpur Plateau in eastern India, which appears to have been isolated from the Himalayan foothills by the alluvial plain and changing environmental conditions after the formation of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (Ilhow<em> et al.</em> 2016). Connectivity across the Brahmaputra is uncertain, as there is potentially a connection from the Himalayan foothills through the Sal forest belt to Orissa.</p>","<em>Indotestudo elongata</em> has long been used by humans as a source of food. Currently, <em>I. elongata</em> is heavily exploited for food and traditional medicine throughout its range (Ihlow&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Both opportunistic collection and deliberate hunting with dogs continue for local use and export to the international wildlife trade (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016). During the 1990s <em>I. elongata </em>were common in the Vietnamese wildlife trade and in Cambodia. It has often been reported as one of the most abundant species available in China (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).This species is also available in the international pet trade, however, the impact is small compared to the volume of trade for food and medicine. Currently the demand for pets in the United States and Europe is mostly met by captive breeding, however, some wild-caught animals still occur (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Indotestudo elongata</em> is included in CITES Appendix II, allowing international commercial trade in the species provided such trade is not detrimental to the species, and subject to national trade legislation. It is also included in Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (amended), which lists species that require a small game hunting license to allow collection and local trade; the species may warrant transfer to Schedule I, which would afford stricter protection. In Thailand, the species is protected from exploitation under the WARPA law. Protected under government Decree 32 Group 2B (2006) in Viet Nam. Wildlife conservation act 2010 in Peninsular Malaysia.

This species is also suspected to exist in the protected foothill forest in the Transboundary Manas Conservation Area (Ahmed and Das 2010). Although it occurs in many protected areas, there is not always effective protection on the ground.<br/><br/>This species is the focus of conservation projects at the Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity (ACCB) at Kbal Spean, Cambodia and the Turtle Conservation Centre (TCC) in Cuc Phuong National Park, Vietnam.

Based on habitat loss rates alone, half the area of suitable lowland and mid-elevation evergreen forest has been degraded and lost in the past half century throughout its range. In addition, the species has suffered long-term subsistence collection and intensive commercial exploitation for East Asian consumption trade in recent years. Overall, the species has declined by at least 80% in the past three generations (135 years). This decline is expected to continue as turtle exploitation through most of its range remains beyond effective control, subsistence collection and poaching occurs widely even in some protected areas, and forest loss continues across much of its remaining range. This species qualifies for listing as Critically Endangered under criteria A2cd+4cd.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<p><em>Manouria emys</em> exclusively inhabits evergreen forest, from lowland regions up to altitudes of about 1,000 m (typically 600-1,500 m). The animals appreciate moisture and are typically found near water and frequently burrow in damp soil (Nutphand 1979). Lambert and Howes (1994) radio-tagged a female at Danum Valley in Sabah. This animal ranged in an area of 0.6 km<sup>2</sup> during 53 days of almost daily observation, her locations generally clustering for several days followed by a long walk of up to about 300 m, followed by another period spent in a limited area. Wanchai (2008) found the species to utilise a range of habitats, including bamboo forest, dry evergreen forest mixed with bamboo, dry evergreen forest, stream courses and swampy stream edges. Juveniles are rarely observed more than 20 m from streams; adults are also generally close to streams except during the raining season when they are seen to forage at greater elevations (Wanchai 2008). During the dry season, most individuals become inactive for a period of up to two months, buried in litter or under tree falls.<br/><br/>The diet has been reported to include bamboo shoots, tubers and other juicy vegetation (Nutaphand 1979) and some invertebrates and frogs (Humphrey and Bain 1990). Lambert and Howes (1994) observed their radio-tagged female feeding on 19 occasions, eating predominantly green leaves of understory plants and mushrooms, as well as some seedlings, sometimes including the roots, and fallen figs (<em>Ficus punctata</em>) on one occasion.<br/><br/>Animals of the nominate subspecies can reach up to 50 cm carapace length and 20 kg, while subspecies <em>M. e. phayrei </em>reaches 60 cm carapace length and 37 kg (Nutphand 1979). Size and age at maturity have apparently not been reported.<br/><br/>The social behaviour of this species is quite complex, with elaborate dominance and courtship rituals (described in captivity and illustrated in detail by McKeown <em>et al.</em> 1990). Lambert and Howes (1994) noted (attempted) matings of their radio-tagged female at Danum Valley during 6-9 March and on 16 April by a different male; another mating was observed on 14 May. In captivity, a nest is constructed by the female by sweeping leaf litter backwards to form a nest mound. In this mound, a clutch of on average 35 (range 15-51, N=24) spherical or slightly elongate eggs (41-54 mm diameter, weight 46-80 g) is laid, with larger females typically produces more eggs. The nest is defended against potential predators by the female during the first few days.<br/><br/>In captivity,<em> M. e. phayrei</em> reaches sexuality maturity at about 15 years (Fahz 2010). Longevity of this subspecies has been recorded up to 20 years, but it is likely to be much longer (Slavens and Slavens 2000). Generation length is estimated at about 45 years (three times age of maturity).</p>","<p><em>Manouria emys</em> is generally killed and butchered on the spot for its meat whenever encountered by local hunter-gatherers through much of its range, as well as collected for export trade for consumption in East Asia. Some wild-caught animals occur in global pet trade. The Turtle Survival Alliance confiscated 65<em> M. e. phayrei</em> in Myanmar recently (Stanford <em>et al</em>. 2015). A total of at least 507 live specimens, in seven shipments, were reported as seized from illegal trade during the period 2000-2015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73).<br/><br/>This species is also threatened by shrinking habitat availability as lowland and mid-elevation evergreen forests are degraded and lost through logging, clearing for agriculture, forest fires, and hydroelectric dams and reservoirs and associated infrastructure, although its preference for rugged wet montane forests may offer some protection (Moll 1989, Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Northeastern India, most of the habitat exists in Reserved Forests outside protected areas, where slash and burn agriculture is in decline, being replaced by horticulture. Organised large bamboo-cutting efforts in forests impact the tortoises both by removing a prime food resource as well as the increased disturbance and detection probability. Ethnic violence is a regional issue, and resettlement sites tend to be located in forest areas. In Mizoram, at least ten individuals collected from a proposed dam site were held captive in Aizawal Zoo for <em>ex situ</em> conservation (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2018).</p>","<p>Nearly all accounts of <em>Manouria emys</em> note it to be uncommon, rare or very rare, and declining: interviews indicated that forest labourers and hunter-gatherers in northeastern India and eastern Bangladesh would find between one and six animals per year, even when using dogs to find the tortoises; some of this information pertained to the 1980s (Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). In 2018, the Singapore Workshop Participants considered <em>M. emys</em> overall Endangered in India, with a declining population trend. Recent records from India are only from Manipur, Mizoram, and Assam. Only three records of wild individuals have been reported in Assam since 2010, which have all been relocated to the zoo; and ten records from Manipur (S. Singh pers. comm 2018). It is considered Critically Endangered in&#160; Bangladesh and Myanmar (Participants, Singapore&#160;Red List Workshop 2011) and is apparently extirpated in the western side of Myanmar (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). It was considered ‘rare’ in Indonesia by Samedi and Iskandar (2000) and very rare in Sumatra. It has been recorded in trade in Malaysia since 1989 and it was considered to occur most commonly in sparsely-populated hill and mountain areas.<br/><br/>Low collection rates of a few animals per year were reported by hill tribe hunter-gatherers in western Thailand in the early 1990s (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995). Taylor (1970) noted that ‘These large turtles are now becoming rare in Thailand'. In 2005, the species was assessed as Endangered in the ONEP Red Data. More recently, Wanchai's (2008) study in the well protected Kaeng Krachan National Park in Thailand found 15 individuals in a 1.5 km<sup>2</sup>, suggesting that relatively high densities may occur in appropriate habitat without human pressures. In central Borneo, the species is not rare in good forest habitats (I. Das pers. comm. 2018). In northeast India, the local communities are reporting fewer captured individuals for this species, although no data on population size or trends are available (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2018). A few juvenile and adult individuals have been collected in the border of Bangladesh and Myanmar.<br/><br/>No population data appear to be available for the other portions of the species' range.<br/><br/>Participants of the Singapore Red List Workshop (2018) suspected over 80% reduction in population has occurred over the past three generations (135 years) and will continue for at least another generation due to exploitation pressures and reduction in area of occupancy as a result of habitat degradation.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Manouria emys </em>occurs from Bangladesh and northeastern India through mid-elevation hilly areas of Myanmar, and western and southern Thailand through Malaysia and Indonesia (including Sumatra and Borneo) (Iverson 1992, Platt <em>et al.</em> 2018). Its presence in Brunei is uncertain. Records from Lao PDR, Viet Nam and southern China likely refer to <em>M. impressa</em> and/or traded animals.<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>M. e. emys</em> inhabits Thailand south of the Phang-nga-Surat Gap, Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. The subspecies&#160;<em>M. e. phayrei</em> occurs from Peninsular Thailand northwards through Myanmar to the northeastern Indian and eastern Bangladeshi hill tracts.</p>","<em>Manouria emys</em>&#160;is generally killed and butchered on the spot for its meat whenever encountered by local hunter-gatherers through much of its range, as well as collected for export trade for consumption in East Asia.

It is also included in Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (amended); it warrants revision to Schedule I. The species is protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act (2010) in Malaysia and trade is regulated. <em>Manouria emys</em> is protected under domestic legislation in Myanmar and under the Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act (1992) in Thailand. It is expected to be included under Government Decree No. 7 in Indonesia soon; in 2017 Indonesian quotas were set at 50 animals, under 20 cm, for the pet trade.<br/><br/>In India, the Nengpui Wildlife Sanctuary, North Cachar Hills and Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary are known to support wild populations in less disturbed habitats (Ahmed and Das 2010). In Bangladesh it occurs in the Sangu Wildlife Sanctuary (Rahman <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Myanmar, <em>M. emys</em> occurs in at least one protected area: Rakhine Yoma Elephant Sanctuary. In Thailand, the species occurs in several protected areas, including: Kaeng Krachan National Park, Mae Wong National Park, Khlong Lan National Park, Khao Pra Bang Kram Wildlife Sanctuary, Umphang Wildlife Sanctuary, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, protected areas in the Nakhon Sri Thammarat mountains, and Bang Lang National Park in southern Yala Province (van Dijk and Thirakhupt 1995, Wanchai 2008; P.P. van Dijk pers. comm.). In Peninsular Malaysia, it occurs in one protected area: Taman Negara National Park (Lim and Das 1999, Norsham <em>et al</em>. 2000). In Indonesia, the species occurs in three protected areas: Gunung Leuser National Park, Danau Sentarum National Park, and Kerinci Seblat National Park. In Sabah, Malaysia, the species occurs in at least two protected areas: Tabin Wildlife Reserve (Høybye-Mortensen 2004) and Danum Valley Conservation Area (Lambert and Howes 1994).<br/><br/>Assurance colonies of <em>M. emys</em> exist both in-range and <em>ex situ,&#160;</em>but maintaining large enough groups in captivity to maintain genetic diversity is beyond what is logistically feasible. Three such facilities currently exist in Myanmar alone, with others established or proposed throughout southern Asia. A large assurance colony of 24&#160;<em>M. e. phayrei</em>&#160;has been established at the Zeepin Forest Reserve in Shan State, Myanmar. An assurance colony composed of village-confiscated&#160;<em>M. e. phayrei</em>&#160;has been established at the Rakhine Yoma Elephant Sanctuary in Myanmar. A much large assurance colony has been established at the Mandalay Zoo in Myanmar, which will be stocked with confiscated animals (Turtle Survival Alliance, unpubl. data 2012). Captive breeding by animals currently maintained in captivity can easily meet hobbyist market for this species, and a complete trade ban on wild-collected animals should be considered.<br/><br/>Captive populations are kept in a variety of zoos and other facilities (India, Sarawak), and can form the nucleus of captive breeding programs for eventual re-introduction. Training on husbandry and captive management is needed, as well as development of a strategy to replenish wild populations with captive-produced specimens.<br/><br/>The survival of the species outside protected areas seems unlikely, and effective protection of existing and perhaps additional protected areas will be key to its survival in the wild. Additionally, raising public awareness and utilising eco-tourism techniques may help to reduce poaching in protected areas. Additional survey efforts are needed across the species range. As the species occurs mostly outside protected areas or within exploited protected areas, community-based conservation could improve the conservation scenario faster in the northeast India (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2010). Updated status, especially in protected areas, is urgently needed, and more ecological information is desirable, as is detailed range-wide genetic and taxonomic characterisation of populations, particularly regarding subspecies in northeast Indian states. Captive breeding programs are required in Indonesia to sustain the population.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> African and Australasian populations of this species are non-migratory or only make local movements in response to seasonal habitat changes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Those populations in Europe and Asia, however, appear to be fully migratory, most flying southward from late-August to October and returning to the northern breeding areas from March to May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species breeds in solitary pairs in the spring, usually nesting during or just after the wet season (where this occurs) (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Langrand 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It is usually a solitary species, but can be found in pairs or family groups, and sometimes forages in small groups of up to 10 individuals in non-breeding areas (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species forages diurnally but is most active in the early morning and late afternoon or evening (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat </strong>The species frequents similar habitats throughout its range and throughout the year, although its breeding areas are characterised by low, dense, tussocky or continuous vegetation such as flooded sedges and grasses (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Langrand 1990, Marchant and Higgins 1993, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It inhabits freshwater, brackish or saline marshy wetlands, both inland and coastal (Australasia), permanent and temporary, with dense emergent and floating vegetation (especially reeds, rushes, sedges, tall dense grasses and <em>Typha</em> spp.) (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Marchant and Higgins 1993, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Typical habitats include marshes, swamps, peat bogs, flooded meadows, damp grassland, seasonally flooded pans and depressions, tussocky grassland interspersed with patches of mud on the margins of open water (e.g. lakes and reservoirs), pools in sand-dunes, swampy creeks, rivers and streams, tall reedbeds (2-3 m high) with extensive mud, shallow puddles and <em>Sesbania</em> bushes, and occasionally salt-marsh (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Marchant and Higgins 1993, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species also frequents marshy artificial wetlands such as irrigated fields of crops (e.g. rice), sewage ponds, salt-works, farm ponds and dense grassy vegetation in rural residential areas (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Marchant and Higgins 1993, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Although the species shows a preference for shallowly flooded areas, breeding birds may occupy grassland and sedges flooded to a depth of 30 cm and will occur on floating vegetation or in tall shrubs flooded to a depth of 2 m (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, bugs, Odonata, stoneflies, caddisflies, flies and mosquitos), as well as annelids (up to 10 cm long), molluscs, small crustaceans (e.g. ostracods and copepods), small fish (up to 2 cm long), amphibians, and vegetative plant material and seeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a shallow cup or platform of vegetation placed close to water on a grass tussock or in soft grass, usually 4-60 cm above the water level (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Occasionally the nest may be floating or anchored to vegetation in water, or placed in or under low bushes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Management information </strong>Changes in water level during the nesting period should be avoided, cutting and burning of vegetation near the waters edge should be controlled and the maintenance of natural vegetation around fish ponds and rice-fields should be encouraged (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).<strong></strong>","The species is threatened by degradation and loss of seasonal and ephemeral wetlands owing to drainage, overgrazing, cultivation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), reed-cutting, reed-burning and sudden changes in water levels caused by discharges from large dams (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is a fully migratory circumpolar breeder with several sub-populations that employ a number of migration strategies, from short coastal flights to long, non-stop flights overland on a broad front (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The sub-population that breeds in north-east Greenland migrates through Iceland, Britain and western France to arrive in its West African wintering grounds (specifically Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania) from late-July, returning again between March and early-April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). European birds may gather in large congregations from the beginning of July in areas such as the Wadden Sea or the Wash to moult (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and some juveniles may remain in the non-breeding range all year (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds dispersed or aggregated in loose colonies, and travels in group sizes of up to 1,500 on passage, remaining in large groups (up to hundreds of thousands of birds) throughout the non-breeding season (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).<strong> </strong>The species is active both diurnally and nocturnally (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Shepherd and Lank 2004). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> In the breeding season this species frequents moist boggy ground interspersed with surface water, such as tussock tundra and peat-hummock tundra in the arctic, as well as wet coastal grasslands, salt marshes and wet upland moorland (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> In the non-breeding season this species mainly prefer estuarine mudflats, but also frequent a wide variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), both coastal and inland, including lagoons, muddy freshwater shores, tidal rivers, flooded fields, sewage farms, salt-works, sandy coasts (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), lakes and dams (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). For roosting during high tides and at night this species prefers large fields of naturally fertilised short pasture or soil-based crops with few vertical structures that could be used by predators (Shepherd and Lank 2004). <strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> This species is omnivorous during the breeding season, consuming mostly adult and larval insects (dipteran flies, beetles, caddisflies, wasps, sawflies and mayflies), and also spiders, mites, earthworms, snails, slugs and plant matter (usually seeds) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> It is also omnivorous during the non-breeding season, consuming mostly polychaete worms and small gastropods, as well as insects (dipteran flies and beetles), crustaceans, bivalves, plant matter and occasionally small fish (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Its nest is a scrape or shallow depression in the ground, concealed in vegetation and sometimes in a tuft or tussock (and thus raised slightly off the ground) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Management information</strong> The provision of well-surfaced paths in breeding areas that recieve &gt; 30 visitors a day has been shown to reduce the impact of human disturbance on this species' reproductive performance (Pearce-Higgins <em>et al.</em> 2007). It is also known to show increased hatching successes when ground predators have been excluded by erecting protective fences around nesting areas (Jackson 2001).","<em>Breeding</em> This species is significantly threatened by the loss of its breeding habitat though afforestation of moorland (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Lavers and Haines-Young 1997). It may also suffer from nest predation by introduced mammals (e.g. European hedgehog <em>Erinaceus europeaus</em>) on some islands (Jackson 2001). <em>Non-breeding</em> In the winter this species is restricted to a small number of estuaries, so it is vulnerable to any changes in this habitat for example through land reclamation (drainage) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and the invasion of alien plant species (such as the grass <em>Spartina anglica</em> which has spread on British mudflats, resulting in the reduction in size of feeding areas available) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (UK) (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002b). Important migratory stop-over habitats on the Baltic Sea coastline adjacent to the Kaliningrad region of Russia are threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for irrigation, peat-extraction, reedbed mowing and burning, and abandonment and changing land management practices leading to scrub and reed overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1 in particular) and is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global   population is estimated to number c.4,295,000-6,800,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015). The European population is estimated at 426,000-562,000 pairs, which equates to 853,000-1,120,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Since the total occupied area in India has been variously estimated at between 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chauhan 2006) and 400,000 km² (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), or even more (Puri <em>et al</em>. 2015), it is impossible to gauge population trend from changes in occupied area. However, there is, throughout most of the range, a clear trend in deterioration of habitat, which has caused Sloth Bear populations to decline (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008). This deterioration in habitat is expected to accelerate in the future.<br/> <br/> Habitat outside of protected areas is under severe and growing pressure due to demands for natural resources and the ever increasing populations of both humans and livestock in the region (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006a). This problem is compounded by many factors including that in India, where the vast majority of Sloth Bear habitat is located: 1) the per capita forest area is only one-tenth of the world’s average; 2) there is a demand–supply gap for construction timber leading to over-harvesting and degradation of natural ecosystems; 3) an estimated 78% of forests are subjected to heavy grazing causing degradation of forest habitat; and 4) vast stretches of forest are still diverted for a variety of developmental and infrastructural projects (Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India 2009). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2015) reported that India had a 0.3% rate increase of forest area during 2010-2015, due to afforestation. However, the type and location of all the forest planted is unspecified. Much of this afforestation effort is occurring in more urban areas and it is not known how much is accessible to Sloth Bears.<br/> <br/> The human population growth in India is presently the greatest threat to Sloth Bears. It drives the loss and degradation of habitat and is likely the cause for growing human-bear conflicts in the country. The population of India is expected to increase by 366,000,000 people (roughly 30%) over the next 30 years&#160; (US Census bureau, International database <a href=""http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php"">http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php</a>). This extraordinary population growth is likely to have major direct and indirect impacts on Sloth Bear populations, especially those existing outside protected areas. The human population growth of India is particularly alarming because 90-95%of the range of Sloth Bears is in India. Likewise, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> (2007) predicted a future decline in Sloth Bear numbers in Sri Lanka due to burgeoning human densities and commensurate habitat deterioration and increasing conflicts.<br/> <br/> The recent extirpation of Sloth Bears in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013) highlights serious concerns over persistence of small, isolated Sloth Bear populations, especially outside of protected areas, where half or more of the populations exist. Sloth Bears are particularly vulnerable to loss of habitat because of their reliance on lowland areas, which tend to be the places most readily used and developed by people. Moreover, the aggressiveness of this species makes them incompatible with high human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Given the lack of effective measures to control the rate of habitat loss and exploitation, Sloth Bear populations are expected to continue declining, at an increasing rate, resulting in a &gt;30% loss over the next 30 years (three generations).</p>","<p>Sloth Bears subsist primarily on termites, ants, and fruits. Sloth Bears are the only species of bear adapted specifically for myrmecophagy (ant and termite-eating; Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). Like other myrmecphagous mammals, they have especially small home ranges compared to other ursids (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006b). The ratio of insects to fruits in the diet varies with the seasonal and geographical availability of each food (Baskaran <em>et al.</em> 1997, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1997, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Mewada and Dharaiya 2010, Sukhadiya <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fruits may comprise 70‒90% of the diet during the fruiting season, whereas termites and other insects may comprise &gt;80% of the diet the rest of the year (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears occupy a wide range of habitats on the Indian mainland including wet and dry tropical forests, savannahs, scrublands, and grasslands (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ramesh <em>et al.</em> 2012). They are primarily a lowland species. Most Sloth Bear range in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka is limited to habitats below 1500 m, although the species may occur as high as 2,000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats (Johnsingh 2003, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Sri Lanka, Sloth Bears are confined to the remaining dry forests in the north and eastern parts of the island, mostly below 300 m (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006). In areas where forest cover is sparse but daytime temperatures are high (a large part of the range), the bear is principally nocturnal or crepuscular and shelters in rock outcrops, thickets, and tree cavities during the heat of the day. Although some Sloth Bears may be active during the day in protected areas (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999), they tend to be almost exclusively nocturnal in disturbed and fragmented forests interspersed with human habitations (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004; Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2012).<br/> <br/> Studies in Nepal and Sri Lanka suggest that Sloth Bears avoid areas where human disturbance is high, so crop depredation by Sloth Bears is uncommon (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). However, in some parts of India, Sloth Bears routinely raid peanut, maize, and fruit crops (Chhangani 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160; In some of these areas the habitats are severely degraded and affected by human exploitation, including the extraction of several food sources of the Sloth Bear.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears typically breed May through July, and females give birth, usually to one or two cubs, from November to January (Laurie and Seidensticker 1977, Iswariah 1984, Gopal 1991, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999, Chauhan <em>et al.</em> 2003, Spady <em>et al.</em> 2007). Cubs often ride on the mother's back during their first nine months, presumably to reduce the risk of predation. Cubs remain with their mothers for 1.5-2.5 years resulting in a 2 or 3 year interbirth interval (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999).</p>","<p>Major threats to this species are habitat loss or degradation (often related to human population growth), retaliation from human‒bear conflicts, and (to a lesser degree) poaching (Johnsingh 2003, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bargali <em>et al. </em>2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). Habitat has been lost, degraded, and fragmented by overharvest of forest products (timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, honey), establishment of monoculture plantations (e.g. teak, eucalyptus), over-grazing, extraction of minerals, quarrying, settlement of refugees, and expansion of agricultural areas, human settlements, and roads (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990).<br/> <br/> In some parts of the range, encounters between people and Sloth Bears have led to numerous serious human injuries and many deaths (Rajpurohit and Krausman 2000, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Such incidents occur where people frequently use bear habitat, and where the habitat has become severely degraded, prompting bears to seek food and water in closer proximity to humans. Most attacks occur when people and bears surprised each other in thickets or around rock outcrops, where visibility is obstructed: the bear(s)—sometimes multiple adult bears are involved—rush at, pursue, and knock down the person, and often attack the face. Bears that attack or threaten to attack people may ultimately be killed. Sloth Bear attacks outside protected areas are increasing, and hostility of local people towards bears has made bear conservation more difficult (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Mardaraj 2014). Increasing numbers of Sloth Bear attacks appear to be related to rising human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> The only natural (non-human) threats to Sloth Bears are Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and possibly Leopards (<em>P. pardus</em>). The threat of Tiger predation may account for the aggressive nature of Sloth Bears (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999). Sloth Bears have been observed fending off Tigers, but they are also occasionally killed by Tigers (Gopal 1991).</p>","<p>Information is available on the area of potentially occupied range in India (Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar<em> et al. </em>2012), Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a), and Sri Lanka (Ratnayeke <em>et al</em>. 2007a,b). The potential Sloth Bear distribution in India was estimated to be <em>ca.</em> 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al. </em>2004, Chauhan 2006) but the more recent National Bear Conservation and Welfare Action Plan 2012 (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the occupied range is twice that large (400,000 km²). An even more recent survey suggested that Sloth Bears may occupy 52% of the land area of India (Puri <em>et al.</em> 2015). Notably, though, the latter study was based on very large sampling cells (2,800 km² across a sampling region of nearly 3 million km²), and any cell estimated to be occupied would have been considered as fully occupied; this would inflate the range area considerably. In short, the results of this study do not appear to reflect the reality of Sloth Bear distribution in India as they clearly do not occur in &gt;50% of the land area. Additionally, the model predicts Sloth Bear occurrence in specific places where they are known to be absent, such as Gir Forest. However, the study does demonstrate that Sloth Bears can live in relatively small degraded areas.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears can occur at high densities. However, there are few reliable Sloth Bear density estimates: most estimates have been based on opinions gleaned from interviews and questionnaires (e.g., Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006). The one robust density estimate for this species, which was based on mark–resight of radio-collared bears, yielded an estimate of 27 bears/100 km² for Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, and as high as 72 bears/100 km² in a core area of the park (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). Gopalaswamy (2006) attempted a rigorous estimate based on presence-absence records at camera traps (as per Royle and Nichols 2003), but detection rates were too low to produce a useful estimate.<br/> <br/> Attempts have been made to apply estimated densities in various protected areas to all occupied areas to obtain a range-wide population estimate. Depending on methods and data employed in this process, range-wide estimates have varied from &lt;10,000 to &gt;20,000 bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). None of these estimates are considered reliable enough to track changes in population size, especially since the total range area is not well defined. Estimates for individual Indian states are also not reliable enough to track population trends (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The population of Sloth Bears on the island of Sri Lanka is equally not well understood. Santiapillai and Santiapillai (1990) tentatively reported a population of 300–600 bears for the island. Ratneyeke <em>et al.</em> (2007a) estimated, based on home ranges of radio-collared bears that Wasgomuwa National Park alone may support more than 100-150 sloth bears. This national park only makes up roughly 5% of the known Sloth Bear range in Sri Lanka and therefore the population likely well exceeds the previous estimate.<br/> <br/> Increased habitat fragmentation and a decrease of occupied habitat have been observed in many parts of the Sloth Bear range (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008, Bargali 2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). However, rigorous assessments of population change are rare. Jhala <em>et al.</em> (2011) compared occupancy of Sloth Bears in select areas from 2006 to 2010, during a comprehensive Tiger survey across India, and reported five decreasing, four increasing, and three stable bear populations; although the methods and short time span between surveys probably precluded a reliable indication of population trend.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sloth Bear’s historical distribution includes a large portion of India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, as well as the southern lowlands of Nepal and presumably Bhutan. Some unverified reports suggested that they once occurred in the western-most corner of present day Myanmar (Erdbrink 1953), but this was never confirmed and seems unlikely based on the mountainous habitat. Historically this species overlapped the distributions of Asiatic Black Bears (<span class=""sciname""><em>Ursus thibetanus</em>) in northern India (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2012), and with both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears (<em>Helarctos malayanus</em>) in northeastern India (Choudhury 2011).&#160;Historical records are confusing, though, because Sloth Bears and Asiatic Black Bears look alike and were often not reliably distinguished.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>India</u></strong><br/> At least 90% of the present Sloth Bear range occurs in India. Within India their distribution is constrained to the south by the ocean, to the northwest by deserts, and to the north and east by mountains. Although Sloth Bears were once common and even abundant throughout the Indian Peninsula (McTaggart Cowan 1972, Krishnan 1972, Brander 1982), their range has shrunk and densities reduced due to continuous habitat loss and human-caused mortalities. Although still found scattered across much of its former range, their actual distribution is now highly fragmented and confined mainly to five distinct regions, namely northern, northeastern, central, southeastern, and southwestern (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a, Johnsingh 2003, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The northern distribution region occurs largely within the state of Uttarakhand (Bargali 2012), but also includes the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and the northwestern tip of Bihar. This northern region borders the southern and western areas of Nepal and includes trans-border populations. However, the northern region remains completely isolated from the other population regions in India due to large scale forest removal and agriculture and human settlements.<br/> <br/> The northeastern region is the farthest east that this species occurs and is perhaps the least understood region in terms of Sloth Bear distribution. The bulk of the distribution appears to occur in the state of Assam (Choudhury 2011, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), though Sloth Bears are also known from Manipur, Megalaya and Arunachal Pradesh (where it is very rare). The fact that the distribution of Sloth Bears in this region overlaps with that of both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears has made reports of Sloth Bear occurrence less reliable.<br/> <br/> The central region is the largest region. The bulk of the distribution occurs in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, but includes the states of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Just south of this region, in the southern half of Andhra Pradesh, is the southeastern region, which occurs along the Eastern Ghats. It is not known whether bears move between the central and southeastern regions.<br/> <br/> The southwestern area follows the Western Ghats and principally falls within the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where there may be a connection to the southeastern region. They have been observed up to 2,000 m elevation in the Western Ghats (A.J.T. Johnsingh, personal communication, in Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a). They also stretch northwestward into Gujarat and Rajasthan.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Nepal</u></strong><br/> In Nepal, Sloth Bears are most common within the narrow strip of lowland grassland–forest mosaic called the Terai. They also range into the lower Siwaliks (maximum elevation is unknown). The bears are mainly in protected areas in the central and western portions of the Terai. Since the mid-1980s, they were thought to have been extirpated from the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve in western Nepal, an area containing the largest patch of continuous grassland in Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). However, during a 2013 Tiger camera trap study in the reserve a photo of a Sloth Bear was captured. Then in 2014 Sloth Bear tracks and scat were recorded in the reserve as well (Babu Ram Lamichane, National Trust for Nature Conservation—Suklaphanta Conservation Program, pers. comm., 2015). Therefore, it appears that Sloth Bears have recolonized Sulka Phanta Wildlife Reserve, likely from adjacent Piliphit Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh, India, which is known to have Sloth Bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012); alternately, Sloth Bears persisted in such small numbers that they went undetected for several years (Johnsingh 2003). Some of the Sloth Bear populations in Nepal remain connected with the Indian northern region (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bangladesh</u><br/> </strong>Sloth Bears have been extirpated from Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013). The last documented records are from the mid-1990s (NCSIP-1 2001, Sarker 2006). Although they had been present in the southeastern, eastern and northeastern parts of the country, the forest patches in which they persisted have been largely removed (Sarker 2006).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bhutan</u></strong><br/> Recent investigations suggest that if Sloth Bears occupy Bhutan, they are very rare. Garshelis <em>et al.</em> (1999a) mapped two populations of Sloth Bears in Bhutan, including Royal Manas National Park (RMNP) and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Their range map was based on habitat-elevation information and purported documentation of presence.&#160; However, due to frequent confusion in distinguishing Sloth Bears from Asiatic Black Bears, it is now apparent that this range map was wrong. Sloth Bears appear to have a much narrower range in Bhutan, if at all. One camera trap photo in RMNP, taken in 2009, 2 km from the Indian border, is the only current verified record of presence (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Grasslands, which are preferred habitat for Sloth Bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999 a,b; Choudhury 2011) are present in both RMNP and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, and both of these protected areas are connected to protected areas in India, known to contain sloth bears. However, it is not known whether a true trans-boundary population exists anywhere along this border, or if just a few vagrant bears occasionally come across to the Bhutan side (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Sri Lanka</u></strong><br/> The Sri Lankan Sloth Bear subspecies is distributed in the north and east sides of the island and is closely tied with forest cover (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). Sloth Bears occupy roughly 17% of the island and there is still a high connectivity between occupied areas. However, recent civil war activities largely occurred in the northern and eastern sides of the island, which are home to the largest contiguous forest patches and which historically supported healthy Sloth Bear populations. These areas have gone largely unprotected and it is still unknown how sloth bear distribution may have been affected (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2007a).</p>","<p>Poaching of Sloth Bears for trade in parts has been reported (Servheen 1990, Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), but its current extent and impact on bear populations is uncertain. Compared to other Asian bear species, commercial trade in Sloth Bear parts appears to be relatively low (Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014). Poaching also occurs for local use: male reproductive organs used as aphrodisiac; bones, teeth and claws used to ward off evil spirits; bear fat used for native medicine and hair regeneration (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997, Chauhan 2006). Occasional rashes of poaching incidents have been reported. For example, in Madhya Pradesh in 2014, at least eight male bears were found professionally poached, as indicated by the skilful removal of their reproductive organs, gall bladders and claws (Basu 2014, Naveen 2014). Two of the dead bears were found near the buffer area of Khana Tiger Reserve, while the others were found in less protected forests in the state. The manner in which the bear parts were removed led many to speculate that that the poaching may be taking place on a larger scale and that the parts may have been removed for illegal international trade.<br/> <br/> The capture of cubs, which often includes the killing of the mother bear, for use as street-show ""dancing bears"" (Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997) used to be a threat in some parts of India, but has been controlled to a significant level (D’Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2011). This practice has been illegal in India since 1972, though it continued in earnest until 2009. However it persists to a small degree in southern Nepal. It is unclear if the practitioners were always in Nepal or if they crossed the border to Nepal from India due to the political pressure to end the practice in India. Several dancing bears have been confiscated at the Nepal-India border while they were being brought into India (K. Satyanarayan, Wildlife SOS, personal communication, 2015). Additionally, a cub was rescued that was being smuggled into Nepal with clear signs that it was to be sold for use as a dancing bear (Wildlife SOS 2015).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Sloth Bears are listed in Appendix I of CITES and are completely protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. They are also protected to varying degrees by national laws in the other range countries. However, they can be killed to protect life or property.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears are reported to exist in 174 Protected Areas (PAs) in India, which include 46 National Parks and 128 Wildlife Sanctuaries (Chauhan 2006). Populations appear to be reasonably well protected when inside these PAs, but face deteriorating habitat conditions outside (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dharaiya, 2009). Reduced cover and food resources outside PAs (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004) have led to increased human–bear conflicts, including frequent maulings (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is estimated that half to two-thirds of the Sloth Bears in India live outside PAs. Roughly half the occupied range in Sri Lanka occurs outside PAs (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b).<br/> <br/> Human-bear conflicts, both crop raiding and bear attacks, are a growing concern for this species. Given the aggressive nature of this animal, and the increasing number of encounters between bears and people, these bears are widely feared. Although education may help reduce human-bear conflicts and enhance a conservation ethic among locals, the root of the problem is largely related to the expansion of human settlement and deteriorating habitat, which increases the chance of interaction between people and bears. Thus, habitat improvements (government or community-based reforestation) would be helpful in alleviating such conflicts. Potential solutions to this problem have not been studied in depth and further research on this issue is critical to getting this problem under control. The planting of fruit trees, to provide both food and cover, has been undertaken in several states in India.<br/> <br/> Other projects to help ameliorate human-bear conflicts will probably need to be implemented for a number of years to produce useful outcomes; long-term funding will thus be needed to advance the science of human-bear conflict resolution. Where sufficient human resources and funding exist, conflict rapid-response teams (staffed by NGOs, government personnel, and local people) can be effective. Safety guidelines can be devised and disseminated, based on knowledge of bear behaviour and ecology, to help people avoid bears or minimize chances of being attacked. Better methods to deter bears are also needed. Additionally, educational efforts to increase awareness and promote greater tolerance are likely to be keys to success.<br/> <br/> Aside from the global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species, published by the IUCN in 1999 (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), India developed a National Conservation Action Plan for bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). This action plan was developed through a wide range of consultations with stakeholders and covers all four species present in India. The plan emphasizes mitigation of human-bear conflicts, increased habitat management, enhanced research and information gathering, capacity building, and improved communication and education. Priority actions in the action plan include: strengthening methods of crop and livestock protection; reducing bear-caused human injuries, creating rapid response teams to investigate conflicts with bears (and possible claims for monetary compensation); enhancing human tolerance toward bears; identifying critical habitats and corridors used by bears, especially those outside PAs; increasing habitat protection and restoring degraded habitats outside PAs; reducing dependency of local communities on resources needed by bears; discouraging shifting agriculture; developing methods to track population size and trends; involving communities in bear monitoring programs; equipping forest and wildlife staff with adequate knowledge and modern equipment to manage all types of human-bear interactions; and developing an advocacy program for bear conservation through active communication to the public and pressure on corporations and politicians.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

It breeds in wide reed-marshes composed primarily of <em>tule</em>-rushes (<em>Schoenoplectus tatora</em>) in places with easy access to open water, or in open view in floating water weeds (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). Fish of the genus <em>Orestias </em>comprise up to 94% of prey as measured by biomass<strong> </strong>(Martinez <em>et al. </em>2006).

Confirmation that birds are drowned in these gill-nets comes from local fishermen and direct observations - one study found 100% of Aymara fishermen questioned had found grebes drowned as bycatch in their nets<strong> </strong>(Martinez <em>et al. </em>2006), 45% of the fishermen finding such birds on a weekly basis. A rapid evaluation with two fishermen in 2005 found one dead grebe per net/fisherman/day<strong> </strong>(B.<strong> </strong>Hennessey <em>in litt.</em> 2005) and studies in 2006-2007 found 2.7 individuals per fisherman/month. Local, natural fluctuations in water levels seriously impact breeding success (Engblom <em>et al</em>. 2001). Lakes Poopó and Uru Uru are threatened by chemical contamination from the heavy metal mining industry (Konter 2006). Lake ecosystems in the area are being affected negatively by the introduction of exotic fish such as <em>Basilicthys bonariensis </em>and&#160;<em>Oncorhynchus&#160;mykiss</em> (J.

Uro communities have recently started hunting birds, including Titicaca Grebes, on a commercial basis to sell at market<strong> </strong>(Martinez <em>et al. </em>2006), and eggs may be harvested for food. Harvesting of <em>tule-</em>beds has taken place for centuries but human population growth and market demand for cattle may be changing harvesting patterns and posing a threat to the grebes' breeding habitat<strong> </strong>(Martinez <em>et al. </em>2006). In particular, burning of <em>tule</em>-rushes during the grebes' peak breeding period may be affecting reproduction<strong> </strong>(B.<strong> </strong>Hennessey <em>in litt.</em> 2005). Tourism on Lake Titicaca has increased rapidly over the past decade, and disturbance by boats may be a threat to reproductive success<strong> </strong>(H. Aranibar-Rojas <em>in litt. </em>2007).

In 2007, 1,254 individuals were counted in the wet season (H. Aranibar-Rojas <em>in litt. </em>2007).

Breeding has been recorded during the rainy season from November to February (Jensen <em>et al. </em>2016). During this time of the year it has been observed aggressively defending likely breeding territories against other sunbirds (Jensen <em>et al. </em>2016). Presumed lekking behaviour has been observed with up to three males repeatedly assembling in a clearing in an open part of the forest with leafless branches and twigs at low height,&#160;hopping from branch to branch and singing aggressively at each other at close range; with a single female observing but not participating (Jensen <em>et al. </em>2016).

Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Its core breeding areas are located in endemic palm forest dominated by coco de mer <em>Lodoicea maldivica</em>. The species nests in tree cavities mainly in dead coco de mer palms, but they have also been recorded to nest in cavities in other palms and living broadleaf trees (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a), with breeding activity from October to March (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013; Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Deep cavities in hollow <em>L. maldivica</em> trunks with dense canopy cover over the entrance are preferred (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Breeding activity fluctuates widely between years (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016), with approximately one year in four showing minimal or no breeding activity.&#160;In one study, 53% of nests were found to be successful out of 36 nest attempts with 57% fledgling survival to one year (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). It is also found in cultivated areas and residential areas with gardens, which are suitable feeding habitats (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016). It feeds on a range of plant species, the majority of which are endemic and native (Reuleaux <em>et al. </em>2014b). It mainly feeds on the fruit pulp, followed by seeds and buds, with occasional observations of feeding on leaves, flowers, bark and scale insects (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014b).","The decline in this species prior to the 1960s is thought to have been driven mainly by predation by introduced rats and hunting by settlers and farmers (Rocamora and Laboudallon  2013). Other causes of increased mortality have included capture for pets and trade and incidental trapping when other species, namely fruit bats, are targeted. The most serious current threats to the species include ongoing nest predation from rats and cats, poaching of its main nesting tree (coco de mer), and habitat destruction caused by  fires, with potential threats including persecution, netting  of bat species and low genetic diversity (Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Forest fires may represent the most serious threat to the species, with records since the early 1980s showing that approximately every 10 years a large forest fire occurs (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The availability of nesting cavities may be a limiting factor in very active breeding years, with some females occupying sub-optimal cavities. The poaching of coco de mer nuts could reduce the area of palm forest over the long term, although recent anti-poaching measures appear to be successful.&#160;Rose-ringed Parakeets <em>Alexandrinus krameri, </em>which once posed a major threat, have been entirely eradicated from the Seychelles by the Seychelles Islands Foundation. <em>A. krameri </em>carried diseases such as Beak and Feather Disease Virus, which was a serious threat for <em>C. barklyi </em>(Fogell <em>et al.</em> 2018). The impacts of introduced species through nest predation and competition for nest-sites may not yet be serious enough to limit the population; however, mynahs are increasing on Praslin (Dueker 2018). Invasive yellow crazy ants are an emerging threat, with numbers having increased substantially in Praslin's palm forest habitat from 2015-2018. The ants have caused at least two <em>C. barklyi</em> nest failures. Yellow crazy ants are now being controlled with a baiting programme across the Vallée de Mai and other parts of Praslin's remaining palm forest (N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2020). Predation of fledglings by cats and dogs is probably limited and post-fledging mortality is not currently a major concern as most fledglings are seen again in the year after they fledge (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). Another risk factor for the species is the substantial and so-far unexplained fluctuations in its breeding activity, with minimal or no breeding occurring approximately every four breeding seasons (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data).","Point count surveys conducted on Praslin in 2010 and 2011 found a  density of 0.14-0.24 individuals/ha, resulting in a total population  estimate of 520-900 individuals (95% confidence intervals) obtained  through distance sampling methodology (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).  After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. The most recent point count survey in 2018 estimated a population of 1392 (1096-1742, 95% CI) individuals. On the basis of this new data, it is assumed that there are 730-1170 mature individuals in the population.",Stable,"<em>Coracopsis barklyi</em> is resident on Praslin, with occasional non-breeding records on Curieuse (c.1 km north of Praslin), <strong>Seychelles </strong>(Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). Point count surveys conducted on Praslin in 2010 and 2011 found a  density of 0.14-0.24 individuals/ha, resulting in a total population  estimate of 520-900 individuals (95% CI) obtained  through distance sampling methodology (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).  No individuals were detected on Curieuse during point counts over four  days and during supplementary fieldwork, thus it is assumed that there  is no resident population there (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). Prior to the surveys by Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. (2013), the most recent  population estimate on Praslin was of 645 individuals (95% confidence  intervals: 404-1,034 individuals), using distance sampling at 39 random  points (Walford 2008). However, this study was deemed to have several  methodological and analytical constraints, which meant that assumptions  of the distance sampling method were not met (Walford 2008; Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013) and resulting in an estimate range that was considered too broad to serve as a basis for conservation planning (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. A review of previous survey results indicates that this species&#160;has recovered from a low point of c.30-50 individuals in one area of the island in the late 1960s,  increasing until the at least the turn of the century, with uncertainty  over the trend since then (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013; Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Surveys in 2018 produced a population estimate of 1382 (1096-1742, 95% CI) individuals on Praslin (Dueker 2018), however this cannot be directly compared to the 2011 population estimate due to differences in survey seasons, which affects the vocalisations (the main detection method) of this parrot.",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species has been protected by law since 1966 (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Endemic palms have been protected since 1991, and the restoration of native palm forest on Praslin and Curieuse is on-going. The species occurs in Praslin National Park, which was established in 1979, and the Vallée de Mai was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Fond Ferdinand and Curieuse island are managed as nature reserves, but they lack official protected status. Fond Peper, an area of mature palm forest of approximately 60 ha, adjacent to the Vallée de Mai, and another area of high quality black parrot breeding habitat, is now also under the management of Seychelles Islands Foundation and being prioritised for conservation. Artificial nest boxes were provided between 1983 and c.2005 (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013; A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016), although these are now no longer in use, with no apparent ill effects to the population (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data).<br/>There is a firebreak around the core breeding area at Vallée de Mai,   but it is not guaranteed to work in the event of a large fire which   cannot be quickly contained (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>.  2014). The firebreak proved to be only partially effective when a fire destroyed several hectares of high quality breeding habitat in the south of Praslin in 2010 (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016). The poaching of coco de mer nuts is being counteracted with  increased security and a regeneration programme, and awareness-raising  activities have been conducted to reduce persecution by farmers. Rose-ringed Parakeets <em>Alexandrinus krameri </em>were eradicated from Mahé&#160;in 2019 (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). An experimental trial to assess the effects of rat control on <em>C. barklyi</em> breeding success was carried out in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. And intensive baiting programme to control yellow crazy ants began in 2019 (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). <br/>A national action plan for the species was produced in 2009 and includes plans to introduce the species to Silhouette, along with captive breeding on Frégate Island and North Island if appropriate habitat restoration and management can be carried out (reviewed by Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Other conservation actions identified for this species include the control of introduced species, population monitoring and public awareness campaigns (reviewed by Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Analysis using statistical models is planned in 2014 after annual counts have been conducted for three years without interruption, and  conclusions regarding the species trend since 1982 will be published  (G.

Populations in both Ethiopia and South Africa are now thought to be extremely small (although it is unknown whether there is migration between the two areas).<br/><p></p>","<strong>Behaviour:&#160;</strong>The movements of this species are not fully understood, but the lack of subspeciation has been interpreted to imply that the birds migrate between the two subpopulations (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Dalton <em>et al.&#160;</em>2018), and DNA analyses suggest that the species may be migratory (Smit-Robinson 2014; C. Symes&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016; Dalton&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). However the fact that there are overlaps in occurrence has prompted suggestions that strict migration is unlikely (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). One suggestion is that long-distance dispersal occurs when numbers are high (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998), with local movements being predominant at other times. Recent findings further support the presence of two subpopulations (South Africa and Ethiopia) that respond nomadically to niche availability (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020a, b, c), and could potentially intermingle at disjunct central sites. In 2012 a survey was carried out in south-west Ethiopia during the non-breeding season to understand more about the possible movement of birds between Ethiopia and South Africa, but no birds were found (Drerup 2015). However, recent developments in the use of remote survey methodology have improved the ability to study this highly elusive species (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>, </em>2019). In Ethiopia birds that breed in the central highlands in June-September may move to lower-level habitats during the non-breeding season when the highland areas becomes unsuitable (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Similarly, in South Africa, birds are primarily present in the highland regions in October-March, with isolated low-altitude records outside of this peak period (April-August). This suggests that the species moves nomadically in response to changing niche conditions and could possibly use peat wetlands at lower elevations during the winter. Application of camera-acoustic survey methodology allowed for the successful confirmation of the vocalisations of this species, which is not very audible amongst other wetland and environmental sounds (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020b). In South Africa, the species arrived at highland wetlands shortly after the first large (c.50mm) rainfall in early to mid summer, displacing the resident Red-chested Flufftail in selected sedge dominant habitat patches (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2019). Territorial activity commenced immediately, including visual and vocal displays (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2019, 2020b).&#160;Visual displays include the voluntary display of white secondaries both when wings were tucked in and during extensive wing-flapping behaviour. These visual displays were noted together with peaks in vocalisations, which were conducted from first light through to 3 hours after sunrise (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020b), with most of the vocalisations done by males. Females were observed to be more active late-morning through to midday, while juveniles were more active during the late-morning and late-afternoon. Chicks fledge by mid-late summer (Colyn <em>et al. </em>2020b). Males may leave wetlands soon after the chicks have fledged, while females remained in wetlands later into summer, and juveniles could remain longer, until the end of March (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2020b).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat:&#160;</strong><em>Breeding</em>&#160;In Ethiopia the species breeds in high-altitude seasonal marshes (between 2,200 and 2,600 m) with dense, rapidly growing vegetation dominated by sedges, grasses and forbs (Taylor 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It occurs here when vegetation has reached 20-40 cm in height and the ground has not yet become entirely flooded (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). Very soon after hatching, it appears to move its chicks to areas of denser vegetation where the ground is more deeply and continuously flooded (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). The species may have specific microhabitat requirements that have not yet been established. In South Africa it inhabits moist to flooded peat-based habitats (mostly at 1,100-2,100 m) where vegetation is dense and dominated by sedges (<em>Carex </em>species), although it is occasionally found in pure stands of Typha and reeds (Davies&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015; Colyn <em>et al. </em>2019). It forages in mud at the edges of reed beds, in shallow water, in floating mats of aquatic vegetation and occasionally on dry ground (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Of the 10 important sites for the species in South Africa, 9 are within the Eastern Uplands, Great Escarpment Mountains and Highveld peatland ecoregions, emphasising the importance of peat-based habitats (Taylor and Grundling 2003)<strong></strong>. Occupancy results from South Africa suggest that increased basal and canopy cover, together with shallower water depths, were the primary factors influencing local occurrence (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2019). Studies from Ethiopia showed that the significant drivers of nest site selection were vegetation cover, sedge cover, vegetation height, and water depth (Colyn <em>et al.</em> 2020a). When cover was reduced, or the water levels increased, birds immediately abandoned respective sites.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet:&#160;</strong>It feeds on seeds and vegetation as well as insects, spiders, earthworms, small frogs and small fish (De Smidt 2003; see Taylor <em>et al. </em>2018).<strong> </strong>The stomach contents of a deceased chick included coleoptera (Dystiscidae) imagines, Diptera larvae (Tipulidae and Tabanidae), and the remains of small crustaceans.<br/>&#160; <strong><br/>Breeding site </strong>Nests found in Ethiopia are described as a ball of woven live sedge, <em>Eleocharis </em>or<em> Cyperus</em>, and other plant stems and vegetation, with clutches of 4-6 eggs (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004; Allan <em>et al.</em> 2006). Observations at a nest found in August 1999 resulted in an estimated incubation period of 15-16 days.<p></p>","Seasonal marshes are threatened by drainage (for cultivation and forestry), flooding by dams, catchment erosion, water abstraction, human disturbance, too-frequent burning, and excessive trampling and grazing by livestock and cutting of marsh vegetation for fodder (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019,&#160;2020a)<strong></strong>. Observations in Ethiopia suggest that the species moves its chicks very soon after hatching to areas of denser vegetation and deeper flooding before the vegetation at nest sites has grown enough for cutting by local people (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004). Grasses and sedges are cut for the culturally important Ethiopian coffee ceremony (De Smidt 2003). In Ethiopia, rapid population growth is resulting in habitat loss and degradation from increasing agricultural practices. Primary threats across the Sululta plain include over-grazing, mowing of wetland vegetation for fodder bale production, and traditional harvesting of vegetation. Currently, more than 90% of all suitable wetland catchments have been completely altered and lost (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Bilacha wetland has already been almost completely converted into agriculture, settlement  and grazing land. Suitable habitat at Weserbi wetland has been completely lost, and housing is spreading close to the remaining small  patch of wet grassland (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Even the  remaining core site, Berga Wetland, is highly threatened as  habitat degradation and  destruction continue unchecked despite attempts to improve the  conservation status of  the area. In addition to the existing overgrazing, trampling and grass  cutting, local people are encroaching  further down to the wetland, converting grassland for subsistence  agriculture and  dividing up small plots of land for grazing. Suitable habitat at Berga has already been reduced by more than 90% and is fragmenting further under land-use pressure (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a).&#160;The peatlands of South Africa are threatened by cultivation, afforestation, grazing, water abstraction, horticulture, peat fires, draining, headcut and donga erosion, siltation, fences and developments such as roads and dams (Taylor and Grundling 2003; Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020c)<strong></strong>. The primary current threat in South Africa is development pressure from the mining industry, agricultural activities, construction of weirs and dams, other sources of flooding, expansion of invasive alien vegetation, and inappropriate management activities such as too-frequent fires and heavy grazing (Colyn <em>et al</em>. 2020c). Genetic analysis suggests that this species may have a low genetic diversity, and so could be limited in its ability to cope with environmental changes (Dalton <em>et al. </em>2018). Climate change analyses suggest that this species is likely to be very vulnerable to climate change, with large sections of its highland breeding areas potentially contracting by 2050 (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020c)<p></p>","The population in South Africa was previously estimated to be 235 birds, with at least a further 210-215 pairs in Ethiopia (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 1998), i.e. probably 700 mature individuals in total. The species can only be reliably surveyed in the breeding season in Ethiopia, but surveys risk disturbing nesting and thus have been avoided in the past (Y. D. Adebe <em>in litt.</em> 2013). Nevertheless, the most recent surveys by Colyn <em>et al.</em> (2020a, b) using cameras and acoustic monitoring yielded upper-limit population densities of 1 pair/5.8 ha in Ethiopia, and 1 pair in 6.7 ha in South Africa. This produced population estimates of 55 pairs in Ethiopia, and c.58 pairs in South Africa, producing a global population estimate of c.226 mature individuals, placed here in the band 50-249 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species occurs in <strong>Ethiopia</strong>&#160;(Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Taylor 1998, 1999), and <strong>South Africa</strong> (ten sites in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga [De Smidt 2003], and it can occur at low, coastal altitudes [Davies <em>et al. </em>2015]). There are also historical sightings from&#160;<strong>Zimbabwe </strong>(Colyn <em>et al. </em>2019)&#160;(only a very limited number of accepted records from the 1970s and 1980s [Hustler and Irwin 1995;&#160;<strong></strong>Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Ewbank 2014], and a possible breeding record in the 1950s [Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Taylor 1999]),&#160;and there is little to no recent information about the species's status there. Claimed records from Zambia and Rwanda are unproven (Taylor and van Perlo 1998; F. Dowsett-Lemaire and R. J. Dowsett <em>in litt. </em>1999; P. Leonard <em> in litt. </em>1999). In South Africa, the total population was estimated to be 235 birds by Taylor and van Perlo (1998), but the area of occupancy has since been estimated at 3.92 km<sup>2 </sup>in South Africa (150 ha across the Dullstroom area, 50 ha at Wakkerstroom, the only two recently reliable site) (R. Colyn&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2020), and due to low confidence in past estimates and continued threats to the species and its habitat over the past 10 years, the regional population in South Africa may be fewer than 50 birds (Evans <em>et al. </em>2015). <br/><br/>In South Africa, a new site was discovered in 2002 in northern coastal KwaZulu-Natal, following speculation that the species no longer occurred in coastal areas, and further sightings at various location in Free State and KwaZulu-Natal have since been made (Taylor and Grundling 2003; Davies <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;In the Ethiopian highlands, 10-15 pairs bred at Sululta in the late 1990s (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; Anon. 1997; J. S. Ash <em>in litt. </em>1999) and c.200 pairs were discovered at a new breeding site (Berga floodplain) in 1997 (Anon. 1997;&#160;<strong></strong>A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998; M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007<strong></strong><strong></strong>). In 2005, a small breeding population was discovered at Bilacha in Ethiopia (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Although Weserbi hosted 10-15 pairs in 2003 (Allan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004), subsequent surveys have failed to record any evidence of presence at this site (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a).&#160;A recent study assessing the available habitat for this species across the Sululta area found the majority of remaining wetland sites were not in a suitable state for this species (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a). Berga Wetland hosts the majority of the remaining habitat for this species across the region, with 61% (158 ha) in the upper reaches, and 37% (71 ha) in the lower reaches. Weserbi is currently unsuitable due to over-grazing and mowing, but should this area improve, it could contribute a further 85 ha of breeding habitat (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a). Bilacha Wetland has been completely fragmented and degraded due to agricultural activities, and currently provides only 1 ha of suitable habitat.<br/><br/>Whether a single population migrates between Ethiopia and South Africa, or each country hosts its own subpopulation, is still not certain (Taylor and van Perlo 1998; Barnes 2000<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>), although observations from a breeding site in Ethiopia discovered in 2005 show that birds continue to breed into the dry season and may remain in Ethiopia after breeding, rather than migrate (A. Tefera <em>per</em> Anon. 2006), and genetic analyses possibly suggest the two subpopulations may intermingle (Dalton <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). Recent research has found birds breeding in both Ethiopia (June-August) and South Africa (October-January) two months apart in the same year (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020a, b). Suggestions  that the non-breeding grounds for the Ethiopian population could be within  south-west Ethiopia have not been substantiated; seven days of intensive surveys in the Kaffa area in April 2013 found no evidence of the species at seven major wetlands (M. Ewnetu <em>in litt. </em>2013). A recent study of the distribution and available habitat for the species across Africa confirmed that Ethiopia and South Africa hold the majority of suitable habitat, and that there are smaller areas located in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020c).&#160;<br/><br/><strong></strong> <p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I and II. Some South African sites have some legal protection, and at least four sites are protected by the landowners (Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>. At the largest Ethiopian breeding population, the vegetation is not cut for fodder until October-November (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, thus giving the birds time to breed without disturbance (Anon. 1997). However, recent surveys by Colyn <em>et al.&#160;</em>(2020a) suggest that the efficacy of this management intervention is deteriorating under increased population growth and land-use pressure, resulting in increased habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation.One of the Ethiopian sites, Berga, is on a state-run dairy farm, and formerly so was Weserbi. The farm at Weserbi has been privatised, but the marsh still remains under the control of the central Dairy Farm Enterprise based in Addis Ababa (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. There is a Site Support Group at Berga, formed by the Ethiopian Wildlife and Natural History Society (De Smidt 2003).<strong>&#160;</strong>Support from organisations including the Middelpunt Wetland&#160;Trust helped to build a primary school (which is now named after the species) for the Berga community and the villagers acknowledge the value of the species (Drummond 2013), and a document is in preparation to formalise the Berga community project (H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt. </em>2016). In South Africa, the Middelpunt Wetland Trust was formed in 1994 with the main objective of conserving the species and its habitat (De Smidt 2003; M. Drummond <em>in litt. </em>2005). In 2003, a partnership was formed to mitigate the effects of the Braamhoek (formally changed to Ingula) pumped storage scheme. Ingula has since been proclaimed as a nature reserve, and as such has secured some habitat for the species. Verloren Vallei, Seeikoeivlei and Ntsikeni Vlei are formally protected areas in South Africa, that currently host the majority of highly suitable habitat for the species (Colyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020c). In June 2003, a national Species Action Planning stakeholder workshop was held in Wakkerstroom, South Africa, to assess the threats facing the species in this country, and concluded with the agreement that a South African White-winged Flufftail Action Group be established (De Smidt 2003), which was formed by the Department of Environmental Affairs in South Africa in 2016 (H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;<br/>An International Species Action Plan was published in 2008 (Sande <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). An AEWA Small Grants Fund supported project in Ethiopia ran from July 2012 to September 2014 (Drerup 2015). The project held four awareness-raising workshops, distributed 1,000 copies of a brochure about the species to schools, local government and the local community and produced a billboard poster to increase awareness. The project enabled protection of the species at its breeding site in the Berga wetlands: 3 ha were fenced off and members of the Site Support Group patrolled the area (these activities were to continue post-completion of the project); soil conservation measures were also implemented to reduce erosion (Drerup 2015). BirdLife South Africa have established a long-term survey being conducted annually since 2016 at core sites within Mpumalanga, South Africa. These surveys assess the ecology, demography and population dynamics, with the results having been synthesised into best practice guidelines for habitat management (BirdLife South Africa <em>in litt.</em> 2020).&#160;In 2015 the second meeting of the AEWA White-winged Flufftail International Working Group was held in Addis Ababa, with a follow up third meeting taking place in South Africa in 2019. An Implementation Plan was developed to ensure the implementation of actions outlined in the ISSAP. The first confirmed breeding record from the southern hemisphere at Middelpunt Wetland, South Africa has resulted in the abandonment of establishing a captive facility, and the focusing of efforts on the conservation of the species’ habitat (H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt.</em> 2020).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Secure habitat under formal protection, and promote appropriate management practices that don't deteriorate wetland habitat. Maintain and restore suitable habitat at breeding areas in Ethiopia through sustainable use under community-based conservation programmes, and it has been proposed that the conservation statue of the Berga Wetland be upgraded (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; <strong></strong>Taylor and van Perlo 1998; M. Drummond <em>in litt. </em>2016). Protect additional sites in South Africa, and a long term goal is also to declare Middelpunt Wetland a nature reserve (Barnes 2000; Evans <em>et al. </em>2015; H. Smit-Robinson <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. Continue surveys in Ethiopia and southern Africa to better define its range, population, seasonal movements and habitat requirements (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 1996; A.

The invasion of Yellow Crazy Ants into the Vallée de Mai represents a major ongoing threat to this population, and since 2016 the ants have spread to encompass the gecko's entire range on Praslin, resulting in a continuing decline in the quality of the species' habitat and plausibly in the number of mature individuals. A major recent threat has emerged from international trade in this species since 2017, with numbers offered for sale online in early 2018 alone believed to represent at least 4% of the total population estimated for the Vallée de Mai. This species is entirely reliant on a remnant patch of Coco de Mer palm forest, and although the area of palm forest is presently stable it faces long-term threats from nut poaching and fire.","This gecko appears to be entirely restricted to mature Coco de Mer (<em>Lodoicea maldivica</em>) forest with a continuous canopy; Bunbury (2018) estimated that suitable habitat covers an area of no more than about 4 km<sup>2</sup> on Praslin, and probably substantially less. It has not been observed in areas with individual Coco de Mer palms or isolated stands of these trees, and is not known from any degraded habitats.&#160;The species is usually found high in the canopy of this habitat and dominates Coco de Mer inflorescences, which provide pollen as a key food source (Mogensen 2014). Its reproductive biology is unknown. It feeds largely on nectar and pollen from Coco de Mer. Although it has been observed to feed on jackfruit within Coco de Mer forest, Jackfruit trees are an exotic species and most have now been removed from the reserve (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020).","The species has an extremely restricted range and is reliant on intact Coco de Mer forest. As such it will be vulnerable to any degradation of its habitat, for example through the spread of invasive species. The Coco de Mer palm was itself added to CITES Appendix III in response to increased levels of poaching of the nuts. Although this may not represent an immediate threat to the gecko, if poaching inhibits recruitment of new palm trees this may be a serious long-term threat to the species' habitat. Ongoing management by the Seychelles Islands Foundation leaves 20% of nuts unharvested, the minimum threshold for forest regeneration calculated by Rist<em> et al.</em> (2009). Poaching in addition to permitted legal offtake therefore threatens the viability of the population over the scale of several decades (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020). Fire, habitat degradation and fragmentation and climate change have also been identifie<span style="""">d as potential threats </span>to the habitat by Bunbury (2018), and a single major fire has the potential to destroy Vallée de Mai (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020). Climate change impacts are presently unstudied, but longer periods of drought are projected for the Seychelles (SIF, in prep.) and could severely affect the palm forest (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>The greatest current direct threats to the species are believed to be the recent rapid increase in commercial interest for this species in the international pet trade given its small population size, and the expansion of invasive Yellow Crazy Ants (Bunbury 2018).Yellow Crazy Ants (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>) were eradicated from Praslin in 1975, but were found to have reinvaded the palm forest on the island by 2000 (Hill<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2003). The species was first recorded from the Vallée de Mai in 2009 and had expanded its range to encompass the entire reserve by 2018 (SIF unpubl. data 2018). This colony has been found to negatively impact the abundance and species richness of arboreal species of molluscs and geckos in native palm forest (Kaiser-Bunbury<em> et al.</em> 2014). The Giant Bronze Gecko was not detected in invaded areas during a 12 week survey in 2010 (Kaiser-Bunbury<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2014), but no conclusions can be drawn from this as this was the least abundant species these authors recorded in non-invaded areas (from the scale in their figure it appears that they recorded only two specimens). One of two related species, the Dwarf Bronze Gecko (<em>Ailuronyx tachyscopaeus</em>)<em>&#160;</em>was significantly less abundant in invaded areas (Kaiser-Bunbury&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). If this reflects evidence of genuine decline, this suggests that the impacts of ant invasion on <em>A. tachyscopaeus</em>&#160;may be immediate and severe.","There are no historical baseline population data for this species and current population trends are unknown. However, as its distribution would have overlapped with that of Coco de Mer forest, which has dramatically declined on Praslin in the last 200 years (in 1742 there were “large forests entirely composed of this palm growing… [on Praslin]” - Ward 1864), it is likely that this species underwent a substantial decline over this period and it was erroneous<span style="""">ly considered to be extinct by Raxworthy and Nussbaum (2000). It survives only in the small area of remnant Coco de Mer forest on the island, where the total population size was estimated to be 3,389 ± 205 animals in 2005 based on focal point surveys (Gerlach 2008). Tagg (2016) estimated the population density within a 0.3 km<sup>2</sup> study area in optimal habitat of 284 (± 29 SE; Range: 245–363 95% CI), based on the results of a mark-recapture study . This author extrapolated these results to the area of Vallée de Mai, estimating a total population size in this area of 1,848 individuals, including juveniles (which were rarely observed) and subadults. This is likely to be an overestimate, as it didn't account for lower densities of palms - and so lower habitat quality for the gecko - in other parts of the reserve &#160;(N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020). Population estimates have not been derived for areas of the species' range outside the valley, where densities of Coco de Mer are much lower.&#160;Current population trends are unknown and the area of Coco de Mer forest is stable, but it is strongly suspected that this species is sensitive to the impacts of both illegal harvesting and Yellow Crazy An</span>ts (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>) which are now present throughout its range on Praslin (SIF 2019); if this is the case it is likely to be in rapid decline.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the Seychelles, where it is known only from - and is considered to be endemic to - Praslin, where it has an estimated area of occupancy of 4 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Bunbury 2018), although the area occupied is expected to be considerably smaller. Earlier reports that the species occurs on Silhouette (Gerlach 2002, 2004, 2007) have never been confirmed by other workers and Rocha <em>et al</em>. (2017) report that they did not obtain specimens from this island ""even after extensive surveys on Silhouette at mid-forest habitats"". The author of the original report agrees that the Silhouette record is best regarded as questionable (J. Gerlach pers. comm. 2020). As such, this assessment follows Rocha <em>et al. </em>(2017) in considering that this species occurs only in one area of mature Coco de Mer palm forest on Praslin, encompassing the Vallée de Mai and Fond Peper. It has been recorded from 100 m asl and suitable forest reaches 350 m asl in Fond Peper (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020).","There is no domestic use of this species within the Seychelles. This species has been recorded in the international pet trade, apparently being attractive to enthusiasts due to its large size, rarity in the wild and scarcity in captivity (Bunbury 2018). Trade is unregulated and appears to have ""escalated rapidly"" since 2017, to a level where it is considered a threat (Bunbury 2018). This trade is almost certain to include wild-caught individuals, and there are no records of this species having been bred in captivity either in the Seychelles or elsewhere (Bunbury 2018). Approximately 40 pairs were offered for sale online in early 2018 (Bunbury 2018). It is estimated that, if all of these animals were wild-caught, this represents at least 4% of the population of the Vallée de Mai (the species' stronghold), a level that is presumably unsustainable (Bunbury 2018).",Terrestrial,"This species is present only in Praslin National Park. There is currently no specific law in the&#160; Seychelles which prohibits the removal of any herpetofauna species from the wild, and the Nature Conservancy and National Parks Act lacks regulations for the Praslin National Park, which would apply to this gecko. The species is not protected under any international legislation. Both national and international legislation to protect this species and ensure that it is covered by trade restrictions (including CITES listing, which has been proposed but is contingent on national protection being implemented - N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020) is the most urgent conservation measure needed for this species (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020). Research is planned to model the potential impacts of climate change on the palm forest (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>Research was conducted into options for controlling or eradicating Yellow Crazy Ants as a prelude to a control program in Vallée de Mai which commenced in 2019.&#160;Annual monitoring of the ant population has been ongoing since the species reached Vallée de Mai (SIF 2019), and will continue during and following the control programme. Recent management efforts including the use of boric acid pesticides specifically targeting ants in Vallée de Mai (Karapetyan 2019, SIF unpubl. data) appear to have been unsuccessful, but subsequent approaches with alternative baits designed to deter native species have been implemented (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020). Monitoring is ongoing to determine the impacts of control techniques on both invasive and native ants, as well as on native geckos (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020).&#160;In addition to this general monitoring there is an urgent need to establish regular dedicated monitoring of this species, which is difficult due to its preference for high canopy. Research by the Seychelles Islands Foundation in 2014–2016 resulted in more than 250 members of this species having pit-tags fitted (Tagg 2016), permitting ongoing monitoring of the marked portion of the population. Ecological research on this species should continue with a focus on its needs and life history and to clarify the impacts of the identified threat from trade. More research is needed to provide a more precise estimate of this species' total population size, including areas for which no population estimates are presently available (N. Bunbury pers. comm. 2020).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008).

The dense human population, consisting mainly of small-scale farmers, causes extensive disturbance in the forest understorey (including in protected areas) by an extensive collection of firewood and collection of leaf litter as organic fertiliser.

It prefers dense, contiguous, undisturbed stands of grass and generally avoids drier, semi-open, short grassland habitat with scattered bushes.

The proposed construction of a large number of dams in the foothills of Arunachal Pradesh poses a significant threat to the species's grassland habitats (R. Das <em>in litt</em>. 2016). On the Brahmaputra Valley for example, increased levels of flooding due to watershed forest loss has lead to erosion of riverine grasslands (Collar <em>et al</em>. 2020). Most remaining habitat is subject to intense pressure from further drainage for agriculture, human encroachment, excessive burning and cutting, domestic livestock-grazing, and, more locally, commercial forestry plantations. The political situation in Myanmar has largely precluded intensive surveys for the species.

Balasubramanian <em>in litt</em>. 2020). It shows a remarkable adaptability to urban environment and  was recorded nesting in a hole in a concrete building (Gadikar 2017). <br/><br/>The breeding season in the Eastern Ghats, India, extends from December to April (Santhoshkumar and Balasubramanian 2010). Nests are located in huge trees along streams and rivers; the preferred nesting trees include <em>Melia dubia</em>. Nest hole competition with parakeets and mynas was observed in the riparian habitat (Santhoshkumar and Balasubramanian 2010). During the breeding season, males frequently visit habitations to collect cattle dung, probably for plastering the nest hole (P. Balasubramanian <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The nest is solely sealed by the female using excreta, mud pellets and bark pieces provided by the male (Charde <em>et al</em>. 2011). The female lays 2-5 eggs, and the incubation period is 21 days followed  by a 45 day fledging period (Charde <em>et al</em>. 2011, Poonswad <em>et al.</em> 2013). In one study in central India, the date of female entry into the nest  was between 9<sup>th</sup> March and 2<sup>nd</sup> April.

The total nesting cycle lasted around 93 days with 1 to 3 chicks fledging (Charde <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Ghats, the diet includes fruits (<em>Ficus </em>spp, <em>Diospyros montana</em> and <em>Vitex altissima</em>) and insects (Santhoshkumar and Balasubramanian 2014). The main food items in central India are fruits of&#160; <em>Ficus religiosa</em> and <em>F. benghalensis</em>, followed by <em>F. glomerata</em> and <em>F. lacor</em> (P. Balasubramanian <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Fruits of <em>Pithecelobium dulce</em>, <em>Manilkara hexandra</em>, <em>Syzygium cumini</em>, <em>Zizyphus mauritiana</em> and <em>Thevetia nerifolia</em> are also delivered by the male to the nest inmates (Charde <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is an important seed disperser of tree flora in the dry deciduous forests of Eastern Ghats; seeds dispersed by the hornbills showed very high germination efficiency (Santhoshkumar and Balasubramanian 2011).","Dry deciduous forest and riverine habitats, which are important for the species in the Eastern Ghats, are under high anthropogenic stress. In disturbed habitats, 65% of hornbill food species were not found.

It is found in areas with lush grass, reeds, tussocks and bushes along streams, around ponds and in <em>Alchemilla</em> bogs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>During the non-breeding season it is also found on dry ground among heaths and <em>Alchemilla</em> and adapts well to human-modified habitats such as lawns, shrubberies and thickets in parks and gardens (Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>. In urban areas it is attracted to feed in areas where the grass has been recently mown, and often occurs in ditches and drainage channels in grass (Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>. It has also been recorded in relatively sparse cover along polluted streams (Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>. It has been recorded foraging in open meadows, on bare mud and in shallow water (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong> Diet </strong>It has a wide diet, including seeds and aquatic insects (especially water beetles)<strong></strong>, as well as crustaceans, small snails<strong></strong> and earthworms (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong> <br/>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a pad of dead rushes on wet ground among high rushes, in rushes over water, or in grass tussocks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>A clutch usually consists of four or five eggs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","Although it can survive in heavily grazed and highly disturbed wet pasture, intensive grazing and mowing for building material, throughout the densely populated highlands, may be the cause of its apparent population reduction (Ash and Gullick 1989)<strong></strong> owing to loss of vegetation cover making habitats unsuitable for use by the species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. In addition, grasslands are being converted to cereal fields, and droughts are likely to have had a negative effect on the species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Uncontrolled developmental projects in Eritrea may be the cause of its scarcity there by causing habitat destruction and modification (R. Teklay <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><p></p>","Dodman (2006) estimated the population to number fewer than 10,000 individuals, and so it is placed here in the band 2,500-9,999 individuals. This equates to 1,667-6,666 mature individuals, rounded here to 1,500-7,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Rougetius rougetii</em> is widespread in the highlands of <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, and much less widespread in those of <strong>Eritrea</strong>, from 1,500 to 4,100 m (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986; Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>. It appears to have maintained its distribution but to have suffered a reduction in numbers (Ash and Gullick 1989; EWNHS 1996)<strong></strong>. Thus, during field surveys of Important Bird Areas in Ethiopia (1995-1996), it was considered uncommon or present only in small numbers at seven sites, and not uncommon or fairly common at two sites (EWNHS 1996)<strong></strong>. This contrasts with earlier records which refer to the species as widespread and common to locally abundant (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>.

Nesting has been observed in July (Rabenandrasana 2007)<strong></strong> and March (Langrand 1990)<strong></strong>, and juveniles have been found in December (I. Robertson <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong> and March (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Local knowledge suggests the species may be double-brooded (I. Robertson <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>, or it may have a very extended breeding season stretching from July to March (Rabenandrasana 2007)<strong></strong>. The majority of breeding observations between 2002 and 2006 occurred between the months of September and November (Rabenandrasana 2007)<strong></strong>.<strong> <br/>Habitat </strong>The species has been found in areas of dense, high, marginal vegetation in streams, lakes and marshes. It prefers gaps (e.g. pirogue channels) between high <em>Phragmites, Typha </em>and <em>Cyperus</em> beds where open water occurs with patches of short, mixed floating vegetation on which it forages (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Water-lilies <em>Nymphaea</em> appear to be particularly important (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996; Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>, but it also uses floating <em>Salvinia</em> spp., sedges, grasses and the invasive water-hyacinth<em> Eichhornia crassipes</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong>(P. B. Taylor <em>in litt. </em>1999)<strong></strong>. This also appears to be the habitat in which it breeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>The species may have been under-recorded in the past because it is very difficult to observe from the shore, since the hidden alcoves of floating vegetation that it frequents are difficult to access during the wet-season floods<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(I. Robertson <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. In addition, during the dry season there is some evidence that it hides in dense beds of <em>Phragmites</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong>(I. Robertson <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>, and it has been recorded in bushes and grass emerging from the water in a clearing of a flooded palm-covered valley (Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Diet </strong>Field observations at Lac Kinkony suggest the diet includes both crustaceans (found on the short sub-surface roots of <em>Salvinia</em> spp.) and invertebrates (spiders and insects) found on top of the floating vegetation (M. Rabenandrasana <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>.<strong> <br/>Breeding site </strong>One nest was found 50 cm above ground-level in <em>Typha </em>(Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>, another in a deep tunnel of <em>Phragmites</em>, 70 cm above the ground (Rabenandrasana 2007)<strong></strong>.<em> </em>Clutch size is 2-3 (Rabenandrasana <em>et al. </em>2009; Pruvot <em>et al.</em> 2018). Both males and females were observed incubating the nest, which was constructed in a dense mat of <em>Phragmites mauritianus. </em>Incubation lasted for 15-17 days, and juveniles were independent of their parents after 45 days (Pruvot <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160;<br/><strong> </strong> <p></p>","Wetland degradation is a cause of major concern for the species (Ramanampamonjy 1995)<strong></strong>. Like the threatened Madagascar Grebe <em>Tachybaptus pelzelnii</em>, it has probably been affected by the loss of fringing water-lily habitat, following the conversion of wetlands for rice cultivation (Rabenandrasana and Sama 2006)<strong></strong>, and by the impact of introduced fish (Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>. The species is also threatened by a reduction in the area of <em>Phragmites</em>, which may be due in part to cutting for human use, although this is not well understood and other factors may be involved (Rabenandrasana and Sama 2006)<strong></strong>. Lac Kinkony is highly threatened by the conversion of adjacent unprotected  land into rice paddies, and an estimated 80% of historical reed area  had been lost by 2008, with increased turbidity associated with erosion  the primary contributor to reed loss (Andriamasimanana and Rabarimanana  2011). Contrary to previous fears, the small size of this rail makes it an unlikely target for hunters<strong></strong>, and in some areas at least the species is taboo and the eggs not collected<strong><sup> </sup></strong>( <strong></strong>M. Rabenandrasana <em>in litt</em>. 2003, I. Robertson <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Rice cultivation impinges on its native habitat (such as at Lac Kinkony), and the burning of marshland areas by farmers in the dry season also threatens the species, especially when these fires go unchecked<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(M. Rabenandrasana <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. At the Befojo site, the local fishing industry centred on the lakes may make it less likely that the lakes will be drained for rice cultivation, as is happening to wetlands across Madagascar (I. Robertson <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Disturbance by fishermen and people from local villages may pose a threat, and the potential effects of other processes such as hydrological change or the effects of exotic fish or vegetation are uncertain (Rabenandrasana<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009). Cyclones can be a natural threat, as they disturb the habitat and so the species has to use less favourable habitats, which may expose them to other threats such as dog predation and human disturbance (Rabenandrasana <em>et al. </em>2009).<br/><p></p>","Survey results from 2003-2006 estimated a total of 215 individuals at five key sites, suggesting that the total population may not exceed 250 individuals (M. Rabenandrasana <em>in litt.</em> 2004; Rabenandrasana <em>et al.</em> 2009). However, this may be an underestimate as the surveys were brief and the methods were still being developed, thus the species is not necessarily absent at sites where it was not recorded, and the number of sightings is likely to indicate a larger population (R. Safford<em> in litt.</em> 2004). Therefore, the estimated population range used here is 250-999 mature individuals. The largest single population recorded so far is only 62 individuals (Rabenandrasana <em>et al. </em>2009).",Decreasing,"<em></em><em>Zapornia&#160;</em><em>olivieri</em> is known from several widely separated areas in lowland western <strong>Madagascar</strong>, and is rare and localised. Specimens were taken in 1930 and 1962 (Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>, and all records since have been field sightings: at Lake Bemamba a single bird seen in 1995 (Ramanampamonjy 1995)<strong></strong> and an adult in 1999 (P. B. Taylor <em>in litt. </em>1999)<strong></strong>; two individual adults at Amboropotsy Marsh (near Bekopaka) in 2001 (Willard and Goodman 2002)<strong></strong>; a pair with young and two other adults at Lac Ampandra (near Bejofo-Antanandava) in 2002 (I. Robertson <em>in litt</em>. 2003),<strong></strong>  and two adults (probably a pair) observed over several days at Lac  Kinkony (south-west of Mahajanga) in 2003 (M. Rabenandrasana <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>.  Surveys of potential sites in western Madagascan wetlands between the  Betsiboka and Mangoky rivers from August  2003 to November 2006 found  the species at five sites: Lac Kinkony, Lac Ampandra, Lac Amparihy, Lac Sahapy and  Lac Mandrozo (Rabenandrasana <em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009). At each site the population was small (12–39 individuals, maximum count of 39 at Lac Amparihy) and the highest density was 20 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>; the total number of birds recorded was 100 and the population at the five sites was estimated at 215 individuals (Rabenandrasana <em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009). Birds were not recorded at potential sites in the south (Rabenandrasana and Sama 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, where they may be absent or populations may be close to extinction (M.<strong> </strong>Rabenandrasana <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>.  Based on these survey results the population may not exceed  250 individuals<strong></strong><strong></strong>.   This may be an underestimate, however, as the surveys were brief and  the methods were still being developed, thus the species is not  necessarily absent at sites where it was not recorded, and the number of  sightings is likely to indicate a larger population (R.

It feeds on small beetles, caterpillars, spiders and small seeds (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is monogamous and territorial. In Uganda there was some evidence of breeding activity in February-May (Mwambu 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and it may breed in March in the eastern DRC (Chapin 1953)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. At least two nests have been found in Rwanda; one in Rugezi Swamp and the other in Kabatwa Swamp in the Volcanoes National Park (Anon. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The latter was described as a small cup-shaped nest constructed from <em>Poa leptocrada</em> and other sedges, and perched in foliage 35 cm above the ground (C.

However, it is now better protected as it supplies water to the hydroelectric dam at Lake Bulera, which provides power to Kilagi (A. Plumptre<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Following power cuts in 2005-2006, the government has moved people away from the swamp to ensure the protection of this water supply (A. Plumptre<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Marsh habitat in Nyungwe Forest was formerly threatened by gold-mining, but by 1989 this threat had disappeared (Dowsett-Lemaire 1990)<strong></strong>. However, mining may now pose a threat to other wetland sites in its range (Kahindo <em>et al. </em>2017). In DRC, many parts of the range are densely settled and many montane marshes have been drained for cultivation or pasture (Sarmiento and Butynski 1997)<strong></strong>. In Burundi habitat at Mwokora is threatened by cutting for mats and thatching, and other valley swamps in Kibira National Park are threatened by encroaching agriculture (Anon. 2011b).

Its population size is inferred to be declining due to ongoing habitat degradation and predation by invasive American Mink. For these reasons, the species is listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It occurs in marshy steppe wetlands, where there are large patches of dense and tall (c.2&#160;m) rushbeds <em>Schoenoplectus</em> (<em>Scirpus</em>) <em>californicus</em>, usually surrounded by wet meadows with&#160;lush green grass, and associated with a permanent water body, such as a river, stream or lake (Mazar Barnett <em>et al</em>. 1998, A. Jaramillo <em>in litt</em>. 2000, Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003, Mazar Barnett <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It appears to leave sites with less favourable habitat during the winter, and some northerly post-breeding dispersal or possibly partial migration may occur, at least in southern populations (Mazar Barnett <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2014).","Intensive grazing by cattle and sheep has degraded wet grassland and marshes across much of the species's current and historic range, especially in the Tierra del Fuego steppe (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In surveys, the species was not recorded at sites that had been degraded through overgrazing (Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003, Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, de Miguel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Overgrazing continues to pose a threat at some localities where the species has been recorded, such as at El Zurdo, Santa Cruz (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, S. Imberti <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). However, two of the most important populations, at Estancias Brazo Norte and La Angostura, are currently managed appropriately with only light grazing (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Marshes at La Soledad and El Sosiego ranches are also subject only to light grazing (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Burning and harvesting of aquatic vegetation to promote spring growth and to produce hay for cattle may also be pressures<strong></strong>&#160;(Fjeldså 1988). These practices are now much less common than they were in the past (Blanco and Canevari 1995, Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014), but surveys in Santa Cruz found that the species's population density was negatively affected by habitat burning (de Miguel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Burning leads to a decreased density of rushes, making the habitat less favourable to the Austral Rail (de Miguel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>Water extraction for agriculture and other purposes, and modification of watercourses through canalisation and damming also negatively impact on wetlands (J. Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2000, 2003, Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003). Important populations at Estancia El Sosiego and near Punta Banderas, Parque Nacional Los Glaciares, would be flooded by the completion of two dams that are being constructed on the Río SantaCruz, affecting the natural outflow of Lago Argentino (de Miguel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>Habitat in Central Chile, where the species was recorded historically, has been degraded via firewood extraction and conversion to agriculture (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Any further development of further intensive agriculture in suitable river valleys is likely to involve irrigation and wetland drainage and thus the loss of wetland habitat (Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003).<br/><br/>The species is also threatened by invasive American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>, which may have played a role in the species's decline (Fraga 2000, Mazar Barnett <em>et al. </em>2014). The mink is present in northern&#160;Magallanes and&#160;Santa Cruz, including in some river basins inhabited by the Austral Rail, and its range is expanding (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Roesler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Fasola and Roesler 2016). Surveys in Santa Cruz found that the species's population density and site occupancy were negatively affected by the presence of mink (de Miguel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).","The species's population size is poorly known, but given that there were no documented records from 1959 to 1998, it is likely to be rare. It is fairly common at a handful of sites, with no known locality holding a population of more than c.35 individuals (Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, 2014,&#160;<strong></strong>Imberti and Mazar Barnett 1999).&#160;Extensive surveys carried out between 1998 and 2006 at 58 wetlands distributed over an area of c.700,000 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;detected a maximum of 175 individuals in total, at 22 localities that collectively held approximately 85 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of habitat&#160;(Mazar Barnett&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2014). Surveys in Santa Cruz in 2009-2013 detected at least one individual at each of two more localities (Roesler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Given the difficulty of detecting the species, there are likely to be undetected individuals. Nevertheless, the total population size is very unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, and could plausibly be less than 2,500 mature individuals (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014), so it&#160;is here placed in the band 1,000-9,999 mature individuals, with a best estimate in the range 2,500 - 9,999 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The subpopulation structure is poorly known, but a record of a vagrant individual in the Falkland Islands indicates that the species is able to disperse over large distances, so there is likely to be a degree of connectivity between habitat fragments.

The species has been recorded historically in Tierra del Fuego, Buenos Aires, and Rio Negro, Santa Cruz and Chubut in Argentina, and in Valparaiso, Santiago, Colchagua, Llanquihue and Magallanes in Chile. It was previously known from just a few specimens and sight records, and since 1959, there were no documented records until the species was rediscovered in 1998, at&#160;Estancia La Angostura, Santa Cruz, Argentina (Mazar Barnett <em>et al.&#160;</em>1998).&#160;Further fieldwork in 1998-2006 recorded the species at a total of 21 localities in in Santa Cruz, Chubut, Buenos Aires and Rio Negro,&#160;Argentina, and in Magallanes (XII Region), Chile (Imberti and Mazar Barnett 1999, Imberti and Mazar Barnett 2003, Pugnali&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Soave&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Mazar Barnett <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Surveys in Santa Cruz in 2009-2013 detected the species at two more localities (Roesler <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Records from Buenos Aires, Rio Negro and the&#160;Valdes Peninsula were made outside the breeding season and may have represented migratory or vagrant individuals (Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Pugnali&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Mazar Barnett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160; A record from the&#160;Falkland Islands (Malvinas) is likely to have been a vagrant individual, suggesting a&#160;tendency to undergo long-distance movements (Pugnali&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).

Drainage has caused massive habitat loss on the Ubaté-Bogotá plateau,  and few suitably vegetated marshes remain because of pollution and  siltation. All major savanna wetlands are seriously threatened, mainly  by drainage, but also by agricultural encroachment, erosion, dyking,  eutrophication (caused by untreated sewage effluent and agrochemicals),  insecticides, tourism, hunting, burning, trampling by cattle, harvesting  of reeds, fluctuating water-levels and increased water demand. The  fringing habitat at Laguna de Tota has been reduced to less than 2 km<sup>2</sup>, and its continuing decay is reducing food availability (Varty<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span><em style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1986).

Major threats are related to small population size and reduced geographic range: its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 358 km² and area of occupancy (AOO) is 244 km². Furthermore, the disconnection of the habitat caused by the construction of the Varadouro Waterway in 1953 isolated the main populations and interrupted gene flow. Almost all currently known distributional range lies in officially protected areas, which are not completely protected from illegal selective logging. Using the lowest range of population size (as estimated by Nascimento <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011a), it is likely that there are up to 250 mature individuals in total and the number of mature individuals in each population is not greater than 50. Thus, the species is assessed as Endangered.","Envisaging future conservation management actions, habitat selection by <em>L. caissara</em> was investigated by comparing mainland and island groups (Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011). Island: Lowland Forest nonhydromorphic; inundated forest (várzeas/caxetais/brejos); sub-xeromorphic restinga (sandy soil forest) (Nascimento 2008, Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011, Ludwig 2011); Mainland: inundated forest (várzeas/caxetais/brejos); intermediate secondary vegetation; Lowland Forest; anthropic area; altered vegetation; submontane Forest; Lowland Forest hydromorphic; submontane Forest (up to 40 m) (Nascimento 2008, Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011). The species avoid submontane areas, and prefer lowland areas close to the sea level (Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011).&#160;The species has no tolerance for changes/disturbances in the environment because it uses predominantly mature forests and late successional stages with little altitudinal gap (Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011). The home range size of island groups ranges from 70 – 321 ha (Prado, 1999; Schmidlin, 2004, Ludwig 2011). Home range of mainland groups range from 130 up to 300 ha (Nascimento<em> et al. </em>2011b; Nascimento <em>et al</em>. 2014; Nascimento 2014). Groups in the continent use a higher number and a wider variety of sleeping sites than insular groups (Nascimento<em> et al</em>. 2011b; Nascimento 2014), which rely exclusively on tree holes as shelters (Prado 1999, Ludwig 2011).&#160;The support capacity of a population is about 700 individuals, and when considering potential areas for conservationist management, this limit can reach approximately 1,500 (Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011). These numbers of population sizes are apparently unable to maintain a viable population. They also emphasize the importance of conservation management actions and studies addressing genetics, as well as ecological / evolutionary issues in <em>L. caissara</em> (Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011). The Black-faced Lion Tamarin is a frugivorous-faunivorous species. Although animals feed mainly on plant (fruits, exudates, flowers and nectar), and animal food items (frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects), they also eat fungi (Prado 1999, Kierulff <em>et al.</em> 2002, Prado and Valladares-Padua 2004, Ludwig 2011, Oliveira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).","This species is threatened mainly by disconnection of its habitat, habitat reduction, loss and degradation of the habitat, urban expansion, reduced protection in its distributional area, disarticulation between environmental agencies and unplanned ecotourism (Moro-Rios <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite the fact that most of the known distribution is protected in Integral Protection Conservation Units, these areas have low inspection and the species have a restricted distribution and low population density. Therefore, effective conservation programs are essential to protect the species.","Methodological differences certainly account for the inconsistencies in population estimates. While Lorini and Persson (1994) estimated a total population not exceeding 260 animals, Nascimento<em> et al. </em>(2011a) reported 392 individuals. If one considers 400 as the total population, there would be about 160 mature individuals, with groups encompassing one or two adult males (A.T.A. Nascimento, personal communication). Group size averages 4.85 (n = 7 and ranges from two to nine individuals (Nascimento <em>et al. </em>2014; Martins<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2015). Even considering the highest population estimates, it is likely that there are no more than 250 mature individuals. Population densities are in the order of eight individuals/km² and seven individuals/km² in Superagui Island (by different methods) (Ludwig 2011) and 1.79 individuals/km² (95% CI 0.69–4.69) (Nascimento <em>et al</em>. 2011a). Population trend: In decline. Studies carried out by Lorini and Persson (1994) and Nascimento <em>et al.</em> (2011a) have similar estimates, with estimated values ​​in 1994 within the confidence interval presented in 2011. Signals of population loss as well as a decrease in genetic diversity on the island and mainland were recorded by using microsatellite genotyping (Martins <em>et al</em>. 2011). An update of population estimates is needed, because data presented by Nascimento <em>et al</em>. (2011a) were collected between 2000 and 2001. More studies of population density should focus on the mainland and regard the habitat heterogeneity between the island and continent (A.T.A. Nascimento, personal communication; Nascimento and Schmidlin 2011).",Decreasing,"The Black-faced Lion Tamarin is endemic to Brazil, occurring in the states of Paraná and São Paulo, where it is resident and native (Lorini and Persson 1994, Kierulff <em>et al. </em>2008). The species occupies the southernmost limits of the distribution of the callitrichids in the Atlantic Forest (Rylands <em>et al</em>. 2002). There are at least two main populations: insular (Superagui Island, Guaraqueçaba/PR) and continental (Ariri in Cananeia/SP; Rio Sebuí Valley and Sebuí region, in Guaraqueçaba/PR). The distribution is limited in the north by the Rio Varadorzinho, and in the west by the Serra da Utinga, Morro do Bico Torto, Morro do Poruquara and Serra do Gigante (Persson and Lorini 1991, 1993). Martuscelli and Rodrigues (1992) reported four localities in the extreme south-east of São Paulo, two in the basin of the Rio do Turvo (Rio do Turvo and Morro do Teixeira) and two further north in the region of Itapitangui. Valladares-Padua <em>et al.</em> (2000) reported the species between the villages of Ariri and Taquari, in the municipality of Cananeia, and suggested that its range may extend only a short distance to the north.

Despite efforts in surveys by IPÊ Institution in studying the distribution across the continental region in 2000 (Valladares-Padua<em> et al.</em> 2000; Prado <em>et al.</em> 2003), the low density registered (1.79 individuals/km²) (Nascimento <em>et al.</em> 2011a) and the small size of the species makes it cryptic and difficult to record. Therefore, it is necessary for more surveys to be carried out on the distribution in the continental region, like Serra do Mar in Ribeira Valley.<br/><br/>There is no indication that the current distribution is reduced compared to that in the past.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (estimated from the available records, adjusted to the biogeographic limits of its distribution [e.g., rivers, coastline], and/or as suggested by experts), is 358 km² (CPB/ICMBio, in prep.); the known area of occupancy (AOO) is 244 km² (Schmidlin 2004).",,Terrestrial,"National Red List Category from the Previous Assessment: CR - C2a(i); E.
