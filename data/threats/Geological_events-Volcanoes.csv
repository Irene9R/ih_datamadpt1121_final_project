1414375,174472,Conolophus marthae,Critically Endangered,"B1ab(iii,v)+2ab(iii,v); C2a(ii)",2012,2012-02-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"A single wild population of the Galápagos Pink Land Iguana exists and is limited to a range less than 25 km² with a core area less than 10 km². The population of this iguana is very small (192 mature individuals) and prone to genetic, demographic, and environmental stochasticity. Population trends are unknown but there is genetic evidence of past reduction and current juvenile recruitment has not been observed. Black Rats and feral cats are present in the range and are likely predators, as is known for other Galápagos iguanas. The presence of ectoparasites and possible endoparasites is a potential concern and its impact on population fitness is unknown. Hybridization and introgression between <em>C. marthae</em> and <em>C. subcristatus</em> has occurred in the past on Volcán Wolf, the extent and effect of which has not been fully evaluated yet. Volcanic eruptions and periodic droughts may also impact this species.","The Galápagos Pink Land Iguana (<em>Conolophus marthae</em>) is found coexisting with a subpopulation of Galápagos Land Iguana<em> </em>(<em>Conolophus subcristatus</em>) on Volcán Wolf. Altitudinal shifts along the slopes of the volcano imply different environmental conditions, which ultimately are reflected by different types of vegetation. The habitat includes tropical dry shrubland at the top of the volcano and tropical dry forest along the slopes. Vegetation at the highest altitudes may be impacted by droughts. The head nodding behaviour of <em>C. marthae</em> is very distinctive and completely different from <em>C. subcristatus</em> and may be a barrier to hybridization.<br/><br/>                  Basic reproductive biology of this iguana is unknown. In late spring 2010, a few <em>C. marthae</em> females were observed carrying 4-7 eggs in their follicles, investigated by a portable ultrasound machine (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011). These data would indicate a much smaller clutch size than for the geographically closest population of <em>C. subcristatus</em> on Fernandina Island (7-23 eggs, Werner 1982). It is still unclear whether <em>C. marthae</em> and <em>C. subcristatus</em> have overlapping reproductive seasons and if the two species may compete for nesting sites on Volcán Wolf; the location of these nests is unknown.<br/><br/>               Average snout-to-vent length (SVL) of animals observed is 46.8 cm, males being significantly larger than females. The SVL of the smallest male Galápagos Pink Land Iguana captured was 37.3 cm, a size that broadly corresponds to the SVL in seven-year old Galápagos Land Iguana individuals (37.5 cm ± 6.0 SD) from Santa Cruz, and even older individuals from Plaza Sur.","<span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB"">                      <p>The population of Galápagos Pink Land Iguana is extremely small and prone to both demographic and genetic stochasticity, as well as environmental stochasticity (volcanic eruptions, droughts).</p>    <p>Because of the overlapping range with Galápagos Land Iguana, hybridization may occur, generating introgression between <em>C. marthae</em> and <em>C. subcristatus</em> on Volcán Wolf. Although there is no evidence of living F1 hybrids at present, DNA evidence shows that rare events of hybridization have occurred, though the severity of subsequent introgression has not been fully evaluated yet (Gentile <em>et al</em>. 2009, Fulvo 2010).&#160; Because the population is so small, rare events of hybridization may have a significant effect on the species.</p>    <p>In addition to the Galápagos Hawk (<em>Buteo galapagoensis</em>), the only native predator of Galápagos Pink Land Iguanas on Volcán Wolf, <a name=""OLE_LINK1"">invasive alien </a>Black Rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) and feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are potential predators of eggs and hatchlings. It is known that feral cats prey on Galápagos Land Iguanas up to three and four years old. Animals in this age class represent a size that has not been found among Pink Iguanas. Therefore, it is suspected that feral cats pose a significant threat to population recruitment in Galápagos Pink Land Iguanas.</p>    <p>Volcán Wolf is an active volcano, with several eruptions recorded in the last century, most recently in 1982. Most recent lava is found on the eastern and southern sides of the volcano and in the caldera (Geist <em>et al</em>. 2005). Eruptions may have caused local extinctions of populations of <em>C. subcristatus</em> in the past, for example, Volcán Chico (on the eastern side of Volcán Sierra Negra) in 1979 (Snell <em>et al</em>. 1984).</p>    <p>               Droughts may be severe on the top of Volcán Wolf. Although adults are expected to cope fairly well with drought since they obtain water from consumed plants, the resultant scarcity of food may potentially cause aborted reproduction for the year due to a combination of lack of egg laying, a higher number of infertile eggs laid, and poor juvenile survival.</p><p><br/></p><p>                  Ectoparasite load is high in both Galápagos Land Iguanas and Pink Iguanas on Volcán Wolf. In fact, the location is characterized by a massive occurrence of ticks, which are much more abundant in Volcán Wolf than elsewhere in the archipelago. Both <em>C. marthae</em> and the <em>C. subcristatus</em> populations from Volcán Wolf show an unbalanced leukocyte formula compared to other populations of land iguanas from the whole archipelago. This could be related to the presence of ticks, but could also indicate a possible endoparasitic infection affecting most individuals (Fulvo 2010). This issue and how it might effect the fitness of the two populations is under investigation.&#160;    </p>    <br/>There is no current or known historic human use or trade of this species.</span>","<p>A single wild population of Galápagos Pink Land Iguana exists and it is not found <em>ex situ</em>. Recently, the effective population size (<em>N</em><sub>e</sub>) has been estimated as large as 41.21 individuals (95% CL = 30.71-67.97) by using microsatellite data (9 loci)  (Fulvo 2010). Mark-recapture data, by applying the Lincoln-Petersen method from two contiguous temporal samples in 2009 and 2010 (percentage of recapture = 53%), would indicate 192 adult individuals (95% CL = 155-260). Sex ratio estimated from samples collected in May 2009 was one male to 0.59 females and one male to 0.51 females in July 2010 (Gentile and Fulvo 2011).</p>    Past and future population trends are impossible to assess due to the lack of a sufficiently long series of estimates of population size. Monomorphism for a single mitochondrial DNA haplotype in a sample of 102 iguanas strongly suggests that the Galápagos Pink Land Iguana might have suffered severe demographic contractions in the past (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011). From 2005 to 2011, 133 adult individuals were captured and permanently marked with brands and Passive Integrated Transponders, representing nearly all observed Pink Iguanas (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011). During these surveys, no juveniles were observed, suggesting population recruitment appears to be non-effective.",Unknown,"The Galápagos Pink Land Iguana is a recently described species endemic to Volcán Wolf, a single location on Isla Isabela. Based on direct observations (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011) and reports of the Galápagos National Park surveys, this iguana has never been observed outside an area larger than 25 km²<sup></sup>. The maximum area surrounding the geographic capture points of all individuals observed to date is 10.9 km², with more than 95% of observations clustering in a much smaller area (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2011). The iguana occurs along the northern slopes of the volcano, in an area ranging from 600-1,700 m asl. There may be a seasonal shift in altitude with Pink Iguanas concentrating at the crater rim at 1,700 m during the months of May-July and descending down to 600 m when vegetation starts drying out. This iguana has not been seen inside the caldera.",There is no current or known historic human use or trade of this species.,Terrestrial,"<p>All species of Galápagos Land Iguanas (<em>Conolophus</em> spp.) are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The known geographic range of Galápagos Pink Land Iguana is within the Galápagos National Park, the legal authority governing and protecting biological diversity of the Galápagos Islands. The Land Iguanas are included in the Management of Native and Endemic Species Program, as part of the Management Plan of the Galápagos National Park.</p>    The Galápagos National Park undertakes major campaigns to control and eradicate invasive alien species in the Galápagos, including on Volcán Wolf. Such actions have so far successfully prevented habitat disturbance by feral goats in northern Isabela and promoted habitat restoration of southern Isabela. In the early 2000s, a three-year programme to eradicate feral cats from the island of Baltra (where <em>C. subcristatus</em> was repatriated from 1991 onwards) was effective by initially poisoning with sodium monofluoroacetate (compound 1080), then trapping or shooting the remaining cats (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2005). However, the applicability of this protocol on Volcán Wolf is questionable due to the difficult terrain and is likely impossible for an island as large as Isla Isabela, an area of 4,588 km²<sup></sup> (Nogales <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160; Further evaluation of the feral cat population on Volcán Wolf is needed for the purpose of implementing a programme for their control.<br/><br/>Based on successful programmes for the populations of <em>C. subcristatus</em> from Bahía Cartago (Isabela), Santa Cruz, and Baltra islands (Snell <em>et al</em>. 1984), the National Park is also considering a captive-breeding programme for <em>C. marthae</em>. The University Tor Vergata (Rome, Italy) is actively assisting the Park in this regard.  <br/><br/>The Galápagos Pink Land Iguana is not in contact with humans in Galápagos except for the purpose of scientific investigation and management. The Galápagos National Park does not envision a plan to include Volcán Wolf in the list of touristic sites nor other possible intrusions to the population. Nevertheless, as the species is endemic and has a very limited distribution, the National Park has added a specific educational module focused on this species in the courses aimed at training and updating nature guides. This training ensures proper information is conveyed to visiting tourists. <br/><br/>Information on the population biology and ecology of Pink Iguanas is very limited and research has begun. Research needs include monitoring of population and habitat trends, diet analysis, and in-depth study of the reproductive biology of this species. Clarifying the frequency of hybridization and level of genetic introgression between <em>C. marthae</em> and <em>C. subcristatus</em> is urgently needed. Additionally, the health status of the population should be monitored and the possible impact of a high parasite load on the fitness of the population should be investigated.<br/><br/>&#160;<span class=""hps"">Additionally, in the event <span class=""hps"">a <span class=""hps"">captive breeding <span class=""hps"">programme is started, the Galápagos National Park, in collaboration <span class=""hps"">with the University <span class=""hps"">Tor <span class=""hps"">Vergata, will <span class=""hps"">develop <span class=""hps"">an education programme for local people and tourists.  It is extremely difficult and expensive to access the study area. The need to transport equipment to and from the site limits the duration of research trips and consequently the extent of research that can be conducted on any one trip. The construction of a small low-impact, temporary field structure near the top of volcano would greatly help by allowing longer field trips and more effective research work and monitoring.&#160;</span></span></span></span>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

A continuing habitat quality decline has been observed as a result of water pollution caused by urban, industrial  and agricultural discharges and run-off into the rivers. The Armería river is highly polluted with heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, and organic nutrients, and has undergone hydrological alterations as a result of  over-extraction of water resources for agricultural and domestic use.&#160;<br/><br/>With a best case scenario for area of occupancy (1,040 km<sup>2</sup>), extent of occurence (6,500 km<sup>2</sup>) and 10 known locations, the Bandfin Splitfin meets the threshold for Vulnerable (AOO: 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>; EOO: 20,000 km<sup>2</sup>; locations: 10), so therefore it is assessed Vulnerable.","Like all other&#160;<em>Allodontichthys</em>-species, the Bandfin Splitfin lives in clear riffles over substrates of gravel, rocks and boulders. It may occur in depths up to 1 m in pools, but generally prefers depths of less than 0.5 m. During the dry season, the currents are slight to moderate, but turbulent during the rest of the year. The only form of submersed vegetation associated with this species is green filamentous algae (Miller 2005).<br/><br/>Harro Hieronimus (1995) observed this species in March 1989 in the Río de la Lumbre near San Antonio on the border between Colima and Jalisco. He described the habitat as a narrow creek up to 1 m wide and 30 cm deep, with the ground made up of gravel, sand, rocks and silt, easily to whirl, and lots of foliage. The riverbed was shaded by large trees; the current slowly running over several steps of boulders and rocks. He found the Bandfin Splitfin hiding under rocks and boulders. Other fish species found at this site were <em>Ilyodon furcidens</em> and Guppys (<em>Poecilia reticulata</em>). The water parametres at 12:45 on March 21 were: temperature 19.5°C, conductivity 560 μS, pH 7.2, total hardness 15°dH and carbonate hardness 10°dH.","The species is mainly threatened by water pollution caused by urban, industrial and agricultural discharges and run-off into the ríos Armería and Coahuayana-basins. A recent study about the water quality of the Río Ayuquila-Tuxcacuesco-Armería system revealed mercury values above the permissible level and lead concentration close to the permissable level (Mancilla-Villa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). The whole system is heavily polluted with heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides and organic nutrients. It has also undergone hydrological alterations as a result of over-extraction of water resources for agricultural and domestic use and, as a result of it, the river is often dry at the river mouth, acting as an obstacle for migratory species (Martínez Rivera <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sugar cane production on the plain between Autlán de Navarro and El Grullo threatens the stocks in this area through pesticides and fertilisers. An additional threat for the Río Ayuquila is urban and industrial sewage from the towns of Autlán de Navarro and El Grullo, and for the ríos Colima and Salado from the towns of Colima and Cuauhtemoc.<br/><em></em>","From the affiliation to two separate river basins (Río Armería respectively Río Coahuayana), two subpopulations of the Bandfin Splitfin, (the Río Armería and the Río Salado subpopulation) can be distinguished. <br/><br/>According to the Río Armería subpopulation, stocks in the Río Ayuquila and some of its affluents recovered after the improvement of water quality from a sugar cane mill discharge near the town of Autlán, but these gains have been offset by population declines further downstream in the Río Armería and in rivers and creeks near Colima belonging to the Río Colima drainage (Lyons 2011). Furthermore, possible habitats in the upper ríos Ayuquila and Tuxcacuesco have become uninhabitable for this species due to dams (e.g. Presa las Piedras, Presa General Ramón Corona). Only one collection site above one dam, at the Arroyo San Pedro, is known. Due to its range and population declines in the lower section of the Río Armería, this subpopulation is regarded Vulnerable. <br/><br/>According to the Río Salado subpopulation, the declines observed in the Río Colima and its affluents can also be observed in this geographically close subpopulation. This subpopulation is much smaller, but includes two locations, so therefore it is regarded Endangered.",Decreasing,"The Bandfin Splitfin is endemic to the Mexican federal states of Jalisco and Colima and was originally described from the vicinity of Colima, probably from the Río Colima, Río Armería drainage. In following decades, it was also discovered in several affluents of the Río Armería and in one affluent of the Río Salado, Río Coahuayana drainage. Currently, its geographic range encompasses the Río Ayuquila (the name of the upper section of the Río Armería), the upper Río Armería to about its junction with the Río de la Lumbre (about 15km north-north-west of Colima)&#160;including the Río de la Lumbre itself, the Río Tuxcacuesco around its junction with the Río Ayuquila, one affluent in its headwaters (Arroyo San Pedro), and two main affluents of the Río Ayuquila (arroyos Ahuacapán and Manantlán), all from within the upper Río Armería drainage. It also occurs in the headwaters of the Río Colima, the Barranca de la Tía Barragana&#160;and Arroyo El Carrizal (Río Comala sources) around the town of Comala, middle Río Armería drainage.

With the exception of Baltra where the subpopulation had been extirpated, subpopulations were considered healthy three generations ago in the 1950s. Since that time, iguanas have been nearly extirpated from most of southern Isabela and Santa Cruz, and have declined in northern Isabela. Juveniles are rarely observed in these remaining nine locations due to continued predation by feral cats. Iguanas are small in number but relatively stable on Fernandina and Plaza Sur. They have increased again on the small islands of Baltra and Seymour Norte (likely to carrying capacity on the latter), due to conservation efforts. Overall, considering the assumed population (current and former) sizes on the larger islands, it is estimated the population has declined by at least 30% over the last three generations. A minimum estimate of 10–15% decline is projected during the future three generations, based on the presence of invasive alien predators in some subpopulations and impacting juvenile recruitment. The estimated extent of occurrence meets the Vulnerable threshold at 9,524 km<sup>2</sup> and the area of occupancy is crudely estimated to be 540 km<sup>2</sup>. Further research on fine-scale distribution is needed to clarify an accurate occupancy status of the subpopulations.","Galápagos Land Iguanas are found in dry areas with low growing shrubs and <em>Opuntia</em> cactus. They are known to eat at least 30 different plant species (Traveset <em>et al</em>. 2016) and are generally found where these plants occur. Iguanas have extremely limited access to fresh water and acquire most of their liquid from vegetation, primarily <em>Opuntia</em> (Jackson 1991, Switak 1998). Research strongly suggests they play a major role as a seed disperser and provide essential ecosystem services for the islands they occupy (Traveset <em>et al</em>. 2016). They travel comparatively long distances among iguana species, and are known to have contributed to revegetation of both native and non-native plants on Fernandina following volcanic eruptions (Hendrix 1981). They are primarily herbivorous but opportunistically feed on insects and carrion (Jackson 1991, Harper <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>On the older central islands (Santa Cruz, Plaza Sur, Seymour Norte, and Baltra), both arid regions and iguanas are found at low, near sea level elevations (Snell and Tracy 1985). However, western subpopulations are found at low and high elevations, including the slopes of active volcanos on Fernandina and Isabela. On Fernandina, iguanas are known to migrate approximately 10 km up to the edge of the crater at 1,500 m, then descend to nest within the caldera (de Roy 1995). Several females have been observed digging nests on the eastern and western sides, inside Isabela's Wolf Volcano caldera (G. Gentile pers. obs. 2012). It is hypothesized that fumaroles from volcanic activity help to incubate the eggs (Werner 1982, 1983). In general, iguanas build shallow burrows in soft soil, or use spaces under rocks as retreats that they defend (Carpenter 1969). Exact home ranges are unknown; however, males are reported to have larger territories than females (Jackson 1991).<br/><br/>The reproductive season for Galápagos Land Iguanas varies dramatically between islands. Breeding season for Fernandina is June to July; Baltra and Plaza Sur iguanas breed during January and February; and the Cerro Dragón and Venecia subpopulations on Santa Cruz breed from August to October. On Isabela, the Wolf Volcano subpopulation females show a peak in gravidity in June, the Bahía Cartago subpopulation breeds during January and February, and the breeding season for other subpopulations is unknown (Costantini <em>et al</em>. 2009, G. Gentile unpublished data). Egg laying typically occurs two to three months after breeding before the beginning of the rainy season, with incubation ranging from 60–90 days. Clutch sizes are known to vary from 6–22 eggs (Werner 1983, Snell <em>et al</em>. 1984). Hatchlings emerge in a period of increasing scarcity of food which lasts until the rainy season of the next year (Snell and Tracy 1985). Juveniles are preyed on by native Racer snakes (<em>Pseudalsophis</em> spp.) and Galápagos Hawk (<em>Buteo galapagoensis</em>). During emergence in the Fernandina crater, hawks are observed to gather and prey heavily on new hatchlings.<br/><br/>Male Galápagos Land Iguanas average 47–51 cm in snout-to-vent length (SVL) and weigh 4–7 kg; females are 42–47 cm SVL and 3–5 kg. The population on Plaza Sur is much smaller with an average 41 cm SVL and 3 kg for males, and 36 cm SVL and weigh 2 kg for females (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2019). Maximums are reported at 60 cm SVL and 12 kg (Márquez <em>et al</em>. 2010). These iguanas are expected to be reproductively mature at 5–7 years and remain so throughout their lifetime until <em>ca</em> 40 years or longer (Werner 1982, Fabiani <em>et al</em>. 2011). Their estimated generation length is therefore 22.5–23.5 years.<br/><br/>The Galápagos Land Iguana is known to occasionally hybridize with the Santa Cruz Marine Iguana (<em>Amblyrhynchus cristatus</em>) on Plaza Sur, generating no introgression (Rassmann <em>et al</em>. 1997, Di Giambattista and Gentile 2014). This island has an unusual topography that allows contact between the two species, whereas their habitats normally do not overlap. A hybrid that was first marked in 1993 was recaptured in 2013, extending the previous longevity record for hybrids by 10 years (H. Snell pers. comm. 2014). Di Giambattista <em>et al</em>. (2018) investigated the level of hybridization between the Galápagos Land Iguana and the Galápagos Pink Land Iguana using a large set of microsatellite markers. Results indicated strong differentiation between the two species and, while hybridization in the past cannot be ruled out, there is no evidence of ongoing hybridization between them.","Previously widespread throughout the archipelago, anthropogenic activities since the 1700s have led to major population declines of Galápagos Land Iguanas on Isabela and Santa Cruz, and extinctions on Baltra, Rábida, and Santiago (Cayot 2008, Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2008, Fabiani <em>et al</em>. 2011). They were likely hunted by man for food in the past, but the predominant threat persisting over the last 100 years has been from invasive alien mammals including feral dogs, cats, pigs, goats, and donkeys (<em>Equus asinus</em>). Feral dogs have been the most harmful as they are capable of killing large adults and were responsible for the near extirpation of subpopulations on Santa Cruz and Isabela in the 1970s (Cayot 2008, Márquez B. <em>et. al</em>. 2010). Grazing mammals are competitors as they degrade essential vegetation, as well as trampling and destroying nests. Pigs are also known to dig up nests and consume iguana eggs. Goats, dogs, cats, and the construction of a military airbase on Baltra resulted in the complete extirpation of those iguanas by 1954 (Snell <em>et al</em>. 1984, Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2005, Cayot 2008).<br/><br/>Today, feral dogs, pigs, goats, and donkeys have been greatly reduced and completely eliminated on a number of islands (Cruz <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2009). However, feral cats remain a strong threat, are widespread on Isabela and Santa Cruz, and prey heavily on juveniles up to two years of age (Márquez B.<em> et al</em>. 2010, Gentile <em>et al</em>. 2016). Cats severely affect recruitment and population structure within seven of the 11 subpopulations. Minimal cat control is underway on both islands; however, it is not enough to protect iguanas and it is estimated that some subpopulations are ageing and currently declining as a result. Recent research on two Isabela subpopulations (Bahía Cartago and Urbina) may illustrate severe juvenile predation from feral cats, since only 0.89% of the iguanas sampled (n = 244) were juveniles (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In addition, all islands apart from Fernandina, Seymour Norte, and Plaza Sur have introduced alien rats, primarily Black Rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) and Santa Cruz also has Norway Rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>; Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). Rats likely pose the most significant threat to hatchling iguanas where other food sources for the rats are scarce, as on small islands and in areas of sparse vegetation (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994, Gentile <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Volcanic eruptions pose a significant stochastic threat for iguanas on Fernandina and Isabela, particularly the former where females are known to nest inside the crater and large mortality events have been documented (de Roy 1995). It is believed a subpopulation in southern Isabela was destroyed due to the eruption of Volcán Chico in 1979 (Snell <em>et al</em>. 1984). Many of the volcanoes in the Galápagos archipelago are still very active; the most recent eruption was in June 2018 on Fernandina (Vasconez <em>et al</em>. 2018).","For all but four locations, the most current population estimates are known from 2002–2008 and suggested the entire population of Galápagos Land Iguanas was 11,581 (range 8,618–17,917), with the largest and most dense population found on Seymour Norte (1.9 km<sup>2</sup>; Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010). This study did not include the small introduced population on Venecia (Santa Cruz), that was later estimated to be <em>ca</em> 200 adults (Fabiani <em>et al</em>. 2011). No population estimate is available for Bahía Elizabeth or Cerro Ballena (north and south Isabela, respectively). Juveniles are only found on Baltra, Seymour Norte, Plaza Sur, and Bahía Cartago (southern Isabela), strongly suggesting predation pressure by feral cats elsewhere. Assuming a conservative 10–15% composition of juveniles (including on Fernandina, which was not noted by the surveyors but does not have cats), the number of adults is estimated to be less than 10,000. Except for Plaza Sur and Fernandina, the sex ratio is biased toward males (Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010). The overall population trend is not known, however, these factors indicate a decline.<br/><br/>Galápagos Land Iguanas were introduced to Seymour Norte from Baltra in 1932–1933, but by the 1980s it appeared there had been no recruitment and the population consisted of ageing adults (Snell <em>et al</em>. 1984). Several poorly documented translocations are known to have occurred in the 1970s and 1980s, and after strong rainfall during El Niño events in 1982–83, juveniles were finally seen on the island (Cayot and Menoscal 1992). Today, it is arguable the carrying capacity has been surpassed, as there are signs of degraded Galápagos Prickly Pear (<em>Opuntia</em> sp.) that is a primary food source on Seymour Norte (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2019). The most recent population estimate indicates 7,581 iguanas total (range 3,555–16,169; Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2019). This estimate also noted 28.6% of the total consisted of juveniles, indicating a recent high reproductive output that is known to fluctuate with annual rainfall or droughts. The number of mature adults on Seymour Norte was estimated to be 5,413, before 2,150 iguanas were removed for the reintroduction to Santiago. It is too soon to assess the survival or establishment of these iguanas on Santiago, and are not included in this assessment.<br/><br/>The second largest subpopulation is found at Bahía Cartago, southern Isabela, and estimated to be 2,600 iguanas total (range 1,800–3,200; Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010). Galápagos Land Iguanas were once found in many locations in southern Isabela but were eliminated, primarily by feral dogs over the last three generations (<em>ca</em> 1950 to present). The last group of 37 iguanas were rescued from Bahía Cartago in 1976 and held in captivity on Santa Cruz before dogs were eradicated in 1982 and iguanas reintroduced (Werner 1984, Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2008). Juveniles are observed in this location because feral cats are controlled by trapping every two years (Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010). There is also a very small adult-only population remaining at Cerro Ballena on the southeastern coast (G. Gentile pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>In northern Isabela, iguana subpopulations are isolated from each other by vast lava flows with no vegetation (Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2008). The number of iguanas in each of five subpopulations range from a low of 140, to the most at 1,600. The total adult estimate for northern Isabela is 2,276 iguanas (range 1,955–4,527; Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010). An analysis of historical data suggests a decreasing trend, since 0% of surveyed iguanas were juveniles in the years 2004, 2006, and 2013, and only 3% in 2012 (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>On Fernandina, iguanas do not occur across the entire island, rather they are concentrated near the crater, crater rim, and the western flank of the volcano, where there is sparse to thick vegetation (Werner 1982, 1983). There are 751 total iguanas estimated on Fernandina (range 680–1,236; Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010). This subpopulation may be stable as there are no invasive alien species present, however, reproduction and female mortality is known to fluctuate due to volcanic eruptions every 10–15 years (de Roy 1995). Genetically, the Fernandina and Isabela populations are similar, have the highest diversity, and are distinct from iguanas in the central islands (Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2008, Gentile <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>A dense and stable population of iguanas are found on the small island of Plaza Sur (0.14 km<sup>2</sup>). There are no invasive mammals on this island since a small group of feral goats were eradicated (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012), and iguanas are found in all age classes. An estimate in 2002 calculated 380 total iguanas (range 230–595; Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Populations on Santa Cruz saw dramatic reductions in the 1970s due to feral dog attacks and predation by feral cats and pigs. The population of Bahía Conway and Cerro Dragón alone was reduced from <em>ca</em> 1,000 iguanas to 56 in less than a year. These survivors were moved to a captive facility in southern Santa Cruz as well as introduced to Venecia, a tiny islet offshore from this subpopulation. Juvenile iguanas from Venecia have been moved back to Cerro Dragón at least three times after dogs were eradicated (Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2008, Fabiani <em>et al</em>. 2011). The most current population estimate for this remaining mainland subpopulation is 693 total iguanas (range 657–1,138; Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010). Habitat is severely limited on Venecia and the population of <em>ca</em> 200 adults is estimated to be at carrying capacity. Cats are also trapped every two years at Bahía Conway to improve juvenile recruitment, however, no juveniles have been observed at Cerro Dragón for the last two decades, likely due to the presence of feral cats (A. Llerena pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>The once healthy subpopulation on Baltra crashed to zero by 1954 due to the impacts of alien predators and competitors, and the construction of a large U.S. military base during World War II. Through captive breeding and translocations, iguanas were repatriated on Baltra in 1991 (Cayot and Menoscal 1992). By 2007, the population had rebounded to 781 total iguanas (range 433–1,298; Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic analysis has shown that the subpopulations on Baltra and Seymour Norte show a mixed ancestry, originating from both Isabela and Santa Cruz clades, that are most likely from the rescues at Bahía Cartago and Bahía Conway and a consequence of undocumented translocations in 1976–1977 (Hofkin <em>et al</em>. 2003, Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>With the exception of Baltra, subpopulations of Galápagos Land Iguanas were considered healthy in the 1950s, three generations ago. Since that time, iguanas have been nearly extirpated from most of southern Isabela and Santa Cruz, declined in northern Isabela from the impact of feral goats and cats, are relatively stable on Fernandina and Plaza Sur, and have increased on Baltra and Seymour Norte due to conservation interventions. Overall, considering the expected population (current and former) sizes on the large islands, it is estimated the population has declined by at least 30% over the last three generations (<em>ca</em> 69 years). A minimum estimate of 10–15% decline of older individuals is projected for the future three generations, based on the presence of invasive alien predators in some subpopulations and impacting juvenile recruitment.",Decreasing,"The Galápagos Land Iguana is found on several islands in the Galápagos Archipelago, Ecuador. They are resident on the islands of Isabela, Fernandina, Santa Cruz, and Plaza Sur; extirpated from Rábida (known from historic subfossils only); introduced on Seymour Norte in the 1930s and Venecia in 1977; and extirpated by 1954 then repatriated in 1991 on Baltra (Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2008, ITWG 2016). Iguanas were noted as numerous on Santiago by Darwin (1839) but extirpated by 1906, most likely due to predation, nest destruction, and competition from feral pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>), dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>), feral goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>), or man (Snell <em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 1984, Márquez <em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2010). Iguanas were reintroduced to Santiago in January 2019 from the Seymour Norte subpopulation (Anonymous 2019). The cause of extinction of the historical population on Rábida is unknown (Steadman <em>et al</em>. 1991).<br/><br/>Galápagos Land Iguanas have a varied distribution across the islands they occur on and are found from 0 to 1,707 m above sea level, with the highest elevation being on Wolf Volcano, Isabela (Onorati <em>et al</em>. 2017). They are generally found in arid to semi-vegetated regions of the islands (Werner 1983, Jackson 1991). Iguanas are distributed across the entirety of the small islands of Baltra, Plaza Sur, and Seymour Norte.<br/><br/>Once widespread on the large island of Isabela, they are now found in several isolated subpopulations, perhaps five, in northern Isabela. The only iguanas remaining in southern Isabela are the reintroduced subpopulation in Bahía Cartago and a very small remnant subpopulation in Cerro Ballena (Tzika<em> et al</em>. 2008, Márquez B. <em>et al</em>. 2010, G. Gentile pers. comm. 2019). On Santa Cruz, iguanas were also once widespread and are now isolated in subpopulations on the northwestern coast, including Bahía Conway, Cerro Dragón, and Venecia (Cayot 2008, Fabiani <em>et al</em>. 2011). On Fernandina, iguanas are most dense on the western flank of the island’s crater (Werner 1983).<br/><br/>Fine scale knowledge of the distribution of the species is unknown. The estimated extent of occurrence of the entire population is 9,524 km<sup>2</sup>. The area of occupancy using a 2x2 km gird cell overlay of the western clade is crudely estimated at 464 km<sup>2</sup> (Isabela 280 km<sup>2</sup> in seven subpopulations, western Fernandina 184 km<sup>2</sup>). The area of occupancy (AOO) in the central clade (Santa Cruz, Venecia, Plaza Sur, Seymour Norte, Baltra) is estimated at 76 km<sup>2</sup>. Further research on fine-scale distribution is needed to clarify an accurate occupancy status of the subpopulations.","Galápagos Land Iguanas are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Ecuador has never declared export of live specimens of <em>Conolophus subcristatus</em> for commercial trade (CITES trade data, UNEP-WCMC 2018), however, they are known to exist in the pet trade. Four smuggling cases with prosecutions occurred between 2010 and 2015 (Auliya <em>et al</em>. 2016). Molecular tools were used to unambiguously assign and return the four iguanas to the origin subpopulation (Gentile <em>et al</em>. 2013). While not significantly reducing the population currently, their entry into the pet trade is of concern because it becomes easier to mask illegal extraction from the wild.",Terrestrial,"All populations of Galápagos Land Iguanas are included in all three protected area designations: Galápagos National Park and National Marine Reserve, Galápagos Islands Man and Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO), and Galápagos Islands World Heritage Site.<br/><br/>Several eradication programmes have occurred that benefit Galápagos Land Iguanas, including feral goats from Baltra, Plaza Sur, Santiago, and northern Isabela (separated from the south by a 10+ km-long lava isthmus; Carrion <em>et al</em>. 2011). Goats have been reduced, but not eliminated (T. Grant pers. obs. 2014) from northwestern Santa Cruz to protect the subpopulations of Bahía Conway and Cerro Dragón. Feral dogs were eradicated from Bahía Conway on Santa Cruz in the early 1980s to protect iguanas, and are also controlled to very low levels in southern Isabela (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). Feral cats have been eradicated from Baltra and Venecia, and Black Rats from Seymour Norte (Harper <em>et al</em>. 2011, Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). The impact of rats is less well understood; however, it was documented that an increased number of Marine Iguana hatchlings were observed following a nearly complete eradication of Black Rats from Pinzón in 1988 (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Multiple translocations of Galápagos Land Iguanas have occurred since 1932. During the Hancock Expedition (1932–33), <em>ca</em> 70 iguanas were captured from Baltra where they appeared to be malnourished, perhaps due to competition for food with introduced goats, and introduced to Seymour Norte where neither goats nor iguanas were present (Woram 1992, Cayot 2008). This experimental translocation later benefited the Baltra iguana population as they were eliminated from Baltra by 1954. Soon after the eradication of invasive mammals on Baltra, iguanas were reintroduced in 1991 (Cayot and Menoscal 1992).<br/><br/>Following the nearly complete decimation of the subpopulations at Bahía Conway (Santa Cruz) and Bahía Cartago (Isabela) by feral dogs in the mid-1970s, an iguana captive breeding programme was initiated by the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station (CDRS), and the surviving iguanas were transferred to the CDRS on Santa Cruz. In 1977, iguanas from the CDRS were introduced to Venecia, an islet off northwestern Santa Cruz, and since it lacked proper soil an artificial nesting site was constructed. Offspring from Venecia have subsequently been translocated to nearby Cerro Dragón (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994). Iguanas from the CDRS were also reintroduced back to Bahía Cartago, Isabela. The iguana breeding programme at the CDRS was discontinued in 2008 (Cayot 2008).<br/><br/>In January 2019, a group of 2,150 iguanas from Seymour Norte were reintroduced to Santiago, following the eradication of feral domestic pigs in 2001 (Anonymous 2019, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2019). If they survive and become established, this will potentially increase the area of occupancy for Galápagos Land Iguanas.<br/><br/>Conservation and research actions recommended for this species include an improved knowledge of population size and trends, distribution and habitat trends, and the impact of invasive species management. Further research and management discussions are needed concerning the results of molecular analysis by Tzika <em>et al</em>. (2008) that determined distinctions between western, central, and Plaza Sur populations, as well as individuals in the introduced Seymour Norte and Baltra populations showing a mix of Isabela and Santa Cruz ancestry due to poorly documented translocations. Additional studies of the Plaza Sur population are needed to better understand their genetic relationship within&#160;<em>C</em><em>onolophus</em>.

Regular monitoring in recent years at the Curug Cibeureum site (which is by far the best known subpopulation) has not normally found more than 10 mature individuals at a time. There appears to have been a major population decline before 1987, and the species has apparently disappeared above 2,000 m asl (Kusrini&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008); for example, it no longer occurs at Lebak Saat (2,500 m asl) in Mount Gede Pangrango National Park (Kusrini<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2017). Fieldwork conducted at Mount Halimun Salak in 2018 found just one individual (M. Kusrini pers. comm. December 2018).

This species fills the ecological niche occupied by&#160;<em>Eleutherodactylus martinicensis&#160;</em>at lower elevations. The eggs develop directly without a larval stage.  It has been found in disturbed areas, such as along access roads created to support the hydroelectric project in Parque Nacional Morne Trois Pitons.","On Dominica, the montane forests are largely inaccessible and secure due to the rugged topography of the area. However, there is some degradation taking place in the south of the island due to small-scale farming and selective logging.&#160;The effects of volcanic eruptions,&#160;which are inevitable (at least over extended periods), have the potential to inflict tremendous damage on habitats and wipe out multiple subpopulations (R. Powell pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>This species is broadly sympatric and syntopic at some sites with&#160;<em>E. martinicensis</em>. The potential for displacement in some of those areas needs to be investigated (especially if climate change allows&#160;<em>E. martinicensis</em>&#160;to colonize higher elevations). The introduction of non-native, invasive amphibians is an ongoing concern. Although an introduction of&#160;<em>E. johnstonei&#160;</em>on Dominica appears to have failed, the threat posed by a successful introduction of this extremely successful invader is unknown and monitoring should be ongoing (R. Powell pers. comm. 2020). During June 2018 and March 2019, more than 945 adult Cuban Treefrogs (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) and several adult Venezuelan Snouted Treefrogs (<em>Scinax x-signatus</em>) were observed&#160;at four sites (collectively) spread along the Caribbean and south coast of Dominica, within or near&#160;ports of entry (van den Burg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;It is thought that these introductions were associated with&#160;container shipments of hurricane relief supplies during the aftermath of&#160;Hurricane Maria (van den Burg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Should these introduced species become established on Dominica, they have the potential to out-compete this native frog (van den Burg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Predation is an additional concern in the case of the Cuban Treefrog (R.

However, it is a common and adaptable species, which likely occurs in more than ten locations and the population is not severely fragmented.","It occurs primarily in mesic lowland and montane forest, but has also been collected in highland savannas and dry forest. In Martinique, in general, the species abounds in cool and humid areas&#160;and becomes scarce in drier habitats (Dewynter 2018).&#160;It has also been found in disturbed habitats, such as banana plantations, sugar cane fields, gardens, and houses (Dewynter 2018). It is active on the ground, calling from soft, wet surfaces, but retreats to arboreal bromeliads. This species breeds by direct development, and the eggs are laid on the ground.","Although not seriously threatened, this species is affected by forest loss due to agriculture, small-scale logging, human settlement, and possibly also by pesticides.

While this species has not currently been confirmed outside of protected areas at present, it is expected to occur more widely outside of these areas which are under threat from ongoing habitat loss due to agriculture. The subpopulation in Galeras is also further under threat from the active volcano there.</span>","The species is very adapted to volcanic soils and vegetation, and occurs at the sub-páramo and páramo altitudinal level, as well as, in high-Andean forest (Rojas-R. and Gutierrez-C. 2006, 2008). Individuals are usually found under rocks or inside sparse vegetation. It has not been recorded from anthropogenic habitats and is unlikely to tolerate habitat disturbance. It breeds by direct development.","The entire known distribution currently occurs within protected areas. However, the subpopulation in Galeras is threatened somewhat by the active volcano, which regularly spews toxic gases and ash. The subpopulation in Santa Helena Natural Reserve (now&#160;Parque Nacional Natural Complejo Volcánico Doña Juana-Cascabel) is threatened by poppy plantations (M.A. Rojas-R. pers. comm. 2008). This species is also thought to occur more widely and possibly continuously in other páramos between the localities in Pasto. However, the relictual forests nearby where the species is currently found are surrounded by potato and poppy crops, and there is also livestock grazing in the region. These activities may threaten the habitat outside of protected areas by virtue of their expansion (M.A. Rojas-R. pers. comm. 2008), and it is likely that undiscovered subpopulations of this species could be threatened.","This species was reported as common in&#160;Santuario Fauna y Flora Galeras&#160;in the early 1980s (Lynch 1984). The species was found to be rare at&#160;Reserva Castelví in 2005 (J. Mueses-Cisneros unpubl. data 2016).

Therefore the current population estimate of 132 individuals is accurate a figure as can be obtained for this species. The population crash on Dominica between 2002-2004 resulted in near-extinction (decline of at least 80%) with population levels being extremely low such that the species was not detected during 2006-2010 and is now estimated to be around 100 individuals. The population crash on Montserrat between 2009-2010 has also resulted in a near-extinction (decline believed to be over 90%) of the species with an initial count of 4 individuals, which was reduced to only 2 individuals after 2011. Therefore the Mountain Chicken continues to be listed as Critically Endangered because of the major population decline that occurred on Montserrat in the last ten years (2007-2017), which is certainly over the 80% threshold required for this category. Furthermore,&#160;the number of mature individuals in each subpopulation is less than 50 and continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is inferred from ongoing threats.","This species lives in dense secondary vegetation which varies from new to old growth, ravines and hill forest. In Dominica, it is also found in plantations. It is terrestrial and nocturnal, hiding in burrows during the day in moist forest. It appears as though the animals are associated with certain soil types that allow the digging of nests. The eggs are laid in foam nests at the bottom of a burrow. The tadpoles (25-43 per nest) develop terrestrially in the nest, not in water. Both females and males guard the nest. The larvae feed on infertile eggs provided by the female.&#160;<br/><br/>Adult individuals are typically 16-17 cm in length, although they can grow to lengths over 20 cm and exceed 1,000g in weight (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2012 cited in Adams <em>et al.</em> 2014). While generation length has not been confirmed, it is estimated to be about three years which is based on the observed length of time this species takes to reach adult size (J. Dawson pers. comm. August 2017). Females tend to be larger than males, although both have similar colouration and patterning (Martin <em>et al</em>. 2007). Their diet consists of&#160;a wide range&#160;of&#160;insects,&#160;millipedes,&#160;spiders&#160;and&#160;land&#160;snails&#160;as well&#160;as&#160;vertebrates&#160;(tree&#160;frogs&#160;and&#160;snakes&#160;have&#160;been&#160; reported&#160;as&#160;food&#160;items;&#160;Brooks&#160;1982 in Martin <em>et al</em>. 2007).","Historically, this species was heavily consumed by humans and was prized for its meat (both subsistence and commercial use for tourists), which contributed to its decline. After the major population decline caused by chytridiomycosis in the early 2000s, a range-wide ban was put in place to stop the hunting of this species; however there may be some illegal hunting still taking place. Substantial habitat loss is also taking place over much of its range due to agriculture, human settlement and pressure from touristic development. On Montserrat, it is likely that subpopulations in the south of the island have been lost to lava flows from volcanic eruptions and subsequent ash fall. On Dominica, the habitat is under threat from expanding human settlements and agriculture (both subsistence and commercial farming), and other human development pressures (M. Hudson&#160;and J. Dawson pers. comm. July 2017).<br/><br/>The subpopulation on Dominica, where the species was once most abundant, declined catastrophically between 2002-2004, following a major confirmed outbreak of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. There is now some evidence of individuals surviving with&#160;<em>Bd</em>&#160;infections, but further research is required to&#160;fully understand this and is currently ongoing (M. Hudson&#160;pers. comm. July 2017). Between 2009-2010, the subpopulation on Montserrat declined from thousands of individuals to just four following an outbreak of&#160;<em>Bd</em>. Two of the individuals have subsequently disappeared, although it was not confirmed whether&#160;<em>Bd</em>&#160;was the cause, and the two remaining individuals on Montserrat both have histories of surviving&#160;<em>Bd</em>&#160;infection (M. Hudson&#160;pers. comm. July 2017).","This species might have been in decline on Montserrat since Cyclone Hugo in 1989 and the Soufriere volcanic eruption of 1995, but analysis of census data does not confirm this (J. Fa pers. comm.). However, since 1995 and until 2009, the population appeared to be stable from census surveys including both visual and aural encounter data (Hudson <em>et al</em>. 2016 - Scientific Reports). Historically it was found across the eastern Centre Hills of Montserrat however between 2009-2010, following the first detection of <em>Bd</em> on the island in 2009, the subpopulation underwent a catastrophic decline from thousands of individuals to just four (M. Hudson pers. comm. July 2017). Apart from three individuals recorded from Killikrankie in 2011, annual population monitoring transects have failed to detect them outside of the eastern slopes of the Centre Hills (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is now only known from two individuals from one site (M. Hudson pers. comm. July 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>On Dominica it was formerly abundant in suitable habitat (possibly until 2002), despite heavy exploitation for food (estimated annual harvest of 8,000-36,000 animals), but the population started to crash during 2002 with few individuals reported in 2003 (Hudson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016 - Scientific Reports). It was estimated that the subpopulation suffered a decline of greater than 85% during an 18 month period (2002-2004) due to chytridiomycosis.&#160;It was thought to be near extinction in 2006, and was not seen or recorded again until 2010 (M. Hudson pers. comm. August 2017). In the intervening years, surveys were sporadically done and a public campaign 'Have You Heard Me, Have You Seen Me' was running&#160;but there were&#160;no reports of the species (M. Hudson&#160;pers. comm. July 2017). Regular surveys,&#160;using standardised transects, began again in 2014 and are&#160;currently being&#160;carried out monthly (M. Hudson&#160;pers. comm. July 2017). The Dominican subpopulation is estimated to contain around 130 unique individuals (both adults and juveniles), captured since 2014, based on pit tag identification (M. Hudson&#160;pers. comm. July 2017).<br/><br/>The population is severely fragmented. It is known from 7-8 subpopulations, for which none of them contain over 30% of the whole population (adults and juveniles). The largest subpopulations are on Dominica and, of those, the two biggest subpopulations contain around 40-45% of the whole population and are separated by about 30 km (M. Hudson pers. comm. August 2017). While one or two of the smaller subpopulations may be connected, other are separated by a number of kilometres and it is unlikely that there is any dispersal or subsequent gene flow between them (M. Hudson pers. comm. August 2017).",Decreasing,"This species occurs on the western side of Dominica and in the Centre Hills of northern Montserrat, having been unsuccessfully introduced on Jamaica and Puerto Rico. It has apparently been extirpated from Guadeloupe, Martinique, and St Kitts, and might once also have occurred on St Lucia and Antigua. Its range is now restricted on Dominica to an area of around 40 km² and to less than 1 km² on Montserrat. It is a relatively low-altitude species on Dominica, occurring from sea level up to (rarely) 400 m asl. On Montserrat it is present from sea level to 430 m asl. Its extent of occurrence (EOO) is 1,568 km<sup>2 </sup>and its area of occupancy (AOO) is approximately 10 km<sup>2</sup>.","It has been widely heavily used for food at a subsistence, national and international level. There is a hunting ban in place on this species on both Montserrat and Dominica, however it is possible some illegal hunting still occurs. It&#160;was previously the national dish on Dominica however, as of 2016,&#160;it has now been replaced to try and further deter the demand for this species for subsistence.",Terrestrial,"<strong><em>Conservation Actions</em></strong><br/>This species occurs in Centre Hills protected area on Montserrat, but does not occur in any protected areas in Dominica. Fifty individuals were removed from the Montserrat subpopulation during the 2009-2010 decline for captive breeding in zoo institutions. An anti-fungal treatment was trialed on the remaining individuals, the world's first trial on a wild population, which was found to be successful in the short-term but not feasible in the long-term (Hudson <em>et al</em>. 2016 - Biological Conservation). The Mountain Chicken Recovery Programme (MCRP) was started in 2008, and currently consists of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Zoological Society of London (ZSL), Chester Zoo, Norden's Ark, Paignton Zoo and the governments of Montserrat and the Commonwealth of Dominica. The MCRP undertakes all conservation actions which are guided by a 20 year long-term recovery plan (Adams <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are also captive, biosecure populations&#160;at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust&#160;on&#160;Jersey (Montserrat origin), ZSL, Chester Zoo and&#160;Norden's Ark in Sweden, where captive breeding programmes are ongoing and there have been successful breeding attempts. No hunting of animals on Dominica has been allowed since 2003, and public awareness actions have taken place to inform the Dominican public of the magnitude of threat facing this species and to discourage illegal hunting. This species was also replaced as the national dish on Dominica in 2016 to reduce demand for it as subsistence. Between 2011-2014, a series of experimental reintroductions were conducted in order to understand the continued impact and seasonal dynamics of disease,&#160;and&#160;the analysis is ongoing (M. Hudson&#160;pers. comm. July 2017). There is ongoing monitoring on both remnant subpopulations on both islands, and there is ongoing public awareness activities such as International Mountain Chicken Day across its range, and educational outreach in schools to raise further awareness on the species (M.

July 2017).&#160;<strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong><strong><em>Conservation Needed</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong>Habitat protection&#160;is urgently&#160;required on Dominica, and captive breeding and educational awareness efforts should remain ongoing (M.

This species was historically recorded in southwestern Korea and in western Kyushu, Japan and in the Yellow, Yangtze, Pear, Mingjiang, and Qingtang rivers in China, but has been extirpated from all of these areas except for the mid-lower section of the Yangtze River, below the Gezhouba dam. This species was historically overfished. In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals, but between 2005-2007 the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was estimated to be 203-257 individuals. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period. The construction of the Gezhouba dam in 1981 blocked the migration routes of this species, making it impossible for it to reach spawning sites in the upper reaches of the river. Currently, there is just one remaining spawning ground (a 4 km stretch of river), which is situated below the Gezhouba dam. Furthermore, in 2003, the Three Gorges dam was constructed 40 km upstream of the Gezhouba dam. This has changed the hydrological regime (lowering the water level of the river in autumn and winter) and affected the water temperature. Between 1983 and 2007, more than 9 million juveniles (including larvae) were released into Yangtze River to increase population numbers, but the contribution to wild stocks is considered to be less than 10%. This species has therefore been assessed as Critically Endangered.","This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Young of this species live in estuarine and nearshore habitats. When the species becomes sexually mature, it migrates up-river. Nearly mature adults (early stage III) arrive at the mouth of the Yangtze River in June or July. The adults do not feed while in the river. <br/><br/>Adults reach the middle sections of the river in September or October, where they overwinter. Ripe individuals were formerly found as far inland as the Jingsha River during the following October and November, where they spawned. Prior to construction of the Gezhouba Dam, the migration distance was as long as 2,500 to 3,300 km. Spawning sites often occur in turbulent sections of the river with rocky substrate and steep cliffs on both banks.<br/><br/>The roe is very large and it sinks and sticks to gravel until hatching. The hatched fries descend from the river to sea near the coast where they grow. They feed mainly on zoobenthos and other bottom invertebrates.<br/><br/>Juvenile <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. sinensis</span> of 7 to 38 cm tail length occur in the Yangtze River estuary from the middle of April through early October.

Individuals from 25 to 250 kg in weight were registered in some fishing grounds of East China Sea and Yellow Sea. This species attains a length of more than 3 metres.","This species has been historically overfished. In the 1970s, fishing was unlimited, but seasonal (occurring mostly between October and November). Gear types include gill nets (upper reach) and row hooks (middle reach).&#160; Due to its life history characteristics, once depleted, stocks of this species take a long time to recover. Fry are also captured by traditional Chinese fishing methods (drift nets in the river and set nets at the river mouth).<br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation, alteration, destruction and changes to hydrological conditions also significantly impacts this species.

Synthetic chemicals in water could contribute to the population decline of this species by significantly decreasing both the quality and quantity of eggs and spawning frequency of fish (Hu 2009).","In the 1960s, this stock supported a major commercial fishery, but catches in the late 1970s had declined to about 500 fish per year (The Changjiang Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).<br/><br/>In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals. In 1981, the construction of the Gezhouba dam isolated the upper reaches of the Yangtze river. In 1983 and 1984, the mean spawning stock size was estimated at 2,176 individuals (946 and 4,169 as 95% confidence intervals). Available data from acoustic surveys show that between 2005 and 2007, the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was 203-257. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period.<br/><br/>During 1996-2001, studies using tag-recapture methods, population structure analysis and sonar counting indicated that the spawning stock in the Yichang spawning area (mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze river) had decreased since the completion of the Gezhouba Dam. Annual estimates of spawning adults within the 40 km (including the 4km long spawning area) ranged from 199 to 473 (Chang 1999, Wei 2003).<br/><br/>Between 1983 and 2007, more than 9 million juveniles were released into Yangtze River to increase wild stocks. Prior to 1996, only the larvae were released as techniques had not been developed to cultivate fry, so survivability is expected to be very low (Wei 200, Chen 2008).

Shekelle (Shekelle <em>et al</em>. 2008), and Siau Island was surveyed by Riley (2002). By analogy with other wild Tarsier populations it is expected that this taxon is found in primary (although no tracts of primary forest have been found on Siau Island), secondary and mangrove forests, forest gardens, and a variety of other habitats of varying degrees of human disturbance that provide adequate shrubby cover. Shekelle and Salim (2009b) reported that their surveys found evidence of <em>T. tumpara </em>in only two places; on the shores of a small freshwater pond at the extreme southern end of the island, and on a steep cliff face along the east coast road where it runs next to the ocean. Numerous other sites that appeared promising turned up no evidence of the presence of tarsiers. There are reports that they can still be found high on the flanks of Mt Karengetang, near the caldera.<br/><br/><em>Tarsius tumpara </em>is phylogenetically linked to other Eastern Tarsiers, from the Sulawesi biogeographic region. All the species in this clade live in small, monogamous or polygamous groupings of 26. Anecdotal observations of <em>T. tumpara</em>, and those of its likely sister taxon, <em>T. sangirensis</em>, indicate that these species might sleep in dispersed social groups, particularly in disturbed habitat, and that this might be a response to predation, particularly by humans and human commensals, such as feral cats and dogs. Merker (2006) studied home range size in <em>T. dentatus </em>and found it to vary, depending on the degree of human disturbance, with home range size increasing with the degree of disturbance. Its diet is mostly large-bodied arthropods, with some small vertebrates.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","<p>The primary threat to this taxon is that its range is restricted to one small, volcanic island. The volcano, Mt. Karengentang, is active and dominates more than 50% of its geographical range. This threat is exacerbated by a relatively large human population (311 people/km²) that has converted virtually all of the primary habitat to some form of human use (Shekelle and Salim 2009a, 2009b). In these ways, <em>Tarsius tumpara </em>faces a set of threats similar to those faced by <em>T. sangirensis</em>, but the threats are more acute for <em>T. tumpara</em>: a smaller island, a more active volcano, and higher human population density. Most troubling, however, are numerous credible reports that the local human population regularly eats tarsiers, up to 5 to10 animals at a sitting, and that tarsiers have been extirpated from areas where they were common as recently as 10 years ago. The population is likely scattered and reported heavily disturbed land on the southern end of the island and the land set apart for conversion. The tarsiers are found in two remote sites of the island where they are hunted and consumed as food. Might be found in Mount Tamata which is deemed ‘unofficially protected’. <em>Tarsius tumpara </em>is considered to be one of the world’s 25 most endangered primates by the IUCN Species Survival Commission Primate Specialist Group (Shekelle and Salim 2007, 2009b).<br/><br/>Predation by feral cats and dogs are associated threats of habitat destruction due to human encroachment.</p>","<p>Shekelle and Salim (2009a) used remote sensing of remaining habitat and population density estimates from studies of other tarsier taxa to estimate the remaining populations being 1,358–12,470 individuals.

Riley remarked that <em>Tarsius sangirensis </em>has a preference for primary forest, but may also occur in secondary habitats including sago swamps, scrub, nutmeg plantations, coconut plantations, and secondary forest growth. These results are similar to those of Shekelle and associates, except that Shekelle did not encounter any in primary forest, and Shekelle and Salim (2009) indicate that it is very unlikely that any primary forest now remains on the island. A study of <em>Tarsius dentatus </em>on Sulawesi by Merker <em>et al. </em>(2005; also Merker and Yustian 2008) showed that they were able to occupy agricultural land as long there were remnant patches of forest or dense shrubbery, although group sizes were smaller and population densities were considerably lower (less than half) than was found for virtually undisturbed old growth forest (estimated densities 268 individuals/km² versus 45 individuals/km²). Like other Eastern Tarsier species from the Sulawesi biogeographic region, this species lives in small, monogamous or polygamous groupings of 2–6. It might sleep in dispersed social groups, particularly in disturbed habitat, and that this might be a response to predation, particularly by humans and human commensals, such as feral cats and dogs. Unlike all other tarsiers, individuals are known to sleep on exposed bamboos, on top of palm leaves and trees and this behaviour is seen to reflect on the poor habitat availability. Great Sangihe Tarsiers are known to prefer typical sleeping sites as the other eastern tarsiers.</p>  <p>Merker (2006) studied home range size in <em>T. dentatus </em>and found it to vary, depending on the degree of human disturbance, with home range size increasing with the degree of disturbance. Its diet is mostly large arthropods and some small vertebrates.</p>","<p>                      </p><p>Shekelle and Salim (2009) argue that the chief threat to tarsiers on Sangihe Island is habitat loss. One major driver of habitat loss is the clearing of forests and forest gardens for more intensive agriculture where underbrush is cleared, such as coconut monocrop, coconut/cocoa, nutmeg, and others (M. Shekelle pers. comm. 2010). Riley (2002), however, did not think that habitat loss was a major threat, given their presence in a variety of secondary habitats. This discrepancy emphasizes the need to determine the suitability of secondary habitats for sustainable tarsier populations. The volcano on Sangihe Island, Mt Awu, is active and one of the deadliest in Indonesia, and the human population density on the island is very high (260 people km²) (Shekelle and Salim 2009). There is practically no primary forest left and there are no protected areas in its range (Shekelle and Salim 2009).<br/><br/>The tarsiers today survive in primary and late succession secondary forest, as the real habitat is now either fragmented, degraded or completely destroyed. The primary and secondary forest is now limited a 940 ha in Mt. Sahendaruman. This patch, though just a ‘green belt’ is locally known as hutun lindung or protected forest but is a ‘deceptive’ travesty of anything close to protection. The species requires immediate status reassessment as when designated as Endangered it was believed to be present on another island namely Siau. But later, the species in Siau was identified as a distinct taxon, <em>Tarsius tumpara</em>. </p>","<p>Shekelle and Salim (2009) used remote sensing to estimate the total population to be between 1,505 and 52,734 individuals, the very wide range being a result of uncertainty in the suitability of ""brush"" habitat for sustainable tarsier populations. Without including ""brush"", the population estimate is only 1,505–2,795 individuals. Riley (2002) estimated total population as 9,000–15,600, but those numbers drop to 300–500 if secondary habitat is excluded. Riley did not address the issue that, while tarsiers are recorded in secondary habitats, these might not support sustainable populations. Thus, the conclusions of both studies are similar; the viable population might be very small indeed, unless populations in suboptimal habitats are ""sources"" and not ""sinks"".      </p>",Decreasing,"<p>Currently this species is recorded as occurring only on Sangihe island, north of Sulawesi, Indonesia (Riley 2002), but it might occur in the other tiny islands of Sangihe chain. </p>",This species is locally hunted for food.,Terrestrial,"<p>                      </p><p>The taxon has been protected by national law since 1931, and is listed in CITES Appendix II.

The known specimens were found under stones (Arnold <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).","Extensive vegetation loss has taken place since the Cape Verde archipelago was first colonized (Arnold <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2008). A particular risk may exist from the  effects of overgrazing of the remaining native vegetation by goats (Arnold <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008), as well as woodcutting by local people (Leyens and Lobin 1996); the species is also likely to be preyed on by cats and rats. The introduced West African house gecko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hemidactylus angulatus</span> has been reported from Fogo historically, but it has not been encountered in any recent visit to the island (Arnold <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008) and it is unclear either whether it is extant on this island or whether it represents a threat to<span style=""font-style: italic;""> H. lopezjuradoi</span>, which is likely to favour different habitats (Arnold <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Another introduced house gecko, <em>Hemidactylus mercatorius</em> (referred to in older literature as <em>H. mabouia </em>in Cape Verde), is also a potential competitor and possible predator. This species has not yet been recorded from Fogo, but is expanding its range in the archipelago (Vasconcelos <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). A specimen of an introduced<em> Hemidactylus</em>, possibly <em>H. mercatorius</em>, was found in São Filipe in June 2012, but was not collected and its specific identity cannot be confirmed (R. Vasconcelos pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Due to its restricted range, this gecko may also be at risk from stochastic events. If the species is indeed restricted to the humid northeast of Fogo, as appears to be the case, there is a potential future risk from the island's active volcano. This area is on a different flank of islands from recent lava flows, however flows produce large swathes of unsuitable habitat on which nothing grows, and are typically preceded by landslides that eradicate nearby vegetation (R. Vasconcelos pers. comm. 2012). If the direction of the flows changes to the northwest (as appears to have happened historically based on lava scars - Day <em>et al</em>. 1999), most or all of this species' habitat could be destroyed (Day <em>et al.</em> 1999). This species' apparent reliance on humid habitats may also render it susceptible to droughts. Projections of future climate impacts in the archipelago disagree on the  influence of climate change on the frequency and severity of droughts  (Paeth and Hense 2004, Cook and Vizy 2006, Held<em> et al. </em>2005),  however, recent modelling suggests the frequency of extremely dry and  extremely wet years is likely to increase over the coming century  (Huntingford <em>et al. </em>2005).","This species is only known from five specimens collected in 1997 (Arnold <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). At least some historical reports of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">H. bouvieri</span> from Fogo are likely to refer to this species (Arnold <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008), but this cannot be verified as historical reports of <em>Hemidactylus</em> from this island are few and only one voucher specimen (a juvenile) is known (Angel 1935). A recent 12-day survey failed to locate any individuals of this species (R. Vasconcelos <em></em>unpubl. data).",,"This species is only known from five specimens, all with the locality data ""Fogo"" in the Cape Verde archipelago (Arnold <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008). Its extent of occurrence is unknown; Fogo has an area of 476 km<sup>2</sup>, however, it is thought that the species has a restricted range within the island as the original material was taken from a single locality (Angel 1935), and extensive sampling across the island has failed to record it since its original collection. It is consequently considered rare (Schleich <em>et al.</em> 1996).",There is no known use or trade in this species.,Terrestrial,"Research is urgently required to obtain data on this gecko's natural history and population status. It was considered rare and in need of urgent protection by Schleich (1996) (as <em>H. bouvieri</em> on Fogo), an assessment supported by Arnold <em>et al.</em> (2008), but it is not known from any protected areas and is not included in national conservation legislation. As this species' exact conservation status is unclear, research into its distribution, ecology, and the impacts of potential threats is urgently needed. Efforts should be made to limit the spread of invasive house geckos to and within Fogo. All native reptiles in the Cape Verde archipelago are endemic to these islands, although this is not widely-recognized among the public (R. Vasconcelos pers. comm. 2012). Education is required to raise awareness of these species and their conservation requirements. Measures are needed to ensure that conservation management is undertaken effectively, and incorporates recent taxonomic changes. Geckos are feared due to traditional beliefs, and there may be occasional persecution; education is therefore needed to raise awareness that these animals are inoffensive to humans. Measures should be developed to prevent the killing of and disturbance to these animals and their eggs, as well as disturbance to and destruction of their habitat, and formal protection of the known locality is recommended.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

This could trigger criterion CR E for this species, however due to current uncertainty over its future and stronger evidence for criteria A, C and D being triggered for this species, criterion E is not applied for this assessment.<br/><br/>Sumatran Rhinos have declined significantly across their range in the past 30 years, with populations lost in Peninsular Malaysia, the State of Sabah, Malaysia, and in Kerinci Seblat National Park in Indonesia. The three principal threats across Sumatra are small population effects (e.g., the Allee effect), human disturbance, and poaching. Threats in the three populations are slightly different (Miller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In Way Kambas National Park, threats are poaching, bird collection, illegal fishing, agar wood collection, human disturbance, annual and catastrophic drought, annual and catastrophic forest fires. In Bukit Barisan Selatan, primary threats are poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, human disturbance (e.g., natural resource collection activities such as non-timber forest products, illegal bird collection, pangolin poaching, and illegal fishing), road development, small and large scale encroachment, and catastrophic events. In Aceh Province, threats include poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, catastrophic events, El Nino Southern Oscillation events, human disturbance and encroachment, forest conversion into various commodities and plantations, and road development. In Gunung Leuser National Park, the primary threats are poaching, the potential for stochastic catastrophes, human encroachment and disturbance, forest conversion, and road construction.","The species inhabits tropical rainforest and montane moss forest, and occasionally occurs at forest margins and in secondary forest (Nowak 1999). Sumatran Rhinos occur mainly in hilly areas nearby water sources, and exhibits seasonal movements, moving uphill in times of lowland flooding (van Strien 1975). This shy species is dependent on salt licks, and occurs mostly in primary forest in protected areas, but wandering into secondary forests outside protected areas, especially in the dry season in search of water (van Strien 1975).<br/><br/>Males are primarily solitary, but can have overlapping territories with females, which are commonly found with offspring (Nowak 1999). The home range size of females is probably no more than 500 ha, while males wonder over larger areas, with likely limited dispersal distance. The species is generally solitary, except for mating pairs and mothers with young (Nowak 1999). Its life history characteristics are not well known, with longevity estimated at about 35–40 years, gestation length of approximately 15-16 months. Captive females have copulated as early as six years of age, and males at eight years of age (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2015; IRF website 2018, www.rhinos.org). Females may develop reproductive pathologies if they do not become pregnant (Roth pers. comm). Because they are induced ovulators (Roth <em>et al</em>. 2001) timing of females meeting males is critical; females are most likely to become pregnant when an ovarian follicle is approximately 20 mm in size prior to copulation.<br/><br/>Home ranges are up to 5,000 ha for males, 1,000–1,500 ha for females. Daily movements between feeding sites and wallows are probably only a few kilometres per day. Longer treks are made when males and females go to saltlicks (5-10 km) and by males exploring their large ranges. Dispersal appears to be mainly by sub-adult animals (4-7 years) old. In this period they may be found rather far from the home grounds. Adults are very traditional in the use of their ranges and will not move away unless severely disturbed. Water is never very far away in the habitats occupied by the Sumatran rhino.","The three principal threats across Sumatra are small population effects (e.g., the Allee effect), human disturbance, and poaching.&#160;The species is now so reduced that there are very small numbers in each locality where it still survives. Threats in the three populations are slightly different (Miller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In Way Kambas National Park, threats are poaching, disturbance from bird collection, illegal fishing, agar wood collection, human disturbance, annual and catastrophic drought, annual and catastrophic forest fires. In Bukit Barisan Selatan, primary threats are poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, human disturbance (e.g., natural resource collection activities such as non-timber forest products, illegal bird collection, pangolin poaching, and illegal fishing), road development, small and large scale encroachment, and catastrophic events. In Aceh Province, threats include poaching, the Allee effect and resultant inbreeding, catastrophic events, El Nino Southern Oscillation events, human disturbance and encroachment, forest conversion into various commodities and plantations, and road development. In Gunung Leuser National Park, the primary threats are poaching, the potential for stochastic catastrophes, human encroachment and disturbance, forest conversion, and road construction.<br/><br/>Poaching looms as a threat but at this time is opportunistic and that organized criminal networks are not in operation at the scale they are in Africa. Poaching is primarily driven by the demand in Viet Nam and China for the supposedly medicinal properties of rhino horns and other body parts, and as a high-value gift item. Many centuries of over-hunting as well as habitat loss has reduced this species to a tiny percentage of its former population and range.","The total population now is estimated to be fewer than 80 individuals. Until the early 1990s the numbers continued to decline at a rapid rate with estimated losses of 50% or more of the population per decade (Foose and van Strien 1997). The total population of the Sumatran Rhino has declined by at least 80 percent in the last 30 years. The combination of the extent and rate of population reduction, as well as population fragmentation, makes it perhaps the most threatened large mammal on Earth.&#160;<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis</em> now occurs only on Sumatra, where there are fewer than 80 individuals in roughly ten subpopulations (Miller <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). The largest populations remain in Bukit Barisan Selatan, Way Kambas, and Gunung Leuser National Park (Miller<em> et al.</em> 2015). The population estimate is still in question in Bukit Barisan Selatan, with no estimate larger than 10 individuals at most and no signs of calves in the past four years. There are thought to be 15-25 rhinos in Way Kambas, the only population considered to be slowly growing, with four calves observed in 2014. In Aceh, there are five subpopulations, ranging in estimated size from two to 24, for a possible maximum total of 30-40 individuals. Miller <em>et al. </em>(2015) report that there may be three small subpopulations in Leuser Barat, but this has not been confirmed. At least four of the five subpopulations in the north of Sumatra are considered non-viable, containing only between two and five animals (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2015). Despite protection, populations continue to decrease. Anti-poaching teams are in place in Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas National Parks, and in parts of Gunung Leuser.&#160;<br/><br/>A tiny population (perhaps no more than three animals) was discovered in east Kalimantan in 2012. Surveys are currently underway to determine the individuals and locations. In 2016, a female with a snare wound was successfully rescued, but subsequently died. In 2018, another capture operation for one animal began in April; a female was captured in November 2018. At the time of this assessment she is in relatively good condition.&#160;<br/><br/>The population status of the subspecies <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis</em> is unknown, with the very slight possibility that a small number of individuals survive in Myanmar.<br/><br/>There are nine animals in captivity, eight in Indonesia and one in Sabah, Malaysia. Two calves were born at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Way Kambas National Park in 2012 and 2016. The remaining female at the Borneo Rhino Alliance Sanctuary in Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia is non-reproductive.",Decreasing,"The Sumatran Rhinoceros once occurred from the foothills of the Himalayas in Bhutan and north-eastern India, through southern China (Yunnan), Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam and the Malay Peninsula, and onto the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia (Foose <em>et al</em>. 1997, Grubb 2005). The species' precise historical range is indeterminate, as early accounts failed to distinguish rhinos to specific level, due to partial sympatry with the other two Asian rhino species (<em>Rhinoceros sondaicus</em> and <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</em>).<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis</em> formerly occurred in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar (Nowak 1999). The subspecies is extinct in the three former countries, but there is a possibility that a tiny remnant population remains in northern Myanmar.<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni</em> formerly occurred throughout the island of Borneo. The subspecies now is considered extinct in the wild in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo). A handful of individuals may still survive in east Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) (Kurniawan, pers. comm.).<br/><br/><em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis</em> formerly occurred in Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra (Indonesia). Presently, the subspecies&#160;primarily occurs in three protected areas in Sumatra (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2015); there may be a handful of stragglers living outside protected areas, particularly in Aceh Province.

Many organizations are involved with these units, which work under a Memorandum of Understanding with the&#160;Government of Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry. The expansion and reinforcement of anti-poaching programs, as well as expanding the current captive breeding program, are the top priorities if this species is to survive.<br/><br/>A standardized method for rhino monitoring has been developed and launched (Tim Monitoring Badak Sumatra 2014). However, it has only been partially implemented and in few areas. The low number apparently poses a big challenge in obtaining an adequate sample that will result in reliable population estimates. Meanwhile, there has also been a concern about introducing disturbance if an intensive survey is conducted in sensitive areas. Because of this, to-date no robust population data are available. The current survey is directed to focus on identifying rhino that are considered ""doomed"" and to be rescued as recommended by the PVA analysis (Miller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015) and endorsed under the Government of Indonesia's Emergency Action Plan.<br/><br/>There are ongoing efforts to further develop capacity for managed breeding in Indonesia. There have been recent advances in captive breeding techniques for this species, including successful births at the Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden in 2001, 2004, and 2006 and at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Sumatra in 2012 and 2016. All the animals from Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden (United States) have now been transferred to the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary. The size of the facility will be doubled by the end of 2019 so that it can hold more animals. The Government of Indonesia has endorsed further rhino rescues to speed up conservation breeding. In late 2018, a collaborative project led by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, involving the IUCN SSC, the International Rhino Foundation, WWF, National Geographic, and Global Wildlife Conservation and Yayasan Badak Indonesia, WWF-Indonesia, and Forum Konservasi Leuser in-country, was launched to speed up the conservation breeding of the species by expanding the Way Kambas Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary and to develop new captive breeding centres in Leuser and in Kalimantan.<br/><br/>The Government of Indonesia published its ""Strategy and Action Plan for the Conservation of Rhinos in Indonesia"" covering the time period of 2007 to 2017.

The Governments of Indonesia and Malaysia have, in principle, agreed to this exchange but for various reasons no exchanges have occurred.

However, Guanaco actual conservation measures continue to be primarily based upon recurring emergencies, <span lang=""EN-GB"">specifically<span lang=""EN-US"">, severe local poaching, which do not fulfill the greater holistic threats faced by the species.&#160; This is a result of its wide distribution existing in small-fragmented and isolated populations, in contrast to some abundant populations that are locally and widely distributed.<br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/>Of grave concern <span lang=""EN-GB"">at the national level is that Guanacos are likely to become extinct in three out of the five countries where they were historically found and currently classified as Endangered: Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru.&#160; For this reason it is important to emphasize that future Guanaco management not only address the poaching problem, but also focus upon the implementation of measures orientated to the protection and conservation of those depressed populations, as well as, simultaneously expand the sustained utilization of those recovered and abundant populations for benefit of local residents and landowners. Accordingly, a more accurate classification of Guanaco, such as a Regional Assessment is needed in order to reflect the actual heterogeneity of populations across its multi-country distribution.<br/><br/>Habitat degradation due to overgrazing, competition with introduced herbivores, and habitat degradation due to extractive industries are the main threats to Guanaco (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Nevertheless, persistent illegal hunting is one of the historical threats to the species, independent of population size that is strongly impacting small and low-density populations <span lang=""EN-US"">(González 2010a,&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Wildlife Conservation Society 2012<span lang=""EN-US"">).&#160; Equally important is the continued hunting of numerically recovered populations (Lambertucci and Speziale 2011) based upon antagonism towards the species by livestock and landowners who have put pressure on governments to control Guanaco numbers.&#160; Examples of this situation occur in the Patagonia of Chile and Argentina, and populations in the Andes of Central Chile.<br/><br/>Human activities such as hunting, mining, oil exploration and extraction, livestock fencing, development of infrastructure, and habitat loss, often impose barriers to migration and movement between populations. The loss of connectivity has resulted in small, closed and isolated populations under increasing risk of collapse due to the loss of genetic variation and environmental or demographic stochasticity – the latter being highly relevant to inordinately small populations.&#160; Recent research, however, on a small island population of Guanacos indicates that such isolation may not be the problem of genetic-diversity loss in the short-term (70 years) as previously envisioned, yet long-term consequences are inevitable (<span lang=""EN-US"">González <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/>Live-shearing of captured Guanacos is currently under development in Patagonia with Argentine-government funding. &#160;If properly managed, these programmes can offer an alternative to local economies and re-evaluation of negative attitudes by landowners towards the species (Franklin <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997, Lichtenstein and Carmanchahi 2012, Lichtenstein 2013). More than 11,000 Guanacos had been shorn between 2004-<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-GB"">2008, yet today only a very small percentage of the total Guanaco population is under such management (Lichtenstein 2013). The effects of sustained-fibre utilization are being assessed and monitored, especially where Guanacos are concentrated in scattered high-density populations (Ovejero <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Carmanchahi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). To encourage the marketing of Guanaco products, Argentina is developing and promoting Guanaco yarn and thread.<br/><br/>Guanacos have been legally hunted in Chile since 2003, with pressure for similar management in the Argentinean Patagonia in order to reduce density and conflicts with livestock production and forestry. However, a recent study revealed that hunting adult Guanacos by itself does not reduce browsing damage to <em>Nothofagus</em> regeneration in Tierra del Fuego, Chile (Martinez-Pastur <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Still, government sanctioned and organized harvesting of Guanacos has resulted in the exportation of meat, contributed to the value of the species, and begun to reduce traditional conflict with sheep ranchers and foresters.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco is a wild ungulate found from sea level to over 5,000 meters elevation (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, González in prep.). At the continental and country levels, climate has mainly driven distributional range of the species (González<em> et al.</em>&#160;2013). Guanaco habitat is characterized by highly seasonal climates, dry winters or snow covered, cold temperatures including below zero, winds from moderate to high intensity and low precipitation combined with high evapotranspiration create arid conditions that in general result in low plant productivity (Franklin, 1982, 1983; Wheeler 1995).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In the sub-region of Patagonia (Hershkovitz 1972) Guanacos inhabit four of the ten major environments described for South America (González<em> et al.</em>&#160;2006): 1) Desert and Xeric Shrublands, 2) Montane Grasslands, 3) Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands, and 4) Temperate Forests (Dinerstein <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). Phytogeographically, Guanacos inhabit the provinces of the Monte and Patagonia, arid and semi-arid shrublands, and grasslands comprising around 1,000,000 km² (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). On a smaller scale, the presence or absence of this species can be explained by altitude, vegetation, topography, and the occurrence of livestock (Travaini <em>et al. </em>2007, Acebes <em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Iranzo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, González <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/></span><br/>Both migratory and sedentary populations exist across the Guanaco range. Migration is mainly driven by winter forage supply and snow depth as observed for Andean and some Patagonian population before and after the reproductive season (Ortega and Franklin 1995). A minimal annual home range reported for the species is 2-9 km<sup>2 </sup>in sedentary animals (Marino and Baldi 2008), whereas in migratory populations they can reach up to 900 km<sup>2</sup> in the Andes (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008) and around 40 km<sup>2</sup> in Tierra del Fuego during winter (Moraga <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>The Guanaco’s primary natural predator is the Puma (<em>Puma concolor</em>; Franklin <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999) and secondarily the Andean Fox (<em>Lycalopex culpaeus</em>; Novaro <em>et al. </em>2009).&#160; Its distribution overlaps marginally with other native ungulates such as Huemul (<em>Hippocamelus bisulcus</em>) in Patagonia, Taruka (<em>Hippocamelus anticensis</em>) in mountains of the central Andes, and the Vicuña (<em>Vicugna vicugna</em>) in some parts of the altiplano (Luccherini 1996, Díaz and Smith-Flueck 2000, Rundel and Palma 2000).<br/><br/>Adult Guanacos weigh 80-120 kg (Wheeler 1995, González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006) and their breeding system is based upon resource defence polygyny, i.e. an adult male defends a territory where birthing and mating occur and a group of females and their offspring (chulengos) feed freely from the intrusion of other males (Franklin 1982, 1983). The Family Group is the basic social unit that occupies a Feeding Territory defended by the resident adult male. Other units found during the reproductive season, include Solo Males that defends a territory without females, and non-territorial Male Groups composed of males of various ages (Franklin 2011). In migratory populations outside the reproductive season, large Mixed Groups can be observed composed of both sexes of all ages (Ortega and Franklin 1995).<br/><br/>Vigilance and foraging accounted for almost 90% of the diurnal time budget for male and female Guanacos in Family Groups, where animals benefited from living in groups as individual foraging time increased with group size, as well as, collective vigilance against predators (Marino and Baldi 2008). Territoriality apparently limits population density, reaching lower K (equilibrium density) when contrasted with models based on individual forage intake (Marino <em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Empirical field data has also shown that Family Group size is positively correlated with forage production within Feeding Territories (Franklin <em>et al.</em>&#160;in press).&#160;<br/><br/>Guanacos are generalist herbivores of intermediate selectivity, i.e. their diets include large proportions of both grasses and shrubs (Raedeke and Simmoneti 1988; Fraser 1998; Puig <em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, 2011, 2014; Baldi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Domestic sheep was the main ungulate introduced across the Guanaco’s range, reaching 22 million within 50 years after its introduction in the Argentine Patagonia in the late 1800s. Guanacos and sheep largely overlap in their forage preferences as much as 80% in some areas (Puig<em> et al.&#160;</em>2001). Although both species can include some 100 plant species in their diets, only 17 species make up 80% of the diets, and in Patagonia two grass species represent 40% for both Guanaco and sheep diets (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Other introduced ungulates found in Guanaco habitat are goats, cattle, donkeys, and horses, but few studies have assessed their diet overlap with the Guanaco. A preliminary study in the Bolivian Chaco showed that the Guanaco is a generalist feeder, responding to the seasonal availability of fruits, flowers and leaves, including a variety of cacti (Cuéllar, unpublished data). In that same region Guanacos mainly compete for forage and spatial resources with cattle and horses.<br/><br/>Competition with livestock, hunting, and habitat modification has often resulted in Guanacos occupying marginal, low quality lands in terms of vegetation cover and the availability of preferred plant species caused by sheep monopolizing the most productive areas (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, Iranzo <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). A spatial segregation has been found in northern Chile between Guanacos and Donkeys <em>Equus asinus</em> (Malo <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Guanacos are still numerous and widely distributed but continue their decline initiated in the 19th century in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and major parts of Chile. Over-hunting, range degradation from livestock overgrazing, and interspecific competition for forage have all played significant and long-time roles in the demise of Guanacos all across their distributional range (Raedeke 1979; Franklin 1982; Miller<em> et al. </em>1983; Cunazza <em>et al. </em>1995; Cuellar and Fuentes 2000; Puig <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001; Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001, 2004). Currently, the main threats are still widespread, but mining and energy projects are also becoming a factor. Of special concern is the recent and rapid development of unconventional oil and gas exploration across large areas of the Guanaco’s distribution.<br/><br/>In Peru Guanacos are seriously affected by poaching and subsistence hunting. Habitat degradation due to extractive industries and livestock overgrazing has been identified as major threats for the few remaining subpopulations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).<br/><br/>In Bolivia the current major threat is habitat loss due to overgrazing by livestock. Although sport hunting was halted in 2001 (Cuéllar, unpublished data), poaching is still common.<br/><br/>In Chile and Argentina, recreational hunting and poaching are major threats. In northern Chile at the local level, feral dogs are reducing Guanaco populations within and outside protected areas, and hybridism with Llamas is common in areas with low Guanaco densities. Mining and oil extraction along with photovoltaic and wind parks have expanded with the demand for increased production, resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation of populations in both countries.&#160; In addition, in northern Chile and the Argentine Patagonia infrastructure development has caused road kills and entrapment within barriers lining highways causing local isolation and limiting population movements <span lang=""EN-US"">(Rey<em> et al.</em><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;2012). Finally, in Chile and Argentina where numbers have recovered due to government sponsored management programs and Guanaco populations coexist with ranching and forestry practices, there has been a return to public resentment towards Guanacos as occurred in historical times. Demonstrated-sustained programs of Guanacos utilization that benefit the local economy and lower population numbers are needed if Guanaco are to be maintained.<br/></span></span><br/>Health studies conducted in mainland Patagonia have shown that Guanaco populations are relatively disease-free, but susceptible to common diseases from domestic sheep, cattle, and horses (Karesh <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Beldomenico<em> et al.</em> 2003, Uhart <em>et al.</em> unpub. data). Castillo (2006) came to a similar conclusion based upon studies of parasite load in free ranging Peruvian Guanacos. Recently, scabies has been reported to affect Guanacos in northern Chile causing mortality in low-density populations. It is also a common disease in Guanacos inhabiting Tierra del Fuego, Chile (Skewes pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Today the Guanaco occupies only 26% of its original range (calculated by Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002, based upon Franklin 1982). Specifically, range distribution has been reduced by 58% in Argentina, 75% in Chile, and over 90% in Perú, Bolivia, and Paraguay (<span lang=""EN-US"">Cunazza <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Ceballos and Ehrlich 2002). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Moreover, distribution has become fragmented into smaller, relatively isolated populations. Although the species is not threatened with demographic extinction at a continental scale, it is predicted that the northern subspecies <em>L. guanicoe cacsilensis</em> will become extinct in Peru within 30 years if current-hunting mortality rates are not curtailed (<a href=""www.conopa.org"">www.conopa.org</a>). Guanacos are ecologically extinct in most of their remaining range (Novaro<em> et al.</em>&#160;2000), with some southern populations at serious risk of local or even regional extirpation (Cunazza <em>et al.&#160;</em>1995). Spatial fragmentation in general is a threat to Guanaco populations (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Recent findings suggest that inbreeding or aberrant mutations may lead to reproductive failure and congenital malformations (Franklin and Grigione 2005, Zapata <em>et al. </em>2008, González <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/></span><br/>Increasing pressure from private landowners in Patagonian rangelands may result in a threat to the remaining high-density Guanaco populations if management is not properly planned and implemented. Live-shearing and subsequent release of wild Guanacos could contribute to their conservation only if the effects of this activity are properly assessed and management is applied accordingly. If not ecologically sustainable, the viability of the most important Guanaco populations will be at risk. Careful evaluation of current management practices involving live shearing is currently in progress, but a long-term assessment is necessary. For Guanaco populations under a hunting strategy of use, information about habitat preferences, flight distance, individual and population movement, group composition, and the effect on neighbouring populations are urgently needed for proper assessment of this kind of productive system.<br/><br/>Land desertification due to overgrazing coupled with more severe and frequent droughts caused by climate change/variation are potential threats of great concern to Guanaco abundance throughout its range. Severe droughts can have drastic effects on local Guanaco populations as documented in eastern Patagonia (Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In addition, models on climate change predict a sharp decrease in rain precipitation within the next 50 years in arid-southern South America (Nohara <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Therefore, it is crucial to favor the ecological functionality of Guanaco populations through adequate management as a step to mitigate additional effects of climate change.&#160;</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">It is estimated that Guanaco abundance has been reduced to only 3-7% of their original numbers when Europeans arrived to South America and the total Guanaco population was between 30-50 million animals (Raedeke 1979). Today, the total continental population of Guanacos is between 1,500,000-2,200,000 with the estimated number of adults between 1,000,000-1,500,000 (calculated from life-tables of Raedeke 1979; Fritz and Franklin 1994), two to three times greater than previously assessed (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2008)<span lang=""EN-GB"">. <span lang=""EN-US"">That number would be reduced if effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) is applied (Sarno <em>et al. </em>2015). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Some 81-86% of the Guanaco population is found in Argentina followed by Chile at 14-18%. The total numbers in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay are less than 1% of the total. Differences in survey methodologies and effort across such a vast area make it necessary to be cautious about population numbers and should be taken only as references. Specifically, what is needed is a more reliable estimate for the entire Argentine Patagonia (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Travaini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). For Chile the total estimate is rather speculative as these numbers come from scattered information instead of planned surveys.&#160; More accurate surveys will hopefully come from new methods applicable for population estimation designed for large areas (González 2010a) or application of standard methodologies at broad scale (Soto 2010). For Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay, most assessments have been based mainly on animal counts because of the large and remote areas involved, possibly underestimating total population size.<br/></span></span><br/>Although Guanaco distribution in the Argentine Patagonia is rather continuous, densities are typically low (&lt;5 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>) and even very low in many parts of Chubut, Rio Negro and Neuquén Provinces (&lt;2 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>). High-density populations are actually scarce in the Patagonia of Argentina (Baldi <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001, 2010; Novaro<em> et al.</em>&#160;2007; Puig <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997, 2003). A recent estimate for Patagonia was reported by Gavuzzo <em>et al.</em> (2015) applying aerial censuses techniques, but the numbers must be used for reference because of problematic assumptions, and used with caution if management decisions are at the local level (Schiavini and Rey 2015). Nevertheless, aerial surveys can agree with population estimation by modelling, for example those from the Santa Cruz Province (Travaini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). For the rest of Argentina, population densities are below one Guanaco/km² and highly fragmented (Baigún <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Puig and Videla 2007) with some relict populations in La Pampa, Córdoba and Buenos Aires Provinces (Sosa and Sarasola 2005, Barri and Cufré 2014). Some high-density populations occur in southern Chile reaching up to 43 Guanacos/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;at Torres del Paine National Park (Sarno and Franklin 1999), but in the rest of Chile populations are small and widely scattered.<br/><br/>As a general rule, it is recommended to use the distance sampling methods either for ground or aerial surveys for open and flat environments, as they are based upon more realistic assumptions than total counts or fixed-width strip transect methods that tend to underestimate population numbers (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, where numbers are very low as in relict populations, total counts or less systematic methods are appropriate as a first approach. Also, extrapolation of local densities to larger areas must be cautiously applied according to sampling effort and based upon proper statistical design. Some large-scale surveys are currently being conducted in Argentinean Patagonia, including modelling (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) and aerial surveys using systematic, digital photographs taken along flight transects. In Chilean mountainous environments survey techniques are in the experimental phase using Monte-Carlo modelling and geostatistical-based estimates.</p><p>Guanaco population:</p><p></p><ul><li>Peru: 3,000</li><li>Bolivia: 150-200</li><li>Paraguay: 20-100</li><li>Chile: 270,000-299,000</li><li>Argentina: 1,225,000-1,890,000</li></ul>Total&#160;Guanaco population: 1,498,170-2,192,300<p></p><p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Trend:&#160; Increasing. Although the global population estimate is higher than previous assessments, current approaches take into account new information and methods of estimation (Schroeder <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Zubillaga <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Travaini <em>et al.</em> 2015). <span lang=""EN-US"">Under-estimates and over-estimates have occurred in the past because of incomplete and inaccurate population-survey methodologies, especially in low population densities over the vast areas involved.&#160; <span lang=""EN-GB"">Also, some large areas previously unknown have been recently surveyed.&#160; At the same time, high-numbered populations in the Argentine and Chilean Patagonia have experienced significant growth in the past number of years <span lang=""EN-US"">(Zubillaga <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, caution should be noted that although numbers have seemingly increased in the far southern cone of South America, in the balance of the Guanaco’s distribution, populations are small and in real decline or at best tenuously stable, such as in Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, northern Chile, and Nnrthern Argentina (Wildlife Conservation Society 2012).</span></span></p>",Increasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco is a widespread species with an extensive, although discontinuous, range from the northern Peru (8°30’ S) to Navarino Island (55°S) in southern Chile, from the Pacific Ocean in the northwest to the Atlantic Ocean in the southeast, and from the sea level to 5,000 meters elevation in the Andean Mountains (Franklin 1982, González<em> et al. </em>2006, González in prep.).<br/><br/>However, its distribution has been severely impacted by human beings. Constant hunting, human occupation and fragmentation of habitat, competition with livestock, and the installation of fences (<span lang=""EN-US"">Torres 1992, Franklin <em>et al. </em>1997, González <em>et al. </em>2006) have reduced the Guanaco’s distribution to only 26% of its original distribution (calculated by Ceballos <span lang=""EN-US"">and<span lang=""EN-US""> Ehrlich 2002, based upon Franklin 1982). Clearly numerous local populations have become extirpated generating a distribution highly fragmented in many regions (Housse 1930, MacDonagh 1949, Mann <em>et al. </em>1953, Cunazza<em> et al. </em>1995, Torres 1992, González <em>et al. </em>2006, Baigún <em>et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>In Peru the northernmost population of Guanacos in South America occurs at 8°30'S (Franklin 1975, Linares <em>et al. </em>2010) in the Calipuy National Reserve in the La Libertad Department. To the south, populations reach the Salinas Aguada Blanca National Reserve in the departments of Arequipa and Moquegua (16°10'S), and a Guanaco population has been recorded in the Nevado Salcantay area in the Anta District (Wheeler 2006, Veliz and Hoces 2007).<br/><br/>In Bolivia, a relict population of Guanaco persists in the Chaco region (Cuéllar and Fuentes 2000) and recent sightings have been reported in the southern highlands between Potosi and Chuquisaca (Nuñez 2008). Although Pinaya (1990) reported the presence of Guanacos in southeastern Tarija, these records are in need of confirmation.<br/><br/>In Paraguay, a small relict population has been reported in the northwestern Chaco (Villalba 2004).<br/><br/>In Chile Guanacos occur from near Putre village at the northern border with Peru to Navarino Island in the far southern Fueguian zone (González <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The largest Guanaco populations in Chile are concentrated in the Magallanes and Aysén regions in the far south.&#160; In the remainder of the country, small and fragmented Guanaco populations occur in the Andean foothills of the extreme north, scattered small pockets along the coast, the north-central zone in the lower Andes, and central Chile exclusively in the Andes (González 2010a, González<em> et al.&#160;</em>2013).<br/><br/>In Argentina most of the world’s remaining Guanacos are found. Although its range covers nearly all of the Argentine Patagonia, Guanaco populations appear to be more scattered towards the northern provinces of the country (Chubut, Río Negro, Neuquén, and Mendoza) compared to the southern region (Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego; Baigun <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wildlife Conservation Society 2012). Throughout northern Patagonia, distribution is highly fragmented in relict populations in the La Pampa and southwestern Buenos Aires Provinces. In central and northern Argentina, Guanaco distribution is restricted to the western half of the country along the pre-Andean and Andean mountains up to the border with Bolivia (Baigún <em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). Recently a relict population has been reported in the arid Chaco of northwestern Córdoba (Schneider <em>et al</em>. unpublished data) and in Córdoba Guanacos have been reintroduced (Barri and Cufré 2014).</span></span></p>","<p>The call for the management and wise use of Guanaco products (fine undercoat/fiber and meat) put forth over the past several decades as an alternative approach to traditional conservation and strict protection (Franklin and Fritz 1991, Franklin <em>et al.</em> 1997) is now in the pioneering stages trying to establish itself as a wildlife production system (Hudson 1989). Research and application of meat harvest programs have been conducted on Tierra del Fuego, Chile, after monitoring population (Skewes<em> et al.</em>&#160;1999, Skewes <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Soto 2010). <span lang=""EN-GB"">Nearly 23,000 animals have been harvested for meat between 2003 and 2015 in Chilean Tierra del Fuego with products primarily exported or used in the local market (N. Soto, pers. com. 2016). <span lang=""EN-US"">Fiber utilization was achieved initially from Guanaco farm individuals captured in the wild as newborns and raised in captivity during the 1980s and 1990s (Bas and González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000), but this approach has largely been discontinued because of high husbandry costs and world instability in the specialty-fiber market.&#160; Another approach, as mentioned above, holds more long-term promise from capturing, shearing and releasing of individuals in wild populations in programs being developed in Argentina. Finally, non-consumptive use, such as tourism, has also helped promote the aesthetic value of the species, especially in wild protected areas (Franklin <em>et al.&#160;</em>1997).<br/></span><br/>A major management program funded by the government is currently being developed in the Patagonia of Argentina for fine-fiber utilization of wild-live captured animals on protected areas. This type of management was at its height during the last decade between 2004-2008 when some 11,000 Guanacos were shorn (Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Lichtenstein 2013). Since then the number of animals has decreased due to international price variations for crude fiber. As a result, there has been a strong incentive to generate Guanaco fiber products as the local level, including yarn and thread (Lichtenstein pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services and Values<br/></strong>The importance of the Guanaco is based upon a multiple set of values (González 2010b). The most basic is its ecocentric or intrinsic value, that is, as a species its right to live, to exist, independent of the importance of the species to humans. This is an ethical base tangentially related to different groups and non-government organizations within the protective laws of each country.<br/><br/>There are a myriad of anthropocentric values that refer to the importance of a species to humans. The species provides multiple benefits to society, or ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) that are imparted to different segments of human society (Ojasti 2000). Guanacos provide regulating, supporting, provisioning and cultural services at different time and space scales. The benefits of the Guanaco to humans can be assessed by a number of values:</p><p></p><ul><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Existence Value&#160;</strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">that can be achieved through investment or payment to insure the existence of Guanaco populations without assumptions for its later use, is still in the beginning stages for this species.&#160; Nevertheless, the work of private organizations like Wildlife Foundation, Patagonia Conservation, and the Wildlife Conservation Society have indirectly assured the Guanaco’s future by acquiring large-land holdings for the conservation of ecosystems that include the species.</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Evolutionary Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>, </strong>through the Guanaco’s heritage of nearly 40 million years of evolution from its ancestors in North American (Franklin 1982, in press) and its anatomical and physiological adaptations (González <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006), its adaptiveness has enabled the species to become the dominate-wild mammal in Patagonia and parts of the Andean mountains of South America (Franklin 2011). This value is important when management is planned and its use is assessed, especially when contrasted with introduced-exotic animals.</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Ecological Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>, </strong>the Guanaco has a major role and broad component in the trophic and ecological network of the South American Andean, Patagonia, and aridland ecosystems. It has been observed that in the absence of this large herbivore, the Puma will consume other prey that are of importance to humans, namely domestic sheep (Novaro <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, Laguna <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The Guanaco modifies plant growth in such a way that reduces dry matter prone to fire (Fuentes and Muñoz 1995) and disseminates seeds through the use of dung piles that promotes the recycling of nutrients and colonization of degraded soils (Cortés <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Henríquez 2004, Cavieres and Fajardo 2005). In addition, the padded feet of Guanacos do far less damage to soft soils compared to cloven hoofed livestock (König <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, König <em>et al</em>. 2015). They are also an important prey of predators and their remains are significant to scavenging animals, all of which contribute to ecosystem health and cycles.</span></li><li><strong><span lang=""EN-GB"">Productive <span lang=""EN-GB"">Value</span></strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>,</strong> applies to a number managed Guanaco populations for the important production of fibre (hair) and meat (see section on Use and Trade). Guanaco fibre is extremely fine (14-16 microns) and potentially economically valuable, as currently being obtained from live capture and release programs in the Patagonia of Argentina. Also, the value of its meat is being harvested from populations in Tierra del Fuego, Chile.</li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Ethnic Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong> </strong>of the Guanaco is high as an invaluable species that has permitted the existence of humans in a variety of remote and dry environments of South America (Franklin 1982). All indigenous cultures associated with the deserts, Andean mountains, and the Patagonian and Fuegian zones utilized the Guanaco, and in some cases depended upon the species for food, clothing, shelter, and artistic and spiritual inspiration (Miller 1982). Its ethnic value was paramount, thanks to the process of domestication in the Central Andes, in the creation of the domestic Llama (Wheeler 1995). The Guanaco has also been seen to have local aesthetic value (Barkmann <em>et al</em>. 2005, Cerda <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</span></li><li><span lang=""EN-GB""><strong>Conservation Value</strong><span lang=""EN-GB""> of the Guanaco has been successfully used as an indicator, sentry, flag, and charismatic species (Noss 1990) in several parts of its distribution (Chehebar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).

Pigaffeta of the Guanaco in 1521 as an example of Magical Realism. Also, Pablo Neruda in his work “Canto General” (<em>General Song</em> in English) of 1950, dedicated words to the Guanaco in several of his poems. In addition, the Guanaco has been featured in major popular magazine articles and a number of television specials and documentaries by Nova, Nature, Discovery and National Geographic seen by multi-millions of people (see for details <a href=""http://www.camelidosgecs.com.ar/pdf/listado_guanaco_2014.pdf"">http://www.camelidosgecs.com.ar/pdf/listado_guanaco_2014.pdf</a>).</span></li></ul><p></p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Guanaco occurs in a number of protected areas and is included in Appendix II of CITES, thus regulating its international commerce of meat and fine-fiber products to insure that such trade does not threaten the Guanaco’s survival. &#160;In selected areas the sale of Guanaco products in local and international markets has contributed to its “species value” in recovered populations that can be used for reducing human-Guanaco conflict with ranchers and forestry production.&#160; Precaution needs to keep in mind for numerically depressed populations where consumptive and commerce use could irreversibly affect population stability; because of such potential problems, national legislation and international control via CITIES and other programs are relevant and important.<span lang=""EN-US""></span></p><p></p><ul><li>Peru. Recent legislation ratifies the alarming status of the Guanaco in Peru classifying it as Critically Endangered (Ministerio de Agricultura y Riego 2014). Governmental management of populations has been changed from CONACS (Consejo Nacional de Camélidos Sudamericanos = National Council for South American Camelids) to SERFOR (Servicio Forestal = Forestry Service) and local communities.</li><li>Bolivia. The government is working with local NGOs and authorities to strengthen the management of protected areas for the species. The government has issued an official notice to law enforcement offices in relevant regions concerning the protection of the Guanaco. The main conservation aim has been achieved thanks to the permanent presence of trained indigenous parabiologists and park rangers in the remaining range of the species (Cuéllar unpub. data). The situation is similar in Paraguay were the population is very small and the local NGOs and governmental institutions are working to maintain and protect the last remaining populations of Guanacos in the country.</li><li>Chile. The species is protected by the National Hunting Law (Ley de Caza) that regulates hunting, breeding, and in situ use. However, personnel for law enforcement are insufficient. Only 4% of the country’s Guanaco habitat has effective protection (8,354 km<sup>2</sup> in 8 National Parks and 4 Reserves). Additionally, there are fiscal and private areas where hunting is prohibited, either with relict populations (7,750 km<sup>2</sup>) or that directly protect the species (1,212 km<sup>2</sup>). A National Management Plan does not exist, but regionally a Conservation Plan has been developed for northern and central Chile (Grimberg 2010). Finally, Guanacos have been classified as Vulnerable in northern and central Chile and Least Concern in southernmost Chile by the Environmental Ministry (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente 2012), where the Guanaco is included in environmental assessment of investment projects such as mining, energy, infrastructure, and others.</li><li>Argentina. A National Management Plan (Plan Nacional de Manejo del Guanaco, Baldi <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006) was prepared in 2006 and endorsed by the provinces with the highest Guanaco densities. The plan was coordinated by the Federal Wildlife Agency (Dirección de Fauna Silvestre) involving local institutions with its main focus on the Patagonia. The Federal Wildlife Conservation Law (Ley Nacional de Conservación de la Fauna) and various provincial acts provide a legal basis for the protection and use of the species. In Patagonia, Guanaco conservation measures include sustainable use of the species in the wild, regulation of hunting, and closing of some access routes and oil trails. Nevertheless, law enforcement capacity is low since most provinces lack sufficient personnel and equipment to control vast areas. Protected areas in the Patagonian steppe would encompass 10% of the Guanaco population if effective, but most protected areas are rather nominal as they contain livestock, lack wildlife guards, and poaching is common. The percentage of the area under effective protection in the Patagonian steppe is estimated at a disconcerting level of less than 1% (Walker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). In the central provinces there are eleven protected areas (national, provincial and private). In general, progress has been made in legislation and management tools, but implementation is needed.</li></ul><p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It is most often encountered on the remains of stone walls in abandoned agricultural land in more humid areas, where it is seemingly reliant on the presence of vegetation on the walls (R. Vasconcelos pers. obs.). It is entirely absent from arid areas (R. Vasconcelos pers. comm. 2012). It is viviparous and diurnal (Schleich 1987). It is omnivorous (Schleich 1987).","This species has somewhat specific habitat requirements, only being found in humid areas mostly in agricultural land with vegetation-covered stone walls. Increased immigration to Santiago and development of roads has resulted in increased residential and agricultural development (R. Vasconcelos pers. comm. 2012). Formerly abandoned stone walls are being cleared of overgrowth. Although this species co-occurs with humans in rural areas where suitable vegetation remains, this shy skink is much less likely to occur on walls with high levels of recent human disturbance and no vegetation cover. Recent visits to two sites where walls have been recently cleared have failed to detect this skink even where it was formerly abundant (R. Vasconcelos pers. obs.). The large and conspicuous species competes with farmers for fruit, and as such there may be localized persecution which is likely to increase as more people move into this lizard's habitat, to which it may be especially vulnerable as it is is viviparous and so has relatively low reproductive output.<br/>Very recently, the introduction of the exotic lizard <em>Agama agama</em> has been detected around the urban areas of São Filipe and Achada Grande Trás. This species has been shown to prey on endemic skinks (A. Rendall pers. comm.), and if an invasive population becomes established it may therefore represent a threat to <em>C. vaillanti</em>.<br/><br/>There is an active volcano on Fogo, and it is possible that a future eruption may present a localized risk to the genetically isolated subspecies on this island; while the species' predicted occurrence in Fogo extends across much of the eastern near-coastal region, it is conspicuously absent from areas affected by recent lava flows, as well as intervening habitat, which is characteristically barren and devoid of vegetation. Low population densities and reproductive output may make this lizard particularly sensitive to the effects of stochastic events.","This species is not common (Schleich 1987). A 42-day survey of Fogo and Santiago recorded 79 individuals across 127 one km<sup>2</sup> grid cells, and the global population is conservatively estimated to be below 2,500 mature individuals (R. Vasconcelos unpubl. data). As this study was conducted in the dry season, this result is expected to underestimate population densities (R. Vasconcelos pers. comm. 2009). Recent visits to areas where this species was formerly abundant located no individuals in areas where vegetation had been removed (R. Vasconcelos pers. obs.), and subpopulations on all three islands where the lizard is found are therefore considered to be severely fragmented due to the availability of remaining habitat (R. Vasconcelos pers. comm. 2012).",Decreasing,"This species occurs on Fogo and Santiago Islands, and the islet Ilhéu de Cima (one of the Rombos Islets), in the Cape Verde Islands (Miralles<em> et al.</em> 2010).

Its population size is small (estimated to be 9,000 to 10,000 mature individuals), which meets the initial threshold for criterion C. However, although its population size is suspected to have been declining over the past three generations (24 years, based on Pacifici <em>et al. </em>2013) at a rate likely to exceed 10% (based on habitat loss data), this does not meet the conditions for criterion C1 because stronger evidence (i.e., population data) is required to be able to estimate the rate of decline. Habitat loss due to logging and deforestation on New Britain Island over the past three generations (24 years) is estimated to be around 19.95% based on observed rates of 1.53% p/a from 1972 to 2002 and 0.625% p/a from 2002 to 2014 (Shearman <em>et al. </em>2009, Shearman and Bryan 2015). The population is suspected to be declining at a similar rate to habitat loss; there is no indication that the rate of habitat loss will decline or cease, and these declines are expected to approach 40% when measured over the past and future three generation period based exceeding the 30% threshold for criterion A4c.","Animals have been recorded in lowland and hill forests, secondary  forest, plantations, logged forest, and in gardens at the forest edge.

One individual was  found roosting underneath a Heliconia leaf (Smith and Hood 1981). The  species regularly returns to a shaded day roost, foraging at night over a  small area (&lt;1 km from roost) and visiting only a few feeding  locations per evening (Hamilton 2004). <br/><br/>The diet is composed primarily of floral and fruit resources including Japanese Cherries  (<em>Muntingia</em> <em>calabura</em>), cluster figs (<em>Ficus</em> sp.) and Woolly Cedar (<em>Trema  orientalis</em>).

This decline is being caused by habitat degradation, hunting, culling, predation by feral cats and dogs, competition with invasive squirrels (in Taiwan), and synergistic effect of typhoons. If these threats are not addressed promptly in proper conservation programs, a future uplisting to Endangered will be necessary. It should be noted that <em>P. dasymallus</em> was listed as Endangered prior to the 2008 assessment, that currently EN B2 is already partly met under condition b(iii,iv,v) (but not under subcriterion a), and that EN C1 is almost fulfilled. Moreover, out of the five known subspecies, one is on the verge of extinction (<em>P. d. formosus</em> in Taiwan), two are Critically Endangered (<em>P. d. dasymallus </em>and <em>P. d. daitoensis</em>), and the two remaining subspecies are considered Near Threatened (<em>P. d. inopinatus</em> and <em>P. d. yayeyamae</em>). The current absence of conservation efforts on the large majority of the distribution range, the total uncertainty surrounding population sizes and trends, the important threats currently faced, and public attitude towards the species further call for caution.","This is a solitary fruit bat with a broad diet consisting of fruits (of <em>Ficus </em>spp especially), leaves, and nectar. It is particularly important for seed dispersal, especially at long distance and for large seeds (e.g., <em>Terminalia catappa</em>). In Japan, <em>P. dasymallus</em> roosts in dense forests, and can be seen foraging in forests, orchards, and in urban areas. It rests during the day either alone or in small groups hanging from the branches of trees.","In Japan, forest clearance for construction and land conversion to create new agricultural plantations (especially for sugarcane, banana, and pineapple) reduce the habitat available for <em>P. dasymallus</em>. This fruit bat also faces substantial threat from local illegal culls operated by farmers in response to crop damage (Vincenot <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015b). This problem, which has been largely ignored so far, is particularly destructive in conjunction with typhoons, which result in both direct mortality and further reduction in food availability. This vortex of synergistic threats is particularly alarming, because it remains unacknowledged and unaddressed by researchers and authorities (Vincenot <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Predation by cats and dogs is also a major conservation concern. Powerline electrocutions and accidental entanglements have also been reported (Vincenot <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, hunting brought <em>P. d. formosus </em>to extinction on the Taiwanese mainland in the 1970s (Lee <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). It then remained only on Lutao (also called Green Island), where hunting for export coupled with competition with the invasive Pallas’s Squirrel (<em>Callosciurus erythraeus</em>) rapidly drove the local population from 2,000 individuals to a point at which local extinction was assumed. After several unsuccessful searches for remaining individuals in the 1990s, a recent survey however found four individuals left on the island (S.-F. Chen pers. comm). <em>P. d. formosus </em>has recently been reported to subsist in very small numbers on Guishan (also called Steep or Turtle Island). Studies are needed to assess possible threat factors present at this last location.<br/><br/>In the Philippines, intensive poaching is occurring on some islands (e.g., Babuyan Claro), where <em>P. dasymallus</em> is favoured as a delicacy amongst locals (Oliveros <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004).

On islands  inhabited by people or frequently visited by people, animals roost along  cliffs where human disturbance is minimal and there is some protection  from winds (Mickleburgh <em>et al.</em> 1992, Mildenstein and Mills 2013).  As a medium-sized Old World fruit bat, this species is expected to have  a large foraging range (e.g. Mildenstein 2012). Even on the largest  islands, Mariana fruit bats are known to fly throughout the island’s  forested area while foraging (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1989, USFWS 2010, Mildenstein and Mills 2013, U.S. Navy 2017).<br/><p>Studies  of the species’ diet and role in seed dispersal are on-going. Local  knowledge and observational study suggests 45 plant species (and/or  congeneric species groups) are used as fruit bat food sources in the  Mariana Islands including native and introduced fruits, flowers, and  some leaves (U.S. Navy 2017). Although this species will use  human-cultivated fruits, there is very little conflict with farmers on  the Mariana Islands, probably because of how few bats remain on  human-populated islands and the species’ status as celebrated part of Chamorro cultural heritage.</p>","Natural threats to the species include volcanic eruptions that can  suffocate bats and destroy their habitat (most recently on Anatahan in  2003). Typhoons, which are becoming more frequent and severe, have high  speed winds that injure bats outright and break off fruit and fruit  bearing branches within bats’ habitat causing subsequent starvation.<br/><br/>Human  caused threats to this species are many. The species is considered a  delicacy in the Marianas Islands and has been traditionally hunted with  little regulation. Since the 1980s, USA federal protection has made it  illegal to hunt fruit bats, although some poaching still occurs  throughout the archipelago. The deliberate introduction of non-native  ungulates has lead to the degradation and loss of fruit bat forest  habitat. Fires are used to remove vegetation and provide new growth for  hunted ungulates, and overgrazing by introduced deer, feral pigs, and  goats prevents forest regeneration and promotes the invasion of  introduced plants on many of the Mariana Islands. Finally, on Guam, the  introduced brown treesnake, <em>Boiga irregularis</em>, is thought to be a  predator on young <em>P. mariannus</em> (Wiles 1987, Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1995, Brooke 2008) and therefore a threat to the long-term survival of the population (reduces recruitment).","The total population size of Mariana Fruit Bats is suspected to be  declining (USFWS 2009), although population trends cannot be fully  ascertained given inconsistency in methods used for surveys and  population size estimation. The total number of bats in the Mariana  Islands was estimated to be 8,700 to 9,000 bats in 1983 (Wiles <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1989), while the most recent population size estimate in&#160; 2013 is 7,402 (calculated from various sources in Mildenstein and Mills 2013).<br/><br/>There  have been few and infrequent archipelago-wide surveys (U.S. Navy 2017).  Most islands have relatively few remaining bats compared to purported  historic population sizes (e.g. Wiles <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1989, Cruz <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>  2000, Johnson 2001). The biggest population (&gt;4,500 individuals in  2017) was found on Rota (CNMI-DFW 2017), but this number was reduced  dramatically after two large typhoons hit the island near the end of  2018 (J. Guilbert, CNMI-DFW pers. comm.).<br/><br/>As late  as 2010, two of the larger northern islands (Pagan, Agrihan) had around  1,000 bats each, while numbers on the remaining islands in the  archipelago were &lt;500 (USFWS 2010). There have been no recent counts  to confirm the species’ status on these islands. The most recent,  reported population sizes by island are Guam: 85 (U.S. Navy 2019); Rota:  &lt;3,000 (J. Guilbert pers. comm.); Aguiguan: 50 (Brooke 2009);  Tinian: &lt;25 (Wiles <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1989); Saipan: &lt;50 (Wiles <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em>  1989); Farrallon de Medinilla: &lt;5 (Vogt 2009); Anatahan: 150 (USFWS  2010); Sarigan: 157 (USFWS 2010); Guguan: 226 (USFWS 2010); Alamagan: 86  (USFWS 2010); Pagan: 1,017 (USFWS 2010); Agrihan: 858 (USFWS 2010);  Asuncion: 573 (USFWS 2010); Maug: 11 (USFWS 2010).<br/><br/>Population density (i.e. number of bats per unit area of habitat available on an island) can be used as an index to the population effect of threats on an island (Mildenstein and Mills 2013). It follows that island fruit bat population densities in the Mariana Islands tend to reflect the amount of local disturbance (to the species and its habitat) rather than amount of habitat available on an island (Mildenstein and Mills 2013). Fruit bat densities decline north to south, as islands get closer and closer to the larger human populations in the southernmost islands due to illegal hunting and habitat destruction from people, exotic plants, and animals (US Navy 2017). With little to no human disturbance, the remote and federally protected island of Asuncion in the far north has the highest fruit bat density (1.88 bats/ha), which can be used to project population sizes of other islands in the absence disturbance (i.e. natural carrying capacity) (Mildenstein and Mills 2013).<br/><br/>As a native to the Mariana Archipelago, the population of&#160;<em>Pteropus mariannus</em>&#160;is fragmented by definition of IUCN population-based assessment criteria, but this fragmentation is natural and not a result of human perturbations. The persistence of the bat's meta-population across the islands is dependent on source-sink dynamics that are tied to localized environmental events and natural and unnatural catastrophes.&#160;Although there  is evidence for infrequent migration among neighbouring islands in the  Marianas (especially after extreme disturbance, reviewed in U.S. Navy  2017), the fruit bat population on any given island is regularly closed  given the distance to nearby Mariana Islands. Genetic study of  opportunistically collected faecal samples throughout the archipelago  suggests moderate levels of isolation across the archipelago. Difference between the northern and southern island  groups were most pronounced, but even notable genetic differences were measured between the  most northern islands and those toward the middle of the archipelago.  Amount of connectivity determines the source-sink dynamics of the  metapopulation and is important to consider when managing for the  species’ conservation in the archipelago (Mildenstein and Mills 2013).",Decreasing,"<em>Pteropus mariannus </em>ranges throughout the Mariana Island chain and is  found on 14 islands including Guam and the islands of the Commonwealth  of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). According to remotely-sensed measurements, there are 485 km² of natural habitat available to this&#160;species throughout the archipelago (data from USFWS&#160;compiled in&#160;Mildenstein and Mills 2013,&#160;US Navy 2017).&#160;Based on research documenting the species' inter-island movements and&#160;foraging habits (Mildenstein unpublished data,&#160;Mildenstein and Mills 2013), it is assumed that the&#160;species' area of occupancy (AOO) will be, at maximum, the remaining 485 km² of available forest used for foraging/roosting.","The species is considered a delicacy in the Marianas Islands and has been traditionally hunted with little regulation. Since the 1980s, USA federal protection has made it illegal to hunt fruit bats, although some poaching still occurs throughout the archipelago.",Terrestrial,"The historic trade of this species led to this and many congeneric  species being listed on Appendix I of CITES. Because the Mariana Islands  are a protectorate of the USA, the species is also protected under the  US Endangered Species Act (ESA). It was originally listed as Endangered  only on Guam under the ESA, but because of the presumed level of  connectivity of the metapopulation across islands, is now formally  listed by the ESA as a Threatened species throughout the archipelago. A  draft recovery plan was developed for the  species (USFWS 2009) and is being updated, and management plans are being implemented on Rota  by the (CNMI-DFW) and on Guam by Andersen Air Force Base, where most of  the recent recordings of the species have been (US Navy 2017).<br/><br/>Active  management and research are on-going on Guam and Rota.

There is continuing decline in the area, extent, and quality of habitat  due to expanding subsistence and commercial agriculture, widespread  logging, disturbance at caves and negative impacts of invasive species, such as Little Fire Ant (<em>Wasmannia auropunctata</em>). It is listed as  Vulnerable under criterion B2 because the species is dependent on a very  small number of caves on each major island group, resulting in an area of  occupancy of <em>ca</em> 240-400 km² over six disconnected islands. It is also  listed under criterion C2 because the number of mature individuals is  estimated at fewer than 10,000, the population is inferred to be continually declining and the number of mature individuals in  each of the six subpopulations is estimated to be fewer than 1,000.","The Fierce Leaf-nosed Bat is a cave roosting species and is restricted to a small number of suitable caves and surrounding areas of lowland rainforest. Animals have been found roosting singly or in small groups of up to 12 individuals, often sharing caves with several other bat species, especially other species of <em>Hipposideros </em>(Flannery 1995, Bonaccorso 1998). It is the most robust leaf-nosed bat in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, weighing 70-80 grams. It is believed to hunt from perches on vegetation, flying out to catch invertebrate prey (Lavery<em> et al.</em> 2016). Its robust dentition and relatively low frequency (52–55 kHz) echolocation call suggest it hunts for larger prey.<br/><br/>Genetic sequencing has revealed genetic divergence between sympatric <em>Hipposideros dinops </em>and <em>H. diadema</em> is less than that between <em>H. diadema </em>samples from the Solomon Islands and mainland Papua New Guinea (Lavery 2014). However, where <em>H. dinops</em> and <em>H. diadema</em> co-occur on Guadalcanal, Santa Isabel and in the Western Province they are reproductively isolated. <em>Hipposideros dinops</em> is easily distinguished by its larger size and distinctive long duration, relatively low frequency, echolocation call (Lavery 2015, Pennay and Lavery 2017). It is believed that <em>H. dinops</em> has undergone recent, rapid speciation, diverging from <em>H. diadema</em> in the past 1–2 million years (Lavery <em>et al.</em> 2014).","This species is likely threatened by extensive logging, particularly in the Solomon Islands, where it is estimated almost all accessible (lowland) forests have been logged (Katovai <em>et al. </em>2015). Mining may cause localised loss of habitat. Cave disturbance is also a threat, many locations are visited by hunters, and in Guadalcanal major disturbances (excavation, and fires) have been observed in caves used by this species caused by prospectors searching for rumoured treasures buried by Japanese forces in WWII. The species is not usually hunted for food, but given its large body size, it is taken opportunistically when hunting for other bats (e.g., <em>Dobsonia inermis</em>) inside caves.<br/><br/>Invasive species, particularly Little Fire Ant (<em>Wasmannia auropunctata</em>), which has become widespread on some islands and is likely to be affecting both food resources and causing direct mortality for the species. It is also likely to be predated by introduced cats and rats.","The Fierce Leaf-nosed Bat is uncommon; it occupies a very limited number  of caves and is absent from many apparently suitable caves (Flannery  1995, Lavery pers comm.). Where it is found, it occurs at low densities  with small numbers, usually &lt;12 (Flannery 1995, Bonaccorso 1998). This bat's echolocation call has only recently been described (Pennay  and Lavery 2017) and acoustic surveys may reveal it is easily detected  where it occurs. Pennay and Lavery (2017) reported that its call was  recorded with regularity amongst free flying bats in acoustic recordings  of free flying bats on Guadalcanal and Choiseul Islands (Solomon  Islands), however these recordings were undertaken in close proximity to  caves known to be used by the species. Only a single <em>Hipposideros  dinops </em>call was recorded at 223 m asl, at Kunua, during acoustic bat  surveys on the west coast of Bougainville (J. Novera pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The  number of mature individuals over its range is unknown, however  it is estimated to be fewer than 6,000. The population is divided into six  subpopulations: Bougainville, Choiseul, Isabel, Malaita, Guadalcanal  and the New Georgia (group) representing a distinct subpopulation with  sea crossings between these major islands extremely rare. The number of  mature individuals in each subpopulation is estimated to be fewer than  1,000 mature individuals. The taxonomic relationships between different  island sub-populations are also complex, and each should probably be  regarded as evolutionary significant units for the genus <em>Hipposideros </em> (T. Lavery pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The population is inferred to be declining  based on observed patterns of decline in other island endemic bat  species with small geographic ranges (Lavery <em>et al.</em> 2020) and the  extensive habitat loss and degradation across the main islands in its  range. More than 40% of Bougainville’s lowland forest has been lost or  degraded over the last half century (Woxvold and Novera 2021) and  unsustainable logging in the Solomon Islands has occurred in almost all  accessible lowland rainforest (Katovai <em>et al.</em> 2015). The rate of decline is likely to continue and intensify as logging rates increase on all islands.",Decreasing,"The Fierce Leaf-nosed Bat is present on the islands of Bougainville (Papua New Guinea), Choiseul, New Georgia, Nggatokae Island, Santa Isabel, San Jorge, and Malaita (all in the Solomon Islands). On these islands it appears to be restricted to a few caves and surrounding lowland rainforest habitats from sea level to about 400 m asl (Flannery 1995, Bonaccorso 1998). Only 1 or 2 caves are known to be used by this species in each of the major island groups, although it is likely that unknown caves also exist. The species is dependent on a very small number of caves on each major island group, resulting in an area of occupancy of <em>ca</em> 240–400 km² over six disconnected islands.","The species is not known to be used or traded. It is not usually hunted for food, but given its large body size, it is taken opportunistically when hunting for other bats (e.g., <em>Dobsonia inermis</em>) inside caves.",Terrestrial,"It is not known if this species occurs in any conservation reserves. Further studies into the distribution, ecology, population numbers, and threats to this species are needed along with protection of the known roosting sites and surrounding forests. The taxonomic relationships between the different island sub-populations requires further investigation to clarify their status as evolutionary significant units for the genus <em>Hipposideros</em>.

22165586,12914,Mazama rufina,Vulnerable,A4c,2016,2015-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is confirmed to be Vulnerable due to an ongoing population decline, suspected to be greater than 30%, over a period of 3 generations (21 years) considering both the past (10 years) and future (11 years) due to loss of primary habitat. This species occurs in an area targeted for the use and expansion of illicit crops, which is currently reducing the species' range but has potential to become a greater threat. New highway construction and mining also pose additional future threats to the species. Based on a habitat model of museum records in Colombia, Ecuador, and  Peru shows a habitat reduction of 47% of their original habitat. Most  of the 30% reduction happened in the last ten years, at least in  Colombia, as result of severe deforestation and agriculture. Habitat  destruction has occurred for decades in the range of the Dwarf Red  Brocket. At least 50% of the expected range in Colombia is somehow  degraded due to colonization, deforestation, and burning for coffee  agriculture and cattle grazing (see Threats).","Records from Ecuador include ‘ceja de selva’, elfin forest, and grasslands (3,600 m), cloud forest / montane ‘Yungas’ forests, and sub Andean forests (1,400 m). Records from Peru include the same vegetation types as in Ecuador and Colombia, but without records in grasslands or over 3,600 m. The main habitat of <em>M. rufina</em> is paramos and tropical montane cloud forests above 1,500 m. The paramos are high altitude grasslands (Boom <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001), which are dominated by <em>Calamagrostis </em>spp. and gigantic Andean rosette plants from the genus Espeletia (Luteyn 1992). The tropical montane cloud forest is a type of vegetation that has special climatic conditions causing cloud and mist to be regularly in contact with the forest vegetation (Bruijnzeel and Veneklaas 1998). These forests support ecosystems of distinctive floristic and structural forms with lower canopy and thicker understory than lowland forests (Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1963). <br/><br/>Along its distribution, <em>M. rufina</em> shares the same habitat with the northern pudu (<em>Pudu mephistophiles</em>) (Hershkovitz 1982); the mountain tapir (<em>Tapirus pinchaque</em>) (Lizcano <em>et al</em>. 2002); and the Andean bear (<em>Tremarctos ornatus</em>) (Peyton 1999). Details of its ecology are unknown, although it seems to be solitary, active by day as well as at night, and expected to be a browser/frugivore in the forest understorey. They are shy and secretive animals, rarely seen because of their nocturnal habits. They live either alone or in pairs and normally within a small territory. They usually defecate in latrines probably located at the boundaries of their territories. <br/><br/>The Brocket deer is a frequent visitor of salt licks (Lizcano and Cavelier 2004). In the Central Andes of Colombia its diet is composed of 40 species of plants mainly herbs, from which it prefers plants of <em>Solanum</em> spp. and <em>Begonia umbellata</em> (Lizcano 2006). They rely on their small size and knowledge of the habitat in which they live to escape predators, diving into thick vegetation when detected. Occasionally they present freezing behaviour before escaping. Nothing is known of reproduction or life in captivity. <em>Oxalis </em>sp. has been identified among plant species eaten by <em>Mazama rufina.</em> No research has been conducted to study the home range.","Habitat destruction occurs due to small scale cattle ranching and agriculture practised by local communities through forest cutting and burning of montane grasslands and shrublands. Illegal plantations of opium and Coca may be the main cause of habitat destruction in some areas of Colombia (Alvarez 2007). Mining, road construction and colonization expand habitat loss. Climate change might also result in area or quality decrease of available habitat for the species in the future, since cloud forests and paramos are broadly affected by atmospheric temperature increase (Foster 2001). Hunting occurs as a source of meat and medicinal products at the local level but needs assessment. They are preyed on by a small number of South American predators, such as puma and feral dogs.","Its density is low ranging from 0.06 (individuals/km²) in mature forest to 0.3 (individuals/km²) in ecotone paramo-montane forest. Its preferred habitats are paramo and forest-paramo ecotone over secondary and mature forest (Lizcano 2006). Collection sites in Colombia may be grouped into 3 to 5 locations distributed in the National Park Los Nevados, Las Hermosas, Nevado del Huila, and Doña Ana, and potentially in Pichachos, Macarena, Sumapaz, and Chingaza. Collection sites of Ecuador correspond to locations at Sangay and Podocarpus National Parks. In Peru collection sites are in and around Tabaconas – Namballe (Maravi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). Current distribution and abundance need to be further assessed. A decreasing population trend is suspected from habitat destruction.",Decreasing,"Following (Czernay 1987) <em>M. rufina</em> is restricted to the Andes. It was originally found in montane forest and paramos at altitudes between 1500-3500 m.a.s.l. (Eisenberg and Redford 1999), from the Central Andes in Colombia to Huancabamba valley in northern Peru. It is currently restricted to remnant forest patches and paramos in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In Colombia it occurs in the states of Nariño, Huila, Cauca, Valle del Cauca, Tolima, Risaralda, Quindío, Caldas, and Boyacá (Alberico <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). <em>M. rufina</em> has not been recorded for the Oriental Andes of Colombia (Cuervo <em>et al</em>. 1986, Alberico <em>et al</em>. 2000). Although <em>M. rufina </em>is not included in the list of mammals of Antioquia state (Cuartas-Calle and Muñoz-Arango 2003), photographic evidence of its presence and of its being hunted was recorded at the “Páramo de Belmira” in the Central Andes of Antioquia (Delgado-V. pers. obs. 2003), which is the northern most record for this species. In Ecuador it was recorded in the western and eastern Andes along the Chimborazo region axis (Tirira 2001). In Peru it is distributed on the eastern flank of the Andes in the watersheds of the Amazon river.<br/><br/>The southern limit of <em>M. rufina</em> is the Huacabamba valley which also acts as a biogeographical barrier for other mammal species (Hershkovitz 1959, 1982, Eisenberg and Redford 1999).

Ecological niche modeling efforts by León-Tapia and Cervantes 2018 found a restricted and isolated pattern of habitat suitability for this species.

45180356,19742,Romerolagus diazi,Endangered,"B1ab(i,ii,iii,v)+2ab(i,ii,iii,v)",2019,2018-08-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Volcano Rabbit is endemic to a small region along the Transverse  Neovolcanic Belt in central Mexico where it occupies a restricted and  specialized habitat on five mountain massifs (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino  2018). This range is becoming increasingly fragmented and the area of  available suitable habitat is decreasing (Velazquez 1994, Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2016, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018, Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em>  2018). This rabbit is being threatened by competition with grazing  livestock, increasing frequency of fire, intrusion by humans  (settlements, roads, etc.), and climate change. Models extrapolating its  persistence in a metapopulation context under climate change indicate  that it is likely to be severely impacted (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2009).  Its current EOO is 2,469 km², and an overestimate of the AOO is &lt;444  km² (based on the sum of 19 relatively large habitat polygons, in which  the species is further fragmented). The high level of current  fragmentation and the multitude of ongoing threats are likely to lead to  further decreases in area occupied. Thus, the Volcano Rabbit qualifies  for Endangered status (EN B1ab(i,ii,iii,v) + B2ab(i,ii,iii,v)).<br/><br/>Reports  that the Volcano Rabbit has gone extinct in the vicinity of the Nevado  de Toluca (Mexico Daily News 2018) are false. Native populations of the  Volcano Rabbit have never been in the Nevado de Toluca. A colony was  introduced in the 1970s and sometime later a single individual was  captured and taken into captivity, since then there have been no  verified records of the species in this area. The Nevado de Toluca is  not included in the current distribution map for the species.","The Volcano Rabbit is a habitat specialist (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993, Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em>  2018, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). It is found at its highest  density in a subalpine habitat containing bunchgrass (“zacaton”) and  pine communities (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993, Hunter and Cresswell 2015, Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>  2015). The largest remaining area of preferred habitat resides in the  Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park, between 3,400 and 4,200 m  (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). A study conducted on the Iztaccihuatl  volcano found that preference was shown for areas that had low  occurrence of “closed forest, long grass, cattle grazing, hunting, bare  ground and incline” (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). Contrary to previous  findings, the study suggested that an increase of recent fire activity  resulted in increased abundance of the rabbit, resulting from improved  habitat quality from reduced competition to bunchgrass (Hunter and  Cresswell 2015). However, regular use of fire to benefit cattle grazing  is not recommended given that cattle grazing proved to be more  detrimental to the Volcano Rabbit than the benefit of improved habitat  quality (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). Further, prevalence of fire led to a  decrease in population persistence (VORTEX modeling, Portales <em>et al.</em>  1997). A second study in the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountain Range found  that, in addition to the previously mentioned factors, proximity to  highways and population centers had a negative impact on abundance,  although this study did not find a correlation with regard to slope (the  effect of fire was not examined) (Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Until  today, habitat fragmentation has not resulted in the loss of genetic  variability, nor has it affected the genetic structure of Volcano Rabbit  populations. The values of genetic diversity are similar in populations  that live in a connected landscape and those that live in an  unconnected one. In addition, gene flow has been detected even in  isolated populations (Montes-Carreto <em>et al.</em>, in press).<br/><br/>The  diet of the Volcano Rabbit is diverse. It is known to consume more than  70 plant species, although the rabbits consume with greater frequency  zacatonales of the genera Muhlenbergia, Festuca, and Jarava (Cervantes  and Martínez 1992, Martínez-García <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mancines-Arellano  2017). In areas where bunchgrass is less abundant, they give birth in  cracks and abandoned burrows (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993). It is  unlikely that the Volcano Rabbit constructs burrows of its own (Fa and  Bell 1990). Gestation time for this species is 38-40 days (Cervantes <em>et al.</em>  1990). It may be reproductively active year-round with a peak breeding  season occurring ""during the warm, rainy summer"" (Cervantes <em>et al.</em>  1990). Litter size is one to three (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).  Adults in a captive breeding program weighed 400-600 g, with birth  weights for females 25-27 g and males 32 g (Matsuzaki <em>et al.</em>  1982). Total length of newborns ranges from 8.3-10.6 cm (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990). Mean total length of adults range between 26.8-32.0 (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990). Most activity occurs in the morning and late afternoon (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>A  study conducted in the Itxa-Popo National Park found that the Volcano  Rabbit makes up 12.5% and 5.5% of the prey base for the Bobcat (<em>Lynx  rufus</em>) and Coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>), respectively (Garcia <em>et al.</em>  2014). Additional predators include the Long-tailed Weasel (<em>Mustela  frenata</em>), Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>), and rattlesnakes  (<em>Crotalus </em>spp.) (Cervantes-Reza 1981, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).","The Volcano Rabbit is threatened by habitat destruction, caused by  livestock grazing, agriculture and property development encroachment,  logging, harvest of the “zacaton” grasses, and fires (98% of which are  started by humans attempting to encourage new pasture growth) (Fa and  Bell 1990). Its range is within 45 minutes of one of the world’s largest  cities (Mexico City) and urban expansion has resulted in habitat loss  (Fa and Bell 1990), which is ongoing. Today, suitable habitat for the  Volcano Rabbit in the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountains covers 7,544 ha,  equivalent to only 13.68% of the landscape, including 957 patches: 293  have a minimum area of 0.25 ha and only two are larger than 1,000 ha  (Uriostegui-Velarde et al 2018). Though hunting is illegal, it continues  because of lack of local knowledge of its protected status, and lack of  enforcement (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990, Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>Reduction  of habitat quality associated to the presence of pasture lands, crops,  and roads may have a stressful effect on the rabbits, as mean cortisol  metabolites levels measured in its faeces were more than two times  higher in highly degraded habitat compared to the low degraded habitat  (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species. Anderson <em>et al.</em>  (2009) predicted that the lower elevation range limit of the Volcano  Rabbit may shift upslope by approximately 700 m during the next 100  years, which will reduce the area occupied by the species, as the  mountain peaks currently lack suitable habitat.","An early estimate of the population of the Volcano Rabbit was 7,085  rabbits; 1,811 individuals in Pelado, 1,816 in Tlaloc, 3,458 in  Izta-Popo and approximately 3,056 for the surrounding areas (Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997). Due to a variety of continuous and ongoing threats, its population is likely to be lower at the present time.<br/><br/>Population  densities estimated by line transects are variable between regions.  Studies conducted on the Pelado Volcano indicated that densities ranged  from 0.11 to 1.2 rabbits/ha according to habitat characteristics  (Velázquez 1994); in the Biological Corredor Chichinautzin the density  was estimated to be 4.2 individuals/ha (Rizo-Aguilar <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). Other studies have shown the relative abundance based on fecal  pellet counts is also highly variable throughout its distribution,  ranging from 0.1 to 3.1 latrines/m² in habitat on the Volcano Pelado  (Velázquez 1994, Velázquez and Heil 1996), and 0.02 to 0.12 latrines/m²  in Sierra Chichinautzin (Rizo-Aguilar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>The  only study that has monitored trends in population was conducted in a  core population in the Sierra Chichinautzin based on density estimates  using pellet counts (Guerrero <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press). This study  indicated that Volcano Rabbit density declined from 4.2 individuals/ha  in 2011 to &lt;1 individual/ha in 2017.<br/><br/>Initial studies indicated  that the Volcano Rabbit occupied fragmented habitat, and that there  were 16 discrete occupied habitat fragments (Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em>  1997); the current number of isolated habitat polygons is 19. More  recent evaluation of the degree of fragmentation within occupied habitat  polygons was able to discern significantly more fine-scale Volcano  Rabbit habitat fragmentation (Uriostegui-Velarde <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).  At the landscape level 957 patches of available habitat covering 75.44  km² were identified along the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountain Range (thus  encompassing Tlaloc Volcano, Pelado Volcano, and Coajomulco forests),  most (N = 293) of which had a minimum area of 2,500 m². Only two patches  were larger than 1,000 ha. 144 plots were sampled intensively, and of  these 50 contained no evidence of Volcano Rabbit presence (no latrines  were located); on only five plots were there more than 100 latrines,  indicating the presence of a highly viable population  (Uriostegui-Velarde <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).",Decreasing,"The Volcano Rabbit is endemic to Mexico, restricted to the Transverse  Neovolcanic Belt, mainly in discontinuous patches on four volcanoes  (Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl, El Pelado, Tlaloc) and the Sierra  Chichinautzin (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>2016, Velázquez and  Gopar-Merino 2018). An initial estimate of area of occupancy (AOO) was approximately 386 km²  based on occupancy on the four volcanoes (Velazquez 1994), although  this area has subsequently been reduced to 335 km². Recent observations,  based on latrine records and sightings in the Biological Corridor  Chichinautzin, have added 109 km² to this distribution (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>  2016). A recent survey in the Parque Ecoturístico Piedra Canteada,  along the Tlaxcala/Puebla border, north of Iztaccihuatl, yielded a  recent siting of Volcano Rabbits, but the extent is unknown  (Ramírez-Albores <em>et al.</em>2014). As a result of the over 15 years  continuous volcanic activity of the Popocatepetl Volcano, the  distribution range has shifted and expanded, locally. Currently, the  discontinuous EOO is 2,469 km². The whole range, however, is becoming  increasingly fragmented as a result of human-induced and natural causes  (Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em> 2018, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>The Volcano Rabbit occurs between 2,900 m and 4,250 m in elevation (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016), but its highest density is found between 3,150 m and 3,400 m (Velazquez 1994).","In some areas, this species is hunted for food.",Terrestrial,"The Volcano Rabbit is listed under Appendix I of CITES (1973), although  the species has never been involved in international trade and this  listing is apparently an historical artifact. Hunting is illegal  according to Mexican law, but poorly enforced (Fa and Bell 1990,  Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). It is listed as endangered in the  Mexican Official Norm NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (SEMARNAT 2010). It occurs  within the protected areas Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks, but  hunting, grazing, and grass burning persist within the park boundaries  (Cervantes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>Captive  breeding programs have been established with some success, but infant  mortality in captivity is very high (Fa and Bell 1990).<br/><br/>It is  recommended that conservation measures focus on habitat management,  particularly the control of burning and overgrazing of the bunchgrass  “zacaton” habitat, and enforcement of the existing laws prohibiting  hunting and trade of the Volcano Rabbit (Fa and Bell 1990, Hunter and  Cresswell 2015, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). Management of the  protected areas should be improved and education plans at local,  national, and international levels should be implemented (Fa and Bell  1990, Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Hunter and Cresswell 2015,  Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).

Measurements of the extent of suitable habitat suggest that this has contracted from perhaps 112 to 47 km<sup>2</sup> as a result of volcanic activity. Little of the species' remaining range is within an area at direct risk from volcanic activity, so this is a past pressure. In recent years, human populations have returned to Montserrat and are settling in the previously largely undisturbed north. This species is only tolerant of a degree of human disturbance, and may be impacted by urban and infrastructure development and greater numbers of cats and rats; the latter are especially abundant in areas with many naturalized exotic fruit trees, including mangoes. At present it seems likely that many of these pressures are localized, and rats seem unlikely to drive the species to extinction.","This species was very abundant and widespread before the latest period of volcanic activity, which began in 1995. It is still likely to be common in the island's north, although recent returning human populations now settling in this formerly undisturbed area may have an impact. Following volcanic activity, only a single adult male was recorded in the volcanic exclusion zone in surveys undertaken in 2009 and 2010, conducted in areas of apparently suitable habitat (Muñoz and Hewlitt 2011).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Montserrat, where it occurs island-wide.

The Montserrat subpopulation was undoubtedly severely impacted by volcanic activity that peaked in the late 1990s. With an area of 102 km<sup>2</sup> Montserrat is the smallest major island on which the species occurs and recent surveys have found the species to be abundant in parts of the island not affected by the volcano, so this must be considered a localized pressure.","This species is found in mesic habitats including humid forests, swamp forest (R. Gomès pers. comm. 2015), coastal vegetation (<em>Terminalia</em>, <em>Hippomane</em>, <em>Coccoloba</em>, <em>Cocos</em>, and <em>Acacia</em>), on the edge of sugarcane fields, banana groves, and fruit tree stands. It is also found in&#160;xeric woodlands.&#160;&#160;It is usually associated with leaf litter and other surface debris; multivariate analyses reveal a significant association with deep leaf litter, high canopy cover and high humidity in Montserrat (Daltry 1999). The diet consists of small invertebrates. It is an egg-laying species (Henderson and Powell 2009). It ranges from sea level to 650 m asl. in humid forest in Guadeloupe (Breuil 2002).","There are not thought to be widespread threats to this species on Guadeloupe (S.B. Hedges pers. comm. 2015). Volcanic activity is likely to have caused a severe range contraction on Montserrat over the past 20 years, however, this represents a limited part of the species' range. Young (2008) describes the species as abundant in the Centre Hills, at the edge of the volcanic exclusion zone; in contrast to Daltry (1999) this author found that the species was more abundant in dry than moist forest. It is not thought to be subject to major threats in Dominica (R. Powell pers. comm. 2015).","The species was extremely abundant on Montserrat before the volcanic eruption in 1995, particularly in moister forest habitats with good leaf litter cover although it was widespread throughout the island. It is likely to have lost at least a third of its range on the island following the eruption, including the wetter area which may have represented the best habitat (J. Daltry pers. comm. 2015), however, Montserrat represents a relatively small part of this species' range. It is very common on Guadeloupe (S.B.

The species is harvested locally as a food resource and is threatened by water quality declines within the lake associated with agricultural runoff. Population trends are unknown due to problems associated with timing of collection. Additional research into the population trend and habitat quality of the species is needed.

It has a slender body with an abdominal concavity that females use to carry eggs until hatching (Parenti 2008). Its exact habitat is unknown, but it is pelagic and is only caught at night using lamps.","The primary threats to freshwater fish within Lake Poso are invasive alien species, eutrophication caused by pollution from multiple sources, and intensive fishing (Parenti and Soeroto 2004). The major threat to this species is likely intensive fishing at night using lamps, as this species is a sought after food fish for communities living around the lake. It is caught using modified nets in both row and motorboats (Gundo 2009, Gundo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, D.F. Mokodongan pers. obs. 2012; 2017). Invasive species such as the Common Carp (<em>Cyprinus carpio</em>) and Nile Tilapia (<em>Oreochromis niloticus</em>) have been introduced into the lake for fishing activities, and may impact this species through predation, competition, and the transfer of disease and parasites (Parenti and Soeroto 2004). Lake Poso is also a clear water lake so it is sensitive to pollution from domestic waste and agricultural fertiliser run off (Parenti and Soeroto 2004). In 1983, volcanic and tectonic activities that occurred within the region are considered to have impacted several Lake Poso fish species.

The population is suspected to have declined since 1985 owing  to a reduction in the Area of Occupancy as a result of volcanic  activity, however the extent of habitat is expected to recover through natural  regeneration so the species is not suspected to be undergoing a continuing decline. Nevertheless, the limited range and small population of this species render it extremely susceptible to future threats, most notably, a serious eruption. In such a case the species may warrant uplisting to Critically Endangered. <p></p>","It is confined to a single small area of <em>Philippia</em> heath woodland around the crater of Mt Karthala.

With this island's large, increasing human population (Louette <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, clearance of forest for agriculture is occurring on all but the poorest soils.

Secondary forest in the agricultural belt is dominated by exotic plants, particularly strawberry guava <em>Psidium cattleianum</em>, which could spread into and degrade remaining native forest. If plans to build a road to Mt Karthala's crater are resurrected, exploitation and fragmentation of the forest, and the spread of exotic species, could be accelerated (Safford 2001)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

It is likely to have been historically more widespread, but extensive targeted searches since its rediscovery, including interviews with local residents, indicate that it is probably now restricted to an area of Woodland Springs with a surviving patch of good-quality secondary forest. Pressures on the lizard's remaining habitat exist from agricultural expansion, and the apparent extreme rarity and likely low size of the remnant population is likely to render it susceptible to predation from several exotic mammal species found on the island.","This semifossorial species is found in mesophilic habitats under rocks and in roots of trees (Henderson and Powell 2009). The Woodland Springs locality is characterized by moist evergreen forest, with some nonnative vegetation but good canopy cover (J. Daltry pers. comm. 2015). It has been sighted in gardens immediately adjacent to the remnant forest (Corey <em>et al.</em> 2010). It is reportedly found in association with streams (Corry <em>et al.</em> 2010). Galliwasps&#160;include both oviparous and viviparous species; the reproductive mode of <em>Diploglossus montisserrati </em>is unknown.","Construction at the edge of the volcanic flow zone is a threat to this area and may impact this lizard; Woodland Springs is a residential area and construction is ongoing to this day (Corry <em>et al. </em>2010). Although its habitat requirements are unknown, it has only reliably been recorded from moderately undisturbed forest. Montserrat's forest more widely is heavily impacted for plantations and other exotic vegetation, and only secondary forest remains across much of the island. Invasive species, including feral pigs, cats, rats and dogs are all likely threats, and considered by Corry <em>et al.</em> (2010) the most important immediate risk to the continued survival of this species, and cane toads are known to be present at Woodland Springs (Corry <em>et al</em>. 2010).

Daltry pers, comm. 2015, Corry <em>et al.</em> 2010). The limited available evidence suggests that this species may be stream-associated, and so may be at risk from capping streams for water abstraction; this practice may also impact the quality of its moist forest habitat (Corry <em>et al.</em> 2010).","This species was not collected between its description and 2006 (Ogrodowczyk <em>et al.</em> 2006).

More recent surveys by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in the last 5-6 years have only found it close to the type locality. Historically it might have been more widespread as the known locality is ecologically similar to the remainder of the Central Hills, however recent volcanic activity may present barriers to dispersal and the failure to record it elsewhere indicates that it may be restricted to the area around Woodland Springs (J.

As such the species would probably qualify for listing as Vulnerable applying Criterion A2, however it is at no immediate risk of extinction and massive declines are unlikely in future as only a minority of the species' remaining range lies within an area at risk from volcanic activity.

For these species an ongoing population decline is suspected; for Izu Thrush the impact of introduced predators is thought to have caused an observed rapid decline and for Izu Leaf-warbler habitat loss and fragmentation are considered to be causing a moderate decline. Siberian Weasel was introduced to Miyake-jima in the 1970s and domestic cats are also widely present, additionally enhanced populations of Large-billed Crow as a result of the availability of food via poor human rubbish disposal. Large areas of natural forest have been replaced by&#160;Cryptomeria&#160;for timber. Road-building and the creation of tourist infrastructure have also been noted to have reduced the extent of natural habitat. In addition the impact of volcanic eruptions is a potential threat to populations in that these events can degrade large areas of habitat. The eruption in 2000 of Mt. Oyama is estimated to have degraded 60% of forest on Miyake-jima, however populations of birds reportedly recovered relatively quickly from this event.

Deposits of volcanic ash have seriously damaged the habitat of the remaining population, and further deposits or an increased frequency of hurricanes could have devastating effects. However, the population trend has since stabilised or even increased, and the species has therefore been downlisted to Vulnerable. Nevertheless, the total population remains very small and given its extremely restricted range is subject to an obvious plausible future threat (further volcanic eruptions) that could drive the species to become Critically Endangered or even Extinct within a short space of time.<br/><p></p> <p></p>","It         occurs in most forest types between c. 150-900 m, but reaches highest         densities in wetter, higher altitude forests, and is absent from areas         of very dry forest (Jaramillo and Burke 1999, G. Hilton <em>in <span class=""SpellE"">litt</em>. 2000, 2003). It is found in all <span class=""SpellE"">successional stages, and sometimes at the edges of         cultivated areas and banana plantations but appears to be an obligate         forest species (G. Hilton <em>in <span class=""SpellE"">litt</span></em>. 2000, 2003). Nesting occurs in March-August, but         the exact timing probably depends on the rainy season (P. Atkinson <em>in <span class=""SpellE"">litt.</em> 1998, 1999, Jaramillo and Burke 1999). Pre-breeding season rainfall increases food availability which leads to improved body condition of females and increased fecundity (Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2013). Nests are mainly suspended from the         leaves of <span class=""SpellE""><em>Heliconia</em><em> <span class=""SpellE"">caribbaea</span></em>, although banana and other         broad-leaved trees are also used (G. Hilton <em>in <span class=""SpellE"">litt</em>. 2000, 2003). Its clutch-size is         typically two or three. Unsuccessful pairs may attempt up to five         clutches; successful pairs can very rarely rear three broods per year (G. Hilton <em>in <span class=""SpellE"">litt</span></em>. 2000, 2003).         It forages at all levels, but particularly in the <span class=""SpellE"">understorey,         feeding mainly on insects, but occasionally also on fruit and possibly         nectar (G. Hilton <em>in <span class=""SpellE"">litt</em>. 2000, 2003).</span></span>","Volcanic         eruptions in 1995-1997 all but extirpated the species from the <span class=""SpellE"">Soufrière and South <span class=""SpellE"">Soufrière         hills. Although volcanic activity was reduced in 1998-2000, the         population continued to decline (G. Hilton <em>in <span class=""SpellE"">litt</em>. 2000, 2003, Hilton <em>et al</em>. 2003).         Potential causes are low insect availability (<span class=""SpellE"">Marske <em>et al</em>. 2007) and/or         chronic ill-health of birds resulting from ash fall on remaining         forest, and other unknown and indirect knock-on effects of volcanic         activity (G. Hilton <em>in <span class=""SpellE"">litt</span></em>. 2000, 2003). Research into reproductive success, using         nest cameras, has also revealed high rates of nest predation by rats         and native Pearly-eyed Thrashers <span class=""SpellE""><em>Margarops</em><em>         <span class=""SpellE"">fuscatus</em>, both of which occur at high but         fluctuating densities (G.

Hilton <em>in <span class=""SpellE"">litt</em>. 2000, 2003).         Conversely, excessive rainfall can also have a negative impact. A feral         pig population is spreading fast and could cause serious damage to the         forest habitat if not eradicated, it damages a key nesting plant for Montserrat Oriole, <em>Heliconia caribaea</em> (Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2015). <span class=""SpellE""><span class=""SpellE"">Despite being previously proposed as a threat, there is no nest         parasitism by Shiny Cowbird <em>Molothrus bonariensis</em> because this species does not currently         occur on Montserrat (P.

Initially, only the         Centre Hills (c. 14 km<sup>2</sup>) population was thought to have         survived the <span class=""SpellE"">pyroclastic flows (although even         this area was heavily <span class=""SpellE"">ashed) (P.

Montserrat has an area of 102 km<sup>2</sup> and there is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of the species' habitat in the island's north, however the population is not severely fragmented and, while the number of locations is unclear, it probably exceeds 10 due to the localized nature of these threats.","This ground dwelling species occurs in mesic to xeric environments, being found in mixed forest and pasture situations, meadows, and beaches (Henderson and Powell 2009). Generation time is expected to be around 3-4 years; by around 6 years of age pholidoscelids appear to be no longer in good breeding condition (R. Powell pers. comm. 2015). Clear-felling associated with construction is likely to impact this species, although it may persist at lower densities in the resulting degraded habitats.","Eruptions from the Soufriere Hills volcano may represent a major threat (Henderson and Powell 2009); this species is however thought to be absent from most of the exclusion zone following the destruction of most suitable habitat in the late 1990s. Further volcanic activity therefore represents little danger. Based on the loss of suitable habitat it is likely that this species has lost at least 30% of its population since 1995, with a major decline likely having taken place following the main eruption in 1998. The species is at some continuing risk from development of remaining forest habitat in the north, and associated increases in the numbers of invasive species, but this is likely to depress populations rather than lead to complete extinction in these areas.","The population has declined markedly in abundance since the Soufriere Hills volcano began erupting in 1995 (Henderson and Powell 2009), with volcanic activity peaking in the late 1990s. Human populations displaced by the volcano have recently been re-established in the formerly lightly-disturbed north of the island.

This snake is a likely factor in the extirpation of the reed-warbler's sister species from Guam. Should the recorded rate of decline be lower than suggested then the species may become eligible for downlisting in the future, though the number of extinctions within this species complex and the potential threat posed by accidental introductions would suggest that extreme caution be employed prior to any lowering of the threat status.","On Saipan, it occurs in thicket-meadow mosaics, forest edge, reed-marshes and forest openings (Craig 1996)<strong></strong>.

During the early 20th Century the native forest habitat was devastated by agriculture such as sugar cane and the invasion of Saipan by the US military (J. E. Gourley<em> in litt.</em> 2012). Persistent reports from the island of Saipan suggest that the Brown Tree Snake (<em>Boiga irregularis</em>) may be in the process of becoming established there (Rodd and Savidge 2007) and unless it can be controlled, the reed-warbler population is likely to be extirpated rapidly once snake numbers have reached the point where they impact bird populations.

Maturin <em>in litt.</em> 1994, Barré <em>et al.</em> 2011,&#160;Dutson 2011). On Tinakula, it inhabits patches of old growth and regenerating forest at&#160;60-260 m (Pierce 2014).<p></p>","Introduced rats, cats, dogs and pigs are found throughout Utupua and Espiritu Santo. Tinakula is free of rats and cats but has yellow crazy ants (Pierce 2014). People frequently visit to hunt ground-doves, chickens (<em>Gallus gallus</em>), <em>Chalcophaps indica</em> and fruit bats, as well as gathering fruits, felling trees for canoes, and rearing piglets brought from the mainland (R. Pierce <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Most individuals on Tinakula were collected in 2017 (N. Collar <em>in litt.</em> 2017). Cyclones and volcanic eruptions are a high risk, particularly on Tinakula where a major eruption in October 2017 killed a large part of the species's population (N. Collar <em>in litt. </em>2017). Forest has been and is being extensively cleared and degraded on Utupua and Espiritu Santo although, on Espiritu Santo, much of the land is too steep for commercial logging and there are few hill villages and gardens above c.500 m. A recently identified threat in Vatthe Conservation Area is the establishment of the invasive vine <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Merremia peltata</span>, which causes the death of large numbers of canopy trees. Approximately 2,300 ha (92%) of Vatthe forest has been affected, some 1,300 ha of which is too severely affected for control of the vine to be sufficient for restoration, and needs to be replanted (Maturin 2012). The species may also be hunted, and may be out-competed by the Common Emerald Dove&#160;<em>Chalcophaps indica</em> in degraded forest habitats (Bregulla 1992, S. Maturin <em>in litt.</em> 1994, G. Dutson <em>pers. obs.</em> 1998, D. Gibbs <em>in litt </em>1999)<strong></strong>.<p></p>","<p>The population size has previously been listed as 600-1,700 mature  individuals. It is probably now much smaller as a result of the losses from Tinakula, and given that it was only  a rough estimate, the population size may have been smaller than this  in the first place. As the species is only very rarely recorded on Espiritu  Santo, the population size there could be very small. Using the lowest  population densities of former congeners (genus <em>Gallicolumba</em>)  and assuming only a proportion of its range in Espiritu Santo is occupied would give  a population size there in the range 210-1,055 mature  individuals.</p><p>The recent survey on Tinakula found 15 individuals – 11 males and 4  females, although it is not certain whether these were all mature  individuals (although Baptista <em>et al. </em>[2018] describe a  different plumage colouration in juveniles, so it is possible that all  counted individuals may be mature), and it is not known whether this is  the total population on the island, or whether there may be some other  individuals present still. The skew in the sex ratio of individuals  found means that a lower population size should be used (<em>per </em>IUCN  Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2017), but again it is unknown  whether it is possible for all individuals in this very small population  to successfully breed. Given the uncertainty, it is <em>very </em>tentatively  suggested that the population size for Tinakula be assessed as 8-15  mature individuals. This would then give an overall global population in  the range 218-1,070 mature individuals, equating roughly to 300-1,600 individuals in total.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Alopecoenas&#160;</em><em>sanctaecrucis</em> is currently known for certain only from Tinakula in Temotu province (Santa Cruz Islands), <strong>Solomon Islands</strong>, and Espiritu Santo, <strong>Vanuatu</strong> (Bregulla 1992, D.

However, in 2017, trappers went to Tinakula and collected a large number of  individuals from the population there, some of which ended up in the  cagebird market, although some were confiscated in the Solomon Islands  before they could leave the country (N. Collar <em>in litt. </em>2017).  Then in October 2017, the Tinakula volcano erupted, destroying a large part  of the island, and potentially killing a large proportion of the species's population on the island (N. Collar <em>in litt. </em>2017). A survey that took place in mid-December 2017 on Tinakula found some individuals still living in the wild on the island. In total this  survey located only 11 male and 4 female Santa Cruz Ground-doves (which  could potentially equate to the whole population on the island), while  109 individuals rescued from trade are now being safely kept in  captivity in the Solomon Islands (OceansWatch 2017, Assomull 2017).&#160;<br/>It survives on Espiritu Santo (3,955 km<sup>2</sup>) which has extensive forest.

Most shearwaters are taken by cats when they land in parts of the forest where the understorey is practically absent (Martínez-Gómez and Jacobsen 2004). The introduction of pigs to Isla Clarion in 1979 led to local extinction of the species by 1990 (Howell and Webb 1990, Everett and Pitman 1993). Subsequently pigs have been eradicated from the island and some other shearwater species (though not this species as yet) have been recorded returning to the island to breed (Wanless <em>et al</em>. 2009). Sheep and goats are destroying nesting habitat across some parts of the colonies, through overgrazing and soil compaction (Santaella and Sada 1991). However, the largest breeding grounds were found in the north and northwest of Socorro’s mountain summit where the vegetation has not been severely damaged by introduced herbivores. Feral sheep and goats were completely eradicated from Socorro in 2012, resulting in a rapid and remarkable recovery of the local vegetation cover (Ortiz-Alcaraz <em>et al.</em> 2017). Rabbits were introduced to Isla Clarion in 1979 and caused significant damage to nesting habitat and directly competed with Townsend's Shearwaters for burrows, which is likely to have hastened the extinction of the species on the island (Santaella and Sada 1991, Everett and Pitman 1993). House Mice have also been identified as having a significant negative impact on the species on Socorro (Islands Conservation <em>in prep</em>.).

132642113,22698335,Phoebastria albatrus,Vulnerable,D2,2018,2018-08-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Vulnerable because, although conservation efforts have resulted in a steady population increase, it still has a very small breeding range, limited to Torishima and Minami-Kojima (Senkaku Islands), rendering it susceptible to stochastic events and human impacts. <p></p> <p></p>","<p><strong>Behaviour </strong><em>Phoebastria albatrus </em>is a colonial, annually breeding species, with each breeding cycle lasting about 8 months. Birds begin to arrive at the main colony on Torishima Island in early October. A single egg is laid in late October to late November and incubation lasts 64 to 65 days. Hatching occurs in late December through January. Chicks begin to fledge in late May into June. There is little information on timing of breeding on Minami-kojima. First breeding sometimes occurs when birds are five years old, but more commonly when birds are aged six. It forages diurnally and potentially nocturnally, either singly or in groups primarily taking prey by surface-seizing (ACAP 2009). During the breeding season, individuals nesting off Japan forage over the continental shelf (Kiyota and Minami 2008). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding. </em>Historically, it preferred level, open, areas adjacent to tall clumps of the grass <em>Miscanthus sinensis</em> for nesting.<strong> Diet</strong> It feeds mainly on squid, but also takes shrimp, fish, flying fish eggs and other crustaceans (ACAP 2009). It is routinely attracted to fishing vessels, where it feeds on discards, fish offal and regrettably also occasionally on baited hooks.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>Historical declines were driven by exploitation, the species being targeted primarily for its feathers, but also eggs and oil (ACAP 2009). Today, the main threat is posed by commercial fisheries. The species’ distribution overlaps with fisheries that occur in the shallower waters along continental shelf break and slope regions, e.g., Sablefish <em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em> and Pacific Halibut <em>Hippoglossus</em> <em>stenolepis</em> longline fisheries off the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia (Guy <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species is known to be killed in U.S. and Russian longline fisheries for Pacific Cod <em>Gadus</em> <em>microcephalus</em> and halibut. Since 1983, a total of 15 birds have been reported killed by fishing gear (USFWS 2012), but it is widely considered that the actual mortality from bycatch is considerably higher (USFWS 2008, COSEWIC 2013). Although there have been no reports of this species being taken in demersal longline fisheries in British Columbia, it has been suggested that one to two birds could be taken each year (COSEWIC 2013). Birds on Torishima have been observed with swallowed hooks that can be traced back to the Japanese fisheries that operate near the island (ACAP 2009). Other threats include mortality and habitat loss from the active volcano on Torishima, typhoons and potential oil spills (G.R. Balogh <em>in litt.</em> 2008). Models have shown that even small increases in chronic mortality rates, such as those resulting from bycatch, would have a greater impact on population trend than stochastic and theoretically catastrophic events, such as volcanic eruptions (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>At the end of the 2013-2014 breeding season, the global population was estimated to be 4,200 individuals, with 3,540 birds on Torishima, 650 birds on the two islands in the East China Sea and 10 birds on Ogasawara Islands.&#160;Eda <em>et al</em>. (2012) showed that two populations of <em>Phoebastria albatrus</em> <span lang=""EN-US"">existed about 1,000 years ago and suggested that descendants of each population have segregated breeding colonies on Torishima and on the two islands in the East China Sea. The sequence divergence between the two clades is greater than between other Diomedeidae sister species (Eda and Higuchi 2012). The trend of assortative mating was indicated among birds from the Torishima and the two islands in the East China Sea (Eda <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>",Increasing,"<p><em>Phoebastria albatrus</em> breeds on Torishima in the western Pacific and Minami-kojima and Kita-kojima in the East China Sea in <strong>Japan</strong>. Historically, there are believed to have been at least nine colonies south of Japan and in the East China Sea (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006). Its marine range covers most of the northern Pacific Ocean, but it occurs in highest densities in areas of upwelling along shelf waters of the Pacific Rim, particularly along the coasts of Japan, eastern <strong>Russia</strong>, the Aleutians and Alaska (to <strong>U.S.A.</strong>) (Piatt <em>et al.</em> 2006, Suryan <em>et al.</em> 2007). The species has also been encountered as far north as the Chukchi Sea (Day <em>et al.</em> 2013). During breeding (December - May) it is found in highest densities around Japan. Satellite tracking has indicated that during the post-breeding period, females spend more time offshore off Japan and Russia, while males and juveniles spend greater time around the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea and off the coast of North America (Suryan <em>et al.</em> 2007). Juveniles have been shown to travel twice the distances per day and spend more time within continental shelf habitat than adult birds (Suryan <em>et al</em>. 2008). The species declined dramatically during the 19th and 20th centuries owing to exploitation for feathers, and was believed extinct in 1949, but it was rediscovered in 1951. The current population is estimated, via direct counts and modelling based on productivity data, to be 4,200 individuals, with 3,540 birds on Torishima, 650 birds on 2 islands in the East China Sea and 10 birds in Ogasawara Islands (Japan) (H. Hasegawa <em>in litt. </em>2014, Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017). In 1954, 25 birds (including at least six pairs) were present on Torishima. Given that there are now 650 breeding pairs on Torishima (H. Hasegawa <em>in litt. </em>2014), the species has undergone an enormous increase since its rediscovery and the onset of conservation efforts. In Ogasawara Islands, a historic breeding site, one nesting pair has been observed on Mukojima in 2013 and one chick was produced in 2016 (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017). Another pair was observed on Nakoudojima in 2014 and 2015 and one chick was produced in 2014 (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017). In 2016, one additional unidentified pair produced a chick on Yomejima. In addition, in 2010, one nesting pair was observed on Kure Atoll (Hawaii), but was probably two females and thus, unsuccessful, and one chick was produced on Midway Atoll (M. Naughton pers. comm. 2011).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway&#160;</strong>In 2001 and 2007, respectively, the USA and Canada released National Plans of Action to reduce the bycatch of seabirds in longline fisheries (NMFS 2001, DFO 2007). In 2002, the use of tori (streamer) lines became a mandatory condition of licence in commercial halibut, sablefish, and rockfish&#160;<em>Sebastes</em> spp. longline fisheries on Canada’s west coast (DFO 2007). In 2003, the Committee on the Conservation of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed <em>Phoebastria albatrus</em> as Threatened in Canada (COSEWIC 2003); and in 2005, the species was added to Schedule 1 of Canada’s Species at Risk Act, as Threatened (EC 2008). In 2008, Canada and the USA released final recovery strategies for the species (EC 2008, USFWS 2008); and in 2013, <em>Phoebastria albatrus</em> was re-assessed by COSEWIC; and once again it was listed as Threatened (COSEWIC 2013).&#160;Mitigation measures have been established in the Alaska demersal longline fishery and in the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery (NOAA 2008). Streamer lines (both heavy weight lines for large boats and lightweight lines for smaller vessels) have been designed to keep birds from longline hooks as they are set, and these are being distributed free of charge to the Alaskan longline fleet (USFWS 2008), though they are not deployed in near-shore waters. In 2006, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission passed a measure which requires large tuna and swordfish longline vessels (&gt;24m long) to use a combination of two seabird bycatch mitigation measures when fishing north of 23 degrees North. Torishima has been established as a National Wildlife Protection Area and National Special Natural Monument. In 1981-1982, native plants were transplanted into the Torishima nesting colony in order to stabilise the nesting habitat and the nest structures. This has enhanced breeding success, with over 60% of eggs now resulting in fledged young. Decoys have been used to attract birds to nest at another site on Torishima since 1993 and the first pair started breeding at this new site in November 1995. The number of chicks fledged from this new colony has increased from one chick in 2004 to four chicks in 2005, 13 chicks in 2006 and 16 chicks in 2007. In October-November 2007, 35 eggs were laid at this new site (Sato<em> </em>2009). To expedite new colony establishment, in 2007, the Japanese government approved a project that chicks translocated from Torishima were hand-reared on a non-volcanic and former breeding island, Mukojima, 350 km away, (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2012). From 2008-2012, 70 chicks were translocated and 69 chicks successfully fledged (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2014). 27 hand-reared birds returned to Mukojima at least once per breeding season from 2011-2016 (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017). Two hand-reared birds successfully paired with naturally reared birds and fledged two chicks at Mukojima and neighbouring island, Nakodojima, 5 km away, during this period (Deguchi <em>et al</em>. 2017).<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed&#160;</strong>Continue to promote measures designed to protect this species from becoming hooked or entangled by commercial fishing gear. Promote conservation measures for the population of two islands in the East China Sea. Promote taxonomic re-evaluation through comparative studies of morphological, genetic, ecological, and ethological traits of birds on Torishima and the two islands in the East China Sea (Eda <em>et al</em>. 2016). Continue research into the at-sea distribution and marine habitat use through satellite telemetry studies.

Individuals arrive at colonies in September, laying in early October with chicks hatching in December and fledging between April and May. Immature birds begin to return to land at the age of two with the numbers of returning birds increasing up to the age of six. The median age of first breeding is 10 years (range 8-13) (ACAP 2009)<strong></strong>. During incubation, breeding birds tend to remain in areas adjacent to or to the north of their colonies in the shelf, shelf-break and shelf-slope waters (ACAP 2009)<strong></strong>. At Campbell Island, Black-browed Albatross show a unique bimodal foraging strategy, alternating between short trips to shelf areas around the breeding site and long trips to the Polar Front (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. Birds foraging over the Benguela Current during the winter also showed a bimodal feeding strategy, alternating trips over deep, oceanic waters with trips over the continental shelf (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. During incubation on South Georgia, satellite tracking reveals males and females forage in different areas with almost no overlap (Phillips <em>et al. </em>2004)<strong></strong>. After breeding, birds from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) winter on the Patagonian Shelf (N. Huin <em>in litt</em> 2008) and estuaries in Buenos Aires province (Río de la Plata and El Rincón) (Copello <em>et al.</em> 2013), whereas birds from South Georgia predominantly migrate to South African waters, spending the first half of the winter in the highly productive Benguela Current (<strong></strong>Phillips <em>et al. </em>2005)<strong></strong>. Black-browed Albatross from Chile make use of the Chilean Shelf, the Patagonian Shelf, and some spend the non-breeding season around north New Zealand. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding </em>The species nests colonially on steep slopes with tussock grass, sometimes on cliff terraces, but the largest colonies in the Falklands (Islas Malvinas) are on flat ground along the shore line. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> It feeds mainly on crustaceans, fish and squid, and also on carrion and fishery discards (Cherel <em>et al. </em>2002, <strong></strong>Arata <em>et al. </em>2003, <strong></strong>Xavier <em>et al. </em>2003, Mariano Jelicich <em>et al.</em> 2014)<strong></strong>. A Wilson’s Storm-petrel was recorded in the stomach contents of a bycaught individual on the Patagonian Shelf (Seco Pon and Gandini 2008), and while various Sphenisciformes and Procellariiformes have been found in the stomachs of albatrosses, penguins tend to be recorded more frequently, although none are typical prey items (Seco Pon and Gandini 2008). The exact composition of its diet varies depending on locality and year (ACAP 2009)<strong></strong>.<strong> <br/></strong><strong>Foraging Range </strong>During chick-rearing, breeding <em>T. melanophrys </em>initially stay in shelf to shelf-slope areas very close to their colonies (within c. 500 km). Later, birds from Chile and South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur) may also travel up to c. 3,000 km from their breeding sites, especially to the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkney Islands, but birds from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) and Kerguelen continue to remain close to their colonies (ACAP 2009)<strong></strong>.&#160;During the non-breeding period adult birds from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) dispersed north of their colonies up to southern Brazil (Copello <em>et al.</em> 2013).<p></p>","<p>The species is threatened by current longline fisheries and the development of new fisheries over much of the Patagonian Shelf, around South Georgia, off the southern African coast and in the Southern Ocean (Tuck and Polacheck 1997, Prince <em>et al</em>. 1998, Schiavini <em>et al.</em> 1998, Stagi <em>et al</em>. 1998). It is one of the most frequently killed species in many longline fisheries including tuna longliners off southern Africa, the pelagic longline swordfish fishery off Chile and Argentine longliners targeting toothfish and kingclip on the Patagonian Shelf (Murray <em>et al</em>. 1993, Gales <em>et al</em>. 1998, Ryan and Boix-Hinzen 1998, Schiavini <em>et al.</em> 1998, Stagi <em>et al</em>. 1998, Ryan <em>et al</em>. 2002 Reid and Sullivan 2004, Bugoni <em>et al</em>. 2008, Favero <em>et al.</em> 2013). Capture rates can vary greatly according to season, number of hooks and type of longline (Bugoni <em>et al</em>. 2008). Mortality in trawl fisheries has also been identified as a major source of mortality for this species over the Patagonian Shelf (Sullivan and Reid 2002, Favero <em>et al</em>. 2011, Seco Pon <em>et al.</em> 2015) and South Africa (Watkins <em>et al.</em> 2007), and was previously estimated to result in minimum 5,000 individuals killed per annum across the deep-water hake trawl fishery in South African waters during winter (Watkins <em>et al.</em> 2008). This threat has since been significantly reduced, largely due to the introduction and use of mitigation measures (Maree <em>et al</em>. 2014). In addition to the commercial longline fishery, this species was the second most frequently recorded bycatch in artisanal fisheries off the coast of Peru (Mangel 2012), suggesting that these poorly regulated fisheries represent a considerable threat to the proportion of the population that forages in the Humboldt current.</p>  <p>Climate change also poses a significant threat to the species. Barbraud <em>et al.</em> (2011) showed that climatic fluctuations have a negative impact on survival. Positive sea-surface temperature anomalies at the species’ wintering ground around Tasmania were identified to have a negative impact on breeding success, while positive sea-surface temperature anomalies had a positive effect (Nevoux <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2007, Rolland <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2008). Extremely low or nil breeding success in some years at South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur) has also been linked to periods of low prey availability in the krill-based trophic system of that region of the Southern Ocean (Xavier <em>et al</em>. 2003), which could be a result of either or both climatic events or overfishing.</p>  Invasive American Mink <em>Mustela vison</em> may pose a serious threat to the species, and feral cats <em>Felis</em> <em>catus</em> are thought to impact on colonies at Jeanne d'Arc Peninsula (ACAP 2009). Volcanic eruptions may pose a risk to certain colonies, but the vulnerable proportion of the population and the probability of incidence is considered too low to cause significant future decline.<strong></strong>   <p></p>","The Falklands Islands (Islas Malvinas) holds the largest number of breeding individuals, estimated at 475,500-535,000 pairs in 2010; Wolfaardt 2012). Most other breeding sites holding large numbers of breeding individuals are in Chile with 55,000 pairs estimated on Diego Ramirez in 2003, 58,000 pairs on Ildefonso in 2012 (Robertson <em>et al</em>. 2013), and 15,500 pairs on Diego de Almagro in 2002 (Lawton <em>et al</em>. 2003). The population size on South Georgia (Georgias del Sur) is difficult to estimate, but based on Poncet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2006) and assuming the rate of decline was c.4% (similar to that of Bird Island), the population there may have been down to 56,000 pairs by 2012 (ACAP <em>unpubl. data</em>). However, this may be an underestimate as, based on surveys conducted in 2014/15 covering 30% of the South Georgia (Georgias del Sur) population, declines actually could have been at c.1.8% per year between 2005 and 2014 (Poncet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, A. Wolfaardt <em>in litt</em>. 2016). There are an estimated c.5,800 pairs in other populations (Antipodes, Campbell, Heard and MacDonald, Crozet, Kerguelen, Macquarie, Snares; ACAP <em>unpubl. data</em>), giving a potential global population of c.700,000 pairs, which equates to 1,400,000 mature individuals.",Increasing,"<em>Thalassarche melanophris</em> has a circumpolar distribution ranging from subtropical to polar waters (ACAP 2009)<strong></strong>, breeding in the <strong>Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)</strong>, Islas Diego Ramirez, Ildefonso, Diego de Almagro, Isla Evangelistas and islets in Tierra del Fuego and in the Mallaganes region (<strong>Chile</strong>), <strong>South Georgia (Georgias del Sur)</strong>, Crozet and Kerguelen Islands (<strong>French Southern Territories</strong>), Heard, McDonald and Macquarie Islands (<strong>Australia</strong>), and Campbell and Antipodes Islands, <strong>New Zealand </strong>(Croxall and Gales 1998, ACAP 2009).

Threats and population status both remain poorly known.  <p></p> <p></p>,"<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is a biennial breeder usually nesting solitarily or in small colonies. Most eggs are laid in October-November, hatch in December-January and chicks fledge in May-June (Croxall and Gales 1998)<strong></strong>. Egg laying is highly synchronous within each colony. Young birds are philopatric, returning to their natal colonies after 7 to 12 years (ACAP 2009)<strong></strong>. Breeding birds from Macquarie Island typically forage in shelf waters around the island; they also utilise sub-Antarctic and Antarctic waters south-west of Macquarie (BirdLife International 2004)<strong></strong>. During chick-rearing, adults from South Georgia feed in Antarctic shelf and shelf-slope areas along the southern Scotia Arc and to a lesser extent in oceanic waters in the mid Scotia Sea (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. It employs a variety of feeding strategies, including surface-seizing, surface filtering and plunging. <br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding </em>It nests on cliff ledges, on a pedestal nest of mud and peat, lined with grass. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> The diet is primarily composed of cephalopods and euphausiids, but birds also take fish and carrion (Thomas 1982, Cooper and Klages 1995)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Foraging range </strong>Satellite-tracked incubating birds from Macquarie Island foraged south of the Antarctic Polar Front, an average of 1,500 km from their breeding sites. Four breeding birds from South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur) followed a typical flight path (38 trips) involving a clockwise route to and from high latitude waters along the southern Scotia Arc, on average travelling 3,800 km, to a maximum range of 920 km from the colony (for further information see Weimerskirch and Robertson 1994, Phillips&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Terauds and Gales 2006, Lawton<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2008, Mackley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","<p>Reports from New Zealand, Australia and Japan indicate that the species is caught in tuna longline fisheries (39 returned from observers in New Zealand fisheries in 1996-2005) (C.

The continued presence of pigs on the main Auckland Island is likely to be impacting breeding success, with chick predation strongly suspected wherever nests are accessible to pigs (Phillips et al. 2016, R. Phillips <em>in litt.</em> 2018). Cats are known to have a negative impact on breeding success on the Kerguelen Islands (ACAP 2009). On Marion Island, house mice <em>Mus musculus</em> are killing up to 5% of chicks annually and this rate is likely to increase unless mice are eradicated (Dilley <em>et al</em>. 2015). Rats have been eradicated from most New Zealand colonies.

Wiedenfeld <em>in litt</em>. 2011).</p>  <p>The island of Fernandina is volcanically active and eruptions pose an unpredictable and inevitable threat to local populations (Wiedenfeld and Jimenez-Uzcategui 2008).</p>  <p>As with other island endemics, the species is highly vulnerable to invasion by non-native species. Dogs <em>Canis familiaris&#160;</em>were eradicated in 1981-82 (Calvopiña 1982 <em>in </em>Valle 1986). However, the likelihood of permanently eliminating all dogs from Isabela is considered to be low, because they are still present on the volcanoes Cerro Azul and Sierra Negra as well as on farms outside the national park boundaries. The risk of future invasions into nesting areas is high because of easy access along the coast (Valle 1986). Other introduced predators (rats <em>Rattus</em> spp., cats <em>Felis catus</em>) remain on several islands and pose a current threat to the species. Negative serologic findings suggest that the species is immunologically naive and may have a reduced capacity to cope with the introduction of novel pathogens (Travis <em>et al.</em> 2006), yet no severe disease outbreaks have been reported in the species as yet. The protozoan parasite <em>Toxoplasma</em> has been considered a threat, but although antibodies were found in birds sampled on both Fernandina and Isabela Island, no direct negative impacts have been noted (Deem <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p>Previous fishing activity on the Galápagos Islands was modest, but has now become an illegal industry, serving markets worldwide, evinced by the occasional uncovering of large illegal harvests (Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2005). The increase in illegal fishing activities around Fernandina and Isabela (H. Vargas and F. Cruz <em>in litt</em>. 2000, Wiedenfeld and Jiménez-Uzcátegui 2008) is likely to have detrimental side-effects (bycatch and injury from entanglement, competition for prey, disturbance) on resident seabird populations.</p>  <p>Human disturbance from tourism to the Galápagos Islands is regulated (capped at 120,000 visitors per annum) but annual visits of about 100,000 tourists may still be a contributory factor to other threats (Boersma <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>Oil spills could have potentially catastrophic effects on the species as its foraging behaviour includes repeated diving and surfacing, which makes it particularly vulnerable to oiling. Oil spills have occurred in the vicinity of the population in the past (e.g. Jessica oil spill) and pose a severe future threat.</p>  <p>Although the species has proven capable of recovering from disastrous events in the past, further environmental changes and fluctuations will continue to be a threat, and may also be increasing in intensity.</p><p></p>","In 1971-1972, the population was estimated at 800 breeding pairs (Harris 1973).  Between 1977 and 1985, it remained stable at around 650 to  850 mature individuals (Harris 1973, Valle 1986, Valle and Coulter 1987). However,  during the severe El Niño event in 1983, the population declined drastically to 400 individuals, but recovered within a season (Valle and Coulter 1987). In 1986, the population was estimated at 1,000 mature individuals (Rosenberg <em>et al.</em> 1990). After the El Niño event in 1997-1998, growth in the cormorant population has been higher than ever  before in the survey period (1977-2006). In 1999, a total of 900 individuals was counted during the census (H. Vargas and F. Cruz <em>in litt.</em>  2000). In 2006, a total of 1,396 individuals were counted. Still, results as of 2003 show  a decrease in the rate of population growth and a low percentage of  juveniles (3% in 2006), suggesting that the population is stabilizing at  a new high (Jiménez-Uzcátegui and Vargas 2007).

Aquatic vegetation (mainly <em>Myriophyllum elatinoides</em>) on the breeding lakes is essential material for floating nests and as habitat for several aquatic invertebrates that form its basic diet<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Chebez 1994). During the first week after hatching, chicks are fed with aquatic beetles (<em>Limnaea </em>spp.)<strong> </strong>(Chebez 1994). The species breeds in colonies of up to 130 pairs from October to March<strong> </strong>(Chebez 1994), but has an exceedingly low reproductive rate with an average of 0.2 young reared per adult per year (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). However, while potential resources for breeding are apparently limited, the resources for adult survival appear to be plentiful, and under natural circumstances adult mortality may be extremely low (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). It occasionally establishes colonies in areas marginal to its main range (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). Individuals tend to have a high fidelity towards the plateaus where they were born (Roesler <em>et al.</em> 2016).<p></p>","The principal threats to the species appear to be introduced American Mink <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Neovison vison,&#160;</span>salmon and trout and climate change (S. Imberti <em>in litt.</em> 1999,&#160;Imberti and Casañas 2010,&#160;Casañas<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2013, Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/>American Mink threaten the species at all stages of its life, with nests, chicks and adults all vulnerable to predation (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Fasola and Roesler 2018). In 2010-2011, an American Mink<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span> killed more than half the adults in a breeding colony of two dozen nests on the Buenos Aires plateau (Roesler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a). Further losses to lone mink occurred in 2012-2013, with 15 adults and 7 juveniles killed at El Cervecero and 10 adults and 5 chicks killed at the very remote C199 colony in La Siberia plateau (<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>Casañas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Given that the Buenos Aires plateau currently holds a large proportion of the population, the presence of American Mink is a serious threat (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Furthermore, American Mink are known to exhibit 'surplus killing', which means that the presence of a single animal could result in the loss of whole grebe colonies (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Efforts to eradicate American Mink are complicated by its dispersal behaviour, with young males dispersing widely and re-occupying lakes (Fasola and Roesler 2018).<br/><br/>Recently, the introduction of trout has been correlated with a decline in breeding numbers at certain lakes (S. Imberti&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2006,&#160;Konter 2008)<strong></strong>. These exotic salmonids compete for food with the Hooded Grebe and modify lake conditions, increasing levels of cyanobacteria which may be harmful to grebes (Lancelotti<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015, Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Izaguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Francisco&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>Surveys between 2006 and 2013 found a number of lakes completely dry, and water levels at known breeding sites were 2-3 m lower than in previous years<strong></strong>&#160;(Konter 2008, Imberti and Casañas 2010, Roesler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a, Casañas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Anecdotal reports indicated reduced winter snowfall without a corresponding increase in precipitation at other times<strong></strong>&#160;(Konter 2008). Research has indicated that lower water levels exacerbate the detrimental impact of introduced fish on the lake conditions and thus on the grebes (Izaguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Given the small size of the population, the failure of an entire colony's breeding effort due to exceptionally high winds, as observed in 2013 at La Siberia, is another potentially serious threat (Casañas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The apparent increase in the incidents of these exceptional winds over the last two decades (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) may be related to overgrazing and/or climate change (Imberti and Casañas 2010).<br/><br/>Excessive grazing by sheep (which causes erosion at lakeshores and limits the growth of emergent vegetation), predation by Kelp Gulls <em>Larus dominicanus</em> at some lakes and attacks by Flying Steamerducks <em>Tachyeres patachonicus</em>&#160;(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997, Imberti and Casañas 2010, Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). The population may be limited by the carrying capacity of rather few lakes with good nest vegetation (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). Volcanic eruptions in the breeding area may have a negative short-term effect because of heavy ash fall, but a long-term positive effect on the productivity of the wetlands (O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). There is oil exploitation on the potential migration route to the Atlantic<strong></strong>&#160;(S. Imberti&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999). Light pollution from cities, as well as oil exploitation and mining, may pose a threat on migration routes (Roesler <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Poor habitat conditions in breeding lakes may have increased competition for nest sites with other waterfowl species (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015). By-catch from fisheries may pose a threat in the winter range (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2016b). The planned construction of two hydroelectric dams on the Santa Cruz River may cause changes to the species's wintering habitats and food availability, thereby threatening the species's wintering areas (Aves Argentinas 2016, Roesler <em>et al. </em>2018a). Research has indicated that although the species winters at three estuaries, before returning to their breeding grounds they congregate at the Santa Cruz-Chico estuary, with almost 95% of the total population recorded there in August 2016 (Roesler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a), meaning that any impact of dams on this estuary could have a great impact on the population.","In 2013, a simultaneous count across all plateaus known to have ever held grebes and visiting virtually every lake with historic records of the species, resulted in a count of 691 adults and 144 chicks in 12 colonies (Casañas<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). During the summer of 2014/2015, 771 adults, 138 juveniles and 12 colonies were recorded across 18 lakes (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys during the breeding season in 2015/2016,&#160;&#160;2016/17&#160;and 2017/18&#160;counted 753, 749 and 776 adults, respectively (Roesler&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016b, 2017, 2018b).

The total population was estimated at 3,000-5,000 individuals in the mid-1980s, with half of these on Meseta de Strobel (Fjeldså 1984, O'Donnell and Fjeldså 1997). Counts on the wintering grounds suggest a decline of 40% over a period of seven years (S. Imberti <em>in litt</em>. 2006). Surveys conducted in December 2006 and January 2009, which revisited key known breeding sites surveyed in 1987 (Lagunas del Sello, del Islote and Tolderia Grande) and 1998 (Encadenadas), also found sharp declines; numbers fell from 452 to 51 at Laguna del Sello, from 700 to 0 at Laguna del Islote, from 90 to 0 at Tolderia Grande<strong></strong> (H. Casañas <em>in litt</em>. 2009) and from 198 to 0 at Lagunas Encadenadas<strong></strong> (Konter 2008). While there is speculation that numbers fluctuate dramatically at breeding sites from year to year driven by movements rather than actual population fluctuations (Fjeldså 1986), overall declines detected on the wintering and breeding grounds appear to have been real and rapid (Roesler&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011b). In both the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 breeding seasons, the species was most abundant on three plateaus: Buenos Aires, Strobel and Siberia,&#160;with five lakes holding almost 85% of the population (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Comparing the total counts made across the same 58 lagoons in 1984-5 (2,352 individuals) and 2010-11 (471 individuals) suggests an overall population reduction of 80% over 26 years, most of which occurred in the Strobel plateau (Roesler <em>et al. </em>2012, Roesler 2016). In 2013, greater resources allowed a simultaneous count across all plateaus known to have ever held grebes and visiting virtually every lake with historic records of the species, resulting in a count of 691 adults and 144 chicks in 12 colonies (Casañas<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2013). During the summer of 2014/2015, 771 adults, 138 juveniles and 12 colonies were recorded across 18 lakes (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).

Their efforts have improved survival rates at a  number of colonies; recruitment is significantly enhanced at nests with Colony Guardians  (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2016a). An awareness-raising program has included displays and theatre productions within the region and the production of a video highlighting the plight of the species, which has been presented to over 100,000 people. An interpretation centre has been established at Río Gallegos, an important wintering area for the species (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).

Members of the Hooded Grebe Project have met with fishing, environmental and conservation agencies in Santa Cruz to inform them of key sites for the species to support decision-making (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). In August 2015, a 'Hooded grebe month' took place, involving&#160;educational, recreational, cultural and artistic activities (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016b). Teachers have been trained about the species's biology and threats (Roesler&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016b).<br/><br/>A monitoring protocol and control program for invasive species has been devised, targeting American Mink, Kelp Gulls (Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2013) and salmonid populations at breeding lakes and identifying routes of arrival. Work is ongoing to eradicate American Mink from the high plateau areas (Roesler <em>et al</em>. 2015<em>, </em>2016b). In 2014/2015, 40% fewer mink were captured compared to 2013/2014 indicating that these control measures were proving to be effective.

It breeds from suburban forest patches to heavily forested areas, including coniferous, broadleaved and degraded forest, on hills and the lower slopes of mountains (up to 1,500 m), where there are watercourses and damp areas. It winters in dark, deeply shaded forest near water up to 2,400 m.&#160;The preferable nesting trees are broadleaved trees such as <em>Prunus</em>&#160;and <em>Quercus</em> sp. (Ishikawa <em>et al</em>. 2012), while they nest on coniferous trees, such as pines and cedars, in some areas (Yamashina 1941, Kurahara 1990). It forages mainly in forest, but will use swamps, rice-fields and farmland and is mainly crepuscular. Breeding has been recorded from April to August (Komiya and Sugita 1975,&#160;Kawana 2006)<strong></strong>. A habitat model showed that precipitation and the number of abandoned rice fields were good predictors of occurrence for this species, with this habitat likely providing food source and nesting trees. Forest plantations were negatively associated with species occurrence (Hamaguchi <em>et al. </em>2014). Earthworms are probably the principal food source, but land snails, cicadas, crabs, and ground and scarabid beetles are all present in its diet (Kawakami <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2005, K. Kawakami <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, Oh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The main threat was previously considered to be deforestation for timber and agriculture in both its breeding and non-breeding ranges.&#160;The drastic decrease in Japan since the 1960s also coincides with the period of a large decrease in forest area across wider Southeast Asia (Kawakami and Higuchi 2003). In the same period, summer visiting birds in Japan had decreased, although resident species were stable or had increased (Higuchi and Morishita 1999). Habitat destruction in the wintering areas is now considered as the main cause of population reduction. However, loss of forest floor vegetation and the subsequent loss of soil due to Sika Deer&#160;<em>Cervus nippon&#160;</em>may also affect viability of breeding populations in Japanese forests (S. Hayama&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Small-scale housing developments, solar power generation, cemetery development, and a general reduction in incentive to maintain biodiversity may also be negatively impacting some breeding sites (Wild Bird Society of Japan [Tokyo]&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The development of dense scrub undergrowth in forest and on abandoned farmland (following a change in traditional agricultural practices) is also believed to reduce the suitability of these habitats for feeding. It has probably been hunted in many parts of its range (including passage sites in northern Philippines and across its wintering area on Mindanao where it gets caught in snares; P. Simpson <em>in litt</em>. 2020, D. Allen <em>in litt</em>. 2020), and suffers from human disturbance (Anon. 2009). It declined rapidly on Miyake-jima in the Izu Islands, where it was formerly abundant, following the introduction of Siberian Weasel <em>Mustela sibirica</em> in the early 1970s. Today nest predation by corvids is an increasing threat as crow populations increase in urban and suburban areas. <p></p>","Previous work in   Japan suggests the assertion that the global population comprises   fewer than 1,000 individuals may have been overly pessimistic.&#160;These estimations are however not considered accurate by some researchers (K. Kawakami <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Recent mating call detections however recorded 23 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup> in rural secondary forests across the Aichi Prefecture in central Japan (Hamaguchi <em>et al</em>. 2014). The total area of rural secondary forests in Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku islands estimates to 72,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thus, the number of mature individuals is thought to be approximately 8,280. However, mating call detection studies have been considered as an unreliable method of monitoring breeding numbers in this instance due to the species's inconspicuous habits and the potential of receiving duplicated records (K. Ohata <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Similar calling surveys have for example not recorded any nests, and as such breeding birds, despite observing other calling individuals. It is also likely that surveys specific to limited sites (the Aichi area in this instance), may not yield results that are compatible with other suitable habitats across the species's range (K. Ohata&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Habitat models have additionally been considered impractical methods of estimating population numbers or trends (J. Kushlan <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Hence, to account for any uncertainty, the true   figure is placed here in the band of 5,000-9,999 mature individuals, roughly equating to 7,500-15,000 individuals. As per the Waterbird Population Estimates, the species is also thought to occur in only one flyaway population across Eastern and South-eastern Asia (Wetlands International 2020).&#160;This is assumed to represent one subpopulation holding all mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gorsachius goisagi</em> breeds in <strong>Japan</strong>.&#160;Breeding has been mainly recorded from Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku islands, while there are relatively few records in northern Honshu (Wild Bird Society of Japan [Tokyo]&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).

However on Montserrat, although it occurs at all altitudes, the species is most common in mesic mid-elevation forest under closed canopies (Parashuram <em>et al</em>. 2015). Pairs feed on insects and berries from ground-level to the forest canopy (Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998). On St Lucia, it previously gathered in large numbers in autumn to feed on berries (Keith 1997). Breeding has been recorded between March and August. The nest is made of dry leaves, twigs and moss, placed 3-10 m above the ground, in forks of large trees or on epiphytes. A clutch typically contains 2-3 blue-green eggs. The incubation period is approximately two weeks and a brood patch is present in both sexes. Chicks stay in the nest for 16-17 days. It is common for this species to nest twice in a year, where it does not build a new nest, but instead rearranges the one used for the first brood (Bénito-Espinal and Hautcastel 2003).  <br/><p></p>","Habitat loss has occurred throughout the species's range, but has been particularly acute on Montserrat<strong></strong>.

However, the estimate was based on distance sampling which can be highly  inaccurate in dense tropical forests given that most Forest Thrush  detections are aural.

Consequently, the species is listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It inhabits broadleaved forest ranging from secondary to mature (Göth and Vogel 1995)<strong></strong>, but needs areas with little ground cover where it can forage in leaf-litter and top soil; mainly for insects and worms, but also small reptiles, seeds and small fruit (Rinke <em>et al.</em> 1993). It uses hot volcanic ash to incubate its eggs, a habit which confines its nesting sites to areas of loose soil close to vents, either in forest or in open ash, or beaches of crater lakes (Todd 1983)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","A study in 1993 revealed that all nesting sites on Niuafo'ou were harvested with at least 50% of all eggs laid being collected or destroyed (Göth and Vogel 1995)<strong style=""""></strong>. However, egg collecting appears to have decline markedly since 1993 (Lloyd 2011)&#160;and younger people are reportedly not interested in maintaining this tradition (MEECCDMMIC 2014).&#160;The reason for the recent decline in the number of nest sites is currently unknown. One possibility is that natural shifts in geothermal activity  may have caused changes in soil temperature profiles that would inhibit  successful incubation of eggs (Tilmouth 2010). Adults are also hunted on a small scale, and both adults and chicks are predated by feral cats and dogs, while pigs almost certainly destroy suitable foraging habitat for  young birds (Lloyd 2011) and may compete for food (Göth and Vogel 1995)<strong style=""""></strong>.

More recent surveys have only been brief and used different methods but only located 28-53+ birds (Butler 2014).&#160;Göth and Vogel (1995) recorded 187+ active burrows, but only 33 were found in 2012 (MLECCNR 2012) and 44 in 2014 (Butler 2014). On Fonualei Island, Watling (2004)&#160;recorded&#160;a minimum of 38 individuals, and estimated a population of 300-500. In 2012, Butler (2013) observed that birds were&#160;also&#160;abundant at another site in the north of the island, and estimated a population of 600-1000, assuming that all apparently suitable habitat had been occupied. Watling (2004) and (Butler 2013) recorded no birds on Late. Thus the population size may be best placed in the range 250-999 mature individuals (G.

By 2013, the population on Fonualei&#160;had risen&#160;to an estimated 600-1,000&#160;birds, assuming that all apparently suitable habitat was occupied (Butler 2013).<br/><br/>A survey in September 2010 revealed that the population on Niuafo'ou had undergone a dramatic decline in the number of nests at all known nesting grounds, and is now confined to small  areas within the caldera. Historically, 27 nests were known from 13 different sites  across Niuafo'ou (Goeth unpublished data, in Tilmouth 2010), but during the September  2010 survey only 10 active nests at 7 sites were found (Lloyd <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).

The largest population on Saipan is inferred to be declining as a result of habitat loss caused by commercial and residential development. The introduction of Brown Tree Snake&#160;(<em>Boiga irregularis</em>) to the species's range islands could result in very rapid elimination of the subpopulations on the islands and therefore, the species has very few locations. For these reasons, the species is listed as Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>","On Saipan,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">the Golden White-eye&#160;occurs in all wooded habitats, including the native limestone forest (which is restricted to steep slopes and cliffs and covers c. 5% of the island), secondary forest and introduced tangan tangan (<em>Leucaena leucocephala</em>) thickets on flat lowlands and plateaus (c. 28% of land cover), and also agricultural and urban areas (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1987, Craig 1990, A. Tieber <em>in litt.</em> 2008, 2010)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. However, it is decidedly more common in limestone forest than in disturbed areas (Craig 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and higher nesting densities are recorded in limestone forest than tangan tangan thickets (Sachtleben 2005, Peiffer 2017)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It forages predominantly in the foliage of trees, particularly <em>Cynometra ramifolia</em>, feeding on invertebrates, flying insects, nectar, fruit and flowers and also taking insects from tree bark (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1987, Craig 1990)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and is typically seen in small groups of 2-4 individuals, thought to be family groups (A.

Berry <em>in litt. </em>2016). Although the species has been recorded in urban areas, it is most frequently recorded in forest&#160;(Craig 1996,&#160;Sachtleben 2005). Habitat loss is thought to have been the main cause of the species's past reduction and the cause of the decline on Saipan (Camp <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Since the 1980s, a significant amount of forest on Saipan has been degraded or lost as a result of residential, commercial and touristic development, and invasive species (Camp <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, G. Wiles <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In contrast, on uninhabited Aguiguan, where agricultural land has been reverting back to forest, the population is increasing&#160;(Camp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</span></p><p>The threat that could have the most devastating consequences is the potential introduction of Brown Tree Snake (<em>Boiga irregularis</em>) to the species's range islands (Rodda and Savidge 2007). If the snake were to become established on Saipan, it would likely lead to extremely rapid declines, as has been the case amongst the endemic avifauna of Guam (to USA) (A. Saunders&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2003, Wiles&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Williams 2004). Roadside surveys on Guam indicated a 90% decline in most bird species within 8.9 years (Wiles <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Accidental introduction via cargo ships and planes has been the primary mechanism for the spread of the species from Guam to other islands, and all goods received in the Northern Mariana Islands are shipped through Guam, with the majority arriving in Saipan (Colvin <em>et al. </em>2005<em>,&#160;</em>MAC Working Group 2014). There have been over 70 reports of Brown Tree Snake on Saipan, including sightings away from port areas (Rodda and Savidge 2007, MAC Working Group 2014), and the island was previously thought to have an incipient population (Colvin <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). However, surveys have not demonstrated the establishment of a breeding population on the island&#160;(Rodda and Savidge 2007) and there have been no confirmed records of the species on Saipan for 20 years (L. Berry <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). There have been no reports of predation on Golden White-eye<em>&#160;</em>(A. Tieber&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2008, 2010)<em>.&#160;</em>The population&#160;decline of Golden White-eye&#160;recorded on Saipan is not attributed to Brown Tree Snake and did not follow the geographic pattern that would be expected if an expanding population of snakes was the cause (Camp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Nevertheless, the risk of the establishment of Brown Tree Snake on Saipan remains high. Although efforts are being made to prevent the introduction of the species, it is not possible to detect all snakes in cargo. Sightings of Brown Tree Snake on Aguiguan have been very rare. Aguiguan is uninhabited and difficult to access and it is unlikely that snakes will be accidentally introduced there (J. Lepson&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999).</p><p>Other invasive non-native species may also threaten the Golden White-eye. The invasive vine&#160;Scarlet Gourd (<em>Coccinia grandis</em>)<em>&#160;</em>was probably introduced to Saipan in 1998 and has led to degradation of the forest habitat on the island (Camp <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Saipan supports high densities of the Black Rat (<em>Rattus rattus</em>), whilst the species is absent in Aguiguan, which may contribute to the different trends in Golden White-eye population seen on the two islands<em> </em>(Amidon <em>et al.</em> 2014)<em>. </em>Rats have been observed predating Golden White-eye nests on Saipan (Peiffer 2017). Feral goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) and the invasive plant&#160;<em>Lantana camara</em> may also lead to long-term degradation of the species's habitat; little tree recruitment has been observed on Anguiguan (Engbring <em>et al.</em>1986, Amidon <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</p><p>Having a distribution on relatively low-lying islands, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change through sea-level rise and increased typhoon frequency and/or intensity (BirdLife International unpublished data). However, analysis of roadside survey data on Golden White-eyes on Saipan found no link between population density and typhoon frequency or severity (Ha <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The species may also be impacted by a shift in suitable climatic conditions;&#160;both wet and dry seasons are predicted to be wetter and warmer in the western Pacific, including the Marianas. Saracco <em>et al. </em>(2016) suggest that such conditions could have negative consequences for the Golden White-eye, which appears to exhibit higher reproductive output in years with a relative contrast in greenness.</p><p>The population on Sarigan could also be threatened by volcanoes (P. Radley <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).</p><p><br/></p><p></p>","<p>The species is considered to be abundant and widespread on Saipan, but less abundant on Aguiguan (MAC Working Group 2014).</p><p>On Saipan, surveys in 2007 provided an estimate of 71,997 individuals (95% CI 47,586 – 106,535), with a density of 711.8 ± 112.1 birds/km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Camp <em>et al. </em>2009). Analysis of population densities indicated a decline between 1982 and 2007 (Camp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009) and analysis of data from roadside surveys from 1991-2010 indicated that the population decreased between 2001 and 2010 (Ha <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).

The species historically seemed to be most numerous between 2,400-3,050 m from April to September and above 3,100 m from November to February during the presumed breeding season.

The situation is similar on the west slope of Volcán Pichincha, where some families still produce charcoal for auto-consumption and commercialisation in Quito (Jahn and Santander 2008). Suitable habitat on ridge-crests is disappearing more rapidly than surrounding vegetation, because the crests provide flat ground for cultivating potatoes and livestock-grazing within otherwise steep terrain (Bleiweiss and Olalla 1983). The Toisán population is threatened by deforestation on the south-west slope of the cordillera, copper mining concessions, and invasions of landless farmers within the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve (Jahn 2008, Jahn and Santander 2008). Human-induced fires threaten large tracts of forest during the dry season (Jahn 2008). The construction of a pipeline at Cerro Chiquilipe led to habitat destruction for the pipeline itself, an access road and a depressurisation station despite the known presence of the hummingbird (Santander <em>et al</em>. 2004). Volcán Pichincha has sporadically erupted since 1999, and ash-fall in the area has been considerable. The impacts of this on the species and its habitat are unknown. Climate change in the future may push the climate zone for this species above the current treeline (Jahn 2008), and could lead to increased competition with Gorgeted Sunangel <em>Heliangelus strophianus</em> as that species expands its altitudinal range (Jahn 2008, Guevara 2013). However, the current treeline is thought to be lower than it was historically owing to centuries of anthropogenic stresses (particularly fire) causing the gradual loss and fragmentation of high altitude forest (Jahn 2008). <p></p>","The population size has not been quantified directly. The species appears to be scarce even in suitable habitat (T. Santander <em>in litt</em>. 2019). At Yanacocha-Verdecocha, a maximum of four individuals have been observed together during each transect count (T. Santander <em>in litt</em>. 2019, H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The population in this area has preliminarily been estimated at up to 20 individuals (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Including further individuals in inaccessible, steep terrain and along the western slopes, the subpopulation at Pichincha volcano may number up to 80 individuals (H. M. Schaefer <em>in litt</em>. 2020), which roughly equates to 50 mature individuals. Similarly, for the subpopulation in the less studied Cordillera de Toisán up to four individuals have been observed, with an estimated density of 2-4 individuals/ha (Montenegro 2017). A recent survey however found the subpopulation to be likely larger than the subpopulation on the Pichincha volcano (L. Calapi, W. Arteaga and K. Varela <em>per</em> S. Bos <em>in litt</em>. 2020, T. Santander <em>in litt</em>. 2020, Ulloa 2020).

A second subpopulation was re-discovered in 2006 in the Cordillera de Toisán above the Intag valley (Jahn 2008, Aves y Conservación 2018).

Media coverage of research on the species and threats to its habitat has encouraged the authorities to control access and forbid charcoal production at Yanacocha (Phillips 1998). The species was designated the 'emblematic bird of Quito' in 2005. The area was subsequently purchased by the Jocotoco Foundation and protects c. 1,100 ha of key habitat for the species. An additional 26 ha has been purchased adjacent to the reserve for reforestation (of native cloudforest) for a carbon offsetting scheme by Bird Holidays, a birdwatching tour company<strong></strong> (Anon. 2006). The neighbouring private reserve Hacienda Verdecocha protects an additional 1,200 ha of optimal habitat. A large part of the unexplored primary forest of Volcán Pichincha's western slopes are protected by Bosque Protector Mindo-Nambillo reserve (Jahn 2008). Western slopes of the Cordillera de Toisán are protected within the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve (Jahn 2008). A Species Action Plan was developed in 2007 and published in 2008 (Jahn and Santander 2008), with a Spanish translation completed by 2012 (Aves y Conservación 2012). <br/>The Species Guardian, Aves y Conservación, have carried out capacity  building activities for nature and community tourism in the Alaspungo  community since 2008 (Aves y Conservación <em>in litt</em>. 2009, 2010, Aves y Conservación 2012) including training of community-based guides. Other actions so far have included a community and stakeholder outreach programme in Pichincha province, the formation of a Local Conservation Group, production and distribution of environmental education materials, reforestation activities on cattle pastures and other degraded lands on the Hacienda Verdecocha and Yanacocha Reserves and initiation of a standardised bird monitoring programme. Plans to designate the Alaspungo Community Forest as a protected area evolved into the creation of a larger 8,000 ha municipal protected area (Nono-Pichán-Alambi Conservation and Sustainable Use Area), including the Community Forest. The resulting plan was being reviewed by the municipality in 2012, and once approved will pave the way for the formal creation of the reserve   (Aves y Conservación 2012). Monitoring along set transects at the Community Forest was scheduled to be initiated in August 2013.

Pollution from a sugar cane mill near the town of  Tamazula has made a portion of the former range of the species in the  lower Tamazula River uninhabitable since the 1970’s (Lyons and  Mercado-Silva 2000). Additional pollution from waste water from the town of Tuxpán, and from sewage from a huge paper mill in Atenquique (García 2008), leads to an ongoing decline in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy and quality of habitats. From 1995 to 2016, the species has  been found at about 10 collection sites, several of them moderately large, and recent surveys indicate that probably all of these populations still persist and have been quite stable since the 1980's and 1990's. <br/><br/>Though the best case scenario of the estimated extent of occurence (1,350 km<sup>2</sup>) and area of occupancy (280 km<sup>2</sup>) meets the threshold for Endangered, due to a high number of locations (9&#160; and relatively stable stocks, this species is assessed&#160;Vulnerable.","The Peppered Splitfin&#160;is known to inhabit permanent freshwater rivers in the Río Coahuayana basin in the state of Jalisco and occurs in rocky streams&#160;and riffles over  substrates of sand, rocks and boulders. The vegetation associated to its habitat is typically  green algae, sometimes sparse or asbsent, especially in large rivers where  the species is scarce. The currents are slight or moderate to swift, the  water is turbid or clear. It can be found in depths of 1 m, but usually  it prefers depths of 0.5 m or less.&#160;Like all known&#160;<em>Allodontichthys </em>species, the Peppered Splitfin is a bottom-dwelling and riffle-inhabitating<strong>&#160;</strong>species (Lyons 2011).<br/><br/>Observations of Köck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;in March 2016 in the Río Contla about 100 m north of the Highway 110 bridge at Contla, revealed a very shallow habitat with water depths less than 30 cm and a width of 3 to 4 m; in the rainy season the width reaches to about 8m, inferred from the existing pebble shore. The habitat was structured with a few big rocks and boulders in the middle of the current, a lot of gravel of different sizes, mud, sand and silt. There were few patches of submersed vegetation (Characeae) could be seen in the more quiet parts of the creek. The current was mainly swift, the water clear. The water parameters about noon were: pH 7.6, carbonate hardness 3°, total hardness 7°, water temperature 22°C. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, a discharge of polluted water close to the bridge raised the pH to 8.6 and led to the occurence of nitrite (1 mg/l) and nitrate (25 mg/l) that were absent above the discharge pipe.&#160;<em>Allodontichthys tamazulae&#160;</em>was associated with its congener&#160;<em>Allodontichthys hubbsi</em>&#160;(in about the same quantity),&#160;<em>Ilyodon whitei&#160;</em>(dominant species, about 90% of the total number of fish),&#160;<em>Poeclia butleri</em>&#160;and Tilapias (species not determined). The top predator seemed to be Dobsonfly larvae (subfamily Corydalinae, family Corydalidae) of about 10 - 12 cm in length, that could be seen hunting successfully twice in 30 minutes.&#160;<br/><br/>The Río Tamazula east of Tamazula de Giordano has a width of 5 to 10 m with a depth of about 50 cm. The bottom is comprised of big rocks and boulders, gravel, silt, mud and sand. The water in March 2016 was swift to torrential, depending on ground and width, and clear to murky. The water parameters were similar to the ones from the Río Contla. The species was associated with the same fish as in its affluent, and a few&#160;<em>Xenotoca lyonsi </em>were also found. The embankment was comprised by small trees (probably&#160;<em>Salix</em>), reeds and few herbaceous riparian plants; the main sections of the riverbank were free of vegetation. The quantity of urban waste was moderate, viscous remains of burnt sugar cane were found very close by: this would be washed into the river with rain.","<em></em>Water pollution has been identified as main threat for this species. Sewage from a sugar cane mill near the town of Tamazula de Giordano has made a portion of the former range of the species in the lower Tamazula River uninhabitable since the 1970’s (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). Moreover, waste water from a huge paper mill at Atenquique has had a heavilyy negative impact on downstream sections of the Río Tuxpán (García 2008), enhanced by sewage from the town of Tuxpán. Additional threats include wash-in of fertilizers and pesticides from ubiquitous sugar cane fields, in addition to sediment as a result of almost entire deforestation in the headwaters of the Río Atenquique (and other affluents of the Río Tuxpán), along with the Río Tuxpán itself for paper production. It is also threatened by non-native fish species (Tilapias).","From its distribution in two distinct river systems, two subpopulations (the Río El Tule and the Río Tuxpán subopulation) can be inferred. <br/><br/>The Río El Tule subpopulation is probably restricted to the Río El Terrero downstream to sections of this river just below El Pozo Santo and to one of its affluents, the Río La Trampa (Arroyo San José de Tule). Discharges from a sugar cane mill in San José de Tule and sewage from these two towns seem to deteriorate the water quality of this river significantly, making it uninhabitable for this species downstream. Due to its restricted range and declining stocks, this subpopulation is regarded Endangered. <br/><br/>The Río Tuxpán subpopulation was found in the Río Tamazula/Tuxpán system from approximately La Garita downstream to just below Atenquique, encompassing some of its affluents like the ríos Contla and San Grergorio and the arroyos Tecalitlán and Espanatica. This subpopulation is threatened by waste waters from a sugar cane mill in Tamazula de Giordano, making the river section after the town uninhabitable for this species since the 1970's (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). However the species occurred in several surveys by Lyons (1999 - 2010) in the Río Tuxpán, so it seems to persist there though it is scarce (T. Lyons pers. comm. 2018, Köck <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). From most of its affulents, the stocks seem to have remained quite stable since the 1980's and 1990's (Lyons 2011). Taking into consideration the restricted range and population declines in some of the habitats, this subpopulation is regarded Vulnerable.",Decreasing,"The Tuxpán Splitfin is a freshwater fish species endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco, historically widely distributed in the upper sections of the Río Coahuayana (Miller <em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;2005), named ríos Tamazula and Tuxpán&#160;(downstream to about the town of San Marcos), and the upper Río El Tule drainage (ríos El Terrero and La Trampa), an affluent of the Río Naranjo, the name of the Río Coahuayana section following the Río Tuxpán. The historical extent of occurrence included several affluents of the ríos Tamazula and Tuxpán, the ríos Contla, San Gregorio (San Jeronimo or Cobianes) and Atenquique, and the arroyos (creeks) Tecalitlán and Espanatica. Due to water pollution caused by sugar cane mills (e.g. Tamazula de Giordano), by sewage from the town of Tuxpán and by a huge paper mill in Atenquique, it is inferred that nowadays the main river is only scarcely populated with this species, and the Río Tamazula past the sugar cane mill in Tamazula de Giordano is thought to be uninhabitable (Lyons and Mercado-Silva 2000). However, it still inhabits the listed affluents and the Río Tamazula above the sugar cane mill; in total, it is known from about 10 collection sites. Several surveys between 1995 and 2016 indicate that this species still persists at all of these sites, in quite stable numbers, since the 1980's and 1990's (Lyons 2011).<br/><br/>In 2008, it was estimated that the Tamazula Splitfin had disappeared from about 55% of its historical range (Domínguez-Domínguez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).",This species is neither traded or utilised as food nor as an ornamental species for aquariums.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),No conservation actions for <em>Allodontichthys tamazulae</em>&#160;are known.,Neotropical,,false,false,Global

However, modelling of the likely effects of mortality caused by longline fishing fleets, combined with potential losses to breeding colonies from sea-level rise and storm surges, suggests it is appropriate to precautionarily predict a moderately rapid population decline over the next three generations (66 years), hence it is classified as Near Threatened.<br/><br/><p></p> <p></p>","<p>The species breeds on beaches and slopes with little or no vegetation, and on short turf. The species feeds mainly on flying fish eggs, squid, fish and crustaceans (Harrison <em>et al.</em> 1983), but also on fish offal and human refuse (Cousins 1998, Conners 2015). During both the incubation and the chick-rearing periods, birds nesting on Tern Island forage widely throughout the North Pacific, including to the distant, productive California Current waters along the west coast of North America (Fernandez <em>et al.</em> 2001, Kappes <em>et al. </em>2010). In contrast, during the brooding period, birds from Tern Island forage predominantly within 500 to 800 km of the island (Hyrenbach <em>et al</em>. 2002, Conners <em>et al.</em> 2015, Gutowsky <em>et al.</em> 2015, Kappes <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p></p>","<p>Incidental capture in commercial fisheries represents a threat to the majority of the population. Between 1978 and 1992, the population experienced elevated mortality from interactions with high seas drift-nets in the North Pacific (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1993). The estimated bycatch rates of Black-footed Albatrosses has fluctuated over the past 50 years, generally ranging between 6,000 and10,000 birds per annum (Naughton <em>et al.</em> 2007); in 2003, mortality was estimated to be at least 2,000 birds per year in the U.S. pelagic longline fleet based in Hawaii, and a further 6,000 in Japanese and Taiwanese fleets (Lewison and Crowder 2003). Recent observer data from the Hawaii longline fisheries, from 2010 to 2015 indicate that deep-set longlines captured an estimated 66 to 535 individuals each year and shallow-set longlines captured an observed 19-49 individuals per year. It has been recently estimated that on average 227 individuals are taken annually in the Alaskan federal groundfish and Pacific Halibut <em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em> fisheries (in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, and the Gulf of Alaska Fishery Management Plan areas), which also target Pacific Cod <em>Gadus microcephalus</em> and Sablefish <em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>. Along the west coast of the U.S.A., Black-footed Albatrosses interacting with fleets harvesting Sablefish and Pacific Hake <em>Merluccius productus</em> are exposed to an elevated mortality risk (Guy <em>et al</em>. 2013). In 2012, it was estimated that between 2006 and 2009, from 25 to 128 albatrosses (assumed to all be Black-footed Albatross) were taken annually in Canada’s Pacific demersal longline groundfish fisheries, with a predicted yearly average mortality of 85 birds (DFO 2012). Bycatch rates in the Japanese and Taiwanese longline fleets are largely unknown. However, studies on this species have confirmed the impact of fisheries bycatch on survival (Verán <em>et al</em>. 2007) and the annual population growth rate (Niel and Lebreton 2005). Tracking studies show that post-breeding birds disperse over large distances to the oceanographic 'transition zone' where they are susceptible to bycatch in the various pelagic longline fleets (Hyrenbach and Dotson 2003, BirdLife International 2004, Hyrenbach <em>et al</em>. 2006, Zydelis <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gutowsky <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015). Within this area, tracking revealed that fishing effort was heavy in the habitats utilised by the species, and that there may be a male bias in the individuals affected by bycatch.</p>  <p>Around the turn of the 20th century, the species suffered sharp declines due to feather hunting (Spennemann 1998). Protective measures and the cessation of feather hunting allowed the population to recover (ACAP 2010).</p>  <p>Climate change poses an ongoing threat in terms of storms and flooding, and a future threat in terms of habitat alteration. The vast majority of the world population nests on islands below 10 m, above sea-level and it is predicted that with climate change and the resulting rise in sea-level, there will be significant inundation and loss of low-lying atolls/islands that are currently used for nesting (Storlazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013, Reynolds <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p>  Other potential threats include volcanic eruptions (Harrison 1990), pollution from agricultural effluents and solid waste including organochlorine (Jones <em>et al</em>. 1996, Auman <em>et al</em>. 1997, Guruge <em>et al.</em> 2001), mercury, PCB and DDE (Ludwig <em>et al</em>. 1998, Guruge et <em>al.</em> 2001, Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2007) and oil spills (Fefer <em>et al.</em> 1984, NOAA 1992).","<p>Between 1995 and 2017, the average number of breeding pairs per season was c.69,900, which equates to 139,800 mature individuals (ACAP 2017).</p>",Increasing,"<p><em>Phoebastria nigripes</em> breeds on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>), the <strong>U.S. Minor Outlying Islands</strong> and four outlying islands off <strong>Japan. </strong>In the past, individual pairs have also bred in Mexico on Guadalupe and San Benedicto islands; however the species has not bred on either island for at least 20 years (ACAP 2010). Colonies have been lost from other Pacific islands (Whittow 1993, Cousins 1998). In total there are estimated to be 70,069 pairs breeding each year (Flint 2007, Naughton <em>et al.</em> 2007, ACAP 2017) in at least 16 locations. The largest population counts have been 28,610 pairs at Midway Atoll for hatch year 2015 and 24, 565 pairs at Laysan Island for hatch year 2012. Together these two sites represent approximately 72% of the global population as estimated by the highest count for each of 16 sites (12 sites surveyed within the last 10 years) (Flint 2007, Naughton <em>et al.</em> 2007, ACAP 2017). On Torishima, 914 chicks were reared from 1,219 pairs in 1998, compared with just 20 in 1964 (Cousins and Cooper 2000). In 2013, 2,060 pairs nested on Torishima (ACAP 2017). The species disperses widely over the northern Pacific Ocean, particularly to the north-east, towards the coastal waters of North America. There have been occasional records in the southern hemisphere (Carboneras 1992, Fernandez <em>et al.</em> 2001, Hyrenbach and Dotson 2001, BirdLife International 2004, Hyrenbach <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/> All Hawaiian breeding localities are part of the U.S.A.

In 1991, a 50 Nautical Mile (92.6 km) Protected Species Zone was established around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where longline fishing is prohibited. In 2006, the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument was established. Originally, Papahānaumokuākea protected an area of 362,073 km<sup>2</sup>; in August 2016, the National Marine Monument was expanded to 1,508,870 km<sup>2</sup> and increasing the area in which the birds are protected from exposure to fisheries interactions (http://www.papahanaumokuakea.gov/news/expansion_announcement.html).</p><p>Nearly 80% of the breeding population is counted directly or sampled every year. All sites except one have been surveyed since 1991 (Croxall and Gales 1998). Hawaiian longline fishing vessels are required to use a range of measures to reduce seabird bycatch. In 2001 and 2007, respectively, the USA and Canada released National Plans of Action to reduce the bycatch of seabirds in longline fisheries (NMFS 2001, DFO 2007). In 2002, the use of bird-scaring (or Tori) lines became a mandatory condition of licence in commercial halibut, sablefish and rockfish (<em>Sebastes</em> spp.) longline fisheries on Canada’s Pacific waters (DFO 2007). In 2006, the Committee on the Conservation of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed <em>Phoebastria nigripes</em> as Special Concern <span lang=""EN-CA"">(a species at risk of becoming threatened or endangered) in Canada (COSEWIC 2006); and in 2009, the species was added to Schedule 1 of Canada’s Species at Risk Act, also as Special Concern (https://www.registrelep-sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=991).</p><p>In 2017, the first cohort of 15 Black-footed Albatross chicks from Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge&#160; were translocated to James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge on the island of O’ahu in Hawaii as part of a plan to establish safe breeding colonies on high islands less at risk from loss due to inundation caused by climate change factors such as sea level rise and increased storm frequency and intensity.&#160; </p><p>In 2006, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission passed a measure to require large tuna and swordfish longline vessels to use at least two seabird bycatch mitigation measures when fishing north of 23<strong><sup>o</sup></strong> N.

The population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. <p></p>","This species is mostly found in zones with light ice pack. Its diet is comprised almost exclusively of Antarctic krill, but it will also take fish and other species of crustaceans when possible. Prey capture is apparently by pursuit-diving up to a depth of 70 m, but mostly at depths less than 45 m. It breeds on irregular rocky coasts in ice free areas, forming large colonies of hundreds and thousands of birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Winter migrations can be extensive and winter habitats are generally pelagic and are located north of the sea ice edge (Hinke <em>et al. </em>2015, 2019).<p></p>","Climate change is potentially the greatest threat to this species at present and in the future. It is thought to impact reproductive success through incurring changes in abundance and distribution of krill (Trivelpiece <em>et al.</em> 2011, Clucas <em>et al.</em> 2014), though these effects have been noted only in parts of the range (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Changes in krill biomass and availability resulting from habitat shifts are thought to be driving rapid declines at a number of colonies (Barbosa <em>et al.</em> 2012, Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2012, Naveen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dunn <em>et al.</em> 2016). In addition, there is considerable overlap between the expanding krill fishery and the species’s foraging distribution, hence there is potential for resource competition, potentially aggravating the climatic effects on krill availability (Hinke 2017, Warwick-Evans <em>et al.</em> 2018; Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Volcanic activity during the 2016 moulting season at Zavodovski and Bristol in the South Sandwich Islands could have had severe impacts on the large colonies residing there, and surveys of the breeding colonies at the South Sandwich Islands should be repeated. If large numbers are found to have been killed by the volcanic event, and if declines elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula continue, the species may warrant uplisting.<br/><br/>Human impacts potentially include disturbance from tourists, scientists, construction of new science facilities and fisheries. However, only a very small percentage of the global population is exposed to human intrusion and there is currently no documented evidence of population-level impacts (J. Croxall <em>in litt.</em> 2017).","<p><span class=""datalabel1"">Convey <em>et al.</em> (1999) estimate a world population of ~4 million breeding pairs.<span class=""datalabel1""></span></p>",Decreasing,"This species has a circumpolar distribution, being found in Antarctica, the <strong>South Sandwich Islands (Islas Sandwich del Sur)</strong>, the South Orkneys, South Shetland and <strong>South Georgia (Georgia del Sur)</strong>, <strong>Bouvet Island (to Norway)</strong> and the Balleny Islands (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992).<br/><br/>Population information for many sites is unknown or out of date. For example, population surveys at the South Sandwich Islands, where the majority of the world population breeds (1,500,000 pairs; Convey <em>et al.</em> 1999; Lynch <em>et al. </em>2016), are infrequent. Other important breeding populations exist at the South Orkney Islands (927,000 pairs; Poncet and Poncet 1985, Humphries <em>et al. </em>2017), but this is probably an underestimate (P. Trathan <em>in litt. </em>2017), especially at the western end of the archipelago. Large populations also occur at the South Shetland Islands (987,000; Trivelpiece and Trivelpiece 2013) and the west Antarctic Peninsula (72,000; Trivelpiece and Trivelpiece 2013). Small populations occur at South Georgia (~1,800 pairs), Bøuvet (&lt;100) and at the Balleny Islands (&lt; 100) (Trivelpiece and Trivelpiece 2013). At the Antarctic Peninsula, population estimates are now increasingly out of date (Trathan <em>et al. </em>2019).<p></p>Population trends for chinstrap penguins, although complex and somewhat regional in extent and timing, suggest that the species experienced a dramatic increase in numbers following the harvesting of fur seals and whales from the early 1800s to mid-1900s and the development and expansion of sub-Antarctic finfish fisheries that began in the 1960s. Chinstrap populations reached their peak in the late 1970s (Croxall and Kirkwood 1979) but then have experienced significant declines at some, but not all, breeding sites since that time (Poncet 1997; Woehler <em>et al. </em>2001; Forcada <em>et al.</em> 2006; Lynch <em>et al. </em>2008; Forcada and Trathan 2009; Trivelpiece <em>et al. </em>2011; Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). A recent analysis of published data on chinstraps in the Antarctic Peninsula region reports an estimated population decline of 1.1 ± 0.8% per annum since 1980 (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>This trend, however, is not mirrored at all locations; for example, in the Palmer Archipelago at the extreme southern extent of this species’s range on the Antarctic Peninsula an initial population of approximately 2000 individuals in 1974 expanded to approximately 10,000 individuals in 2016, including both an increase in extant colonies and the establishment of new ones (Fraser 2016). Importantly, this region has experienced a significant decrease in sea ice but no apparent changes in Antarctic krill abundance (Steinberg <em>et al. </em>2015).

Island subpopulations are at risk from stochastic events such as typhoons and volcanic eruptions, as well as further introductions of invasive species such as the Brown Tree Snake. The number of locations is therefore likely to be small, but larger than ten.

In Palau, most birds inhabit beach strand forests, and only a few nests have ever been found in the upland volcanic forests (Engbring 1992, VanderWerf 2007, P. Radley <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).

A few mounds are also built in upland forest and are made of decayed wood and other plant material.<p></p>","The main ongoing threats to the species are forest degradation by grazing feral ungulates, forest clearance, human disturbance, and sea level rise due to climate change.<br/><br/>Ungulates are currently present on Aguiguan, Tinian, Saipan, Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan (USFWS 2020). Little is known about the extent of ungulate grazing in Palau. On Sarigan, habitat has been severely degraded as a reult of grazing by goats and pigs (Fancy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999), but goats and pigs were removed from the island during 1998-2000 (Kessler 2002). Surveys in the Northern Mariana Islands in 2008-2009 found that the species had higher densities on islands without ungulates, and that the likelihood of detecting the species on ungulate‐free islands was 84% compared to 37% on an island with ungulates (Amidon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). However, the majority of the species's population is currently located on islands that are free of ungulates (Amidon 2011, Radley 2019).<br/><br/>Forests on Saipan, Tinian and Aguijan were extensively cleared for sugarcane plantations during the first half of the 20th century (Stinson and&#160;Glass 1992). On Sarigan, forest has been cleared for coconut palm plantations (Fancy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999).&#160;Commercial and residential development also contributes to habitat degradation (USFWS 1998). Forest on Saipan was projected to continue to undergo considerable clearance from 2000-2030 to make way for housing development (Stein&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Birds were hunted, and eggs were collected in the past (Pratt <em>et al.</em>&#160;1980, USFWS 1998). Nowadays, the species is rarely hunted, but the eggs are still regularly collected illegally from nest mounds on a limited basis (Engbring 1992, Pratt and&#160;Etpison 2008, C. Kitalong pers. comm., in Radley 2019).<br/><br/>In Palau, increased tourist use of beaches has resulted in disturbance to nest sites (Engbring 1992). In the Rock Islands, the species was recorded at lower densities at islands with a higher tourist presence, suggesting an impact of tourism (Radley 2019, Radley <em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).<br/><br/>On all islands, predation on megapodes by introduced predators, e.g. monitor lizard <span style=""font-style: italic; "">Varanus indicus</span>, rats <span style=""font-style: italic; "">Rattus spp</span>., and feral cats, dogs and pigs is a threat (USFWS 1998, Pratt and&#160;Etpison 2008). Studies in Palau indicate that predation by rats (mainly <em>Rattus rattus</em>) does not have a major impact on the scrubfowl (Radley 2019, Radley <em>et al. </em>2020). Cats have been introduced to the&#160;Rock Islands Southern Lagoon Conservation Area, and are likely to be a significant threat there (T. Hall, pers. comm. 2020, in P. Radley <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>The accidental introduction of the Brown Tree Snake <span style=""font-style: italic; "">Boiga irregularis</span> from Guam to other islands in the Marianas and to Palau is a potential threat (Stinson and&#160;Glass 1992, USFWS 1998).&#160;If the snake were to become established on a range island, it could likely lead to extremely rapid declines, as has been the case amongst the endemic avifauna of Guam (to USA) (although the scrubfowl was extirpated from Guam before the arrival of the snake; Wiles<em> et al. </em>2003).&#160;Roadside surveys on Guam indicated a 90% decline in most bird species within 8.9 years (Wiles <em>et al. </em>2003). Accidental introduction via cargo ships and planes has been the primary mechanism for the spread of the species from Guam to other islands, and all goods received in the Northern Mariana Islands are shipped through Guam, with the majority arriving in Saipan (Colvin <em>et al</em>. 2005, MAC Working Group 2014). There have been over 70 reports of Brown Tree Snake on Saipan, including sightings away from port areas (Rodda and Savidge 2007, MAC Working Group 2014), and the island was previously thought to have an incipient population (Colvin <em>et al. 2</em>005). However, surveys have not demonstrated the establishment of a breeding population on the island (Rodda and&#160;Savidge 2007) and there have been no confirmed records of the species on Saipan for 20 years (L. Berry <em>in litt.</em> 2020). Nevertheless, the risk of the establishment of Brown Tree Snake on Saipan remains high. Although efforts are being made to prevent the introduction of the species, it is not possible to detect all snakes in cargo. The potential introduction of the Brown Tree Snake is primarily a threat to the subpopulations on the inhabited Mariana Islands of Saipan and Tinian (Radley 2019), which together contain only a small minority of the global population. Palau has a native species of bird-eating snake, and so the scrubfowl may be behaviourally adapted to this threat (Radley 2019).<br/><br/>A volcanic eruption destroyed the entire megapode population on Anatahan in the early 2000s. Volcanic activity is an ongoing threat on other islands as well, including Asuncion, Pagan, Guguan, Sarigan, Alamagan and Agrihan, and can bury vegetation and nesting areas (USFWS 1998). Over 80% of the population of the Northern Mariana Islands in found on Asuncion, Guguan, and Sarigan, all of which are dormant volcanos that could become active at any time (P. Radley <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).&#160;<br/><br/>Forests across the species's range are periodically degraded by typhoons. Increased typhoon frequency and intensity as a result of climate change may increase the threat posed by typhoons, especially in Palau (Radley 2019). However, the species is likely to have some resilience to typhoons, and surveys of nesting mounds in Palau following typhoons found that the majority of damaged nesting mounds were quickly restored (Olsen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In Palau, the species is threatened by the loss of coastal nesting habitat due to rising sea levels resulting from climate change, which could lead to significant population declines in the long term (Olsen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Radley 2019, Radley <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). An analysis of the impact of sea level rise estimated that 33-43% of the species's breeding habitat in the Rock Islands will be lost by 2100 (Radley 2019). Neither typhoons nor sea level rise threaten populations in the Marianas to the same degree because they generally nest at higher elevations (Olsen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Radley <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021).","In Palau, the species is widely-distributed, but generally uncommon to rare, and only locally distributed (VanderWerf and&#160;Dittmar 2020). Surveys throughout the archipelago (excluding Kayangel Atoll) in 1991 led to population estimates of 244 (+/- 173) individuals on Babeldaob, 104 (+/- 34) in the Rock Islands (excluding Ngerukeuid), 52 (+/- 41) on Peleliu, and 97 (+/- 43) on Angaur, with a total population estimate of 497 (+/- 291) individuals (Engbring 1992, VanderWerf and&#160;Dittmar 2020). This may equate to approximately 330 (137-525) mature individuals. Recent surveys have estimated the Kayangel Atoll population to be 108 mature individuals (Olsen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016), so the total Palau population in 1991 may have been c. 438 (245-633) mature individuals.&#160;<br/><br/>Repeat surveys in 2005 produced population estimates of 301 (+/- 171) individuals on Babeldaob, 227 (+/- 133) in the Rock Islands, 48 (+/- 32) on Peleliu, and 125 (+/- 71) on Angaur, leading to an estimated total population in Palau (excluding Kayangel Atoll) of 700 (+/- 308) individuals (VanderWerf 2007, VanderWerf and&#160;Dittmar 2020). This may equate to approximately 466 (261-672) mature individuals. The population estimates for Peleliu and the Rock Islands may have been underestimated because areas known to be used for nest-building were not surveyed (VanderWerf and&#160;Dittmar 2020). Recent surveys have estimated the Kayangel Atoll population to be 108 mature individuals (Olsen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016), so the total Palau population in 2005 may have been c. 574 (369-780) mature individuals.<br/><br/>A survey of nesting mounds across 122 beaches across Palau (excluding Angaur) in 2011-2013 recorded 173 active nesting mounds distributed across 53 sites, indicated a population of c.346 mature individuals (Olsen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). 95 (55%) of the recorded active nesting mounds were in the Rock Islands, 54 (31%; 108 mature individuals) were in Kayangel Atoll (including three on Ngeriungs Islet and one on Ngerbelas Islet), 13 (8%) were on coastal islets of Babeldaob, and the remaining 11 (6%) were on Peleliu and nearby islets (Olsen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Assuming that the 125 individuals estimated for Anguar in 1992 may equate to roughly 83 mature individuals, the total population in Palau in 2013 may have been approximately 429 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Playback surveys in the Rock Islands in 2017 found higher densities, suggesting that previous surveys may have underestimated the population size in Palau (P. Radley <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). These surveys also suggested that the number of nesting sites may have declined by 5-10% since 2013 (Radley 2019). Since previous surveys indicated a population reduction in the Rock Islands but no overall decline for Palau (VanderWerf 2007, VanderWerf and&#160;Dittmar 2020), the population in Palau is assumed not to have changed significantly since 2013. <br/><br/>Taking into account the above population estimates, the total population in Palau is placed in the band 245-780 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 420-580 mature individuals (based on the best estimates from the surveys in 2005 and 2011-2013).<br/><br/>In 1998, the total population in the Marianas was estimated to number&#160;1,440 to 1,975 birds (USFWS 1998). Extensive surveys in 2010 combined with DISTANCE analysis resulted in much higher estimates than previously reported, with a total estimated population in the northern islands (Saipan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, Agrihan, Asuncion, and Maug; excluding Aguiguan, Farallon de Medinilla, Anatahan and Tinian) of 10,727 individuals (95% CI: 6,682—15,445), with the majority of the population found on the islands of Asuncion, Sarigan and Guguan (Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). The higher estimate was believed to be largely due to increased survey effort, including the use of playback surveys, but may also have reflected the removal of ungulates from Sarigan in 1998 (Amidon <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). The use of pooled analysis from data across islands together with assumptions about habitat occupancy may have led to this estimate being too high (P. Radley <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>On Aguiguan, surveys in 2000 and 2002 estimated a&#160;population size over 0.5 km<sup>2</sup> of forest at 80 (43-149) and 72 (34-149) individuals, respectively (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). Subsequent research using playback indicated a territory size of 3.76 ha in limestone forest on the island, indicating a population size of 112 individuals (61–206; 95% CI; Kessler and&#160;Amidon 2009, Amidon <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/>On Tinian, surveys in 1982 and 1994 did not detect any individuals (Engbring <em>et al.</em>1986, USFWS 1998), but incidental reports from the 1990s suggested that a very small population (&lt;10 individuals) may persist (O'Daniel and&#160;Krueger 1999, USFWS 1998). None were detected during surveys in 2008 (Camp <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012a,b).<br/><br/>Surveys on Saipan in 1982 lead to a population estimate of 40 individuals&#160;(Engbring&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986). Repeat surveys in 1991-1992 lead to an estimated population size of 14 birds in the native forests of the Marpi region&#160;(Craig&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993, Craig 1996). No individuals were recorded during surveys in other parts of the island where the species was previously recorded, leading to the conclusion that the population on Saipan was declining (Craig 1996). In 1997, the population on Saipan was thought likely to be less than 30 individuals (USFWS 1998). Following surveys in 2010 and analysis using a modelled detection function based on survey data from across the Marianas, the Saipan population was estimated at 151 (95% CI: 27-370) individuals (Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), although this may have been an overestimate (P. Radley <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>On Farallon de Medinilla, the population was estimated in 1996 to be less than 10 individuals (M. Lusk, pers comm., in USFWS 1998). More recent information suggested a population of at least 24 mature individuals (Vogt 2009).<br/><br/>On Anatahan, the population size was suspected to be around 300 individuals in 1988 (Reichel and&#160;Glass 1988), 1,150 (523-2,539) individuals in 2000, and 2,928 (1,830-4,685) individuals in 2002, just before the volcanic eruption (de Cruz <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003a). Following the volcanic eruption, the population was thought to be extirpated (Kessler and&#160;Amidon 2009). However, 23 individuals were detected during surveys in 2010 (Amidon <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>The population on Sarigan was estimated at 423 to 522 birds based on variable circular plot counts (USFWS 1998). In 1997,&#160;the Sarigan population was estimated at 677 (545-810) individuals (Fancy <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999).&#160;In 2006, the population was estimated at 3,544 (2,404-5208) breeding individuals (Martin <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;Following surveys in 2010, the population was estimated at 2,135 (95% CI: 1,261-3,250) individuals (Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). The larger recent population estimates may be partly due to increased survey effort, and partly the result of ungulate removal (Amadon <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/>The population on Guguan was estimated in 1986 at 1,500 - 2,200 individuals (Glass and&#160;Villagomez 1986). Subsequent surveys indicated a decline, with population estimates of 500 individuals in 1992 (Rice and&#160;Stinson 1992) and 305 (172-438) in 2000 (Cruz <em>et al.</em> 2000). However, surveys in 2010 estimated a population of 1,507 (95% CI: 824-2,449) individuals (Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/>On Alamagan, surveys in 2010 and analysis using a modelled detection function based on survey data from across the Marianas, estimated the population at 529 (95% CI: 92 - 966) individuals (Amidon <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Repeat surveys in 2017 resulted in a population estimate of&#160;114 birds (50-178; Murray <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>On Pagan, the population was estimated at 50-150 individuals in 1994 (C. G. Rice, pers. comm. 1994, in USFWS 1998).&#160;&#160;Following surveys in 2010 and analysis using a modelled detection function based on survey data from across the Marianas, the population was estimated at 147 (95% CI: 28-312) individuals (Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), which may have been an overestimate (P. Radley <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>The population size in Agrihan in 2010 was thought to be smaller than ten individuals (Amidon <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/>On Asuncion, the species was previously considered rare, with a rough population estimate of less than 25 individuals in 1995 (D. Stinson pers. comm. 1995, in USFWS 1998). However, surveys in 2008 and 2010 found a large population, estimated at 1,757 (1,123-2,487), and 5,714 (95% CI: 3,135-8,821) individuals respectively (Radley 2009, Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). The 2010 population estimate had a high level of statistical confidence, but assumed that all habitat was occupied, which may not have been the case (P. Radley <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>In Maug, the species was found to be common on all three islands in 1992 (Rice and&#160;Stinson 1992), with the population at that time estimated at 50-150 individuals (C. Rice pers. comm. 1994, in USFWS 1998). Following surveys in 2010 and analysis using a modelled detection function based on survey data from across the Marianas,&#160;the population was estimated at 544 (95% CI: 308-834) individuals (Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), which may have been an overestimate (P. Radley <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>Based on the above figures, the current population for the Mariana Islands is estimated to be in the range 3,700 - 21,900 (roughly equivalent to 2,400 - 14,600 mature individuals), with a best estimate of c.6,000 individuals (roughly equivalent to 4,000 mature individuals).<br/><br/>Summing the estimates for Palau and the Mariana Islands, the global population size is estimated to be in the range 2,600 - 15,400 mature individuals, with a best estimate of approximately 4,500 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The subpopulation structure is not known, but the species has been recorded flying several kilometres between islands (Pratt <em>et al.</em>&#160;1980). It is assumed that there are at least 10 subpopulations in the Mariana Islands and at least two in Palau. The largest island population may be on Asuncion or on Sarigan. On Asuncion, surveys in 2008 and 2009 estimated the population at 1,757 (1,123-2,487), and 5,714 (95% CI: 3,135-8,821) individuals respectively (Radley 2009, Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). On Sarigan, the population was estimated in 2006 at 3,544 (2,404-5208) breeding individuals (Martin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).&#160;Following surveys in 2010, the population was estimated at 2,135 (95% CI: 1,261-3,250) individuals (Amidon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).&#160;Assuming the populations on Asuncion and Sarigan represent distinct subpopulations, the largest subpopulation is estimated to number 1,123 - 8,821 individuals (roughly equivalent to 740 - 5,900 mature individuals), with a best estimate of 1,757-2,135 individuals, roughly equivalent to 1,200-1,500 mature individuals.",Unknown,"<em>Megapodius laperouse</em> occurs on <strong>Palau</strong> and the <strong>Northern Mariana Islands (to USA)</strong>, and is extirpated from Guam (to USA).&#160;<br/><br/>In Palau, subspecies <em>M. l. senex</em> occurs on Peleliu, Babeldaob, Angaur, Ngesebus, the Rock Islands (including Ulong, Ulebsechel, Ngeruktabel, Mecherchar, Ngerechong, Ngemelis, Babelchomekang, Ngeanges, Kmekumer, and the&#160;Ngerukuid Islands; Olsen and&#160;Eberdong 2017), Koror, Malakal, Ngerekebesang, and Kayangel Atoll.<br/><br/>In the Northern Mariana Islands, nominate&#160;<em>laperouse</em>&#160;is mainly restricted to islands north of Saipan, including Asuncion, Agrihan, Pagan, Alamagan, Maug, Guguan, Sarigan, Anatahan and Farallon de Medinilla (Lusk&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000), as well as Saipan and Aguiguan (Craig and&#160;Chandran 1993, USFWS 1998).

The uninhabited islands of Asuncion, Maug, Uracus and Guguan are wildlife sanctuaries (USFWS 1998), and there are several protected areas on Saipan (MAC Working Group 2014).<br/><br/>Goats and pigs were removed from Sarigan during 1998-2000 (Kessler 2002), and from Anatahan during 2002-2003 (de Cruz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003a).

Extensive efforts are underway to prevent the accidental introduction of Brown Tree Snake (<em>Boiga irregularis</em>) on Saipan (Colvin <em>et al. </em>2005). Cargo arriving at sea and air ports in Saipan is checked for snakes and traps have been installed to catch any snakes that are missed (MAC Working Group 2014). Barriers have been constructed at docks on Saipain to allow any introduced snakes to be contained (MAC Working Group 2014). Sniffer dogs have been trained to detect Brown Tree Snakes at Saipan airport (MAC Working Group 2014). Port officers from Saipan have been sent to Guam to receive training on prevention of Brown Tree Snake invasion and a programme has been carried out on Saipan to increase awareness among the general population of the importance of reporting Brown Tree Snake sightings (MAC Working Group 2014).<br/><br/>On the Kayangel Atoll, local people have been trained in monitoring techniques (Palau Conservation Society 2015).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/><br/>Develop a long-term, standardised monitoring programme across the species's range to monitor population trends.

It has a small area of occupancy and occurs at a small number of locations. Its population size remains small and is composed of small subpopulations. In the absence of continued habitat management and/or predator controls, its area of occupancy, area and quality of habitat, and population size would all likely decline. For these reasons, the species is listed as Near Threatened.<p></p>","In 1949, the remaining populations on Hawai‘i&#160;were restricted to rocky, sparsely vegetated, high volcanic slopes. Historically, the species is likely to have used grasslands, grassy shrublands, and dryland forest (USFWS 2004). It currently occurs in a variety of habitats including golf courses, pastures, lava flows, upland grasslands and shrublands (USFWS). The optimal habitat during the breeding and moulting seasons appears to be lowland grassland, including exotic grassland, where there is an abundance of high protein food, adjacent to natural scrubland nesting areas (Black <em>et al.</em> 1994, Black 1995<strong>, </strong>Black <em>et al.</em> 1997, Leopold and Hess 2013)<strong></strong>. During the non-breeding season it prefers subalpine shrubland (Leopold and Hess 2013, 2014). The species is likely to have originally been an altitudinal migrant, nesting primarily in leeward lowlands below 700m, and moving to montane habitats above 900 meters in the non-breeding season (Black 1995, USFWS 2004). Seasonal movements are now being seen in some recovered populations (USFWS 2004, 2011, Hess <em>et al.</em> 2012). Although a weak flier, the species is capable of flying between islands, and there have been several records of individuals flying between Maui and Hawai‘i&#160;(Banko and Elder 1990). It feeds on a wide range of plants (Banko <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). It breeds from August to April, with most eggs hatching in December and January (Banko <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999).<br/><p></p>","The species originally declined as a result of hunting by Polynesian and non-Polynesian people, habitat loss and the introduction of mammalian predators (USFWS 2004). Currently the main threats are predation by alien mammal species, habitat loss and degradation, and conflict with humans. Examination of carcasses from 1991-2013 found that emaciation, trauma from predation and road collisions, and diseases (predominantly toxoplasmosis)&#160;were the biggest causes of death (Work&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;<br/><br/>The introduced small Indian mongoose&#160;<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>&#160;occurs on all range islands except Kaua‘i, and is the main predator of eggs (Banko 1992, USFWS 2004). Eggs are also predated by Black, Norway and Pacific Rats (USFWS 2004). Dogs, mongooses and occasionally cats predate on goslings (Banko and Elder 1990, Banko 1992). Feral pigs trample nests and predate eggs, young and adults (USFWS 2004). Feral cats also carry the protozoan organism&#160;<em>Toxoplasma gondii&#160;</em>which causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that can be fatal in the species, although it is unlikely to be causing significant population-level impacts (Hess and Banko 2006, Work&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, 2016, USFWS 2018)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>A lack of suitable lowland habitat, especially for rearing young, may be an important factor limiting growth (USFWS 2004). The development of agricultural systems by the Polynesians, and later by European settlers, resulted in the extensive loss and alteration of habitat (Olson and James 1991)<strong></strong>. Lowland habitat continues to be lost through urbanisation and conversion to agriculture (USFWS 2018), and is being&#160;degraded through grazing by feral ugulates (cattle, goats and sheep) and by the introduction of alien plant species such as guinea grass (<em>Megathyrsus maximus</em>), sword grass (<em>Miscanthus floridulus</em>), koa haole (<em>Leucaena leucocephala</em>), and lantana (<em>Lantana camara; </em>Banko <em>et al.</em> 1999, VanderWerf 2012, USFWS 2018).<br/><br/>Road-kills are an important cause of mortality on Hawai‘i&#160;(M.

Climate change may also negatively affect the species through an increased frequency of cyclones, and through sea level rise, which may reduce the amount of available lowland breeding habitat (USFWS 2018). <br/><br/>Volcanic activity has the potential to destroy much or all of the habitat at Hawai‘i&#160;Volcanoes National Park and surrounding areas, but volcanoes are not considered to represent a threat to the species as a whole (USFWS 2019).","Recent population estimates have included 1,754 in 2006, 2,019 in 2007, 1,900 - 1,950 in 2008, 1,877 - 1,927 in 2009, 1,888 - 1,978 in 2010 (USFWS 2011), 2,465-2,555 in 2011 (VanderWerf 2012), 3,039 in 2015 (Amidon 2017), and 2,855 in 2016 (USFWS 2018). In 2018, the population was estimated at 3,252 individuals, including 1,104 on Hawai‘i&#160;(including 598 birds relocated from Kaua‘i), 627 on Maui, 37 on Moloka’i, 1,482 on Kaua‘i&#160;and 2 on O‘ahu&#160;(USFWS 2018).<br/><br/>For some time, all populations were dependent on continued releases of captive birds to persist (USFWS 2004), but releases ceased by the late 2000s (USFWS 2011). The populations on Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i&#160;Island and Maui are now considered to be self-sustaining (USFWS 2018). The population on Moloka’i is not yet successfully breeding (USFWS 2019), and so it is excluded from this assessment. In 2011-2016, 640 individuals were removed from a site on Kaua‘i&#160;to reduce the risk of bird strike at an airport, and moved to Hawai‘i&#160;and Maui (VanderWerf 2012, USFWS 2018).<br/><br/>The total population size of all established subpopulations is here placed in the band 2,600 - 3,300 individuals, roughly equivalent to 1,700 - 2,200 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Although the species is capable of flying between islands (Banko and Elder 1990), it is assumed that subpopulations on separate islands are largely isolated.",Increasing,"<em>Branta sandvicensis</em> is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>).
