It breeds in a wide range of environments, including permanent or semi-permanent ponds or lakes (COSEWIC 2012),&#160;from clear mountain ponds to temporary, manure-polluted pools in the lowlands, usually in sites where predatory fishes are absent. In the mountains of western Colorado, it is associated with ponds that have silty bottoms, low alkalinity, and no fish (Geraghty and Willey 1992). Aquatic breeding habitats must hold water for the 3 to 7 months required to complete development up to metamorphosis (COSEWIC 2012), and the species can be found in many breeding sites throughout the year (Hammerson 1999).","Besides use as live bait, this species is thought to be affected by deforestation and loss of wetland habitat (AmphibiaWeb 2011). However, the species commonly occurs in highly altered habitats, and it often breeds in ponds constructed for livestock use.(Hammerson 1999). Introduced predatory fish could potentially also be a cause of declines (AmphibiaWeb 2011, COSEWIC 2012), as could acid rain (Harte and Hoffman 1989). Cases of road mortality are high where roads intersect migration routes to and from breeding sites (COSEWIC 2012). Ambystoma tigrinum Virus (ATV)&#160;has been identified as the causative agent in localized mass mortality events of Western Tiger Salamanders in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta (COSEWIC 2012).<br/><br/>Many mountain lakes, formerly inhabited by tiger salamanders, now have few or none as a result of the stocking of trout which consume and deplete the larval populations (Blair 1951 pers. obs.). Geraghty and Willey (1992) found that fish absence was the most important factor influencing tiger salamander presence in Gunnison County and vicinity, and Corn, Jennings, and Muths (1997) reported that trout and tiger salamanders rarely occur together in Rocky Mountain National Park. Trout and tiger salamanders do occasionally coexist in some lakes (Dartt 1879, Blair 1951), but only where vegetated shallows provide habitat not easily accessible to the fishes.&#160;<br/><br/>Under certain conditions, larval populations might be vulnerable to bacterial infections associated with livestock grazing. In the mountains of Utah, Worthylake and Hovingh (1989) observed recurrent mass mortality of larvae associated a bacterial infection and suggested that increased nitrogen levels due in part to sheep grazing might have been involved. Bryant (1995) observed a mass mortality event in the summer of 1993 that appeared to be associated with an opportunistically pathogenic bacterium. In Arizona, similar die-offs, apparently associated with bacterial pathogens, have been reported (Pfennig, Loeb and Collins 1991). Cannibal morphs seemed particularly vulnerable, probably due to their feeding on diseased larvae. Again, fecal contamination of ponds by introduced livestock was suggested as a possible cause of the fatal outbreaks. In contrast to these reports, larvae sometimes do thrive in large numbers in manure-laden ponds in Colorado (Hammerson 1999). Nevertheless, die-offs of larvae, apparently associated with pathogenic bacteria, have been observed in Colorado (Hammerson 1999).","This is one of the most abundant&#160;<em>Ambystoma&#160;</em>species. The total adult population size is unknown but surely exceeds 1,000,000. Tiger Salamanders occur throughout their historical range in the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains of Colorado and adjacent states. They remain easy to find and locally abundant in suitable habitat. Ponds often contain up to several thousand larvae. Recent surveys found no evidence of significant declines in distribution or abundance (Corn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1989; Hammerson 1989a, 1992; Corn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997). In the Rocky Mountains, a local decline in numbers over several years, reported by Harte and Hoffman (1989), turned out to be a temporary fluctuation from which the population subsequently recovered (Wissinger and Whiteman 1992). Hovingh (1986) reported that tiger salamanders remain quite common in aquatic systems in glaciated portions of the Uinta Mountains in northeastern Utah. The widespread creation of small, fish-less artificial bodies of water has provided much suitable habitat where previously there was little, and these salamanders have been quick to colonize it (Norris 1973, Hammerson 1999). Declines of the Southern Mountain sub-population in British Columbia, northern part of the disjunct sub-population, have been observed and predicted based on habitat loss and degradation, road mortality, and&#160;other threats (COSEWIC 2012).",Unknown,"This species has a widespread distribution through western and central Canada including British Columbia, central and southern Alberta and Saskatchewan to southern Manitoba (COSEWIC 2012). In the United States it has a broad north-south distribution, extending from Montana and the Dakotas to Oklahoma and Texas (AmphibiaWeb 2011).&#160;The eastern distribution extends through Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, continues west along the northern Mexican states of Coahuila and Sonora, and then north through Arizona along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. There is a disjunct distribution in the northwest, extending from extreme northern Oregon, through Washington and Idaho panhandle&#160;into the southern Okanagan region of British Columbia&#160;(COSEWIC 2012). The species has been introduced in numerous localities west of the native range (Stebbins 2003); for example, some sub-populations in southern Arizona were introduced for use as fish bait (AmphibiaWeb 2011).","It is reported to be used widely as live bait in fishing (CARCNET 2010, AmphibiaWeb 2011).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong><em>Conservation Actions</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong>In most of the range in the United States, this species is of relatively low conservation concern and does not require significant additional protection or major management.<p></p>The Canadian range of this species includes the South Okanagan Grasslands Provincial and White Lake Grasslands Provincial Parks (COSEWIC 2012).

Medina-Rangel pers. comm. February 2019). The eggs are usually deposited on leaf surfaces and the larvae are washed off or fall into water below the site of oviposition.","<p>The massive declines noted in this species may have been due to chytridiomycosis (Gratwicke<em>&#160;et al.</em> 2016). However, studies by Woodhams&#160;<em>et al. </em>(2006) found that among the species studied this was one of the more resistant to infection; possibly explaining its continued persistence at lower numbers. Ranavirus is a potential threat, as infected individuals have been documented in Siquirres; however, the effect of this virus remains unknown (S. Whitfield and H. Zumbado-Ulate pers. comm. September 2019).<br/><br/>General habitat loss and fragmentation remains a threat throughout this species' range, and this is especially the case in Costa Rica where deforestation by squatters threatens Fila Asunción, one of the two confirmed remaining subpopulations in the country. The other extant subpopulation at Siquirres is currently protected by a private landowner; however should the ownership change in the future, the security of this subpopulation could be at risk (Costa Rica Red List Workshop September 2019). The other historical sites in Costa Rica have been deforested for agriculture and livestock ranching (Costa Rica Red List Workshop September 2019). Deforestation and illegal mining are the main threats in the area where the species has been registered in Colombia (G.F. Medina-Rangel pers. comm. February 2019).</p>","It was once considered to be a reasonably common species in Costa Rica, but most subpopulations disappeared in the late 1980s and early 1990s.&#160;As of 2019, the species has been reported with certainty from only three areas in Costa Rica: Fila Asunción, 15 km south-west of Limón in&#160;Veraguas&#160;(an abandoned farm); in a forested area near Parque Nacional Barbilla and Siquirres in&#160;Limón&#160;Province (B. Kubucki and S. Salazar pers. comm. September 2019); and from&#160;La Alegría in Guayacan&#160;in Limón Province&#160;(Garcia-Rodriguez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;The species has been reported from a fourth area in Costa Rica: Cedral, near Miramar, however this record remains unconfirmed (F. Bolaños pers. comm. September 2019).&#160;Fila Asunción&#160;is the only site known to have a large breeding subpopulation (Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019). In 2003, the species was&#160;intentionally reintroduced to a historical site in Siquirres; ca. 75 tadpoles rescued from another site ca. 30 km away (airline distance) and introduced to the area, and the species is now colonizing other neighboring properties, all of which are within its general historical range (B. Kubicki pers. comm. September 2019). All other previously known Costa Rican subpopulations are thought to have disappeared, including those in Monteverde, San Ramón, Parque Nacional Braulio Carrillo, and Parque Nacional Tapantí. It has still not recovered in much of its Costa Rican range, and has not been recorded in recent years in the Cordillera Central or&#160;Cordillera&#160;de Tilarán (Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019).<br/><br/>The species was once reasonably common in lower elevations throughout Panama, but extensive declines have reduced its range to only a few sites in western Panama (Hertz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), and occasional records from central Panama. Extensive declines have been recorded from the Reserva Forestal Fortuna, Chiriquí (no records from this site since 1999) and El Copé, Coclé where it declined from 2004, although it persists at a very reduced abundance (Lips&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><br/>In Colombia, the species is either very rare, very difficult to see, or the population is very small (G.F. Medina-Rangel pers. comm. February 2019). During surveys in&#160;Unguía, Chocó&#160;between 2012 and 2016, only two individuals were seen during one outing in July 2014. The status of the Colombian subpopulations remains unknown.<br/><br/>Overall, the population is thought to be decreasing due to a combination of ongoing decline in the extent and quality of habitat and disease. It is reasonable to estimate that the remaining population has experienced a decline of 80-95% since 1998 (21 years/three generation lengths) based on the disappearance of the western and central Panamanian population, probably due to chytridiomycosis (Lips&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Hertz<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012).",Decreasing,"This species occurs in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. It occurs predominantly on the Atlantic versant from the vicinity of Tilarán, Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, to western Panama; the disjunct Pacific slope records are from northwestern Costa Rica and southwestern, central, and extreme eastern Panama in the Darién area, where it extends marginally across the border into Colombia.&#160;Its elevational range is 440-1,600 m asl.","<p>This species is commercially available in the international pet trade, presumably from captive-bred sources at present.

Chaves pers. comm. 2007, 2019). Situating barrels of water in the forest has successfully attracted this species to reproduce (B. Kubicki pers. comm. August 2010). The species is known to occur within at least six Panamanian protected areas, and is identified as a high conservation priority species in Panama's national amphibian conservation action plan (ANAM 2011). Two successful captive breeding programmes began in 2001: 1) the Atlanta Botanical Garden, which has since transferred individuals to 19 US zoos which continue captive breeding efforts in the US (Gratwicke&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016)' and 2) the&#160;Manchester Museum, which has transferred some individuals to Bristol Zoo and Norden’s Ark for assurance populations (M.

This species is also likely to be threatened by surface water extraction for domestic and agricultural use (S.&#160;Whitfield&#160;pers. comm.&#160;September 2019), and the dumping of chemicals into rivers to harvest freshwater crustaceans is another probable threat (Costa Rica Red List Workshop&#160;September 2019). The expansion of oil palm plantations is a growing threat to the species in Costa Rica (H. Zumbado-Ulate pers comm. September 2019). In Panama, the area where it was found in 2008 is being deforested for livestock farming and agriculture purposes (A. Batista pers. comm. March 2013).","This is a large species, unlikely to be overlooked, that was formerly very abundant,&#160;particularly in the Osa Peninsula and Golfito in&#160;Costa Rica (Savage 2002). By the early 1990s, all known subpopulations had been extirpated in Costa Rica, and&#160;its decline is considered enigmatic because population collapses were apparently simultaneous and occurred in protected and unprotected areas at low elevations.&#160;Since 2000, extensive field work within its historical distribution in Costa Rica has revealed that this frog is now restricted to a small area.

As such, we reaffirm the prior assessment of the taxonomically restricted Mojave Desert Tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, as Critically Endangered, and add criterion “a” for direct population observations: CR A2abce+A4abce. The previously defined widespread species&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu lato</em>)&#160;was last assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1996; a separate assessment currently in progress by the TFTSG for the Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai </em>(previously considered part of <em>G. agassizii</em>)&#160;has provisionally assessed that species as Vulnerable.","The life history of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is typical of long-lived chelonians and has been reviewed by Berry and Murphy (2019). Tortoises require 17–20 years to reach sexual maturity at a straight-line carapace length (CL) of 18 cm or more (Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, Medica <em>et al</em>. 2012). Variation in years is dependent on desert region, frequency of droughts, and quality of available forage. In the northern part of the geographic range, females smaller than 20.9 cm were not reproducing (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998).&#160; Maximum lifespan was estimated by Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) at 75 years, but few live beyond 50 yrs in the wild (Germano 1992). Generation time was estimated to be 20–32 years (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, USFWS 1994). Based on data from three desert regions, mean sizes of females ranges from 21.4 to 23.1 cm, whereas the mean sizes of males ranged from 24.3 to 24.9 cm; the largest desert tortoises on record, a male, reached 38.1 cm carapace length (Stebbins 2003), whereas a female was 37.4 cm, but these animals were exceptions (Berry and Murphy 2019).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Mature females may lay clutches of one to 10 eggs in up to three clutches per year in spring and early summer; in some years, some females do not lay eggs (Rostal <em>et al</em>. 1994, Henen 1997, Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wallis <em>et al</em>. 1999, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2015). Annual fecundity ranges from 0 to 16 eggs (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2015). Several factors may affect egg production: site, year, size of female, size and number of eggs, and available water and protein from precipitation and forage in the year preceding egg laying, as well as the year eggs are laid (Henen 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Incubation times for eggs range from 67 to 104 days (Burge 1977, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hatching success varies and appears to depend on year, location of the nest, and whether it is the first or second clutch. Eggs may be infertile or broken during laying (e.g., 12%; Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). Many nests are destroyed by predators before hatching and the loss of eggs (and nests) varies by year (Turner et al. 1987); they estimated an average loss of 37.1% of nests in a multi-year study. Hatching success in intact nests, undisturbed by predators, has been shown to vary from 73 to 100% (McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Rostal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bjurlin and Bissonette 2004, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises inhabit desert scrub habitats, including saltbush, creosote bush, Joshua Trees and Mojave yuccas, and microphyll woodlands with ironwood, palo verde, desert willow, and smoke trees (Berry and Murphy 2019). In the northeastern part of their geographic range, they occur in an ecotone between the Mojave and Great Basin deserts with sand sagebrush and junipers. Actual occurrences tend to be in valleys, alluvial fans, bajadas, and ephemeral stream channels, although tortoises can be found in low sand dunes and on steep slopes of mesas and cliffs (Berry and Murphy 2019).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises are herbivorous and selective in their choice of plant species (Jennings 1993, Oftedal 2002, Oftedal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jennings and Berry 2015). They primarily eat forbs when available. In years of abundant precipitation, they are selective feeders and prefer specific species of annuals and herbaceous perennials in the legume, mallow, borage, aster, four o’clock, and cactus families (as well as other families). Although they eat grasses, a diet solely of grasses is deficient in nutrients and is likely to inhibit growth and survival, especially in neonate, juveniles, and immature tortoises (Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The quality and quantity of preferred plant foods has diminished because of continuing invasion of non-native annual grasses and forbs and increased fire associated with the highly combustible&#160;non-native grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).&#160;<br/><br/>Annual survival and mortality of adults is dependent on sex, size of the tortoise, frequency and severity of droughts, numbers and types of anthropogenic uses, location, and decade of study. In a multi-year study in the eastern Mojave Desert, annual survivorship of juveniles increased with size, ranging from 0.767 when &lt;6.0 cm to 0.861 when 6.0 to 17.9 cm (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). When tortoises reach breeding age at an estimated 18.0 cm, survival rates were 0.87 to 0.944. Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported an annual survival of 0.883 for adults at Joshua Tree National Park. In a study in the Colorado Desert, Agha <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated adult survival at a wind-turbine energy site (0.96) and an adjacent area (0.92). At two sites in the eastern Mojave Desert, Longshore <em>et al</em>. (2003) reported annual survival of adults of 0.985 and 0.829, with the lower survival rate at a site affected by drought.<br/><br/>Woodbury and Hardy (1948) estimated that 1% of adults died per year in a population mostly comprised of adults. In the northeastern Mojave Desert, Turner <em>et al</em>. (1984) reported mortality rates of 18.4% in a year of drought and 4.4% in a normal year. In the western Mojave Desert, death rates were lowest at a protected Research Natural Area (2.8%/yr) and highest in critical habitat (20.4%/yr). At Joshua Tree National Park, the mortality rate was 11.7% (Freilich <em>et al.</em> 2000), and in Red Rock State Park, 67% (Berry et al. 2008). In a demographic study of tortoises at 21 sites in the central Mojave Desert, mortality rates of adults ranged from 1.9 to 95.2% (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) predicted an annual rate of population increase of <em>ca</em>. 2% in a model based on a tortoise subpopulation in the eastern Mojave Desert between 1977 and 1985. By 2000, this subpopulation had declined precipitously, apparently due to disease (see Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2002) estimated the recruitment rate of young tortoises into the adult subpopulation at 0.092 in a plot in Joshua Tree National Park. This number of tortoises on this plot was thought to be stable between 1991 and 1995, but later declined (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>Gopherus agassizii</em>&#160;faces&#160;multiple threats to individuals, populations, and habitat (for annotated bibliographies of reports and published papers, see Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980; Berry 1984; USFWS 1990, 1994, 2010, 2011; Grover and DeFalco 1995; Bury and Luckenbach 2002; von Senckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002; Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2011; Lovich and Ennen 2013a; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015; Berry and Murphy 2019). Recent articles document further examples of threats (Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b,c). Much of the information with numerous references are contained in Berry and Murphy (2019). Substantial tortoise habitat was already lost to cities, towns, settlements, agriculture, energy developments, and military bases in the 20th century, and continuing habitat loss and degradation, combined with high mortality rates in dwindling low-density populations due to disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis), road and off-road vehicle-induced mortality, subsidized predators (e.g., ravens), poaching for pets, and mortality from increasing droughts associated with climate change, are threatening most remaining populations of Desert Tortoises (summarized in Berry and Murphy 2019). The majority of desert tortoise populations are currently considered non-viable because of the low density of adults and their existence in isolated and fragmented pieces of habitat (Berry 1984, USFWS 2010, Allison and McLuckie 2018, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).&#160;<br/><br/>Many threats are cumulative in nature and interact synergistically with others. By rating them separately in the Standard Threats Classification Scheme below, the severity of threats and their negative impacts are not described in full measure. One of the limitations of the classification scheme for threats are the ratings for severity. Severity is associated with declines (or not) by percent over 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer. For species such as desert tortoises with long generation times (<em>ca</em>. 20–30 years), this may be 60 to 90 or more years. Here we provide a detailed and expanded Threats Classification Scheme for <em>G. agassizii</em>.<br/><br/><strong>Detailed Threats Classification Scheme<br/><br/></strong>Classification Level<br/><br/>&#160; a. Examples<br/>&#160; b. Timing and Scope<br/><br/>1.1 Housing &amp; urban areas, towns, settlements, ranches<br/>&#160; a. Desert cities, towns, settlements, scattered homes in rural areas, desert land entry, e.g., Inyokern, Ridgecrest, Red Mountain, Trona, Boron, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, Lucerne Valley, Ft. Irwin, Barstow, Daggett, Mountain Pass, Joshua Tree, Twentynine Palms, Vidal Junction, Ludlow, Amboy, Needles, Las Vegas, St. George, Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, Parker, Blythe, El Centro,&#160;Stateline, Las Vegas, Mesquite, St. George.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, disappearance of tortoises and habitat; 20% of geographic range. Loss of habitat from widespread and rapidly growing and expanding cities, towns, and settlements associated with high levels of human population growth in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts and loss and degradation of adjacent habitat (Hughson 2009, U.S. Census Bureau 2010). In the northwest and southwest portions of the geographic range, tortoise populations are locally extinct, absent from valleys and fans and in low densities on military bases.<br/><br/>1.2 Commercial &amp; Industrial<br/>&#160; a. Airports and landing strips, military bases, solar and wind farms.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, loss of tortoises and habitat; 8% of geographic range. Development and use of multiple airports, landing strips, several large military bases with ground disturbing activities (military manoeuvres), and solar and wind farms (with associated transmission lines and roads)&#160;result in degradation and loss of substantial habitat in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts.<br/><br/>1.3 Residential &amp; commercial; golf courses, tourism, recreation<br/>&#160; a. Golf courses are associated with cities and towns that currently exist or are expanding within or near Desert Tortoise habitat (e.g., Las Vegas, Henderson). Vehicle-oriented recreation and visitation are very high in many parts of both deserts including what is now critical habitat, several State Parks and National Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, museums, and other points of interest.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Loss and degradation of habitat, illegal collecting of tortoises: 30%. The high levels of visitor use pose severe threats to <em>G. agassizii</em> throughout remaining habitat as well as in critical habitat. For example, at Lake Mead National Recreation, annual records of visitors from 1946 was &gt;1 million visitors per year; by 2018 more than 7.5 million visits occurred (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/"" style=""color: purple;"">https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/</a>). In parts of critical habitat in the western Mojave Desert, visitor use is very high, e.g., visits and visitor days recorded annually from 2008–2018 ranged from 55,874 to 94,474 visits and 26,218 to 90,445 visitor days per year (USBLM 2019). Visitor use, particularly vehicle-oriented use, is very difficult to control; a substantial portion occurs off-highway and designated trails.&#160;Off-road vehicle recreational uses are associated with higher rates of deaths from gunshots in tortoises occurring in areas with high visitor use days (Berry 1986, 2020a).<br/><br/>2.1.3 Agriculture: Agro-industry farming<br/>&#160; a. Farms for cotton, alfalfa, pistachio, goat-nut, and other crops and dry farming in parts of the geographic range (e.g., Fremont, Antelope, Indian Wells, Victor, Apple, Lucerne, Mojave River, Chuckwalla and Virgin River valleys, bordering the Colorado River).<br/>&#160; b. Severe, cleared land, local areas, often expansive, throughout the geographic range. Historic and ongoing. Habitat and tortoises lost, 10%. Farming began very early (late 1800s) and continues to the present. Farming has negatively affected the water table locally, causing subsidence and fissures to develop in at least one area (Berry 1984), as well as altering vegetation in the vicinity. Habitat cleared for farming generally is used for industrial purposes, e.g., solar or off-road vehicle recreation after abandonment. Both agricultural and industrial uses are associated with influx and proliferation of non-native plants onto adjacent, high quality desert tortoise habitat and protected areas.<br/><br/>2.3.2 and 2.3.3 Agriculture: livestock farming &amp; ranching<br/>&#160; a. Cattle ranching, sheep grazing and driveways, allotments, licenses, and leases (often on federal lands); growing herds of feral burros and expansion into critical habitat.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Moderate to severe, historic (from 1850s), ongoing; 80% of the geographic range affected. Grazing of livestock and use of driveways was widespread and often intensive throughout the geographic range until the Taylor Grazing Act in 1932. Livestock grazing was widespread after that time but managed as an important desert use (e.g., Berry 1984, USBLM 1980). In 1990, after the tortoise was listed as threatened, sheep grazing continued but was excluded from critical habitat. Cattle grazing continued throughout much of critical habitat and still occurs in an estimated 17% of critical habitat (USFWS 2010). Feral burros also graze in tortoise habitats and are encroaching into one critical habitat (USFWS 2010; Berry et al. 2020c). Livestock cause degradation and loss of habitat through development of piospheres, trampling, altering cover, composition of shrubs and forage plants available for tortoises to eat (Webb and Stielstra 1979, Fleischner 1994, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Abella 2008, Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016). The disturbances created by grazing contributes to growth and proliferation of non-native, fire-prone, invasive grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992).<br/><br/>3.1 Energy production &amp; mining: oil and gas<br/>&#160; a. Oil and gas, drilling and exploration.<br/>&#160; b. Medium severity, local areas, &lt;1% of geographic range. Exploratory drilling has occurred in tortoise habitat and has left degraded and cleared areas of &lt; 1-2 ha, with spoil piles, drilling waste, and trash from the drilling operations spread over the area. These sites became focal points for camping and vehicle-oriented recreation, enlarging over time (K.H. Berry pers. obs.).<br/><br/>3.2 Energy production &amp; mining: mining and quarrying<br/>&#160; a. Small and large mines, exploratory pits, bulldozed areas, shafts, and major mines; quarries.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation on a local or regional scale; 5%. Mining on small and large scales began in the late 1800s, killing tortoises and destroying habitat. Roads were constructed to access potential mining areas and districts (Mojave,&#160;Rand, Atolia, Goldstone, Calico, Mountain Pass). Tortoises fall into pits and shafts and were killed. Some mines cover 7.8 km<sup>2</sup> or more and their influence can expand beyond that. Gold mines are associated with spread of mercury and arsenic in soils and plants far beyond the source (e.g., &gt;12 km), transported by wind and water (Chaffee&#160;and Berry 2006; Kim <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014). Tortoises are negatively affected by these elemental toxicants with poor health; these toxicants were reported in livers, integument, lungs, etc.&#160;(Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, Selzer and Berry 2005, Foster <em>et a</em>l. 2009).<br/><br/>3.3 Energy production &amp; mining: renewable energy<br/>&#160; a. Windfarms, photovoltaic, solar fields; new utility and transmission lines, power poles and towers with adjacent roads accompany these developments.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, future. Severe degradation and loss locally over large areas, 5% over the geographic range. Windfarms occur in tortoise habitat, generally on slopes or on hills and small mountains. Solar panels have been constructed on abandoned agricultural fields or in low density or marginal habitat. However, some projects were built in prime habitat, causing loss of habitat and displacement of tortoises. Solar and wind energy is a growing industry with losses of &gt;106 km<sup>2 </sup>as of 2019 (Mark Massar, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>4.1 Transportation and service corridors: roads &amp; railroads<br/>&#160; a. Freeways, 2-lane highways, county gravel or dirt roads, and roads to points of interest; railroads (two major) and several spurs with associated dirt roads and tower lay-down areas for power towers and poles.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe loss and degradation of habitat. 5% throughout the geographic range. Roads were developed in the late 1800s and have proliferated and widened into freeways since that time. Several major freeways and state highways cross the geographic range. Importantly many more dirt roads exist to points of interest (e.g., mines, mining areas, water troughs and water sources, outlying rural areas, recreation areas). Tortoise populations are depleted on either side of highways and well-used roads for distances of &gt;4,000 m (von Seckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002). A very small portion of these roads and highways have tortoise-proof fencing.<br/><br/>4.2 Transportation &amp; service corridors: utility &amp; service lines<br/>&#160; a. Telephone and electric poles and lines; major transmission lines and corridors.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, moderate to severe. Telephone poles and electric poles and lines usually parallel major or minor paved and dirt roads and extend from towns and cities&#160;into remote areas to provide service to agricultural developments, mines, wind and solar farms and individual residences or small settlements. Electric transmission lines cross many parts of the geographic range, including critical habitat (critical habitat alone: 1,634 km of lines in corridors, total area of corridors, 1,743.5 km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2010).&#160; These corridors are accompanied by dirt roads and spurs to the towers. Often corridors contain several sets of towers and electrical lines. Utility lines also include ground disturbance from fibre optic cables, aqueducts, and gas lines, all of which disturb tortoise habitat. Utility poles and transmission lines have allowed for spread of predators (Common Raven, Red-tailed Hawk) into remote parts of the desert, because they make use of the towers and poles for perching and nesting, leading to increased predation on tortoises (Knight and Kawashima 1993, Anderson and Berry 2019).<br/><br/>4.4 Transportation and service corridors: flight paths or military use<p>&#160; a. Commercial, non-commercial, and Department of Defence flight paths.<br/>&#160; b. Numerous, ongoing. Flight paths are minor or no impact if not associated with release of ordnance (bombing ranges). The noise may have effects on wildlife, including tortoises (e.g., Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>5.1.1 Biological resource use: hunting &amp; trapping terrestrial animals: intentional use (species is the target)<br/>&#160; a. Illegal collecting of <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>for commercial sale, food, cultural purposes, and for international trade, etc.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Tortoises have been and continue to be collected for pets, food, tourism,&#160;commercial sale, and cultural purposes, although such collection has been unlawful since 1939 (Berry 1984, Berry <em>et al</em>. 1996, Berry and Murphy 2019, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.1 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: recreational activities<br/>&#160; a. Visits to State and National Parks and Preserves, National Recreation Areas, federal and state lands, private lands, and Open Recreation Use Areas (unrestricted vehicle play areas) by vehicle-oriented recreationists.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe impacts regionally and locally, especially in the western, central, and southern Mojave Desert and growing in the western Sonoran Desert; associated with proximity to cities, towns, and settlements. Formerly populated with Desert Tortoises, several intensively used areas are now severely degraded and have few if any tortoises (e.g., Bury and Luckenbach 2002, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014a, USFWS 2015, Berry and Murphy 2019). Vehicle-oriented visitation is exceptionally high, ranging from &gt;50,000 to 86,550 between 2008 and 2018 annually in some regions of the Mojave Desert (USBLM 2019). Other parts of the desert and critical habitat are also experiencing growing numbers of visitors. Deaths of desert tortoises from road kills and shooting is higher in areas with high levels of vehicle-oriented visitation (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.2 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: war, civil unrest &amp; military exercises<br/>&#160; a. World War II and subsequent. Military manoeuvres across substantial areas of habitat in the western Sonoran and eastern Mojave deserts to train troops using tanks and other vehicles for the war in North Africa. Since the 1960s, military manoeuvres with armoured vehicles in extensive areas in the western, southern, and central Mojave deserts; aerial bombing training in limited areas in the western Sonoran Desert.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Military manoeuvres in 1942 resulted in severely degraded habitat (compacted soils, damaged desert pavements, altered vegetation, including forage available for desert tortoises. Lands disturbed in 1942 have not recovered after 60 years (Prose 1985, 1986; Prose and Wilshire 2000). Similar disturbances have occurred and continue to occur in tortoise populations and habitat at military installations in the southern and central Mojave Desert. In the early 2000s, expansion of the Fort Irwin military installation in the central Mojave Desert caused loss and degradation of 760 km<sup>2</sup> of tortoise habitat and <em>ca</em>. 304 km<sup>2</sup> of the lost habitat was part of critical habitat (USFWS 2010, Berry and Murphy 2019). An estimated <em>ca</em>. 300 km<sup>2</sup> will be lost with additional, ongoing expansion of the same base. The western expansion of the Marine Corps base at 29 Palms caused hundreds of tortoises to be translocated and habitat lost in the southern Mojave Desert (USDD 2017).<br/><br/>6.3 Work and other activities: law enforcement, illegal immigrants, species research, vandalism<br/>&#160; a. Border patrol agents and illegal immigrants travel cross-country by foot and vehicle in tortoise habitat in the southern border range. Vandalism, specifically wanton shooting or killing of tortoises has affected some populations more than others, probably associated with higher visitor use and vehicle-oriented recreation.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, moderate severity. Border patrol agents travel north from the border into tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, to apprehend illegal immigrants. Vehicle travel can occur off dirt roads, widen existing roads, and create new disturbances. Shooting tortoises, running over them deliberately with vehicles, or otherwise killing them has been documented in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>7.1.1 Fires &amp; fire suppression<br/>&#160; a. Caused by lightning, car fires on highways or roads, arson.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, severe, with the severity dependent on the critical habitat unit or protected area. Mojave and Colorado Desert habitats did not evolve with fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). Fires increased in numbers, frequency, and amounts burned with the invasion and proliferation of non-native grasses which are highly combustible (Berry and Murphy 2019). Fires have occurred throughout the geographic range and have burned significant amounts of critical and other protected habitats in the southern, central, eastern and northeastern Mojave Desert regions. Once habitat burns, it is likely to burn again with higher frequencies and with potentially increased biomass of non-native annual grasses. Tortoises die in these fires or are injured, but some survive (Berry and Murphy 2019). Loss of cover of shrubs and food supply for the tortoises is severe in most burned areas. When fires are very hot, the seed bed may be damaged or destroyed. The most severely burned protected habitat is in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve with &gt;30% burned as of summer 2020 (McLuckie <em>et al</em>. 2021); the Mojave National Preserve also experienced a major fire and loss or degradation of 7% of the critical habitat unit in summer 2020 (Darby <em>et al</em>. 2021). <br/><br/>7.2.8 Abstraction of ground water<br/>&#160; a. For agriculture, primarily, followed by urban and cities.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, long-term degradation of habitat adjacent to cities, towns, industrial and agricultural developments. Depletion of the ground water table causing subsidence and formation of fissures has occurred in at least one part of the western Mojave Desert and in the northeastern Mojave Desert in the Las Vegas Valley in what was once desert tortoise habitat (Berry 1984, Burbey 2002). In the western Mojave Desert, the water table was depleted by agricultural uses (cotton, alfalfa) and now with solar energy development; and by cities in the Las Vegas Valley by depleted associated aquifers. Other regions have and continue to experience depletion of the water table in areas with agriculture and desert cities, e.g., adjacent to the Mojave, Colorado, and Virgin rivers (Stamos <em>et al</em>. 2001). Water is sought from sources and regions outside desert tortoise habitat (e.g., the Colorado River) to support cities and towns, as well as agriculture, because existing water tables are insufficient to support them.<br/><br/>8.1.2 Invasive and other problematic species, genes &amp; diseases: Named species<br/>&#160; a.&#160;<em>Bromus madritensis </em>ssp<em>. rubens, B. tectorum, Schismus </em>spp<em>., Erodium cicutarium, Hirschfeldia incana, Brassica tournefortii.<br/></em>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation of the Mojave and western Sonoran ecosystems. Landscape conservation forecasting (Provencher <em>et al</em>. 2011) quantified the pervasive abundance of annual brome grasses that foster destructive wildfires of a size and intensity far greater than the fire regime with which Mojave Desert habitats developed over the past millennia.&#160;In addition to supporting fires, the non-native grasses compete with native forage species of forbs required by tortoises to grow, reproduce, and remain healthy. Non-native grasses and forbs dominate the ecosystem in biomass in both wet and dry years in many tortoise habitats (Brooks and Berry 2006, Berry 2014b). Non-native grasses are not nutritious plants for tortoises to eat and cause weight loss and can cause death in juveniles (Hazard <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The awns of <em>Bromus</em> also can injure tortoise mouths. The non-native <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em> and especially <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, introduced through agricultural development, also compete with native forage species, changing the composition of the native flora (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b). They are not eaten by tortoises and can be high in oxalates, potentially a source of oxalosis in tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>8.1.2 Diseases. Named species<br/>&#160; a. Infectious diseases: <em>Mycoplasma agassizii, M. testudineum, </em>Testudinid herpesvirus 2 (TeHV2); Non-infectious diseases: oxalosis, gout, starvation, dehydration.<br/>&#160; b. Infectious diseases: ongoing, severe in some areas. The two species of <em>Mycoplasma</em> are infectious pathogens. The first (<em>M. agassizii</em>) was discovered in wild populations in 1989 and the second (<em>M. testudineum</em>) a few years later (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, 2014). These pathogens are spread by contact between tortoises cause disease and death in some populations, and inhibit olfaction necessary for foraging (Jacobson and Berry 2012, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Mycoplasma agassizii</em> is common in captive desert tortoises, more so than in wild populations. Epidemiological studies indicate that the distribution of the two species differs, and that tortoises with antibody-positive tests for the diseases occur closer to human habitations rather than more distant (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mycoplasmosis has been implicated as a major contributor to a catastrophic die-off of tortoises at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2020b). It is also associated with declines in other parts of the geographic range (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160; Non-infectious diseases of known etiology include oxalosis, gout, and starvation and dehydration (Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Some individuals and populations have been negatively affected by these diseases.<br/><br/>8.2.2 Problematic Native Species<br/>&#160; a. The Common Raven (<em>Corvus corax)</em>, an uncommon to rare resident between the 1920s and 1940s in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts, is now an abundant predator in ecosystems where the Desert Tortoise lives.&#160;Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>) is another similar predator, and Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>) can also be a hyper-predator.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe and negative effects on population structure; loss of juveniles and immature tortoises. Populations of the Common Raven have grown enormously, supported by subsidies of food, water, perch and nest sites available from humans (Boarman 1993, Boarman and Berry 1995). They have been able to access formerly remote parts of the desert by relying on settlements, road kills and trash along highways and roads, and utility poles and transmission lines for perching and nesting (Knight and Kawashima 1993). Common Ravens are very effective predators on hatchling, juvenile and immature tortoises, with dozens to hundreds of shells recorded beneath perch and nest sites. They are responsible for preventing recovery in many parts of the desert by depleting young tortoise cohorts in populations that can lead to local extinctions (Kristan and Boarman 2003). Red-tailed Hawks have expanded their use areas into remote parts of the desert ecosystems, using utility poles and towers as nest sites and juvenile tortoises for food (Anderson and Berry 2019). Similarly, Coyotes are subsidized predators found in increased numbers near cities, towns, and some military installations and at times have high predation rates on tortoises (Esque <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>8.4.2 Problematic Species/ Diseases: Named Species<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Several non-native species of tortoises and turtles carrying disease or potentially carrying disease have been released illegally into Desert Tortoise habitats, e.g., African Spurred Tortoise (<em>Centrochelys</em> <em>sulcata</em>; Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018) and Central Asian Steppe Tortoise (<em>Testudo horsfieldii</em>; Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe. Releases of tortoises, whether native or non-native are illegal in large parts of the geographic range. Nevertheless, introduced, non-native turtles and tortoises such as the African Spurred Tortoise and Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise have been found to carry new diseases that would negatively affect already declining <em>G. agassizii </em>populations (Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018). The African Spurred Tortoise can do damage to habitat and to the native tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, because of the large size and aggressive nature. One Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise was captured in the Central Mojave Desert with a new herpesvirus not previously described in <em>G. agassizii&#160;</em>(Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The concern is that this non-native tortoise may have transmitted the new herpesvirus to desert tortoises. New, non-native herpesviruses from other species and countries and continents are a threat to health in already declining <em>G. agassizii</em> populations.<br/><br/>8.5 Viral/Prion-induced Diseases<br/>&#160; a. Herpesviruses are implicated in illness and mortality in tortoises.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe if coupled with other stressors. Herpesviruses are a threat to health and survival of desert tortoises, especially those herpesviruses introduced from other, non-native species to the desert. Tortoises with clinical signs of the disease were among populations that severely declined between the 1990s and 2000s; herpesvirus may have contributed in some areas (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Testudinid herpesvirus 2 was first identified in captive tortoises, then confirmed in wild <em>G. agassizii</em> (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012). The estimated prevalence of this herpesvirus for captive and wild tortoises from the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts ranged from 15 to 56% (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>8.6 Diseases of Unknown Cause<br/>&#160; a. Shell diseases, i.e., cutaneous dyskeratosis, necrosis.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. A novel shell disease, cutaneous dyskeratosis and shell necrosis, was implicated in illness and deaths of Desert Tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1994; Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2001) and a decline of ca. 80% in a once-robust population. Other populations in critical habitats appear to be affected similarly. This is a metabolic disease with lesions of the shell and integument as outward manifestations. The causes are suspected to be toxicants (e.g., elemental toxicants and/or nutritional deficiencies). The disease is implicated in elevated death rates in adult tortoises in the western Sonoran Desert and eastern Mojave Desert (Berry and Medica 1995, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>9.2.2 Industrial &amp; military effluents<br/>&#160; a. Seepage from mining.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, unremediated regionally. There are links between some diseases in tortoises and toxicants from mining and other similar developments. Tortoises dying of upper respiratory tract disease caused by <em>Mycoplasma</em> spp. in the western Mojave Desert in close proximity to a mining district had high levels of mercury in livers compared to tortoises without the disease (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991). Ill tortoises with high levels of arsenic occurred in an area mining district with high levels of mercury and arsenic (Selzer and Berry 2005). Waste from the mines was transported by wind and water to distances of 15 km (Chaffee and Berry 2006; Kim et al. 2012, 2014). Mines in other tortoise habitat in different desert regions have yet to be examined.</p><p>9.4 Garbage &amp; Solid Waste<br/>&#160; a. Trash is a threat to tortoises because they can consume it or become entangled.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, low to moderate. Consumption of trash can lead to illness and death (Donoghue 2006, Walde <em>et al</em>. 2007). Balloons and other trash are common throughout the desert and most abundant near human habitations, along roads, and recreation use areas (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008, 2014a; Keith <em>et al</em>. 2008). Trash attracts predators—Common Ravens, Coyotes, and other canids—thus creating an additional risk to tortoises.<br/><br/>9.5 Air-borne Pollutants<br/>&#160; a. Pollutants such as atmospheric nitrogen and increases in CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the growth of invasive grasses and thus fire.<br/>&#160; b. Atmospheric nitrogen from urban or other areas is transported to deserts and tortoise habitat, and deposited on soils, thus enhancing growth of non-native grasses and plants prone to fire (Brooks 2003, Rao and Allen 2010).<br/><br/>11.1 Habitat Shifting &amp; Alteration<br/>&#160; a. Desertification; degradation of vegetation, soils, and topography<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Throughout the geographic range, most, if not all, tortoise habitats have received (and continue to receive) one or more anthropogenic uses and activities resulting in compacted or eroded soils and alteration of the natural structure and composition of annual and perennial vegetation (e.g., Lei 2009). Long-lived shrubs and native annual wildflowers and grasses have been replaced in part with short-lived colonizers (shrubs, non-native, fire-prone grasses) typical of disturbed areas. These changes have brought fewer places to dig burrows and a reduced supply of nutritious plants to eat (Brooks and Berry 2006, Webb and Wilshire 1983). In some areas, the rich diversity of shrubs and annual plants have been replaced by a few shrub species and the annuals replaced with primarily non-native annual species (Brooks and Berry 2006).<br/><br/>11.2 Droughts<br/>&#160; a. Desert Tortoises require water from precipitation and a diverse diet of native annuals to grow, reproduce and survive.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, increasingly severe with reduced survival throughout the geographic range, often associated with hyper-predation by coyotes. Although the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts are typified by droughts often lasting more than a year, tortoises have adaptations to cope. However, tortoises die of starvation and dehydration during prolonged droughts (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2002, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003, Longshore <em>et al</em>. 2003, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014). Juveniles are especially vulnerable. With climate change and warming, droughts, including megadroughts lasting 10 years or more, are predicted to occur in coming years (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2017, Steiger <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>11.3 Temperature Extremes<br/>&#160; a. Tortoises are able to withstand the extremes of temperature experienced in the desert; however, increases in warm temperatures coupled with drying and changes in precipitation patterns present high risks to the species.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing and a growing issue, with climate change having negative impacts throughout the geographic range. Tortoises cope with the extremes of summer and winter temperatures (and lack of water, see 11.2) by using deep burrows and restricting above-ground activities and reproduction during drought. As temperatures rise with the rise in CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases, tortoises will need to find habitats where deeper burrows can be excavated. At the higher temperatures, the spring season for foraging on ephemeral annuals and egg laying is likely to be shortened, reducing the time for eating, growing, and egg production. Sex of tortoises is determined by temperature of incubation in nests, with females produced at the higher temperatures and males at the lower temperatures. Eggs laid in nest that will experience the high temperatures of summer may be predominantly female, and if temperatures are excessive, may not be viable. Although the species could survive at higher (and cooler) elevations, the habitat in mountain ranges will be more limited, steep, rocky, with exposed bedrock in places with inadequate forage.<br/><br/>12.1 Other Threats<br/>&#160; a. Climate Change.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, see 11.2 and 11.3. Change in timing and amounts of precipitation coupled with increasing temperatures are likely to have profound negative effects on the species, further reducing available habitat (e.g., Barrows 2011). Profound changes are predicted to cause deterioration in composition, structure, diversity and biomass of trees and shrubs (Munson et al. 2016) that provide shade and cover to the tortoises. Barrows (2011) predicted that tortoises may survive if they move from the western Colorado Desert to higher elevations.&#160; However, the long-lived tortoises have strong fidelity to existing home ranges.</p>","Population estimates and trends have previously been difficult to obtain with certainty for large segments of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> populations due to their patchy distribution, difficulty of detection, and associated statistical weaknesses of population estimates. Population data have been variously documented or reviewed by Woodbury and Hardy (1948), Hardy (1976), Berry (1984, 1986, 1989), Bury and Corn (1995),&#160;Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Berry and Murphy (2019). A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;by Allison and McLuckie (2018) has demonstrated continued adult population declines in four of the five&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units and low densities in nearly all subpopulations near the minimum required to remain viable (3.9 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>Between the 1930s and early 2000s, estimates of density and trends in populations were based on demographic data, habitat condition, and anthropogenic threats from both long- and short-term study plots of varying sizes, as well as reports by government agency personnel and expert observers (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948; Hardy 1976; Berry 1984, 1989). The study plots were limited in number and did not represent the entirety of subpopulations across the geographic range (e.g., Berry 1984). The subpopulation on the Beaver Dam Slope, Utah, was federally listed as threatened in 1980 (USFWS 1980). A petition submitted by the Desert Tortoise Council in 1984 to list all wild populations in the United States was denied; the USFWS determined that listing of U.S. populations was warranted but precluded because of other higher priorities (USFWS&#160;<span style="""">1985</span>). In 1989 and 1990, the State of California and USFWS listed the tortoise as threatened (USFWS <span style="""">1989,&#160;1990;</span> California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2016). The appearance of upper respiratory tract disease and rapidly declining populations in the western Mojave and a major decline in tortoises in parts of the western Sonoran (Colorado Desert, California) associated with appearance of shell disease were additional threats to the many causes of declines (USFWS 1990, 1994, and references therein). Reflecting its concern over these declines, USFWS (1994:3) stated that: “The most serious problem facing the remaining desert tortoise population is the cumulative load of human and disease-related mortality accompanied by habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. Virtually every extant desert tortoise subpopulation has been affected by one or more of these factors.” As a result, the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994) also designated federal critical habitat units for desert tortoises at that time.&#160;In October 2020, the California Fish and Wildlife Commission accepted a petition from Defenders of Wildlife to up-list wild desert tortoises from threatened to endangered status; California has the largest subpopulation and geographic range of the species. The petition is currently under consideration by the agency with a response estimated in 2021.<br/><br/>To better measure trends in densities of adult populations in the threatened subpopulations, the Recovery Team proposed development of a landscape scale program (USFWS 1994). At the same time, the Recovery Team also noted the importance of study plot data, because more population attributes were provided than density of adults. After experimenting with different techniques, the USFWS decided to use distance sampling and initiated a formal, range-wide program for estimating densities of adult populations in critical habitat units (USFWS 2015, and references therein).<br/><br/>In the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994), population size, viability, and sizes of protected areas were discussed. Assuming the minimum density of adults in a population was “approximately 10 adults per square mile” (equivalent to 3.9 adults/km<sup>2</sup>), the target size for protected areas (then called Desert Wildlife Management Areas) was approximately 1,000 mi<sup>2</sup> (ca. 2,590 km<sup>2</sup>). This would ensure that even at such low densities and assuming half of such large areas might support no or few tortoises, each protected area would support enough adults for a genetically minimum viable population. The Recovery Team recommended six Recovery units with 12 different populations. The updated Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011) is based on the same number of populations but configured into five revised Recovery units with 17 different monitored subpopulations.<br/><br/>Most demographic data from study plots collected from the 1930s on the Beaver Dam Slope and between 1979–1980 in California and Nevada during the spring season indicated counts of 5–64 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Berry and Murphy 2019). In describing trends between 1978 and 1990 in California, the USFWS summarized data from 10 study plots in the Mojave and Colorado deserts and reported a highly significant downward trend (USFWS 1994). Additional data for the period showed some populations with low but potentially stable densities in Nevada (Berry and Medica 1995). A review of population status (Tracy <em>et al</em>. 2004) considered updated information from the permanent study plots in California and found that population declines in the western part of the range in California continued and declines were perhaps beginning in the eastern part of the California range.<br/><br/>The current population trends are based on landscape-level assessment using distance sampling for the 11-year period between 2004 and 2014 (USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). The sampling represented all five recovery units with 16 subpopulations in critical habitat units of from 115 to 3,763 km<sup>2</sup> described in the original Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994). Joshua Tree National Park is treated as a protected area and monitored as a 17th subpopulation although not designated as critical habitat. Consistent downward trends have continued in four of the five recovery units, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 11 years. Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014; the exceptions were adult densities in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) and the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (10.2/km<sup>2</sup>) (Berry et al. 2014, 2020). Unfortunately, in July 2020, a significant part of the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve burned and tortoises were found injured and dead. The Red Cliffs subpopulation declined from 2005 wildfires and with the recent 2020 fires, there will likely be further depression in densities. The six subpopulations with increasing densities had 2.7 to 6.4 adults/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2014. However, most of the 17 populations were near or below the 3.9 /km<sup>2</sup>&#160;density of adults considered as a minimum for viable populations (USFWS 1994, 2015).",Decreasing,"The Desert Tortoise was previously considered to be a single wide-ranging species, <em>Gopherus agassizii</em>, inhabiting the Mojave and Sonoran Desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico from southern California and Arizona through Sonora and into northern Sinaloa (Stebbins 1966, 2003; Iverson 1992). The species was found to be polytypic by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2011), who split the morphologically and genetically distinct Sonoran Desert populations as <em>Gopherus morafkai</em>, the Sonoran Desert Tortoise. Further analysis demonstrated that <em>G. morafkai</em> was also polytypic and split further to separate and describe the Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise further to the south as <em>Gopherus evgoodei</em> (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Geographically restricted <em>G. agassizii</em>, the Mojave or Agassiz’s Desert Tortoise, is endemic to the United States, inhabiting southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and extreme northwestern Arizona west and north of the Colorado River (TTWG 2017, Berry and Murphy 2019). The Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai</em>, occurs in both the United States and Mexico, inhabiting Arizona south and east of the Colorado River, Sonora (including Isla Tiburón), and extreme northern Sinaloa (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2011, TTWG 2017). The Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise, <em>G. evgoodei</em>, is endemic to Mexico and occurs in southern Sonora, northern Sinaloa, and extreme southwestern Chihuahua (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2016, TTWG 2017).<br/><br/>Within its geographic range, <em>G. agassizii</em> occurs in the Mojave Desert, the western Sonoran or Colorado Desert, the ecotone of the Mojave with the Great Basin Desert, and ecotones with vegetation types typical of higher elevations on the lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada, Transverse, Peninsular and desert mountain ranges (USFWS 1994). McLuckie <em>et al</em>. (1999) identified a subpopulation of <em>G. agassizii</em> east of the Colorado River in the Black Mountains of northwestern Arizona in which morphometric and mtDNA characteristics of the majority of the subpopulation were typically Mojavean; however, elements typical of tortoises in the Sonoran Desert were also evident. Edwards <em>et al.</em> (2015), using new genetic techniques, examined this and other nearby tortoise subpopulations, and identified hybrids (F2) in three mountain ranges near the Colorado River in Arizona. The two <em>Gopherus</em> species come in contact in limited places where Mojave Desert habitats meet Sonoran Desert habitats. The two species likely maintain largely independent taxonomic identities due to ecological niche partitioning (Inman <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species has been recorded at elevations of up to&#160;1,570 m asl (Rautenstrauch and O’Farrell 1998); however, tortoises may be found in unusual places, often transported by humans or other animals (e.g., the type specimen of <em>Xerobates lepidocephalus</em>&#160;[Ottley and Velázquez-Solis 1989] from southern Baja California, Mexico, is actually an introduced <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>[Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2011]).","Commercial take or use of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is prohibited by law, and few animals have been documented in (illegal) trade in recent decades. The evaluation of conservation status, conservation and monitoring actions for the species have generated significant financial investments in the species, supporting a range of local and visiting livelihoods. The approximate cost to develop and implement the 25-year recovery program for the Mojave Desert Tortoise was USD 100 million (USGAO 2002, Ernst and Lovich 2009, USFWS 2011, Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thirty years have passed since the federal listing of&#160; <em>G. agassizii</em> as threatened in 1989–1990, declines of breeding adults continue, and many tasks to reduce deaths, described first in 1994 (USFWS 1994), remain to be implemented (see also USFWS 2011, Reports from the Recovery Implementation Teams). If fully implemented, the recommended actions could exceed 159 million USD plus additional costs that could not be estimated in the 2011 Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011). As one of the keystone species of the Mojave Desert, <em>G. agassizii</em> plays an unquantified but substantial role in generating tourism income to regional protected areas (see Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/"">https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/</a>).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Conservation Measures taken:<br/></strong>The first legal conservation measures for <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> came from the State of California in 1939 (California Department of Fish and Game Code 1939–1981).&#160;Additional protective regulations followed until <em>G. agassizii </em>was listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act in 1989 (California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife 2016). Federal legislation to protect <em>G. agassizii</em> first occurred in 1980 and was restricted to the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utah (USFWS 1980). In 1989–1990, <em>G. agassizii</em> was federally listed as threatened (USDI&#160;<span style="""">1990&#160;</span>and references therein). The only population of <em>G. agassizii</em> that is not protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, is in the northwest corner of Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recovery efforts have been underway since 1990. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1994) published the first Recovery Plan in 1994, coupled with designations of critical habitat units by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994); this was followed by a revised Recovery Plan in 2011 (USFWS 2011), and regional Recovery Implementation Teams established in 2012. These teams are chaired by an employee of the USFWS Desert Tortoise Recovery Office, and are composed of federal, state, and county employees from the range of the desert tortoise, including representatives from local and national conservation and other stakeholder organizations. <br/><br/>The species is included in CITES Appendix II as part of Testudinidae spp., requiring that any commercial international trade be documented not to be detrimental to the survival of wild populations. CITES Trade records generally show very low levels of international exports of live animals; the vast majority of live traded Desert Tortoises are personal pets moving in-country with their owners, and many of the records in fact concern seizures of illegally transported specimens (CITES UNEP-WCMC trade database).<br/><br/>Conservation and recovery efforts began in the early 1970s, long before efforts of the federal actions by the USFWS in 1989–90. The Desert Tortoise Council formed in 1974-75 out of an interim recovery effort involving the four Southwestern states. This non-profit corporation was and continues to be dedicated to preserving representative populations of desert tortoises; educating the public; holding annual introductory workshops; and annual symposia to bring together representatives from government agencies, academia, and the public to learn and discuss important topics aimed at recovery of tortoise populations. The Desert Tortoise Council was instrumental in providing critical materials for federal and state listings of the species. The Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, Inc., was formed in 1974 to establish protected areas for <em>G. agassizii</em>. This non-profit organization is a land trust and mitigation bank, a source of education, and research. They were instrumental in establishing the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area and increasing its size.<br/><br/>Two preserves or protected areas exist with moderately high degrees of protection. One is the 100 km<sup>2</sup> (and increasing) Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area, which was formally designated by the U.S. Congress in 1980. It is fenced, with no vehicle access, livestock grazing, mining, or surface disturbances other than a few limited natural trails and a kiosk. The Natural Area is for wild tortoises only and populations are allowed to fluctuate naturally with no augmentation. Population density of adults throughout the Natural Area in 2011-12 was 10.2/km<sup>2</sup> (Berry et al. 2014a). The second preserve is Red Cliffs Desert Reserve in Utah (251 km<sup>2</sup>). The Red Cliffs National Conservation Area provides additional protection for federal lands within the Reserve. Several paved roads, fenced and unfenced, run through the Reserve and recreation occurs throughout (e.g., hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking).&#160;The next and lower level of protection could be described as occurring within National Parks, State Parks, and National Recreation Areas such as Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, Mojave National Preserve, Red Rock Canyon, Anza-Borrego, and Red Rocks State Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and the Beaver Dam Wash National Conservation Area. These parks and recreation areas have very high visitor use, unfenced paved roads, and some illegal collecting and release of captive tortoises of one or more species. <br/><br/>Twelve critical habitat units, the basis for Tortoise Conservation Areas (term defined in USFWS 2011), were designated by the USFWS (1994), and have far less protection than either the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area or the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve and are subject to multiple land uses that fragment and degrade habitat and create vulnerabilities and risks to the tortoises (e.g., invasive non-native grasses and other non-native species; highways; roads; utility poles, towers, and electrical transmission lines; gas lines and fibreoptic cables; recreational vehicle use; shooting; domestic and feral dogs; cattle grazing and feral burros; mining; military installations; fire that causes degradation of habitat).<br/><br/>Seventeen monitored subpopulations in the 12 critical habitat units are contained within five recovery units which cover a total of 25,678 km<sup>2</sup>. The following information for each recovery unit and the 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas reports area (km<sup>2</sup>), and density of breeding adults per km<sup>2</sup> in 2014. Western Mojave Recovery Unit: Fremont-Kramer (2,347 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Ord-Rodman (852 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Superior-Cronese (3,094 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Colorado Desert Recovery Unit: Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range (713 km<sup>2</sup>, 7.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Chuckwalla (2,818 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.3/km<sup>2</sup>), Chemehuevi (3,763 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Fenner (1,782 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Joshua Tree (1,152 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Pinto Mountain (508 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.4/km<sup>2</sup>), Piute Valley (927 km<sup>2</sup>, 5.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Eastern Mojave Recovery Unit: El Dorado Valley (999 km<sup>2</sup>, 1.5/km<sup>2</sup>), Ivanpah Valley (2,447 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Northeastern Mojave Recovery Unit: Beaver Dam Slope (750 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Coyote Spring (960 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.0/km<sup>2</sup>), Gold Butte (1,607 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Mormon Mesa (844 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit: Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (115 km<sup>2</sup>, 15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2015; Allison and McLuckie 2018). The overall decline in tortoise populations in critical habitats (Tortoise Conservation Areas) between 2004 and 2014 was 32.2% (USFWS 2015). Four of the five recovery units are in a state of decline, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 10 years (USFWS 2015). Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014 (USFWS 2015).<br/><br/>Extensive research has been published in peer-reviewed journals on many aspects of natural history, general ecology, physiological ecology, reproduction, health and diseases, population attributes, causes of death, movements and home range, predators, head-starting, translocation, and many other topics, making <em>G. agassizii</em> likely the most well-researched non-marine turtle species (Lovich and Ennen 2013b). Over 400 journal articles were published as of 2018, most between 1990 and 2018, as well as hundreds of reports (see three annotated bibliographies covering almost 160 years: Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980, Grover and DeFalco 1995, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016). Some information has been integrated into recovery programs, but many of the recovery measures recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) have not been implemented as of 2020.<br/><br/>Economic relevance: The approximate cost of USD 100 million to develop and implement the first and second Recovery Plans is significant within the regulatory, scientific and local economic sectors involved and much remains to be implemented (USFWS 1994, 2011; Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Measures needed:<br/></strong>The USFWS (1994) published recommended regulations for the areas that were designated as critical habitat. They described activities to be prohibited (e.g., all vehicle activity off designated roads; all competitive and organized recreational vehicle events on designated roads; habitat destructive military manoeuvres, clearing for agriculture, landfills and other surface disturbances; domestic livestock grazing, grazing by feral burros and horses; vegetation harvest; collection of biological specimens or vegetation harvest except by permit; dumping and littering; and deposition of captive or displace desert tortoises except under authorized translocation research projects; uncontrolled dogs out of vehicles; discharge of firearms except for hunting of game between September and February. There were many other recommended management actions but few of these recommendations were adopted when critical habitat units were officially described (USFWS 1994), and others have only been partially implemented by 2020.&#160;There were also recommendations for monitoring and research. In the second recovery plan, the USFWS (2011) identified and ranked (Darst <em>et al.</em> 2013) priority actions for recovering the Desert Tortoise and established regional Recovery Implementation Teams to implement these recovery actions. These Recovery Implementation Teams identify local, regional, and range-wide actions by submitting proposals to team members for discussion and prioritization. Ultimately the proposals are submitted to range-wide Management Oversight Groups composed of state, federal, and county government agencies for review, discussion, and potential sources of funding. Some projects are successfully funded and implemented, while many recommended in 1994 remain unfulfilled.<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Conservation Actions Needed, we provide the following notes:<br/></strong>1.1. Land/water protection -&gt; Site/area protection<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Better protection of Critical habitats could ensure that populations of tortoises become stable and/or increase. Examples of protective measures included in recovery measures for the tortoise are exclusion fencing and culverts along highways and roads; reduction in populations of hyper-predators such as the Common Ravens; control and removal of newly introduced and previously existing non-native plants; and control of recreational vehicle use.<br/><br/>2.1. Land/water management -&gt; Site/area management<br/>&#160; &#160; a. The first recovery plan identified site-specific or critical habitat-specific measures to ensure protection of habitat and reduction of deaths of tortoises from anthropogenic sources (USFWS 1994). Most of these recommendations are still relevant. The Recovery Implementation Teams have provided recommendations similar to those in the first recovery plan. Many of these measures remain to be implemented. For example, in the State of California where most desert tortoise habitat and populations occur, acquisition of private land would be beneficial, because a substantial portion of habitat is in multiple private ownership. Both the USFWS and State of California recommend that developers of tortoise habitat acquire replacement habitat for habitat lost to development, and such actions have been occurring for ~20 years. Another topic and critical area that would benefit from protection is the population and hybrid zone with <em>G. morafkai</em> east of the Colorado River in Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). This small population is not protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>2.2. Land/water management -&gt; Invasive/problematic species control<br/>&#160; a. Non-native grasses (e.g., <em>Schismus arabicus</em>, <em>S. barbatus</em>, <em>Bromus tectorum</em>, <em>B. madritensis rubens</em>) and forbs (e.g., <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em>) present serious and severe problems to tortoises because tortoises are selective in the choice of forage (Jennings and Berry 2015). The non-native annuals contribute to changes in forage availability, habitat structure, and increases in fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). These non-native species thrive under disturbance and spread via roads, livestock, military maneuvers, and disturbances created by recreational vehicle use off-road (e.g., D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006). The grasses are highly combustible and fire-prone in wildlands that did not evolve with short-term fire cycles (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). The grasses also compete with native annuals used as forage by the tortoises, and the species of grasses contain little nutrition, require water to metabolize, cause weight loss in the tortoises, and can become embedded in the jaws (Medica and Eckert 2007; Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). Similarly, <em>Brassica tournefortii</em> competes with native species used for forage and often occurs in dense stands, inhibiting movements of tortoises (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).<br/><br/>3.2. Species management -&gt; Species recovery<br/>&#160; a. Species management and recovery are guided by the Recovery Plan and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. On-the-ground management is by the administering agency, e.g., U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Department of Defense, States (for state land), and private owners. That being said, much can be done by implementing actions recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) and by restoring degraded habitat (e.g., Abella and Berry 2016); controlling recreation vehicle use off-road and reducing fragmentation of habitat; limiting spread of invasive, non-native grasses and forbs; controlling hyper-predation in common ravens (USFWS 2008)&#160;and coyotes; preventing dogs and dog packs from running loose in the desert; and acquiring habitat.<br/><br/>4.3. Education &amp; awareness -&gt; Awareness &amp; communications<br/>&#160; a. See Conservation Actions in Place. Expansion of on-going programs to prevent take or shooting in the wild and release of captive tortoises of several species.<br/><br/><br/><strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Research Needed, we provide the following notes:</strong></p>While research on some topics is desirable, more is known about <em>G. agassizii </em>than most other reptiles (Lovich and Ennen 2013b, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016 and references therein). Instead, implementation of previously identified actions to protect populations and habitat is more critical, specifically actions that will reduce deaths and loss or degradation of habitat.&#160;<br/><br/>1.1. Research -&gt; Taxonomy<br/>&#160; a. Genetic relationships between and within populations: human-mediated translocations of tortoises have occurred for decades, some authorized, some not (see Murphy et al. 2007). One recent question is the source of tortoises in Anza Borrego Desert State Park in the Colorado Desert of California. One might expect that the source would be tortoises occurring in the Colorado Desert, but instead tortoises have genotypes typical of the southwestern Mojave Desert population (Manning and Edwards 2019). More information on nearby tortoises (e.g. Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2020) occurring on the east-facing slopes of the Peninsular Range north of the Park may shed light on whether this is a naturally occurring population or a source that came from human-mediated translocations.<br/>&#160; b. Translocation of thousands of tortoises has occurred in the last &gt;20 years. Yet the only information available as to whether these translocated tortoises have been assimilated into the recipient or existing resident populations is research by Mulder <em>et al.</em> (2017) on assimilation of translocated males into the population of resident tortoises. Much more needs to be done on following males and females over a 10- to 20-year period to determine if and when adult males are assimilated into resident populations.<br/><br/>1.2. Research -&gt; Population size, distribution &amp; trends<br/>&#160; a. More information on current population attributes such as size-age class structure, recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, sex ratios of adult tortoises, and causes and contributors to death is highly desirable. Landscape sampling undertaken and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Desert Tortoise Recovery Office has provided valuable region-wide information on adult densities but not on other essential population attributes (i.e., Allison and McLuckie 2018). Resurvey of long-term, mark-recapture tortoise plots has been spotty for the past 20 years while support has increased for line-distance sampling representatively and on a landscape scale (see USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). Nonetheless, it is clear (USFWS 2011) that species recovery cannot be assumed based on patterns of adult counts alone, and active work to describe vital rates across the range will be an important part of assuring tortoise populations reflect healthy population dynamics or determining regional and size-specific recovery needs.<br/><br/>1.3. Research -&gt; Life history &amp; ecology<br/>&#160; a. More information is needed on survival of neonate, juvenile, and immature size classes (first 12 to 15 years of life) and causes of mortality in the wild. Frequent input of new data on causes of and contributors to mortality for all size classes is essential for improving management of the species and for achieving upward trends.<br/><br/>1.5. Research -&gt; Threats<br/>&#160; a. The USFWS developed a model to identify major threats to the species (Darst <em>et al</em>. 2013); the information in this model is based on published research only, and not on the hundreds of reports and manuscripts available in Annual Reports to the USFWS on research permits. The model is outdated and needs major revisions to more accurately reflect available information and more recent priorities. In addition, support could be provided to speed up publication of important research projects that will lead to more protective management actions.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>3.1. Monitoring -&gt; Population trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on population attributes in critical habitat, near highways, and in critical habitat near urban areas.<br/><br/>3.4. Monitoring -&gt; Habitat trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on wildfires, non-native plants, seed beds, and recovery of preferred forage plants.<br/><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

It is a stream dwelling and breeding species (Hodgkison and Hero 2001), but, unlike most stream-breeding frog species that live in the adjacent forest and use the stream habitat for breeding, the stream is the primary habitat for both male and females throughout the year (Hodgkison and Hero 2001, 2002). On several occasions the adults and juveniles were noted to form small aggregations (4-6 individuals) amongst large boulders behind waterfalls (Liem 1974b; J-M. Hero pers. obs.). Gravid females and males with nuptial pads are encountered all year round (Martin and McDonald 1995). Unpigmented eggs numbering 136-216 (1.98-3.4mm in diameter) are laid in gelatinous egg masses under rocks in water (Liem 1974b; Hero and Fickling 1996). Liem (1974b) described the larva and noted that it is one of the few species of frog known to exhibit larval adaptations to torrent environments of Australia, such as a streamlined body shape, large suctorial mouthparts and a muscular tail.

The species occurred at all lowland sites, and at upland sites north of the Daintree River during summer surveys in 1991–1992. In 1994 it was sighted at several locations above 600 m asl on Mount Father Clancy. Lowland populations surveyed in Tully Gorge appeared to be relatively stable between 1995 and 1998 (J.-M. Hero pers. comm.). At the southern end of its range it was last observed in Mount Spec State Forest in 1991 (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993); however, adults occurred at a lower elevation site in a different creek system (Crystal Creek Stone Bridge, 300m asl) from January 1994 to September 1995 (J.-M.

It is usually found perched on rocks or overhanging vegetation adjacent to the water (Liem 1974b). Little is known about the life history of this species. Mating calls have been heard from October to March (Liem 1974b). From 86-90 large unpigmented eggs (1.9-2.5mm diameter) are laid under rocks in riffles (Richards 1993a; Hero and Fickling 1996). Richards (1992) described the tadpole and noted that it is one of the few species of tadpole known to exhibit adaptations to torrent environments of Australia, including a streamlined body shape, large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tail. Tadpoles commonly overwinter in upland streams, although those hatching in early summer can metamorphose before the next autumn (Richards 1992).","The reason(s) for the decline of this species are unknown, although chytridiomycosis must be strongly suspected.

Within these streams they are often found in the slower more open sections, away from waterfalls (Hodgkison and Hero 2002). Individuals can be found on rocks, logs and vegetation in or adjacent to streams (Hero and Fickling 1994). There are differences in habitat use between males and females of the species. Females and juveniles use streamside vegetation more frequently than males. In contrast, males display strong fidelity to the rocky stream environment. Calling males and gravid females have been observed throughout the year (Liem 1974b). Breeding has been observed in most months, except during cold winter nights, and seems to reach a peak between November and March (Liem 1974b; Dennis and Trenerry 1984). Males call from rocks or boulders in creeks or from vegetation overhanging water along streams and creeks (Liem 1974b). The males also appear to display inter-male spacing, with males rarely found within 1m of each other, which is possibly a territorial response to low availability of females (Hodgkison and Hero 2002). A number (46-63) of unpigmented eggs (2.4-2.6mm in diameter) are laid in compact gelatinous clumps under rocks in water (Liem 1974b; Hero and Fickling 1996). Larvae can be found in fast-flowing sections of streams and adjacent pools in highly oxygenated water, clinging to rocks and other substrates (Liem 1974b; Hero and Fickling 1994).

Current research is examining the possibility that disease, such as a viral infection or chytrid fungus, may have contributed to the decline of this species (Berger, Speare and Hyatt 1999). In recent experiments involving the translocation of larvae and adult frogs to sites previously occupied by the species, a clear pattern was evident in the disease results, and nearly all of the animals found dead showed signs of chytridiomycosis (Retallick 1999, 2000, 2001). It is unknown as to whether this disease was solely responsible for the disappearance of <em>L. rheocola</em> at these sites.

However, there has been very little research into the impact of feral pigs on native frog populations (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993).","This species was first noted to have declined in 1989 (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). In 1990 several sites were sampled between the Kirrama Range and Cooktown. <em>L. rheocola</em> was common at all foothill and lowland sites and was recorded at some upland sites in the Kirrama Range in April and on the Carbine Tableland in January of that year (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). It was abundant in Danbulla State Forest (at 700m asl) in September 1982, but was not recorded there during monitoring between 1989 and 1992 (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). It has since disappeared from most upland sites south of the Daintree River (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). Richards, McDonald and Alford (1993) reported only two adults at Bobbin Falls on the Atherton Tableland, although the species has been found regularly in that area between 1998 and February 2000 (R. Retallick pers. comm.) and 2001-2002 (K.R. McDonald pers. comm.). At O’Keefe Creek, Big Tableland, this species has occasionally reappeared near a 400m asl site, but has not established resident populations and is absent at another monitoring site at  600m asl (McDonald and Alford 1999).

In montane areas the species prefers fast-flowing rocky streams although they also frequent slower watercourses where ample vegetation exists along the margins (Czechura, Ingram and Liem 1987). At low elevations, it favours rock soaks, narrow ephemeral streams and rock outcrops in larger watercourses (Czechura, Ingram and Liem 1987). It may also be found on rocks, boulders and vegetation in or adjacent to streams (Czechura, Ingram and Liem 1987). <em>N. dayi</em> is a spring and summer breeder (Davies and Richards 1990) with peak breeding activity from October to April (Hero and Fickling 1997; Hodgkinson and Hero 2002). Davies and Richards (1990) provide a detailed description of the developmental biology of the species. Males call at night from rocks and low foliage along rapidly flowing stretches of creek. The competition for females may necessitate territorial behaviour in males, as they have never been found calling in a group or within 1m of another male (Hodgkinson and Hero 2002). Amplexus is axillary and eggs are laid in a cohesive clump under rocks in rapidly flowing water (Czechura, Ingram and Liem 1987). One clutch collected contained 107 unpigmented eggs (egg diameter 2.3-2.6mm, capsule diameter 3.3-3.5mm, n=5) (Davies and Richards 1990). Larvae can be found on or under rocks in fast-flowing sections of stream and show adaptations to living in torrents, such as large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tails (Davies and Richards 1990; Fickling and Hero 1994). After hatching they aggregate under a rock until their digestive tracts are fully formed (Davies and Richards 1990). After several days they begin to graze on benthic algae and may drift downstream. Larvae from eggs laid in early summer complete development in 3-4 months, while those eggs laid in late summer may overwinter and metamorphose the following summer (Davies and Richards 1990).","The reason(s) for the decline of the species are largely unknown. Although in the past habitat destruction may have been a factor, clearing or logging has not taken place in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, where the species occurs, since 1988 (McDonald and Alford 1999). Richards, McDonald and Alford (1993) first noted a decline of the species in pristine rainforest habitats in 1989. Richards, McDonald and Alford (1993) reject drought, floods, habitat destruction or changes in water quality (pH, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and metal ions) as the primary causes of the decline. However, in a study by Hodgkinson and Hero (2002) cold temperatures were found to reduce the activity of <em>N. dayi</em> and it was suggested that prolonged exposure to cold, dry conditions (particularly at high altitudes) may inhibit the breeding and survival of the frogs and influence recruitment in local populations. Current research is examining the possibility that disease, possibly a virus or chytrid fungus, may have contributed to the decline of this species (Berger,  Speare and Hyatt 1999; McDonald and Alford 1999). Chytrid fungus was detected in this species in Tully, Queensland. Feral pigs are a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989-1992 in an area previously inhabited by <em>N. dayi</em> (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993).

The species is here listed as Near Threatened based on an estimated decline of 20–25% in the past 12 years (estimated generation length = 4 years), thereby approximating the threshold for listing as Vulnerable under criterion A2. This decline is attributable to multiple threats, including ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, reduction in prey abundance due to illegal hunting and predation by domestic dogs, and an increased risk from canid-related disease.","<p>Bush Dogs are reported to be a habitat generalist by indigenous peoples, within the context of occurring generally near water sources, particularly small streams, where prey densities may be higher (Zuercher <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005; E.S.

Lima, K.E. DeMatteo, R.S.P. Jorge, M.L.S.P. Jorge, J. Dalponte, H.S. Lima, and S.

Estimated generation length is four years [(0.5 x reproductive length of six years) + sexual maturity at one year (in captivity; Porton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1987).</p>  <p>Preliminary field data supports anecdotal reports of diet and the idea that Bush Dogs are highly carnivorous (Deutsch 1984, Peres 1991); however, there appears to be evidence of prey preference based on geographical region and habitat type, which is likely compounded by seasonal variability.&#160;For the Pantanal area in Brazil, the principal food item was Nine-banded Armadillo (<em>Dasypus novemcinctus</em>; 94%) with small mammals, Agoutis (<em>Dasyprocta azarae</em>), and birds occurring in smaller quantities; however, no fruit was recorded (n = 17, identified by scent and tracks; Lima, Jorge et al. 2009).&#160; For the interior Atlantic forest in Paraguay, the majority of the diet was composed of Agoutis and Paca (<em>Cuniculus paca</em>) with small mammals, rodents, reptiles, invertebrates, and <em>Cecropia</em> fruit occurring in lower amounts (n = 11, identified using mitochondrial DNA; Zuercher <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). In a successful reproduction center in southeast Brazil, where meat and fruit (banana and papaya) are available, animals eat fruit and meat in equal proportions (L. Saboia, pers. comm.).&#160;Predation of poultry has been reported to occur occasionally (DeMatteo 2008).</p>","<p>There are several serious perceived threats, including: 1) human encroachment and loss of intact habitat due to large-scale agriculture (e.g., soybean), conversion of land to pasture, and large-scale plantations of monoculture trees (e.g., eucalyptus, pine); 2) reduction in prey abundance due to illegal poaching and domestic dog predation; and 3) increased risk of contracting lethal diseases from domestic dogs (proximity to human populations and hunting dogs (DeMatteo 2008).</p>  <p>Canid-related diseases are a threat not previously identified for Bush Dogs. However, field evidence supports that pathogens may be transmitted by domestic dogs, and the effects can be potentially devastating, mainly due to the species’ group living (Mann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1980, Steinel <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001, Leite Pitman, Nieto <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Jorge, Morato <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Jorge, Nunes, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007, DeMatteo 2008, Jorge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008, E.S. Lima, K.E. DeMatteo, R.S.P. Jorge, M.L.S.P. Jorge, J. Dalponte, H.S. Lima, and S. Klorfine, pers. obs.). E.S. Lima, K.E. DeMatteo, R.S.P. Jorge, M.L.S.P. Jorge, J. Dalponte, H.S. Lima, and S. Klorfine (pers. obs.) observed this effect when a generalized hair loss, suspected to be a type of mange, gradually spread through a group of wild Bush Dogs, eventually killing all individuals. In addition to mange, parvovirus and rabies are diseases reported as negatively effecting wild populations (Mann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1980, DeMatteo 2008).&#160; The species has been identified to be susceptible to both <em>Dioctophyma renale</em> and <em>Amphimerus interruptus</em> (museum collections - Vierira <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008), <em>Lagochilascaris</em> sp. (Volcán and Medrano 1991), and as a host for <em>Echinococcus vogeli</em> (Cestoda: Taeniidae) (Rausch and Bernstein 1972). Captive animals have been identified as susceptible to a variety of diseases and parasites, including parvovirus (Janssen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1982), vaccine-induced canine distemper (McInnes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1992), leishmania (Lima, Fattori <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009), <em>Spirocerca lupi</em> (Rinas <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009), <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>(Sedlak and Bartova 2006), and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Campylobacter</span> (L. Saboia pers. comm.). With the latter, 13 of 15 individuals in a large family group suddenly died from severe haemorrhagic enteritis when they contracted Campylobacter from an infected Coati that they were inadvertently fed (L. Saboia pers. comm.). This loss of multiple animals in a short period emphasizes both the species sensitivity to various diseases and the susceptibility of group living species to pathogens. With increasing proximity to human areas and intrusion into protected areas with hunting dogs, the risk of exposure to disease is potentially high.&#160;Exposure to disease may also result from feral or semi-feral, non-vaccinated, domestic dogs that regularly hunt prey independent of humans (K. DeMatteo pers. obs.).&#160;DeMatteo (2008) noted that in Brazil more problem interactions were noted to occur between Bush Dogs and domestic dogs than with livestock, which only emphasizes the threat of disease to the species.&#160;&#160;</p>","<p>Despite its large distributional range and occurrence in a variety of habitats, Bush Dogs seem to be naturally rare throughout their range. In a recent survey by DeMatteo (2008), the majority of countries in the Bush Dog’s distribution reported the status of the species as rare or unknown&#160; (rare: Ecuador; rare or unknown: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, French Guiana, Paraguay; unknown: Panama and Venezuela) and only two countries reported it as common (Guyana and Peru). The species is seldom recorded with camera traps; however, caution should be taken when interpreting the lack of detection, as this may actually be associated with the species actively avoiding features associated with this technique (e.g., placement of traps along animal trails used by other carnivores) or assumptions on animal movement (e.g., placement along roads assumes the animal will walk along the road versus cross over the road).<br/></p>  <p>Demographic data for Bush Dogs are lacking throughout their range and population estimates have been reported only for a few areas: &lt;100 in Misiones Argentina (DeMatteo 2008), &gt;1,000 in Bolivia (DeMatteo 2008), &gt; 1,000 in 4,022 km²<sup></sup> or one individual/4 km²<sup></sup> in Cusco Peru within the Camisea River region (DeMatteo 2008), 0.04 individuals/km²<sup></sup> (B. Beisiegel pers. comm.) in Brazil, 0.025 individuals/km² in partially fragmented cerrado in Mato Grosso Brazil (E.S. Lima, K.E. DeMatteo, R.S.P. Jorge, M.L.S.P. Jorge, J. Dalponte, H.S. Lima, and S.

Across the entire range, increasing levels of habitat fragmentation (urbanization and agriculture), threats to prey populations with illegal poaching, and exposure to potentially lethal candid-related diseases, mean that the probability that the trend is stable or increasing is highly unlikely.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs from extreme eastern Central America and northern South America, south to Paraguay and north-eastern Argentina. Isolated subpopulations may also still occur in Ecuador and Colombia, west of the Andes. Its historical distribution may have extended as far north as Costa Rica (Rosa and Nocke 2002), where the species may still survive.&#160; The current distribution map was generated using the results of an extensive survey of carnivore biologists and literature for species presence (n = 399 historic locations), as well as a bioclimatic model predicting suitable area for the species (DeMatteo and Loiselle 2008). The latter authors estimated that the total area predicted to be suitable for Bush Dogs is in the order of 14,445,000 km²<sup></sup>, with 77% of this occurring within the current range.</p>","<p>Bush dogs have been reported shot in five countries (Argentina, Brazil, Panama, Peru, Venezuela) and trapped in two (Panama and Peru) (DeMatteo 2008, F. Michalski unpubl. data).&#160;In Peru, these events were associated with natives reporting that they will eat Bush Dogs if snared or if they have the rare opportunity to collect then with traditional hunting; however, Venezuela reported shootings were associated with the occasional collection of trophies due to its rarity (DeMatteo 2008).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>This species occurs in several protected areas throughout its range, but it has a patchy distribution and occurs at very low densities. Hunting is prohibited in Colombia (Law Number 848:1973), Ecuador (Law Number 74:1981), French Guiana (Law Number JO19860625:1986), Panama (Law Number 2-80:1980), Paraguay (Law Number 18796:1975) and Peru (Law Number 5056:1970).

In April 2009 the population was estimated at 291 adult (&gt;1 year old) wolves (EWCP annual report 2008–2009) and in April 2010 at 290–320 (EWCP annual report 2009-2010). Since then 23 carcasses have been retrieved, and 56 individuals have gone missing, probably as a result of a canine distemper epizootic that affected several subpopulations in Bale.<br/><p>Ethiopian Wolves are restricted to seven isolated mountain enclaves in the highlands of Ethiopia. The Afroalpine range available to the species is shrinking and increasingly fragmented. The species’ extent of occurrence is estimated at 4,200 km² with an area of occupancy of 2,779 km². Population estimates across the species’ range suggest that between 360 and 440 adult (&gt;1 year old) wolves remain, of which &lt;250 are mature individuals. One relict population in northern Ethiopia (Mt Guna) is now functionally extinct.</p>  <p>The largest population occurs in the Bale Mountains in southern Ethiopia, where intensive monitoring of wolf packs indicate that population size varies widely due to the recurrence of infectious disease epizootics affecting local subpopulations. Since 2008 to date this population has declined by ~30%, from approximately 300 to an estimated 210 adults, due to consecutive epizootics of rabies and canine distemper. This equates to a 20% global decline in the population in the last three years; although narrowly below the threshold for uplisting to Critically Endangered under C1, this continued decline merits careful ongoing monitoring of population numbers (and a reassessment if necessary) and sustained conservation interventions.</p>    <p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Number of ""Mature Individuals""</span><br/> The number of mature individuals in the population (population size) was determined using the IUCN's new definition (in: Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria) and the following formula:<br/> <br/> Mature individuals = 0.31N1+ 0.4N1+0.57N2 +0.16 N2 then<br/> Mature individuals = 0.71N1+ 0.73 N2 where:<br/> N1= adult male population<br/> N2= adult female population<br/> <br/> Calculations of mature individuals capable of reproduction were derived from empirical data on wolf populations in the Bale Mountains, between 1988–1992 and 1997–2000. Of all adult males in a population, 31% are alpha males and thus reproductive individuals (= 0.31N1). Of all subordinate adult males (= 0.69N1), some may access reproduction either by replacing the alpha male or through extra-pack copulations. This proportion was subjectively estimated at 60% and thus the contribution of subordinate adult males potentially capable of reproduction is 0.6 x 0.69N1 = 0.41N1. <br/> <br/> Of all adult females in a population, 57% are in alpha position and thus reproduce (= 0.57N2). Of the suppressed adult females (= 0.33N2) we estimated a 50% likelihood to access reproduction in their lifetime (0.5 x 0.33N2=0.16N2). This was derived from the rate of breeding opportunities, calculated as 0.12 for female per year from empirical data, over four years (0.12 x 4 years= 0.5).<br/> <br/> Population estimates were derived from current availability of habitat types and extrapolations of the density of adult and subadult wolves to the area of each habitat type. Population estimates (N) are numbers of adult and subadult wolves. Given a population sex ratio of 2:1 males to females then the male population is 2/3N = 0.67N and the female population is 1/3N= 0.34N. Eighty percent of males and 70% of females are adults, therefore:<br/> <br/> N1= adult male population= 0.8 x 0.67N = 0.53N<br/> N2= adult female population= 0.7 x 0.33N = 0.23N <br/> <br/> and, Mature individuals = 0.71N1 + 0.73N2, so:<br/> Mature individuals = 0.37N + 0.17N= 0.54N<br/> <br/> Mature individual estimates for 2010 based on IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group (2011):<br/> <br/> Bale Mountains: N = 210; mature individuals = 113<br/> Arsi Mountains: N = 54; mature individuals = 29<br/> Simien Mountains: N = 52; mature individuals = 28<br/> North Wollo: N = 19; mature individuals = 10<br/> South Wollo: N = 16; mature individuals = 9<br/> Menz : N = 15; mature individuals = 8<br/> Mt Guna: N = 0; mature individuals = 0<br/> Total: N = 366; mature individuals = 197<br/> </p><p>Guassa-Menz estimate of 15 adult wolves was derived from intensive observation of wolf packs in recent years which yielded an estimate of 25 adult wolves, and was corroborated by DNA fingerprinting in 2008 (which identified 23 individuals). During 2010 40% of the known wolves have died or disappeared due to canine distemper, resulting in the revised estimate. </p>  <p>Arsi and Simien estimates (EWCP unpublished) were derived from intensive observations of wolf packs across both ranges. Recent improvements in monitoring resulted in a larger estimate for Simien, and a smaller one for Arsi. These revised figures reflect improved field techniques and effort rather than actual population change.</p>  <p>For North and South Wollo, population estimates are conservative and were based on habitat availability. Using field maps, the extent of suitable habitat were estimated and populations extrapolated from known densities in Bale for habitats with similar characteristics (Marino 2003a).&#160; Here the lower value of densities observed were used (i.e., good habitat: 0.2 wolves/km²; marginal habitat 0.1 wolf/km²).<br/> <br/> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Other parameters used:</span><br/> Generation time: mean 4.5 yr, range 3–8; extent of occurrence: 4,200 km² [defined as area above 3,000 m asl]; area of occupancy: 2,800 km²; number of populations: 7; number of sub-populations: 10.<br/> <br/> Given the information above, Canis simensis meets the criteria for Endangered under criterion B based on &lt;5,000 km² extent of occurrence (B1), as the population is severely fragmented (a), and there is a continuing decline (b) in area, extent and or quality of habitat (iii) and number of mature individuals (v).

Finally, it also meets the threshold of &lt;250 mature individuals for listing under D.</p>","<p>A very localized endemic species, confined to isolated pockets of Afroalpine grasslands and heathlands where they prey on Afroalpine rodents. Suitable habitats extend from above treeline at about 3,200 m up to 4,500 m, with some wolves present in montane grasslands at 3,000 m. However, subsistence agriculture extends up to 3,500–3,800 m in many areas, restricting wolves to higher ranges (Marino 2003a). Rainfall at high altitude varies between 1,000 and 2,000 mm/year, with one pronounced dry period from December to February/March.<br/> <br/> Wolves utilize all Afroalpine habitats, but prefer open areas with short herbaceous and grassland communities where rodents are most abundant, along flat or gently sloping areas with deep soils and poor drainage in parts. Prime habitats in the Bale Mountains are characterized by short herbs (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Alchemilla</span> spp.) and grasses and low vegetation cover, a community maintained in continuous succession as a result of molerat (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Tachyoryctes macrocephalus</span>) burrowing activity. Other good habitats include tussock grasslands (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Festuca</span> spp., <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Agrostis</span> spp.), high-altitude scrubs dominated by <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Helichrysum</span> spp. and short grasslands in shallow soils. In northern parts of the range, plant communities characterized by a matrix of 'guassa' tussock grasses (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Festuca</span> spp.), 'cherenfi' bushes (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Euryops pinifolius</span>) and giant lobelias (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lobelia rhynchopetalum</span>) sustain high rodent abundance and are preferred by wolves. Ericaceous moorlands (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Erica</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Phillipia</span> spp.) at 3,200–3,600 m are of marginal value, with open moorlands having patches of herbs and grasses which are relatively good habitat.</p>","<p>Continuous loss of habitat due to high-altitude subsistence agriculture represents the major threat. Sixty percent of all land above 3,200 m has been converted into farmland, and all populations below 3,700 m are particularly vulnerable to further habitat loss, especially if the areas are small and of relatively flat relief (Marino 2003a). Habitat loss is exacerbated by overgrazing of highland pastures by domestic livestock, and in some areas habitat is threatened by proposed development of commercial sheep farms and roads. Human persecution triggered by political instability in the past is currently less severe and associated with conflicts over livestock losses (Marino 2003a). Recent population decline in Bale has been mostly due to disease epizootics, with road kills and shooting as secondary threats. Rabies is a potential threat to all populations, with canine distemper also a concern in Bale. Most of these threats are exacerbated by the wolves' specialization to life in the Afroalpine ecosystem.</p>  <p>In Bale, the Ethiopian wolf hybridizes with domestic dogs (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Canis familiaris</span>). Gottelli <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (1994) used mitochondrial DNA restriction fragments and microsatellite alleles to conclude that hybridization was relatively common in western Bale as a result of crosses between female wolves and male domestic dogs. Hybrids have shorter muzzles, heavier-built bodies and different coat patterns. Although hybrids are confined to the Web Valley in western Bale they may threaten the genetic integrity of the wolf population. Following hybridization, a population may be affected by outbreeding depression or reduction in fitness, although to date this does not seem to have taken place in Bale. Currently there is no indication of hybridization taking place outside western Bale.<br/> <br/> There is no exploitation of the species for furs, body parts or other purposes.</p>","<p>More than half of the species' population lives in the Bale Mountains, where wolf density is high for a social carnivore of its size, and positively correlated with density of rodent prey and negatively with vegetation height (Sillero-Zubiri and Gottelli 1995). Highest wolf densities are found in short Afroalpine herbaceous communities (1.0–1.2 adults/km²); lower densities are found in Helichrysum dwarf-scrub (0.2/km²), and in ericaceous heathlands and barren peaks (0.1/km²). Wolves are also present at low density (0.1–0.2/km²) in montane grasslands at lower altitudes.</p>  <p>Elsewhere, overall wolf density is relatively lower. In Menz, wolf density was estimated at 0.2 animals/km² using transect data (Ashenafi 2001). Comparison of census transect data from recent comprehensive surveys (Marino 2003a) indicates higher abundance in North Wollo (0.20 ± 0.20 sightings per km), intermediate in Arsi and Guna (0.10 ± 0.11 and 0.10 ± 0.14, respectively), and lower in South Wollo and Simien (0.08 ± 0.13 and 0.06 ± 0.11, respectively). These results were supported by counts of wolf signs (i.e., diggings and droppings) and interview results. <br/> <br/> A summary of population abundance and status in each region can be found in Sillero-Zubiri <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2004), with the most recent information on population status found in IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group (2011), and summarized above. Time series from long-term monitoring of wolves in the Bale Mountains of southern Ethiopia, spanning over 20 years, indicated marked variation in wolf abundance in association to rabies epizootics affecting high-density populations in 1991, 2003 and 2008 (Marino 2003b, Marino <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006, IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group 2011). Population numbers returned to previous levels after the first two disruptions, evidencing resilience to catastrophes, but at very low density population growth was unexpectedly low, due to delays in the formation of new breeding packs (Marino <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> in review). Canine distemper (CDV) appears to be more important than previously thought, with CDV outbreaks affecting wolves across subpopulations in the Bale Mountains in 2005, 2006 (Malcolm 2006), and 2010 (Gordon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Endemic to the Ethiopian highlands, above the tree line at about 3,200 m. There are no recent records of the species at altitudes below 3,000 m, although specimens were collected at 2,500 m from Gojjam and north-western Shoa at the beginning of the century (references in Yalden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1980). Reported in the Simien Mountains since the species was first described in 1835, but scattered and irregular sightings suggest numbers have been declining. Reported on the Gojjam plateau until the early 1900s (Powell-Cotton 1902, Maydon 1932). South of the Rift Valley, wolves have been reported in the Arsi Mountains since the 1920s, and, more recently (1959), in the Bale Mountains. Reports of small populations in North Sidamo (Haltenorth and Diller 1980) may be in error. There is no evidence that the Ethiopian Wolf ever occurred in Eritrea (Coetzee 1977).<br/> <br/> The species currently is confined to seven isolated mountain ranges of the Ethiopian highlands, at altitudes of 3,000–4,500 m (Gottelli and Sillero-Zubiri 1992, Marino 2003a). In the northern highlands wolves are restricted to land above 3,500–3,800 m by increasing agricultural pressure (Yalden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1980, Marino 2003a). Wolf populations occur north of the Rift Valley in the Simien Mountains, Mount Guna, North Wollo and South Wollo highlands, and Menz. Recently extinct in Gosh Meda (North Shoa), and absent from Mt Choke, Gojjam, for a few decades. South-east of the Rift Valley there are populations in the Arsi Mountains (Mt Kaka, Mt Chilalo and Galama range) and in the Bale Mountains, including the Somkaru-Korduro range (Marino 2003a).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p>The species is not included on the CITES Appendices. It has full official protection under Ethiopia's Wildlife Conservation Regulations of 1974, Schedule VI. Killing a wolf carries a sentence of up to two years.<br/> <br/> The Ethiopian Wolf occurs in several protected areas: Bale Mountains National Park; Simien Mountains National Park; Borena Saiynt Regional Park (South Wollo); Guassa Community Conservation Area (North Shoa); Arsi Mountains Regional Park. As a result of boundary extensions (Simien) and new parks created (Arsi) the area of suitable wolf habitat within protected areas increased to 87%. </p>  <p>A number of important steps have been taken in the interests of conserving this endemic species, including: 1) a dog vaccination campaign in Bale, and vaccination campaigns&#160; in response to rabies outbreaks in dogs close to wolves in Menz and Simien; 2) sterilization programme for hybrids in Bale; 3) vaccination of wolves in response to rabies epizootics in parts of Bale; 4) community and school education programme in Bale and Wollo; 5) strengthening the capacity of the Bale Mountains National Park – funding patrolling, maintenance of infrastructure, etc.; 6) surveys to determine the persistence and status of all populations of wolves; 7) monitoring of all wolf populations; 8) A Strategic Planning workshop for Ethiopian wolf conservation held in Lalibela, February 2011, resulting in a National Action Plan for the next 10 years (IUCN/SSC Canid specialist Group 2011). </p>  <p>In 1983, the Wildlife Conservation Society established the Bale Mountains Research Project, which publicized the wolf's plight and started a regular monitoring programme for the species. A detailed four-year field study followed (Sillero-Zubiri 1994). Based on its findings, the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group produced an action plan for the Ethiopian Wolf (Sillero-Zubiri and Macdonald 1997), which provided a detailed strategy for the conservation and management of remaining wolf populations. This plan advocated immediate action on three fronts – education, wolf population monitoring, and rabies control in domestic dogs – to conserve the Afroalpine ecosystem and its top predator. As a result, the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme (EWCP) was established in 1995 by Oxford University with financial support from the Born Free Foundation, Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS), the Wildlife Conservation Network&#160; and other donors. The Programme’s overall aim is to protect the Afroalpine ecosystem and many of its rare highland endemic plants and animals through better management in Bale and the establishment of other conservation areas in Menz and Wollo. The EWCP currently monitors the demography of the Bale and selected populations in South and North Wollo, supports park patrols within the wolf range, undertakes domestic dog control and the removal of dog-wolf hybrids. Additionally, the EWCP carries out a community conservation education campaign that targets people living inside the wolf's range and is aimed at improving dog husbandry and combating disease in the park and surroundings. A large-scale dog vaccination programme (targeting up to 5,000 dogs a year) seeks to reduce the occurrence of rabies and distemper within the Ethiopian wolf range and is backed up by further epidemiological and demographic studies. The EWCP is also active elsewhere in Ethiopia, with representatives surveying and monitoring all wolf ranges and implementing education campaigns about the plight of the species. Zelealem Tefera Ashenafi set up the Guassa Biodiversity Project in 1996, looking at the relationships between pastoralists and wildlife in the highlands of Menz. FZS and partners are working in North Ethiopia to protect the Afrolapine ecosystem, supporting the Simien Mountains National Park and creation of a new community conservation area in North Wollo. </p>  There are no animals maintained in captivity.<br/><br/>Although the behavioural ecology of the species is well known, research has focused largely in the optimal habitats in the Bale Mountains. Additional information on dispersal distance and survival would be useful. Investigation into the role of the species in the epidemiology of canid-related diseases is necessary. Studies on wolf-prey relationships and prey availability in the high risk populations of northern Ethiopia are also needed.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

13985603,22781,Urocyon littoralis,Near Threatened,,2013,2013-07-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Island Fox is restricted to six of the California Channel Islands off the coast of southern California, USA. Four Island Fox subspecies suffered catastrophic population declines in the mid-1990s, after which they were listed as Endangered under the U.S Endangered Species Act. However, all four subspecies have since recovered to or are approaching recovery to pre-decline population levels, due to the success of aggressive recovery actions such as captive breeding and reintroduction, relocation of Golden Eagles, and vaccination against canine diseases. The total population of mature individuals increased from &lt;1,500 in 2002 to &gt;4,000 in 2011 and annual survival rates are above 85%.&#160;<br/><br/>The Red List Status for the Island Fox is currently assessed as Near Threatened (it almost qualifies as threatened under criteria B1a and C2a). The species meets none of the criteria for the threatened categories (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable). In regard to criterion A, population reduction, the species has not experienced a population reduction in the past 10 years or three generations. Four subspecies experienced declines in the 1990s, but have since increased significantly, to near pre-decline numbers. Criterion B concerns geographic range. The total range for the species is about 9,000 km², and the number of locations (considering past and future potential threats) is &lt;10 (the species occurs on six islands) which would place the species in the Vulnerable category, but only if there was a continuing decline or extreme fluctuation in occurrence, occupancy, locations, or population size. Criterion C considers small population size. The number of mature individuals is approximately 4,000, whih would &#160;place the species in the Vulnerable category, but only if there was also a continuing decline&#160;and the number of mature individuals was &lt;1,000 in each subpopulation, or if the population fluctuated extremely . Island Foxes do not meet criterion D, very small or restricted population size, because the number of mature individuals is &gt;1,000 and number of locations is &gt;5. Finally, Island Foxes do not meet the criteria for E, quantitative analysis. Recent estimates &#160;indicate that the probability of extinction in the next 50 years is &lt;5% for each of the four Island Fox subspecies listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act (T. Coonan, National Park Service, C. Boser, The Nature Conservancy and J. King, Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Although the species meets none of the criteria for the threatened categories, it is assessed as Near Threatened because of inherently small population sizes (none of the six subspecies exists at adult population levels considerably higher than 1,000 individuals), potential threats from disease and/or predation, and the continuing need for intensive management actions such as population size and survival rate monitoring, disease and Golden Eagle surveillance, and annual vaccination against rabies and canine distemper virus. If considered alone, some of the subspecies would likely meet criteria for a threatened category, due primarily to inherently small population sizes. However, previous Red List assessments have been conducted at the species level for Island Foxes. Because recent threats to subspecies have been mitigated, it is not necessary to consider Red List status for individual subspecies at this time.<br/><br/>According to IUCN Red List Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommitee 2013), a species may be moved &#160;from a category of higher threat to one of lower threat if none of the criteria of the higher threat category has been met for five years or more. Therefore, to be moved to the Near Threatened category in 2013, Island Foxes must not have met criteria from any higher threat category (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable) criteria in 2008 or later. The following demonstrates, category by category, that Island Foxes did not meet any of the threatened category criteria in 2008.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>A. Population reduction: </strong><br/>As of 2008, had Island Foxes undergone a population decline over either 10 years or three generations (whichever is longer)? A recent life table matrix model (B. Hudgens, Institute for Wildlife Studies, unpubl. data) indicates Island Fox generation time is about four years. Therefore, from 1996-2008, was there a 90%, 70% or 50% decline in the overall number of island foxes? By 2008 the number of island foxes was approximately 2,500 adults, but the population in 1996 is unknown. In that time period, 1996-2008, four Island Fox subspecies had reached the nadir of their declines (in 1999-2000) and recovery was well under way on all islands, so much so that captive breeding had ceased on all islands by 2008. Thus, it is unlikely that there was a 50% or greater decline between 1996 and 2008, a period spanning three generations of Island Foxes.<br/><br/><strong>B. Geographic range:</strong><br/>The range of Island Foxes comprises about 9,000 km², which meets the Vulnerable category if two of the following are met: the number of locations is less than 10, a continuing population decline, or extreme fluctuations. Although Island Foxes occur in &lt;10 locations (six islands), there was no continuing decline in 2008, nor were there extreme fluctuations. Therefore, Island Foxes do not meet the geographic range criteria for any of the threatened categories.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>C. Small population size and decline:</strong><br/>The number of mature Island Foxes was about 2,500 in 2008. That would place the species in the Endangered category, but only if there was &#160;a continuing decline, or a decline combined with either a) a low mature population size in each subpopulation, b) a high proportion of individuals occurring in just one subpopulation or c) or extreme fluctuations. Because there was no continuing decline in 2008, Island Foxes do not meet the small population size and decline criteria for any of the threatened categories.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>D. Very small or restricted population:</strong><br/>The number of mature individuals in 2008 was 2,500, which is above the 1,000 required for a Vulnerable rating. Additionally, they did NOT have an area of occupancy of &lt;20 km² or number of locations &lt;6. Therefore, Island Foxes do not meet the very small or restricted population criteria for any of the threatened categories.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>E. Quantitative Analysis:</strong><br/>There is no analysis that concludes that in 2008 the probability of extinction for Island Foxes was 50% in 10 years (Critically Endangered), 20% in 20 years (Endangered) of 10% in 100 years (Vulnerable). Thus, Island Foxes do not meet the quantitative analysis criteria for any of the threatened categories","<p><span lang=""IT"">The Island Fox is considered to be a habitat generalist because it has been found using virtually all habitat types occurring on the Channel Islands (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a, USFWS 2012).&#160;Use of diverse habitats likely is a function of ecological plasticity, limited predation and competition pressures, and characteristic high fox densities.&#160;Habitats used include beaches, sand dunes, bluffs, grasslands, sage scrub, cactus scrub, chaparral, oak woodlands, riparian woodlands, pine forests, marshes, and developed areas (e.g., towns, campgrounds).&#160;However, preferential use of some habitats has been detected.&#160;Island Foxes may prefer stabilized sand dunes (Sanchez and Hudgens 2012, Gregory <em>et al</em>. 2012, Garcelon and Hudgens 2012) and areas with higher topographic and vegetation structure diversity (USFWS 2012) such as shrublands and woodlands (Laughrin 1977, Crooks and Van Vuren 1996, Roemer 1999, Drake 2013).&#160;Conversely, some habitats appear to be used less, particularly types with low vegetation structure such as grasslands (Roemer 1999, Roemer and Wayne 2003).&#160; </p>  <p><span lang=""IT"">Home range use by Island Foxes is influenced by various factors including topographic features, available habitat types, habitat-specific resource abundance, fox density, sex, and age (USFWS 2012).&#160;Mean home range sizes of 0.16-3.39 km² <span lang=""IT""><sup></sup> have been reported (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a, Sanchez 2012, Drake 2013)&#160;&#160;Size generally is inversely related to fox density (Sanchez 2012) and is slightly larger for males.&#160;Also, foxes using grasslands tend to have larger home ranges than foxes using denser, more structurally diverse habitats.&#160;Den sites are variable and can occur in rocks, brush, log piles, earthen burrows, and man-made structures (Laughrin 1977, Moore and Collins 1995).&#160;Island Foxes exhibit both nocturnal and diurnal activity, and also are skilled climbers thereby allowing them to access resources in trees and large shrubs (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a).&#160; </span></p>  <span lang=""IT"">Island Foxes are foraging generalists and consume a wide variety of items including rodents, birds, lizards, insects, snails, carrion, and fruits (Moore and Collins 1995, Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;Use of items varies by habitat-specific and island-specific availability, and also varies by seasonal availability (e.g., fruits, some insects, marine mammal carrion).&#160;Preferred items appear to include deer mice (<em>Peromyscus maniculatus</em>), lizards, beetles, Jerusalem crickets (<em>Stenopalmatus</em> spp.), earwigs (<em>Forficula auricularia</em>), and fruits of toyon (<em>Heteromeles arbutifolia</em>), manzanita (<em>Arctostaphylos </em>spp.), and prickly pear cactus (<em>Opuntia </em>spp.) (Cypher <em>et al</em>. 2011). Deer mice may be a particularly important food for parents to feed to growing pups due to ease of transport and high protein content (Laughrin 1977, Garcelon <em>et al</em>. 1999).</span>","Predation by non-native Golden Eagles (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>) led to a catastrophic decline on the three northern islands (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel) during the 1990s but aggressive management actions have greatly reduced this threat (see Conservation section) (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a). A catastrophic decline on Santa Catalina Island was due to canine distemper virus, probably introduced by a raccoon (<em>Procyon lotor</em>) that “stowed-away” on a boat from the mainland (Garcelon <em>et al</em>. 1992, Roemer 1999, Timm <em>et al</em>. 2000, Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Efforts to control fox predation on San Clemente Island Shrikes, <em>Lanius ludovicianus anthonyi</em>), were previously considered a possible threat to the foxes (Roemer and Wayne 2003) but have been discontinued.<br/><br/>Island Foxes have naturally low population levels (less than 1,500 on the larger islands and less than 500 on San Miguel) (Coonan<em> et al.</em> 2010a). Furthermore, they have extremely low levels of genetic variability (Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 1990, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 1991, Goldstein <em>et al</em>. 1999, Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2004), and thus reduced ability to adapt to future environmental change. The possible introduction of new diseases from the mainland remains a threat to populations on all islands. Thus, these foxes will always be a “conservation reliant” species, requiring careful monitoring and rapid management interventions to survive (Scott <em>et al</em>. 2010).","Island Foxes exhibit substantial variability in abundance, both spatially and temporally. In the 1990s, Island Fox numbers declined on five of the six islands where they occur, reducing the total population from approximately 6,000 individuals (Roemer <em>et al</em>. 1994) to less than 1,500 in 2002. Island Fox numbers have been steadily increasing in the past decade, reaching a total population of approximately 5,500 and an adult population of &#160;&gt;4,000 in 2011.<br/><br/>Fox populations on both San Miguel and Santa Cruz Islands declined by &gt; 90% between 1995 and 2000. Similar declines also occurred on Santa Rosa and Santa Catalina Islands (Roemer 1999; Timm <em>et al</em>. 2000; Roemer <em>et al</em>. 2001a, 2002; Coonan 2003). By 2000, Island Fox populations on San Miguel and Santa Rosa islands had declined to only 15 individuals, all of which were brought into captivity (Coonan 2002, 2003; Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a). The Santa Cruz population &#160;dropped from an estimated 1,300 foxes in 1993 to as low as 50 &#160;foxes in 2001, including 10 pairs brought into captivity in 2002 &#160;(Roemer 1999, Roemer <em>et al</em>. 2001, Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Captive populations were maintained on the islands from which they were originally captured. Beginning in 2003, captive-bred foxes from each of the three northern islands (San Miguel, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa) were released back into the wild. By 2008, all captive animals were released and populations were growing exponentially on all three islands. By 2011, wild fox populations had increased to an estimated 580 foxes with 400 adults on San Miguel Island, 450 foxes with 280 adults on Santa Rosa Island, and 1,200 foxes with 880 adults on Santa Cruz Island (Coonan 2012). &#160;<br/><br/>On Santa Catalina, Island Foxes were nearly completely eliminated on the &#160;eastern portion of the island by a canine distemper outbreak that swept through the population in 1999 (Timm <em>et al</em>. 2000), with only about 110 adult foxes remaining on the island in 2000. Translocations from the western portion of the island, beginning in 2003, have resulted in a steadily growing population, estimated at &#160;approximately 1,500 foxes in 2011. About 80% of the fox population now lives on the island’s east end. &#160;<br/><br/>The San Clemente population has steadily increased from approximately 250 adults in 2001-2002 (Wolstenholme <em>et al</em>. 2003 ) to approximately 700 adults in 2011 (Gregory <em>et al</em>. 2012), with a total population (including young of the year) estimated around 1,100 (Garcia and Associates 2011). A small area of stabilized sand dunes on the north end of the island support the highest recorded density of foxes with density estimates ranging from 14--40 foxes/km² (Gregory <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sanchez and Hudgens 2011). &#160;Outside of the dunes, fox densities ranged from 2.5-7.8 adults/km² with densities generally &#160;highest in the north and lowest in the south (Gregory <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>In contrast to the other populations, the San Nicolas Island Fox population has remained relatively stable over the past 10 years, though there is anecdotal and genetic evidence of a severe population decline to an effective population size of less than 10 breeding individuals in the 1970s (Laughrin 1980, Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2004). Since 2000, estimated population size has fluctuated from 500-700 adults and 600-800 total, including young of the year (Garcelon and Hudgens 2012). The highest densities of animals occur in the stabilized dunes and coastal sage scrub on the western end of the island, where adult fox densities of over 25 foxes/km²  have been recorded. &#160;Fox densities are much lower in the grasslands and barren cliffs in the south and east of the island, where recorded densities are only 1.9 foxes/km² (Garcelon 2010 ).<br/><br/>All current estimates of density and population size in island foxes have been derived from trapping data &#160;using modifications of a capture-recapture approach (Roemer <em>et al</em>. 1994). Density estimates prior to 2005 were generally calculated by dividing estimated population size within a trapping grid by the effective trapping area including a buffer determined by the mean-maximum distance moved (MMDM) by captured individuals. More recent density estimates were generally estimated from spatially-explicit mark-recapture analyses (Efford <em>et al</em>. 2004). Island-wide estimates were extrapolated either by simply multiplying the average densities of trapped areas by the total island area, or by multiplying densities of trapped areas within different habitat types by the area of each habitat on the island.",Increasing,"<p>Island Foxes are restricted to the six largest of the eight California Channel Islands located off the coast of southern California, USA. The view that foxes reached the northern Channel Islands by waif dispersal, followed by Native American assisted dispersal to the southern Channel Islands (Collins 1982, 1991a,b, 1993; Wayne <em>et al</em>. 1991; Goldstein <em>et al</em>. 1999), was challenged by Rick <em>et al</em>. (2009), who dated fossil fox bones. The oldest bone was dated at approximately 6,400 cal yr BP, several thousand years after humans colonized the islands. Thus, it is now unclear whether foxes reached the northern islands naturally or were introduced by humans.</p><p>Six distinct subspecies are recognized, one on each of the islands where they occur:</p><p>San Miguel Island Fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis littoralis </em>(Baird, 1858)), San Miguel Island,</p><p>Santa Rosa Island Fox (<em>U. l. santarosae</em> Grinnell &amp; Linsdale, 1930), Santa Rosa Island,</p><p>Santa Cruz Island Fox (<em>U. l. santacruzae</em> Merriam, 1903), Santa Cruz Island,</p><p>Santa Catalina Island Fox (<em>U. l. catalinae </em>Merriam, 1903), Santa Caralina Island,</p><p>San Nicolas Island Fox (<em>U. l. dickeyi</em> Grinnell &amp; Linsdale, 1930), San Nicolas Island, and<br/></p><p>San Clemente Island Fox (<em>U. l. clementae </em>Merriam, 1903), San Clemente Island.</p>",,Terrestrial,"The species is not included in the CITES Appendices.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Legal status</strong><br/>In 2004, four of the six Island Fox subspecies were federally listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) under the federal Endangered Species Act (USFWS 2004). The northern Island Fox subspecies (San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz) were listed due to population declines caused by Golden Eagle predation, and Santa Catalina Island Foxes were listed because of a population decline likely due to canine distemper virus. The San Nicolas and San Clemente subspecies were not listed as endangered by USFWS, because USFWS had been petitioned only to list the three northern subspecies and the one on Santa Catalina Island (USFWS 2004). All six subspecies had been previously listed as threatened by the state of California (California Department of Fish and Game 1987).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Need for recovery actions</strong><strong><br/></strong><em>Northern Channel Islands</em><br/>Dramatic fox population declines on San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands were detected during the 1990s. The Island Fox population on San Miguel declined from an estimated 450 adults in 1994 to 15 in 1999 (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Santa Cruz population declined from as many as 2,000 adults in 1994 to 50–60 in 2000 (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Foxes on Santa Rosa may have numbered more than 1,500 in 1994 (Roemer <em>et al</em>. 1994) but declined to 15 animals by 2000 (Coonan and Rutz 2002). Prior to implementation of Island Fox recovery efforts, Roemer (1999) estimated time to extinction at five years for Island Foxes on San Miguel and 12 years for Island Foxes on Santa Cruz.Evidence from radio-telemetry studies showed that predation by Golden Eagles was the primary mortality factor for Island Foxes on the northern Channel Islands, and caused the massive decline of the three northern subspecies from 1994 to 2000 (Roemer et al. 2001). Golden eagle predation was identified as the cause of death for 19 of 21 radio-collared Island Foxes on Santa Cruz Island from 1993 to 1995 (Roemer <em>et al</em>. 2001). On San Miguel Island in 1998–1999, four of eight radio-collared Island Foxes were killed by Golden Eagles in a 4-month period (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;Until the 1990s, Golden Eagles, which prey mainly on small mammals, had never bred on the Channel Islands, and their recent colonization of the islands was due to a prey base, feral pigs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) and mule deer (<em>Odocoileus hemionus</em>), that was not present prehistorically (Latta <em>et al</em>. 2005; Collins and Latta 2006). The absence of Bald Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em>), which bred historically on the islands and prey mainly on fish and seabirds and whose presence may have kept Golden Eagles away, may also have allowed Golden Eagle colonization of the islands (Roemer <em>et al</em>. 2001). Island Foxes evolved in the absence of significant diurnal aerial predators such as Golden Eagles, and therefore may have been more vulnerable to predation than other small carnivores. Moreover, on much of the northern Channel Islands, historic sheep grazing changed the predominant vegetation from shrub to non-native grasslands, which offer much less cover from aerial predators.<br/><em><br/></em><em>Santa Catalina Island</em><br/>At the same time that the National Park Service (NPS) was dealing with the issue of eagle predation and very low fox populations, The Santa Catalina Conservancy and its contractor, Institute for Wildlife Studies, were addressing a massive population decline of Island Foxes in 1999-2000, apparently caused by canine distemper virus (CDV). Foxes had declined on the eastern portion of the island, but not on the western portion, which was separated from the western portion by a narrow isthmus. The presence of CDV antibodies in Island Fox blood samples, observation of disoriented foxes, and the presence of CDV in a fox carcass led to the conclusion that the rapid decline (within one year) had been most likely caused by an outbreak of CDV. Later analysis indicated that the CDV was most like the strain present in raccoons, suggesting that the source of the diseases was not the unvaccinated dog and cat population on the island, but perhaps a stowaway raccoon (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Recovery plan</strong><br/>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a draft recovery plan for the four listed subspecies in 2012 (USFWS 2012). The plan presented recovery criteria that were based on population risk and on threats. To meet population risk-based criteria, fox populations must demonstrate demographic characteristics consistent with long-term viability, as measured by a population recovery tool that estimates extinction risk using adult mortality and population size estimates (Bakker and Doak 2009). To meet threat-based recovery criteria, land managers must develop monitoring programs and plans for mitigating the two primary threats to Island Foxes, disease and predation. The plan’s recovery actions included removing the threats of predation and disease, managing captive island fox populations for recovery, and establishing island fox monitoring strategies. In reality most of those recovery actions had been completed by the land management agencies prior to release of the recovery plan.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Development of recovery actions</strong><br/>The major recovery actions for Island Foxes were those recommended by an ad hoc group of scientists first convened in 1999 by the NPS to recommend emergency actions that would prevent the extinction of Island Foxes (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a). From 1999–2012, the NPS annually convened a group of experts to help evaluate the status of Island Foxes on Park lands, and to make findings regarding appropriate recovery actions. The Island Fox Conservation Working Group comprised a loose affiliation of public agency representatives, landowners, conservancies, zoological institutions, non-profits, and academics concerned about conservation efforts for the Island Fox. The working group served as a forum for information exchange and evaluation of recovery efforts, dividing into subject matter groups to tackle most issues. In most years the subgroups were concerned with captive breeding, wild fox populations, fox health (veterinary) issues, and education. The group annually reported the status of Island Foxes on all islands, listed findings in regard to threats to the species, and recommended appropriate mitigation actions. From 2004-2006 USFWS used the Island Fox Conservation Working Group to develop its draft Island Fox recovery plan.<br/><br/>In 2003, the Park completed a recovery strategy for Island Foxes on the northern Channel Islands (Coonan 2003). The recovery strategy focused on the major recovery actions of Golden Eagle translocation, Island Fox captive breeding and reintroduction, and disease mitigation via vaccination, as well as the larger, ecosystem-level actions of non-native ungulate removal and reintroduction of Bald Eagles.&#160;On Santa Catalina Island, the CDV-caused population decline was addressed by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy and the Institute for Wildlife Studies. At the Conservancy’s request, IWS developed recovery actions, which included development of a vaccine against CDV, development of a captive breeding program, and translocation of foxes from the still populous western portion to the sparsely populated eastern portion of the island (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Implementation of recovery actions</strong><strong><br/></strong>Since 1999, recovery actions have been implemented, and most of them completed, on the northern Channel Islands and on Santa Catalina Island, and conservation measures have been implemented on the two other islands with foxes (San Nicolas and San Clemente). These actions included captive breeding and reintroduction of Island Foxes; capture and translocation to the mainland of Golden Eagles; development of a vaccination program for wild Island Foxes; development of epidemic response plans; removal of non-native ungulates from the northern Channels Islands; reintroduction of Bald Eagles; and development and implementation of Island Fox monitoring programs.&#160;<br/><em><br/></em><em>Captive breeding</em><br/>Development of captive breeding programs occurred simultaneously on the northern Channel Islands (for San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Island Foxes) and on Santa Catalina Island (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Upon receiving recommendations from the Island Fox Conservation Working Group, the Park began taking emergency recovery actions in 1999, focusing on two measures, the removal of the existing Golden Eagles on the islands, and captive breeding of the critically low Island Fox populations.&#160;<br/><br/>Because Island Foxes had not been bred in captivity before, the Park worked with local zoo staff, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and other national experts to establish animal husbandry methods, including facility design and construction, diet, genetic management, pairing and breeding and release techniques (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b). Captive breeding was begun <em>in situ</em> on each island, because each subspecies was managed individually, and mainland facilities would have exposed captive foxes to a suite of pathogens unknown on the islands. Captive breeding began on San Miguel in 1999 and on Santa Rosa in 2000, when the remaining 15 foxes on each island were brought into captivity, respectively. In 2001 the IFCWG recommended beginning captive breeding on Santa Cruz, to avoid starting captive breeding with the kind of perilously low numbers that the programs on San Miguel and Santa Rosa began with. Accordingly, 20 foxes were brought into captivity on Santa Cruz in 2002. On Santa Catalina Island, IWS built pens and brought 12 pairs of foxes from the populated west end into captivity in 2001.<br/><br/>Despite the low number of founders, Island Fox captive populations grew quickly, and reached captive facility capacity, and the level at which releases could begin, in 2001 on Santa Catalina, 2003 on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz, and 2004 on San Miguel. Island Fox captive breeding encountered challenges such as low reproductive success later in the program, evidence of stress in captive foxes, male aggression, female abandonment of pups, and an outbreak of mastitis in the Santa Rosa and San Miguel facilities. Video monitoring of captive foxes allowed identification of factors that led to successful reproduction and rearing (Calkins <em>et al</em>. 2013). Releases ceased in 2004 on Santa Catalina, and 2007-2008 on the northern Channel Islands. On the northern islands, reproductive success in the wild had begun to outpace that in captivity, and so all foxes were released by 2008.&#160;There are now no Island Foxes in captivity.&#160;Over the captive breeding period, 254 foxes were released to the wild on the northern islands and 57 on Santa Catalina, where reintroduction was augmented by translocation of juvenile foxes from the populous West end to the East end.<br/><br/>Reintroduction was very successful, due to generally high survival and high reproductive success of released foxes (Coonan and Schwemm 2009). Wild populations grew rapidly on San Miguel, Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina, though on Santa Rosa fox survival, and thus population growth, was retarded by Golden Eagle predation (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Annual rate of increase (lambda) for recovering fox populations ranged from 1.3-1.9, and by 2011-2012, the adult populations on San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz were estimated at 400, 500, and &gt;900 individuals, respectively, and there were &gt;1500 total foxes on Santa Catalina (Coonan 2012). Foxes had reached pre-decline levels on San Miguel and Santa Cruz, 12 years after declines brought them perilously close to extinction.&#160;<br/><em><br/></em><em>Development of Vaccines</em><br/>Staff from IWS worked with the Smithsonian National Zoological Park on the use of a vaccine against CDV for Island Foxes. The Canary pox virus recombinant CDV vaccine was tested in a small sample of Island Foxes and proved safe and effective, with vaccinated foxes seroconverting and exhibiting positive antibody titers. The vaccine was thereafter administered to all captive foxes on all islands and later to a portion of the wild populations, upon the advice of the Island Fox health group (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a, Coonan 2012). Although the effectiveness of the vaccine has not been tested in a challenge study, evaluation indicates vaccination does produce antibody response consistent with protection, though annual booster is required to maintain adequate antibodies (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2012). Vaccination of Island Foxes against CDV will continue indefinitely.&#160;<br/><br/>Because there is a naturally-occurring morbillivirus in Island Fox populations that likely confers some immunity against CDV (Clifford <em>et al</em>. 2006), not all wild foxes are vaccinated, to allow circulation of the morbillivirus. On most islands, foxes are vaccinated using a “vaccinated core” strategy, in which 80-100 foxes are vaccinated in one or two geographic core areas. This allows the natural morbillivirus to circulate among foxes on the rest of the island; protects foxes in areas that may be access points for CDV (such as near harbors) and theoretically protects a core group of individuals that could be used to start a captive breeding program, should CDV decimate the remainder of the population. On Santa Catalina, however, foxes are vaccinated in an island-wide strategy, because of the large number of landing sites on that island.&#160;<br/><br/>Wild Island Fox populations are also currently vaccinated against rabies, because a rabies epidemic among foxes could not be adequately mitigated, once detected. Unlike canine distemper virus, there is no naturally-occurring rabies among island foxes, so the vaccinated core strategy is not implemented; all trapped foxes are vaccinated against rabies (Coonan 2012).&#160;<br/><em><br/></em><em>Golden Eagle Removal</em><br/>The Park established a cooperative agreement with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG) in 1999 for the purpose of relocating Golden Eagles from the northern Channel Islands. Personnel from the SCPBRG began eagle surveys and removal on Santa Cruz Island, the island with the most recent sightings, in late summer 1999. Golden Eagles were discovered breeding on both Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa Islands. By the end of 2006, 44 Golden Eagles had been removed, mostly from Santa Cruz Island, the majority by bownet trapping. Captured birds were released in north-eastern California, and satellite telemetry on the first released birds indicated that none attempted to return to the islands (Latta <em>et al</em>. 2005). Island Fox survival increased as the number of eagles on the island declined (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a).<br/><br/>Genetic analysis of blood samples from captured eagles suggested that initial colonization of the islands by Golden Eagles had been rapid, perhaps the result of one colonization event by a family group (Sonsthagen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Rapid growth of the island eagle population ensued, to the point where carrying capacity was reached and young eagles began dispersing from the island population to the mainland. This implies that preventing future recolonization of the islands by dispersing mainland eagles will be crucial to Island Fox persistence. Actions that will prevent colonization include rigorous monitoring for evidence of predation and eagle presence, removal of non-native eagle prey, and re-establishement of a robust breeding population of territorial Bald Eagles.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Larger ecosystem recovery actions</strong><br/>The team of experts first convened by NPS in 1999 concluded that mitigating Golden Eagle predation on Island Foxes required not only the immediate, emergency recovery actions of eagle relocation and Island Fox captive breeding, but also larger, ecosystem-level actions that would tip the balance away from continued Golden Eagle use of the islands and toward conditions that would allow foxes to persist. Accordingly, the team called for both removal of feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island, since the non-native pigs facilitated the “hyperpredation” visited upon foxes (Roemer <em>et al</em>. 2001), and the reintroduction of Bald Eagles to the northern Channel Islands, positing that the presence of breeding Bald Eagles would discourage nesting by Golden Eagles (Coonan and Rutz 2001). With the later discovery of deer bones in Golden Eagle nests on Santa Rosa Island (Latta <em>et al</em>. 2005; Collins and Latta 2006), the need to remove that prey source became apparent (Coonan and Dennis 2007), and the USFWS Island Fox recovery plan called for the removal of non-native ungulates from that island (USFWS 2012).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Reintroduction of Bald Eagles&#160;</em><br/>The restoration of Bald Eagles to the northern Channel Islands, funded by the Montrose Settlements Restoration Program, comprised annual releases of young eagles from 2002-2006. Breeding by released Bald Eagles began in 2006, and as of 2012 there were &gt;40 bald eagles on the northern Channel Islands, with breeding occurring on Anacapa, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands (Sharpe 2012).&#160;<br/><em><br/></em><em>Removal of non-native ungulates</em><br/>Prior to the discovery that feral pigs supported Golden Eagles on Santa Cruz Island and so facilitated predation on Island Foxes, the NPS had sought to remove feral pigs from that island because of the impacts to natural and cultural resources from pig rooting and foraging (NPS 1985). Accordingly, in 2005-2006 the NPS and The Nature Conservancy, co-owners of Santa Cruz Island, cooperated to remove feral pigs (&gt;4,000 total) from Santa Cruz Island, thereby eliminating that non-native prey source for Golden Eagles (Morrison <em>et al</em>. 2007, Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a).&#160;<br/><br/>Non-native ungulates had existed on Santa Rosa Island since the early 20th century, when they were bought to the island for hunting purposes. Their phased removal was scheduled as part of a court settlement among the NPS, USFWS, the former island owners, and environmental groups to address ungulate impacts to water quality and endangered plant species (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a). By the end of 2012, all elk had been removed from the island, and only a handful of deer remained (T. Coonan, NPS, unpubl. data).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Monitoring</strong><br/>Thorough Island Fox monitoring programs have been implemented on all six islands. For the four islands with listed subspecies, monitoring programs were established to track effectiveness of recovery actions and to chart the recovery of populations. These initial monitoring efforts have evolved into longer-term programs designed to track Island Fox population size, survival, mortality sources, and exposure to disease.<br/><br/>Because reintroduction and/or translocation occurred on all four of islands with listed subspecies, released foxes were radio-collared to monitor their survival and identify mortality sources. As of 2013, a sample of radio-collared foxes was maintained on all six islands to detect mortality causes such as disease. Annual survival of Island Foxes has been tracked for listed subspecies, and shows increased survival over time, with recovered populations exhibiting annual survival of 80-90% (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a).&#160;<br/><br/>On the four islands with listed subspecies, a portion of the 50 or so radio-collared foxes are disease sentinels. These are young, unvaccinated foxes whose mortality may detect emerging diseases as well as the presence of diseases against which a portion of each Island Fox population is vaccinated (rabies and CDV).&#160;<br/><br/>For naturally small populations such as those of the Island Fox, population size is important to track, both to chart recovery of populations and to assess demographic viability. Prior to the declines of the 1990s, the NPS tracked population trends of Island Foxes on San Miguel, as part of its longterm ecological monitoring program. Population size of the four endangered subspecies has been monitored since reintroductions or translocations began, and population trends on San Clemente are also monitored. Guidance for population monitoring of all fox populations was developed through the efforts of the Island Fox working group (Rubin <em>et al</em>. 2007), who recommended using spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) methods on multiple small (2 x 6 trap) grids. Density and population estimates from annual trapping have been used to document recovery of listed Island Fox populations (Coonan <em>et al</em>. 2010a).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Recovery tool</strong><strong><br/></strong>Results from population and mortality monitoring have been incorporated into a “recovery tool” for land managers to use to assess recovery status of listed fox subspecies. Recent demographic modelling incorporated life-history characteristics of the well-studied Island Fox with environmental drivers and uncertainty to develop extinction probabilities for combinations of population size and annual mortality (Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2009, Bakker and Doak 2009). The demographic traits that best predicted extinction risk were adult population size and adult annual mortality rate, assessed jointly (Bakker and Doak 2009). Subspecies-specific graphs were developed that plotted risk isoclines across range of three-year average adult population sizes and mortality rates. Three-year averages of both adult population size and adult mortality have become the basis for assessing demographic recovery criteria for the Island Fox. Island managers and the Island Fox working group identified a predicted risk of quasi-extinction (decrease to a population size of &lt;30) of less than five percent over 50 years as the population condition consistent with recovery. To account for uncertainty, the joint 80 percent confidence intervals for both population size and mortality must lie within the 5 percent extinction risk isoclines. Island Fox subspecies must meet this standard for five consecutive years before they may be considered for de-listing. This standard has now been adopted by the USFWS in the draft recovery plan for the Island Fox (USFWS 2012) as the demographic recovery criterion. As of 2012, use of the recovery tool indicated that San Miguel, Santa Cruz and Santa Catalina Island Foxes were close to demonstrating biological recovery, and Santa Rosa Island Foxes were several years from doing so (Coonan 2012).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Periodic serology</strong><br/>Island Foxes from all islands are periodically surveyed for evidence of disease exposure, as result of recommendations from the Island Fox working group regarding vaccination and serological testing. The Fox Health group recommended that blood samples from Island Fox populations be collected annually, and that such samples tested at least once every five years for evidence of exposure to CDV, canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV) and Toxoplasma. Island Fox populations had been tested previously for disease (Garcelon <em>et al</em>. 1992, Roemer <em>et al</em>. 2001, Clifford <em>et al</em>. 2006), and recent serological testing (Coonan 2012) confirmed earlier conclusions that each Island Fox subspecies has had a unique history of pathogen exposure, and vulnerability to various canid diseases is not equivalent among subspecies.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Threat mitigation plans</strong><br/>The USFWS’ draft Island Fox recovery plan requires threat mitigation plans to be developed by each land management agency before Island Fox subspecies can be delisted. Such plans must demonstrate the agency’s capability and willingness to detect and mitigate threats posed by the two most onerous mortality factors, predation and disease. An epidemic response plan has been developed for San Clemente Island Foxes (Hudgens <em>et al</em>. 2011) and plans are currently being developed for island foxes on the northern Channel Islands and Santa Catalina Island (B. Hudgens, IWS, unpubl. data). The plans detail appropriate pathogen monitoring and disease-specific mitigation actions, incorporating the specific operational capabilities of the respective agencies.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Gaps in knowledge</strong><strong><br/></strong><em>Density dependence</em><br/>In some areas of San Nicolas Island, foxes have remained at a stable population density greater than 25 foxes/km<sup>2;</sup>&#160;however, this very high density is unusual in carnivore populations. Additional research on habitat use, diet and small-scale resource use, abundance, and fecundity are needed to explore density dependence and estimate carrying capacity on other Channel Islands. Research exploring the ecological drivers of the fox’s home range size, which varies significantly between studies, could have applications for disease transmission rates and inter-species competition, and ultimately inform us on density dependence by habitat type.&#160;<br/><em><br/></em><em>Meso-predator competition</em><br/>Many of the islands contain meso-predator species that likely compete with the Island Fox. San Clemente, Santa Catalina and until recently, San Nicolas contained non-native feral cats. &#160;The removal of feral cats from San Nicolas Island in 2011 presents a unique opportunity to document the effects of competitor removal from an isolated and well-documented system. Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Island contain the only native meso-carnivore, the Island Spotted Skunk (<em>Spilogale gracilis amphiala</em>), which likely competes with the Island Fox (Crooks and Van Vuren 1995, Roemer <em>et al</em>. 2002). &#160;Foxes are competitively dominant to skunks (Roemer <em>et al</em>. 2002), and the latter increased on both islands when foxes declined. Skunks have apparently declined on Santa Cruz Island during the recent recovery of foxes, and have not declined on Santa Rosa, where the recovering fox population is perhaps one-half of its pre-decline number (Coonan and Guglielmino 2012). Further refinement knowledge is required about the relationship between these two meso-predators.<br/><em><br/></em><em>Disease</em><br/>Apart from the threat of non-native predators, the greatest threat on these conservation islands is the possibility of a mainland disease introduction. A number of recent studies have addressed the threat of disease, including previous pathogen exposure (Clifford <em>et al</em>. 2006), pathogen transmission (Sanchez 2012), and Canine distemper virus titer persistence. However, additional research and management may be needed to prevent outbreaks, as new transmittable diseases arrive on the California coast.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The species is assessed as Endangered, since its extent of occurrence is 589 km² (its total range is estimated as being less than 200 km²), the range is fragmented, and there is continuing decline in habitat due to ongoing habitat loss and hunting.","This is the largest extant rodent on Madagascar. It inhabits dry deciduous coastal forest (mixed with baobabs) with a sandy floor permanently covered by dry leaf-litter. Animals live in monogamous social units and both sexes are territorial. The animals occupy a family burrow with a complex of tunnels. They are nocturnal, and forage on the forest floor for fallen fruit, seeds and leaves. It is also known to dig for roots and tubers and to strip bark from saplings. Mating takes place in the rainy season, and the females give birth to one young per litter; females can give birth twice within the reproductive period. Males leave the parental burrow and territory at the age of around one year (before the next breeding period) and can reproduce immediately. However, female offspring show delayed dispersal and stay with their parents for two reproductive seasons. Females are probably not sexually mature before the age of two years (Sommer <em>et al.</em> 2002, Sommer 2003).","The historical decline of this species has been partly through climatic change leading to increased aridification of south-western Madagascar, and also the extensive modification of suitable habitat by humans since their arrival on the island. Current areas of habitat are threatened by slash and burn agriculture, charcoal production, burning for cattle pasture and logging (Sommer 2003). There is a road that now cuts through the middle of the species' range, and has divided the range. Throughout its range, increasing visits by hunters and their dogs have targeted this species. Also, this species has declined with the introduction of feral dogs and cats, by predation and also potentially transmission of lethal toxoplasmosis. This species could be susceptible to hantavirus, which has been shown in some rodents in eastern Madagascar.","Within the largest forest fragment in the southern forest area, the Kirindy Forest/CFPF, field studies between&#160;1990 and 2000 documented a rapid population decline. Whereas the population size was constant between 1992 and 1996 (54 animals/100 ha), the population density declined by about 40% between 1997 and 1999 (33 animals/100 ha) and in 2000 by about 60% of the original density (22 animals/100 ha) (Sommer and Hommen 2000).<br/><br/>In a population viability analysis, Sommer <em>et al.</em> (2002) used a calculated median of 23 active burrows per 100 ha in suitable habitat to estimate the southern subpopulation (15,000 ha) with 6,900 adults and the northern subpopulation&#160;(4,000 ha) with 18,40 adults.<br/><br/>Surveys undertaken in 2005 estimated the combined size of the two <em>H. antimena </em>subpopulations to be c.36,000 individuals, considerably larger than previously assumed. There was no evidence that active burrow density across the species’ known range changed between 2000 and 2005. <em>H. antimena</em> was not uniformly distributed, with higher densities of active burrows found in forest with the highest canopy in areas furthest from forest edges (Young <em>et al.</em> 2008).",Unknown,"This species is endemic to Madagascar, where it is restricted to the west of the island in a narrow coastal zone. The southern limit is now the Tomitsy River (until recently it ranged south to the the Andranomena River) up to the Tsiribihina River in the north (Sommer 2003). In the last century, the species ranged from the Morondava River to the Tsiribihina in the north, but the species has lost significant portions of its range, and is now found in two isolated range segments (separated by the Mandroatra River). The total range was estimated to be less than 200 km² (Sommer <em>et al. </em>2002); the extent of occurrence (calculated as a minimum convex polygon around its mapped occurrence on the distribution map) is 589 km². The species is predicted to have an elevation range of 40-100 m asl (Goodman and Raherilalao 2013).<br/><br/>Subfossil remains indicate that over the past 1400 years, the range of <em>H. antimena</em> extended at least 475 km further south (Goodman and Rakotondravony 1996).",,Terrestrial,"The majority of the distribution of the species is with the Menabe-Antimena protected area.

There are no indications that the species abundance is in decline. While the size of Lake Superior is substantial (surface area of &gt;82,000 km²), there is a threat from disease (particularly from&#160;viral hemorrhagic septicemia, or VHS) that can be considered a single threatening event that could rapidly cause the species to go extinct. The species is listed as special concern by the US Fish and Wildlife service, the states of Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. COSEWIC in 2005 listed the species as Special Concern.</p>",Habitat for this species includes open waters of large lakes; most abundant at depths of about 100-180 meters in Lake Superior (Page and Burr 2011). It spawns at about 90-180 meters (Scott and Crossman 1973).,"The major threat to this fish comes from competition and predation from exotic Alewife (<em>Alosa pseudoharengus</em>) and Smelt (<em>Osmerus mordax</em>) (Todd pers. comm. 1993). Walker (1992) reported that these species are thought to compete with the Shortjaw Cisco (<em>Coregonus zenithicus</em>), a similar deep-water coregonid, for food and habitat and that predation on cisco eggs and young have further impacted cisco populations (Berst and Spangler 1972, Christie 1972, Lawrie and Rahrer 1972, Wells and McLain 1972). Stedman and Argyle (1985, cited by Walker 1992) found that Rainbow Smelt (<em>Osmerus mordax</em>) preyed heavily on Bloater Chub larvae (also a similar Coregonid species) in areas where the two were found in close proximity. As the numbers of these exotic species increase, the number of kiyi declines. Lake Superior has a low number of alewife and this has probably helped to preserve the Kiyi there (Todd pers. comm. 1993).<br/><br/>According to Todd (pers. comm. 1993) there is no current fishing pressure on the Kiyi but this may have been a factor in the past. Walker (1992) discussed the importance of fishing to the shortjaw and other ciscoes. She stated that overfishing was a major cause of the collapse of the Shortjaw Cisco populations in both lakes Michigan and Huron (Smith 1964, Berst and Spangler 1972, Christie 1972). Seven species of deepwater ciscoes, or chubs, existed within the Great Lakes basin and these ciscoes supported valuable commercial fisheries since at least 1869 (Koelz 1926). They were harvested with size-selective gill nets and marketed as smoked fish. Seldom were they distinguished by species. Large fish were more valuable and therefore the first to be overexploited. The ciscoes of intermediate size were not heavily fished until the larger species became less abundant. Due to the absence or scarcity of the species (both shortjaw and kiyi) throughout most of the range there is no current commercial fishery. Small numbers are taken in the bloater chub fisheries of Lake Superior. These fisheries currently operate at low levels due to low prices and the distance of the fishing grounds from ports. If these fisheries were to expand, there would be little legal protection for the species.<br/><br/>The following information on additional threats comes from a discussion of limiting factors in a status report on shortjaw cisco (<em>Coregonus zenithicus</em>) by Walker (1992). Due to the similarity of the two species the information was included here. Habitat degradation is not generally believed to be a major threat to this species because they are found in remote areas of the Great Lakes and at depths greater than 200 feet. However, the disposal of dredged material and sedimentation could deposit silt on spawning beds, smother eggs, and reduce the level of dissolved oxygen by introducing organic matter (U. S. Army Corps of Engineers 1975). Additionally, disposal of contaminated dredged material adversely effects survival of fry and eggs by adding to the loading of and exposure to toxic compounds (e.g., organochlorine compounds and heavy metals). Many hazardous chemicals present in the Great Lakes may also threaten the species. PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were shown to decrease reproductive success in related species, such as the lake trout (Mac and Edsall 1991). The bloater chub, also a coregonid species and similar to the Shortjaw Cisco, has been monitored for the presence of contaminant residues since 1969 (Hesselberg <em>et al</em>. 1990, Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 1990). Concentrations of arsenic in the fish of lakes Michigan and Huron, including bloaters, are the highest measured nationally as part of the National Contaminant Monitoring Program (Schmitt and Brumbaugh 1990). There is some evidence on the adverse interactive effects of arsenic and PCBs on the bloater (Passino and Kramer 1980). Since 1980, contaminant residues in the bloater have declined. This is representative of the contaminant reduction in the Great Lakes, but the persistence and potential detrimental effects of these and other contaminants require continued monitoring to establish cause and effect linkages (Fox 1991, Mac and Edsall 1991). Organochlorine compounds bioaccumulate in the food chain and become concentrated in organisms at higher trophic levels, such as fish. The exotic and parasitic sea lamprey (<em>Petromyzon marinus</em>) is implicated in the demise of the species. Lake trout and burbot, large, bottom-dwelling fish, are the natural predators of the ciscoes. Lamprey population expanded and the lake trout and burbot populations plummeted. Decreases in the trout and burbot abundance made the deepwater ciscoes likely prey (Hile and Buettner 1955). In addition, as trout populations crashed, commercial fishing pressure shifted to the ciscoes. The combined effects of lamprey predation and increased fishing effort overtaxed the ability of the shortjaw and other ciscoes to maintain viable populations (Lawrie and Rahrer 1972).  Since the population has been reduced to one known occurrence, the species is highly vulnerable to localized destructive events.","The only substantial population is in Lake Superior, where the species is regarded as reasonably abundant (Todd pers. comm. 1993). The current population is actually low for a fish of this type and may be no more than 11,000 individuals (Smith pers. comm. 1994).<br/><br/>Current population trend in Lake Superior is unknown, but there has been a decline range-wide in the past (Todd pers. comm. 1993). Currently there is no evidence to indicate that the population is decreasing or increasing (Smith pers. comm. 1994).",Unknown,"The historic range of this species included the Great Lakes of North America (except Lake Erie). The species was extirpated in Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Ontario (COSEWIC 2005, Zimmerman and Krueger 2009) and is currently extant only in Lake Superior.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Populations should be monitored frequently; status could change abruptly (Smith, pers. comm. 1994).<br/><br/>The minimum population size needed to maintain a genetically viable population should be investigated. The following research needs are taken from the status report on the Shortjaw Cisco (<em>Coregonus zenithicus</em>) by Walker (1992) as they apply to the Kiyi. Sampling is needed to determine growth rates, fishing and natural mortality rates, age at maturity and fecundity. It is also necessary to sample to locate and determine characteristics of spawning sites, such as depth, temperature and substrate type. Once spawning sites are identified emergent fry can be sampled and related diet studies can be conducted. Determination of the predators and competitors of the kiyi is necessary to determine the role of the Kiyi within its environment. Since environmental contamination may have affected the ciscoes, baseline contaminant information should be collected, including measures of the total body burdens of organochlorine compounds and heavy metals, analysis of prey contamination levels, and sampling of eggs to determine their level of contamination. The genetic material of the Kiyi should be examined by gel electrophoresis and mitochondrial DNA sequencing. This will allow the estimation of the degree of hybridization which may have affected the cisco.<br/><br/>Information on abundance and changes in abundance in Lake Superior should be examined. Occurrences should be sought throughout the Great Lakes.<br/><br/>Commercial fishing should be restricted as it effects the Kiyi. The Kiyi should be considered for more protective listing by the USFWS as there is only one extant EO. Reduction of contaminants released into the Great Lakes should be continued (Walker 1992).

Disease and pathogen issues are undoubtedly due to infections of Muskellunge in the Great Lakes by piscirickettsia (musky pox) and viral hemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) over the past decade (Kerr 2011).","This species is represented by a large number of occurrences (subpopulations). Kerr (2011) determined that this species occurs in 1,391 lakes, 376 rivers, and 99 reservoirs in North America. Almost 73 percent of North America's Muskellunge waters are sustained by natural reproduction, but few jurisdictions rely solely on natural reproduction to provide fisheries (this is a highly prized trophy fish) (Kerr 2011). <br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but apparently quite large (probably greater than 100,000). This fish is locally common (Page and Burr 2011).<br/><br/>Abundance declined in many jurisdictions by the late 1800s and early 1900 (Kerr 2011). Stocking has expanded the distribution of Muskellunge in a number of locations beyond its natural range.

It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years), but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.</p>","<p>The Siberian Ibex&#160;primarily occupies mountainous regions from 500 to-5,500 m asl in rocky terrain and open alpine meadows and crags, seeking out lower elevations during the winter (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). In the completely snowed in valleys of the Himalaya, however, ibex remain in high elevations during winter to feed on emergent vegetation in the avalanche chutes and windblown crests, and also digging through softer snow of the higher elevations. They descend to the lower valley bottoms to take advantage of the spring thaw, but ascend to the highest ridgelines during the peak of summer (Schaller 1977, Bhatnagar 1997). Ibex occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. Siberian Ibex&#160;can also be found in areas with canyons, rocky outcrops, and steep ‘escape’ terrain far from high mountains (Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007, Peterson 2016, Bragin <em>et al.</em> 2017). The species rarely enters forest zones, but on a hot day does prefer shaded areas, or even small pockets of pastures near glaciers. Ibex tend to remain near steep, escape terrain (Bhatnagar 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Pin Valley National Park in India, over 90% of the over 800 ibex sightings were within 100 m from ‘escape terrain’ (Bhatnagar 1997). Females tend to retreat into the security of cliffs for parturition in May-June (Schaller 1977). </p>  <p>Ibex live in small groups that vary considerably in size, sometimes forming herds of over 100 animals, but more typically averaging 6-30 animals, depending on the region (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1997, 1999b; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Singh <em>et al. </em>2010). They spend the day in alternating periods of activity and rest, having a bimodal pattern through much of the year. In winter, ibex in the Himalaya tend to have a distinct unimodal activity peak towards noon, while resting on or near cliffs from evening until the next morning (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1992, Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). </p>  <p>Ibex shows little sexual segregation throughout the year, except the period between parturition (around June) and autumn (November) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex in an area of rocky outcrops in the Mongolian Gobi Desert displayed no segregation between sexes and similar sized mean annual home ranges using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) of 42 km<sup>2</sup> for females (n = 5) and 39 km<sup>2</sup> for males (n = 4) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). A study on ranging patterns of ibex in the Indian Himalaya (2 adult males and 3 females) shows that the mean annual home range (MCPs) of males (44 km<sup>2</sup>) was almost double that of females (20 km<sup>2</sup>) (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex used extremely small ranges on lower, south facing slopes with early sprout during the spring (&lt;3 km<sup>2</sup>), expanding to larger ranges in summer and autumn, but again confining to small ranges during winter (5-10 km<sup>2</sup>). Daily movements of ibex were highest during the summer flush when they traversed over a km during a day to take advantage of forage quality, but were confined to barely a 300-400 meters during winter and spring due to limited usable patches (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015).</p>  <p>Ibex are primarily grazers with herbs as well as subshrubs and shrubs such as <em>Eurotia sp</em>., <em>Rosa</em> sp. and <em>Ephedra sp.</em> contributing significantly to their diet (Manjrekar 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Bagchi <em>et al. </em>2004, Tumursukh 2015). </p>  <p>Females gestate for 170-180 days (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961) and usually give birth to one, sometimes two, kids in the spring. The animals reach sexual maturity at 18 months for females and 30 months for males, although usually only older males mate (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Siberian Ibex&#160;can live up to 16-17 years (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961, Fedosenko and Blank 2001).<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>Throughout its range, local people hunt ibex for subsistence use because they traditionally provide an important supplementary food for local people. Poaching also occurs in some areas by military personnel, road maintenance workers, and others, especially in areas accessible by vehicle (Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987). Additional threats to ibex include competition with livestock for food and habitat, and in some areas by predators. As a result of these threats, some populations have declined significantly, especially in regions with dense human populations.<br/> <br/> In 2007, producers of wool products in Nepal began marketing a product they termed “yangir”, which they claimed originated from wild, hunted <em>Capra sibirica</em>. (Some hair fibers from <em>C. sibirica</em> are quite fine, and potentially may be used for high-quality wool). At least one importer based in Germany was marketing these products as high-end, specialty scarves. As of this writing (early 2020), the origin of these products (and whether they indeed came from <em>C. sibirica</em>) had not yet been determined, but were still being advertised on the internet as coming from ibex, stating that annually 1500 kg of the wool are produced world-wide (www.acitac.com/materialien/faserkunde/yangir.html). This would require the harvest of a considerable number of animals. Domestic hunting might provide the raw material. Trophy hunting programs harvest only a few animals/year and are unlikely to be the source of a commercially marketed wool product. However, so far interest in ibex wool at local level is unknown and it seems Central Asia is not (yet) a supplier (Michel unpubl. data). If <em>Capra sibirica</em> were being poached specifically to feed this market, formerly stable populations could quickly become threatened.<br/> <br/> In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Siberian Ibex&#160;are harvested in trophy hunting programs. Trophy hunting targets only males above a certain age, and so direct impacts on targeted population size likely remain negligible, but poorly regulated trophy hunting can have many negative consequences (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), including an effect on the sex and age composition of populations as reported from Kyrgyzstan (Michel and Rosen 2016). The potential of causing evolutionary effects is low as long as hunter harvest only a minor portion of the males. Bans on trophy hunting and importation of hunting trophies risk removing incentives to prevent poaching and might increase human-caused mortality of ibex.<br/> <br/> Climate change likely poses new threats by altering habitat quality, in particular affecting water availability, vegetation composition and phenology as well as causing changes in land-use. <br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, it seems that prior to the Soviet invasion, Siberian Ibex&#160;was abundant and hunted throughout its range by local tribesmen. The impact of hunting was believed to be limited, in some areas due to customary regulations (Michel unpubl. data, based information from traditional hunters 2009). Currently hunting is formally banned, but poaching is still a major threat to the species, especially where new roads increase accessibility and modern weapons improve efficiency, in particular where military personnel and other armed forces are involved. Poaching became of greater concern in Wakhan National Park (i.e. the district of Wakhan), where border guards and police presence has increased (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2019). <br/> <br/> In China, the species is classified as a Category I Protected Wild Animal Species under the Wild Animal Protection Law (Wang 1998). Poaching might now pose a minor threat, as the government has confiscated most guns from pastoralists living near ibex habitat, although some poaching by police and/or military no doubt continues. Competition with livestock may occur.<br/> <br/> In India, region-wide threat assessments are scarce. Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2015) report illegal hunting by migratory laborers and migratory herders as one of the most important threats across the state of Himachal Pradesh, followed by subsistence hunting by local people and competition with migratory livestock for fodder. Increased grazing and disturbance from livestock are apparent in some areas (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1986, 1994; Pandey, 1993). Livestock grazing may not necessarily indicate competition, as was evident from summer grazing by local herders in Pin Valley; however, large herds of migratory herders were certainly a threat (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2000, Bagchi <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004). The fact that ibex can utilize rugged habitats have probably allowed them to linger precariously in parts of Himachal Pradesh with heavy grazing by migratory herds of livestock (Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>2015). The level of poaching is extremely low in the Buddhist dominated areas of India (Spiti and Ladakh). Heavy military presence along the disputed border between India and Pakistan can cause considerable disturbance to the species on both sides of the border, including the presence of border fencing. In fact, the ‘highest battlefield in the world’ around the Siachen glacier, contested between India and Pakistan, is surrounded by prime ibex habitat of the Karakorum, but is subjected to considerable military activity.</p>  <p>In Pakistan, poaching for food, heavy military presence on the Indian and Afghanistan borders, and competition for food with livestock are threats to Siberian Ibex. <br/> <br/> In Mongolia, transformation of ibex habitat for mining might be one of the most important emerging threats to the conservation of this species (see Tumursukh <em>et al.</em> 2015). The impact of trophy hunting on ibex populations remains uncertain (Lkhagvasuren <em>et al.</em> 2016). Other important threats to the species include grazing competition and disturbance from livestock, and poaching (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ibex is probably less affected than argali (<em>Ovis ammon</em>) by poaching and competition with livestock, because of the more precipitous and hence less accessible terrain it occupies, yet both probably negatively affect the species (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). A recent study by Odonjavkhlan (2018) did not find evidence for an impact of livestock grazing on habitat use by ibex in Tost Tosunbumba Nature Reserve. Tumursukh (2013) found evidence for competition between ibex and goats/sheep for forage; however, he did not find any evidence for demographic impacts from this competition. Illegal and unsustainable hunting for meat, trophies and skins remains a threat (Wingard and Zahler 2006), although habitat degradation through grazing by increasing livestock numbers and competition for pasture and water may constitute threats in some areas (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2006b) and increasing resource extraction and mining activities may also result in habitat loss and degradation. Harsh winter weather conditions can also severely affect population sizes locally (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  <p>In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the species is hunted by local people based on permit systems, but with a large unreported and illegal take. Informal hunting still seems to exceed official quotas in these countries, although the quotas for domestic hunters have not always appeared sustainable. Kyrgyzstan since 2017 has applied temporary hunting moratoria in several provinces, the effect of which is not yet evident.<br/> <br/> In Russia, although hunted legally under license, many are shot illegally and in large numbers.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>No rigorously derived population estimates exist for Siberian Ibex&#160;in any range state, although Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) and Lkhagvasuren <em>et al. </em>(2016) provide population estimates for most of Mongolia in 2009. Thus, the total population number provided here is a rough guess. Summarizing all available guestimates for the range states the total population size likely would be in the range of 170,000 to 250,000 animals (102,000 to 150,000 mature individuals).<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, the Siberian Ibex&#160;was considered abundant throughout its range prior to the late 1970s and a series of wars. Shank <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1977) estimated that around 5,000 animals used the Ajar Valley Reserve seasonally during the 1970s; this population is likely much smaller now (C. Shank pers. comm. 2007). More than 4,000 were believed to inhabit the Pamir alone. Their present status in the Pamir is unknown, but they are known to persist in reasonably large numbers throughout the ranges of the Wakhan Corridor. There in 2011 WCS recorded 2,069 animals in a direct count (1.6 per km²); in 2015, the double observer method yielded an estimate of 740 ±226 (2.2 per km²) (Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017)<span lang=""EN-US""> and 753 ±267 (2.2 per km²) in 2018 (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2020). The Siberian Ibex&#160;occurs along the Panj River across most of Badakhshan Province, but in some districts is exposed to illegal overhunting and population numbers are unknown (Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> There is no overall population estimate in China. The population in the Tian Shan had been guessed at 40,000-50,000 individuals (Wang 1998). Wu <em>et al. </em>(2015) estimate a density of 1.54 (± 0.23) per km² in the Tien Shan mountains south of Urumqi. Densities in other areas are relatively low. Rough guesses of ibex numbers in the Bei Mountains (northern Gansu) are between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals. The species has almost disappeared in the Daqin Mountains (Gao <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is listed as “Endangered” in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals (Wang 1998).<br/> <br/> In India, earlier population estimates include a minimum of 6,000 in Ladakh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1991a) and perhaps another 4,000 on the south side of the main Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, and in the Pir Panjal range of Himachal Pradesh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1992). A total of up to 15,000 ibex was estimated by Johnsingh, Mishra and Bhatnagar (1997) in <em>ca</em> 40,000 km² of potential habitat based on rough extrapolations. Counts of ibex in protected areas include 330 in the Kanji-Boodkharbu, 225 in Lungnag, 250 in Rangdum, and 174 in Rizong Wildlife Sanctuaries (Jammu and Kashmir) (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a), and 174 in the Pin Valley National Park (Himachal Pradesh) where Pandey (1993) estimated a density of 2.3 ibex/km² in 1989 and Johnsingh <em>et al.</em> (1997) at a lower value of 1.2 ibex/km². More recently Suryawanshi <em>et al.</em> (2012) estimate a density of 0.37 ibex/km² or 184 (± 40) ibex in 497 km² in Pin Valley National Park; a density of 0.11 ibex/km or 45 (±13) in 411 km² of Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary and a density of 0.14 ibex/km² or 30 (±14) in 219 km² of Lossar area of Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Over the past 10 years, these populations have been monitored using similar protocol and the population trends are stable (Suryawanshi, unpublished data). A recent occupancy survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2017) across the state of Himachal Pradesh found that ibex occupy an estimated 8,915 km². They found no evidence of range expansion or contraction in the Himachal Pradesh region between 1992 and 2015. Given these figures, we suspect that total population might not be more than 15,000.<br/> <br/> As reported by Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997), the total number of ibex in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia (as well as in adjacent Russia) was estimated at between 100,000 to 110,000 animals. Most of these occurred in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (<em>ca</em> 70,000) and Kazakhstan (ca. 17,000) with far fewer (8,000 to 9,000) in southern Siberia (3,000 to 3,500 in the Altai, 2,500 in Tannu Ola mountains of Tuva, 1,500 in Western Sayan and 2,000 to 2,500 in Eastern Sayan) and Uzbekistan (2,400). In Kazakhstan, the official numbers reported by the Provincial Territorial Inspection Services for Forestry and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture (A. Muzbay pers. comm. 2019) during the period 2014-2018 varied between 16,582 and 22,700 (average 20,500). These variations may reflect differences in reporting or methods rather than actual fluctuations of the population size. In Kyrgyzstan, officially reported numbers for the years 2000 – 2013 vary between 34,000 in 2009 and 73,000 in 2000, and are not always fully consistent (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019); the most recent official figure was 41,463 in 2018 (Press Service of the State Agency on Forestry and Environmental Protection, 2019 quoted at https://eco.akipress.org/news:1562027). The abundance varies. There are hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Ala-Arch National Park and Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) with high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low. The population size in the Pamirs and Pamiro-Alay in Tajikistan are unknown, but the species was considered common, especially in the western part of the Pamirs (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers had declined during and after the civil war in Tajikistan in the 1990s and recovered only locally. The total potentially suitable area in Tajikistan is approx. 70,000 km²; if applying the lower density margin (0.2/km²) from the site estimates below the total ibex population size might be 14,000 animals (own guess Michel, 2019). Considering that large areas are intensively used for grazing and poaching impact has reduced population sizes, this figure might be more realistic than higher estimates of up to 25,000 (Kh. Karimov pers. comm. 2019). In Uzbekistan, the population might still be in the range of 2,000-2,500 animals, although the southern part of the Hissar Range in Surkhandarya Province has not been surveyed for the last two decades (E. Bykova pers. comm. 2019). Thus, despite local declines the overall population size seems to be still similar as reported in Shackleton (1997) with no detectable overall trend, but possibly declines at least in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, it is not clear if this apparently stable or slightly declining population size reflects the real situation or continuity in formal reporting by state agencies and hunting organizations. The continuing prevalence of poaching across Central Asia combined with an increase in the intensity and area covered by livestock grazing in mountainous rangelands over the last two decades leads us to suspect an overall more substantial decline in population size than reflected in official numbers. This suspected decline is also supported by site-level estimates in areas with different management regimes </p>  <p>Few site level estimates exist for the Central Asia region. Jumabay-Uulu (2013) estimated a density of 0.67 ibex/km² in 1,341 km² of Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve in Kyrgyzstan. Recent surveys (2018) by Khanyari (unpublished data) using the double-observer survey method put the estimates in this area at 2.26 ibex/km². Numbers in community-based conservancies in the Bartang valley, Wakhan and Northern Alichur range of Tajikistan have been stable or increasing between 2009 and 2019 with densities varying between 0.19 and 1.42 animals per km² conservancy area and an absolute number of up to 2,300 over an area of 2,250 km² (unpublished data of ANCOT, 2019). Michel and Muratov (2010) reported direct counts of 2,476 animals in 8,174 km² surveyed area of the eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan (0.30 ibex per km² surveyed area with substantial variation between areas). Point counts in two sections of this area in 2013 yielded estimates of 0.34 animals per km² in an unmanaged area and 0.57 animals per km² in a game management area (unpublished analysis of data of ANCOT by Michel).&#160; <br/> <br/> The Mongolian Red Data Book 1987 (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987), stated that 1,000 individuals inhabited western Khövsgöl alone, and a total of 80,000 animals occurred in Mongolia in the mid-1980s (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) stated that ibex numbers declined since that peak estimate of 80,000 due to exploitation, habitat degradation and competition for resources (Schaller 1994, 1995, 1998). Lkhagvasuren et al. (2016) estimated a total of 36,018 (13,840–43,873) ibex across Mongolia. This is much lower than the 80,000 ibex estimated in mid-1980s. In the Khohk Serkh Reserve in the High Altai, the population was estimated at 1,000 in 1979 by Dzieciolowski <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1980) and at 1,200 by des Clers (1985). Tulgat and Schaller (1992) estimated 600 ibex in the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area. In 1989, in a 200 km² study area west of Tsogt in the Altai, Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1994) counted 337 ibex, and estimated there may have been a total of up to 450 animals. Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) recorded 1,218 ibex in 623 km² of Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Conservation Park (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999b). Tumursukh <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate a density of 0.75 ibex/km² or 1,051 (±196) in 1,400 km² of the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, which were later declared Tost-Tosumbumba Nature Reserve. Few other rigorously derived estimates of population numbers exist for other parts of Mongolia. <br/> <br/> Siberian Ibex&#160;is widely distributed over northern Pakistan, but is only locally abundant in the northern part of the country. Hess (1986) found the highest density in northern Pakistan to be in the area along the Barpu Glacier (Gilgit District) with 1.2 to 1.6 animals/km² (n = 194-270 animals, area surveyed = 164 km<sup>2</sup>). Wegge (1988) estimated that &gt;2,000 ibex lived in the Khunjerab NP, at a slightly lower density of <em>ca</em> 1.0 ibex/km². In many areas the species had densities of only 0.1 to 0.3/km² as in the Shinghai Valley, Gilgit District (n = 15-50 animals, area surveyed = 176 km², Hess, 1986). Within the Gilgit District, Siberian ibex was clearly rarer in the southern than in the northern part. The reasons for this may be that compared to northern areas, elevations in the south are generally lower, there are higher densities of humans using alpine pastures, and there are smaller distances between villages. The census of the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP, 1992) gives 2,545 animals for the whole province; in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a total of 375 were estimated (Qayyum, 1986, 87). Recent surveys by Khan <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a total of 899 ibex in a survey area of 1,895 km² of Khunjerab National Park. They encountered the highest densities of ibex in the Muztagh-Taxkorgan region with an estimated 1.17 ibex per km²<sub>. </sub>Din <sub>et al</sub>. (2011) counted 429 ibex in 1,022 km² of northern Chitral (Torkhow valley). Rahman and Din (2016) in Chipursan Valley (Hunza) recorded 2,085 ibex (0.26/km²). Ali <em>et al</em>. (2007) counted 122 ibex in the Neelum Valley of Azad Kashmir. During 2010-2011 in Nagar Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan Ali <em>et al</em>. (2015) counted 478 in winter and 456 in spring, leading to density estimates of 0.33 and 0.32 per km² respectively. Khan <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported 2,777 ibexes from the whole of Gilgit Baltistan, while annual surveys of ibex in central Karakoram National Park suggest numbers to be around 2,500 ibex.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species inhabits the mountain ranges, isolated mountains, and rocky outcrops of central and northeastern Afghanistan, China (northwestern tip of Gansu, western Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, possibly Tibet on its border with Xinjiang, Schaller 1998), northwestern India (Himalaya of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh), southern and eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia (Altai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, and Sayan Mountains, as well as in the southeast), northern Pakistan, Russia (southern Siberia, southern Tuva, and the Altai Mountains), Tajikistan and northeastern Uzbekistan (west Tian Shan) (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005, Harris <em>et al. </em>2009). </p>  <p>In Afghanistan, Siberian Ibex were historically found in steep habitat throughout the Afghan Hindu Kush and its outlying ranges (e.g., Spinghar, Kohe Baba, Safed Koh, Feroz Koh, Nuristan), but current distribution is not known. Its occurrence has been confirmed since 2000 in suitable habitat throughout the Afghan Pamir and along the Panj River of north-eastern Badakhshan, in particular in Wakhan, Ishkashem, Zebak, Rushan and Darvaz districts (Simms et al. 2014, Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017, Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> In China, Siberian Ibex occur primarily in the mountains surrounding Xinjiang, but also in those of extreme northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Populations are relatively widespread in western Xinjiang (Abudoukadi’er 2003) in the mountains around the Dzungarian Basin, including the mountains along the border with Kazakhstan from south of the Irtysh River, through the Kok Shaal Tau Mountains along the border with Kyrgyzstan and into the Pamir along the border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also throughout the Tian Shan ranges. Populations occur along the Sino-Mongolia border in the Baytik Mountains (Xinjiang), in the Mazongshan area of northern Gansu, and as far east as the Daqinshan of central Inner Mongolia (Wang 1998). Slightly separated from these are populations in the Altai Mountains in northern Xinjiang, along China’s borders with Mongolia, and Russia. <br/> <br/> The Siberian Ibex has a widespread distribution in northeastern and eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and southern Siberia, where it occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from hot deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. It is found throughout the ranges of the Pamiro-Alay, Pamir, Tian Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Altai, and Tuva Mountains, as well as the western and eastern Sayan (Weinberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997; Fedosenko 2001). The species occurs in mountainous areas with sufficient rugged escape terrain and suitable pockets of grazing habitat, but is missing in the wide mountain valleys and plateaus intensively used for livestock grazing.<br/> <br/> In Mongolia, Siberian Ibex are patchily distributed in rugged terrain throughout the western half of the country, and in central and south-central Mongolia to the trans-Siberian railway line (Ulaanbaatar to Sainshand) (Dulamtseren 1970, 1977; Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). More specifically, ibex inhabit the Altai, Hangai, and Gobi Altai Mountain Ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980, Mallon 1985, Schaller 1994, Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). They also occur in the Sayan Mountains near the Russian border west of Lake Hovsgol and in scattered populations in the small mountains in the Transaltai Gobi and in canyons, rocky outcrops, and other rugged terrain throughout the Gobi Desert (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1977; Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1999a, 1999b; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). A small, introduced population survives in the Bogd Uul Mountains just outside of Ulaanbaatar (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The largest number of ibex occurs in the Altai and western Hangai Mountains (Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Populations continue to become increasingly fragmented, especially in central and southeastern Mongolia (Schaller 1994, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2009). A long-term research project on ibex ecology is being conducted in northern Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in northern Dornogobi Aimag (Reading <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006b, 2007; Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Peterson 2016; Bragin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017; Otgonbayar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/> <br/> In India, the Siberian Ibex occurs in the Himalayan regions of Jammu and Kashmir, in the Karakorum, Zanskar and Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh and in the Trans Himalayan and Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh, as far east as the Sutlej river (Fox 1987; Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992; Gaston <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1981; Pandey 1993). The species occurs in the western half of Ladakh, in the Shyok Valley (Nubra region) of northern Ladakh, along the Ladakh Range, and along both sides of the main Himalayan Range eastward to Shingo La (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a, 1992; Mallon 1991; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Its occurrence is very sparse east of the Zanskar River, a tributary of the Indus. It is present along the southern side of the Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir from the Zoji La eastwards to Himachal Pradesh, where it occurs throughout much of Lahul and Spiti, in the upper Beas and Parbati catchments, and Kinnaur in the east, primarily on the right bank of the Sutlej river (Fox <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1992; Pandey 1993; Bhatnagar 2003; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015; Ghoshal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). </p>  <p>In&#160; Pakistan,&#160; the population of Himalayan Ibex&#160;is currently concentrated within the Karakoram Range, especially in the Districts of Hunza (Gojal Valley), Nagar (Hopper and Hisper), Shigar (Basha and Braldu) and Ghanche (Hushey and Kandey) (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015; Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In the Hindu Kush Range, the largest and most stable population occurs in Qurumber National Park and its buffer areas (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In the Himalayas, ibex habitat is shrinking overall; currently it is confined to Shouter Valley of Neelum Valley within the range that was reported for ibex in Pakistani Kashmir (Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Among the valleys of Gilgit-Balitstan that fall in the Himalayas, ibex exist in the Rupal, Rattu and Darley Valleys of Astore District in Gilgit-Baltistan. In the Hindu Kush Range, the ibex survives in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the upper Chitral District. It is restricted to the relatively dry mountains between about 3,200 to greater than 5,000 m.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Siberian Ibex are harvested by subsistence hunters for their meat and by trophy hunters primarily for their skulls with horns sometimes also the entire skin. Locally the fur is used to produce high-end wool, called “yangir”, but the extent of this use is not known.",Terrestrial,"<p>Within Afghanistan, ibex are nominally protected from human harvest by a nationwide presidential ban on hunting. Ibex populations residing in the Ajar valley (in Bamyan Province) were listed by the Government’s National Environmental Protection Agency as legally protected in 2009, formally banning all hunting and trading of animals from this population within Afghanistan. They are present in the Wakhan National Park (declared in 2014), and the Bamyan Plateau protected area (declared in 2019), which incorporates the Ajar Valley. They are probably very few left in Band-e-Amir National Park (declared in 2009) and their status in Shah Foladi protected area (declared in 2019) is unknown. Conservation measures proposed include surveys to determine the current status and distribution of the species.<br/> <br/> In China, the taxon is listed as Class I in the Wildlife Protection Law. Siberian ibex occur in at least eight nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Khanasi and Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), Tuomur Feng, Bogda Feng, Tianchi, West Tian Shan, and Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). Conservation measures proposed include determining the status of populations throughout their distribution in China, providing additional protection in some areas (e.g., in the Altai), considering others for development of managed, sustainable trophy hunting programs. These latter programs may be useful where ibex numbers are sufficiently abundant, and where removal or reduction of livestock is advised, local people should be provided with compensation. In northern Gansu, livestock should be managed to reduce conflicts with <em>C. sibirica</em>. It has also been suggested that a cross-boundary reserve be developed that would connect to the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia, not only to protect ibex but also other species.<br/> <br/> In India, the Project Snow Leopard, a national level policy for conservation in high elevation area promotes landscape scale participatory approaches within multi-use landscape (PSL 2008). Such a policy facilitates working with local communities to reduce impacts of livestock grazing and illegal hunting on wildlife in the region through the implementation of carefully developed management plans. Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2015) corroborate this by finding that most of the wildlife (including ibex) occur outside protected areas in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Siberian ibex is found in several protected areas in the western Himalayan region (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, 1991a, 1994; Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981; Bhatnagar 2003) including: Jammu and Kashmir (undivided) – Kishtwar and Hemis National Parks and Batkal Thajwas, Overa Aru, Kanji, Boodkharbu, Tongri, Rangdum, Karakoram, Lung Nag, Rizong Sabu, and Chukor Wildlife Sanctuaries; Himachal Pradesh - Pin Valley and Great Himalayan (possibly) National Parks and the Daranghati (possibly), Gamgul Siya-Behi, Kanawar, Kugti, Lippa Asrang, Manali, Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/> <br/> Within ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia ibex are present in several strictly protected areas (<em>zapovedniks</em>) and National Parks. Among these are important areas: Kazakhstan: Aksu-Dzhabagly, Alma-Ata and Markakol, Altyn-Emel National Park; Kyrgyzstan: Besh-Aral, Naryn, Sarychat-Ertash and Sary-Chelek, Ala-Archa National Park, Khan-Tengri National Park; Russia: Sayano-Shushensky and Altai; Tajikistan: Romit, Zorkul, Tajik National Park; Uzbekistan: Chatkal, Gissar and Zaamin, Ugam-Chatkal National Park, Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserve. Hunting by domestic hunters based on permits and hunting seasons exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and in few hunting areas in Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting for ibex exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting can be important for conserving the species, as it can provide incentives to prevent poaching, but usually only if implemented as community-based programs. Most such operations in the former Soviet Union involve former poachers and the income they provide encourages these people to refrain from poaching and to prevent others from poaching (Michel and Rosen 2016). Bans of trophy hunting as proposed in Kyrgyzstan in 2018 and 2019 or prohibition of trophy imports would remove such incentives and could result in higher mortality from unregulated illegal use. In Kyrgyzstan (since 2010) and Tajikistan (since 2008) community-based game management led to local recoveries of ibex numbers (Michel and Rosen 2016) in areas where previously poaching had reduced population sizes to low levels (SULi 2019). For instance, in Tajikistan 4 such game management areas with a total area 2,250 km² harbor about 2,300 animals with further community-based areas under development. Hunting and tourism revenues finance the management of these areas, managed by local NGOs created mainly by former poachers. Also in Kyrgyzstan, on several thousand square kilometers community-based organizations prevent poaching and thus support ibex conservation, although so far hunting quotas have not been assigned in any of these areas. Conservation measures proposed include the expansion of community-based hunting management and protection and the increase of protected areas effectiveness with a focus on stopping poaching and regulation of livestock grazing to prevent forage competition and habitat degradation. </p>  <p>In Mongolia, ibex is legally protected as a Rare species under the Mongolian Law on Fauna and the Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). No general hunting is allowed, but a limited amount of licensed trophy hunting is permitted. The species is listed as Near Threatened in most recent Mongolian Red List (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006), which represents a change in status from the last 2 Mongolian Red Books, in which the species was listed as Threatened (Shagdarsuren 1987; Shiirevdamba <em>et al</em>. 1997). Approximately 14% of the species’ range is protected (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006) and it occurs in at least the following protected areas: Altai-Taivan Bogd, Bodgkhan Mountains, Eej Khairkhan Mountain, Great Gobi, Gobi Gurvan Saikhan, Ikh Nart, Khangai Nuruu, Khar-Uvs Lake, Khokh Serkh Mountain, Khovsgol Lake, Otgontenger Mountain, Sharga Natural Reserve, Silkhem Mountain, Tarvagatai Mountain, Tost Mountains, Tsambagarav, Uvs Lake, and Yoliin Valley. Khokh Serkh Nature Reserve in the Altai region was established specifically for the conservation of this species. A long-term research project on ibex in Ikh Nart has been established for several years now, and several hundred are estimated to be living within this protected area (R. Reading pers. comm.). Conservation measures proposed include: 1) Undertake more rigorous population surveys of all populations; 2) Study the ecology, particularly habitat requirements and movement patterns, and the impacts of livestock grazing on ibex; 3) Hire, train, and equip law enforcement agents, especially for protected areas; 4) Begin using the money generated from trophy hunting to pay for conservation and management of the species, ideally using community-based approaches (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016); 5) Establish new protected areas to conserve additional populations of ibex; and 6) Collaborate better with Russia and China to protect populations that live in border regions. Trophy hunters purchase hunting licenses from which US$800 for Altai ibex and UD$720 for Gobi ibex are theoretically allocated to the government for a quota of 260 animals per year (MNE 2005). Little to none of this money is used specifically for conservation or management of the species (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), although a small percentage of the money goes toward general conservation activities, such as the budgets of regional protected areas administrations. <br/> <br/> Within Pakistan, Shackleton (1997) reported numerous protected areas providing differing levels of protection to ibex. These include: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Agram-Basti Wildlife Sanctuary (WS), Goleen Gol Game Reserve (GR); Swat District: Giddar Baik WS, Mahu Dand GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987). Gilgit-Baltistan - Gilgit District: Khunjerab NP, Kargah WS, Naltar WS, Kilik-Mintaka GR, Danyore GR, Sherqillah GR, Pakura Nallah GR, Chassi-Bowshdar GR, Nazbar Nallah GR (Rasool no date); Diamir District: Astor WS (Rasool n. d.); Baltistan District: Baltistan WS, Satpara WS, Nar Nallah GR, Askor Nallah GR (Rasool no date). Azad Jammu and Kashmir – Muzaffarabad District: Ghamot GR, Machiara GR (Qayyum 1986, 1987; Zool. Survey Dept. 1986). Mahu Dand GR was created for ibex in 1992. WWF-Pakistan began a hunting program in 1990 at the Bar village near Gilgit (Johnson 1997, Arshad 2002). In 1991, IUCN-Pakistan, with support from UNDP, in co-operation with local people and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program, initiated a planning process to survey protected areas and to prepare an overall sustainable-use wildlife management plan for ibex populations. The program involves hunting by both local and foreign hunters. Conservation measures include: 1) Provide complete legal protection for the species and 2) Establish a proper hunting system involving a management plan for locals, as well as for foreigners. Hunting occurs in areas with healthy populations. This trophy hunting program has benefited the ibex population in Pakistan, and helped many populations to recover in several valleys of northern Pakistan (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This is based on an inferred population decline as a result of habitat loss, which may have approached 20-25% over the last ten years. Habitat conversion to agriculture and cattle farming, and hunting and persecution by feral dogs are constant threats, and the species is confined to a human dominated landscape with only patches of remaining habitat. The former Pampas Deer range has been dramatically reduced from 95 to 99% of the original habitat in the last century. Today less than 1% of the habitat remains (González<em> </em>1993, 1996). Although the Pampas Deer is adaptable to some degree of habitat modification, it should be monitored to ensure rates of decline do not increase. Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat to the existing population (González 2004, González <em>et al.</em> 2010).","The species occupies a range of open habitats in the Neotropics, in particular grassland areas and the cerrado shrublands. In Argentina, it also occurs in coastal salt marshes.","Habitat conversion for agriculture and competition with domestic livestock have been reported as threats to the Pampas Deer (Wemmer 1998). Due to the fragmentation of the remaining habitat the small and isolated populations face other threats. Other threats include over-exploitation for food, hides, and sport, predation by feral dogs, and possibly bovine disease (Wemmer 1998). In Brazil in Paraná State, another cause of mortality, outside of the Conservation Units, is the juvenile and fawn mortality during the crop harvest (Braga 2004). Predation of fawns by feral pigs occurs in both San Luis and the Bahia Samborombon; and fawns are kept as pets by local people (J. Jackson pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Breeding of cattle and sheep is also signaled as one of the negative factors for the species, due to competition for food and habitat, or transmission of diseases (Jackson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Cosse <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Giménez Dixon 1987). However, there are situations where agricultural activity is compatible with the conservation of the Pampas Deer (Merino <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2011). The presence of dogs related with the cattle activities and, even more, of feral dogs that attack the deer is a serious threat (Jackson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Beade <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).","There is not update information of total population size there are partial estimation for population specifically in the Southern part of South America<em>.</em> The populations from Argentina and Uruguay show a declining trend (González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, González <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). A minimum estimate for the total population size is 20,000 (Pinder 1994), while the maximum population size is estimated at 80,000 (Pinder 1994) individuals.<br/><br/>The largest extant populations are found in Brazil, in the northeast cerrado ecosystem where about 2,000 individuals live, and in the Pantanal where 20,000 to 40,000 exist (Pinder 1994). While in the last years two subpopulations were discovered, one further north on the island of Marajo, at the mouth of the Amazon River (Rossetti and de Toledo 2006), extending the species range, and the other in the south of the country a small subpopulation in Paraná State estimated to be less than 100 individuals (Braga <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). <br/><br/>In Uruguay there are two main subpopulations: El Tapado (Salto Department) with 800 individuals, and Los Ajos (Rocha Department) with approximately 300 deer (Weber and González 2003). At the turn of the 20th century, the Argentinean population was likely very large since over 500,000 km² of grassland habitat was available. However, today only three small subpopulations remain: Corrientes (Ituzaingo Department) with about 170 individuals (Merino and Beccaceci 1999), in San Luís Province) with approximately 800-1000 individuals (Merino <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011) and coastal Bahía de Samborombóm (Buenos Aires Province) with about 200 individuals (Merino <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997) and in Santa Fé “Bajos Submeridionales” area there is a small subpopulation estimated to be less than 50 individuals which lives in an area of 23,000 ha. (Vera Department, Pautasso 2011). A small subpopulation may still be extant in the southeastern part of Bolivia (Weber and González 2003). Small subpopulations of Pampas Deer may still be extant in the National Park Noel Kempff Mercado (Santa Cruz Department), in southwestern Bolivia (Anderson 1985, 1993; Tarifa 1993). However, it is restricted to relatively small patches of suitable habitat and may have become locally extinct in some of them.",Decreasing,"The Pampas Deer occurs in insular populations in western, northern, and  central Argentina, eastern Bolivia, central and southern Brazil,  Paraguay, and Uruguay. Prior to the 1800s, the species was abundant  throughout the grasslands of South America (Wemmer 1998, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>  2010). The Pampas Deer was a widespread species occupying a range of  open habitats, including grasslands, pampas and the Brazilian savanna  known as the Cerrado, in eastern South America from 5º to 41ºS (Cabrera  1943, Jackson 1987, Merino <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1997, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, 2002, González 2004, Weber and González 2003, González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2010). However, the area encompassed by these habitats has been  dramatically reduced to less than 1% of that present in 1900 (González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998). Currently, Pampas Deer populations are generally small and highly isolated (Jackson and Langguth 1987; González <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1998, 2002).","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. <br/><br/>In Argentina the entire Samborombón Bay area has been a protected area since the 1970s.

The entire Bay was included in the List of Wetlands of International Importance of the Ramsar Convention and was declared as Wildlife Refuge in 1997.<br/><br/>A Pampas Deer PHVA workshop was conducted in Uruguay in 1993 and conservation recommendations were listed for the main populations in Uruguay (González&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). Several conservation deer workshops were facilitated by Deer Specialist Group to plan management and conservation strategies for this species. These have been followed up by diverse research and conservation activities in the region.<br/><br/>Recommended conservation actions include further population surveys, ecological research, strengthening of existing management of protected areas, creation of new protected areas, establishment of a collaborative captive breeding programme, and enlisting the co-operation of local landowners in maintaining this species (Wemmer 1998). In 1984 the Province of Buenos Aires declared the species a ""Natural Monument"" in Argentina (Gimenez Dixon 1991). The provinces of Corrientes, and San Luis did likewise in the 1990s. Uruguay also declared it Natural Monument in 1985 (decree 12/9/85).<br/><br/>In spite of all these efforts, the majority of populations remain in fragile condition. Recommended conservation actions include further population surveys, ecological research, strengthening of existing management of protected areas, creation of new protected areas, establishment of a collaborative captive breeding programme, and enlisting the co-operation of local landowners in maintaining this species (Wemmer 1998).

But there are subspecies&#160;that are in danger of becoming extinct e.g.&#160;<em>Odocoileus hemionus cerrosensis</em>&#160;because on the island where it occurs, density is very low, because there are feral dogs and predation is high.<br/><br/>One obstacle involved in evaluating mule deer populations trend is inconsistent and incomplete data collections as stated by Carpenter <em>et al.</em> (2003). This problem results from the wide variety of methodologies and approaches used by states and provinces for Mule Deer management. There is a real need to standardize many of the methodologies to obtain data collections and establish protocols to obtain those measurements about Mule Deer populations.","Mule Deer are well adapted to a variety of habitats including temperate forest, desert and semidesert, open range, grassland, field and scrub habitats as well as Mountainous areas.","Today the most urgent threat to Mule Deer in the wild is the spread of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Currently CWD is more prominent at the local or regional level. CWD has currently been diagnosed in Mule Deer in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States and other mid-western states. Other threats include: high predator populations (including feral dogs), competition with livestock grazing, human habitat alterations and other anthropogenic forces. Although most of the subspecies are not threatened, the Cedro Island subspecies (<em>Odocoileus hemionus cerrocensis</em>) is considered to be Vulnerable (IUCN 1988) because of the low numbers and the high predation by feral dogs and poaching.","Where they occur Mule Deer populations are typically managed by federal, state and provincial agencies that monitor abundance and trends in order to set species management objectives. As a result Mule Deer remain abundant throughout much of their native range and are not currently in urgent need of further conservation action, but some evidence in the United State and Canada has shown declines in some populations (Bellard <em>et al</em>. 2001). Additionally in Mexico some data show local extinction of some populations in the Chihuahuan desert region of Coahuila and Nuevo León Mexico (Martínez-Muñoz <em>et al</em>. 2002), and in some populations we found evidence of metapopulation dynamics for this specie (Sanchez- Rojas and Gallina 2000).",Stable,"<em>Odocoileus hemionus</em> occurs throughout western North America from Alaska and Western Canada through the Rocky Mountains and Western Plains States of the United States south to the Peninsula of Baja California, Cedro Island, Tiburon Island and Northwestern Mexico.

As of early 2015, there are about 295 wild born&#160;mature individuals distributed among several re-established populations. Of these, 206 are in self-sustaining free-living populations. Of the 24 current sites where this species has been reintroduced, few have viable populations. The number of breeding adults declined by about 40% from 2008 to 2015 (approximately two generations). &#160;Although formerly widespread in central North America, the species declined through the 20th century to near extinction by the late 1970s, primarily as a result of prairie-dog <em>Cynomys</em> control actions and sylvatic plague; by 1987, it was considered Extinct in the Wild. The current populations result from massive efforts to reintroduce captive animals back to the wild. It was reintroduced by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service into eight western states of the USA, one state in Mexico, and one province in Canada from 1991 to 2009. Populations in Mexico and Canada are now considered extirpated. At present, it is considered self-sustaining at only four locations (two in South Dakota, one in Arizona and one in Wyoming). Even with augmentation, wild&#160;Black-footed&#160;Ferret populations remain small, fragmented, and intensively managed.","Black-footed Ferret is limited to open habitat, the same habitat used by prairie-dogs <em>Cynomys</em>: grasslands, steppe and shrub steppe. It depends largely on prairie-dogs, preying on them and using their burrows for shelter and denning (Hillman and Clark 1980). Ferret habitat selection at fine scales is dependent on density of prairie-dog burrow openings (Eads&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, 2013).&#160;It has been estimated that about 40-60 hectares of prairie-dog colony are needed to support one Black-footed Ferret. Ayers <em>et al</em>. (2014) found that Black-footed Ferrets successfully recruited offspring with prairie-dog densities of at least 12 individuals/ha in ferret core areas. Biggins <em>et al</em>. (1993, 2006) provided information on evaluating areas as potential Black-footed Ferret habitat; factors include size of prairie-dog complex, prairie-dog population density, spatial arrangement of prairie-dog colonies, potential for disease in prairie-dogs and in ferrets, potential for prairie-dog expansion, abundance of predators, future resource conflicts and ownership stability, and public and landowner attitudes.","The extreme dependence of Black-footed Ferret on prairie-dogs <em>Cynomys</em>&#160;made it especially vulnerable to extinction because its prey were persecuted as agricultural pests during most of the 20th century (Biggins and Godbey 2003). Populations declined&#160;rapidly&#160;as a result of widespread extermination of prairie-dogs and the spread of canine distemper and plague&#160;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>&#160;(Biggins and Godbey 1995, Biggins <em>et al.</em> 1998). Plague is an exotic disease that did not exist in North America prior to 1900.  It can affect Black-footed Ferret directly via infection and subsequent mortality, and indirectly through mortality of prairie-dogs and resultant dramatic declines in the Ferret's prey base&#160;&#160;(e.g., Eads and Biggins 2015). Multiple techniques and approaches are currently being developed and tested to reduce direct and indirect threats caused by plague.<br/><br/>Populations of Black-footed Ferrets declined throughout the 20th century to near extinction by the late 1970s (Biggins and Schroeder 1988). A small remnant population (around 100 animals or fewer; Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989) was discovered in 1981 near Meeteetse, in northwestern Wyoming, but that population was decimated by canine distemper and plague&#160;in 1985 (Forrest <em>et al</em>. 1988).<br/><br/>Another major threat is the loss of habitat by conversion of grasslands to agricultural uses; the remaining habitat is now fragmented by great expanses of cropland and human development. In addition, the gene diversity of the current captive population as&#160;determined by pedigree analysis&#160;is estimated to be about&#160;86% of that which was&#160;present in the population's founders (Garelle <em>et al</em>. 2014). This decrease in genetic diversity and concomitant increase in inbreeding may decrease fitness through inbreeding depression, including immune system dysfunction and reduced reproductive success (Bronson <em>et al</em>. 2007).","There are no known non-introduced wild Black-footed Ferret populations (Nowak 2005). This species nearly went extinct in the late 1980s and existing populations are the success of massive efforts to reintroduce this species back to its native habitat. Captive breeding has been successful.&#160;Several hundred individuals exist in six <em>ex situ</em> breeding facilities and as of early 2015,&#160;approximately 500 wild-living (released or wild born) individuals exist in populations in several US states and Mexico.<br/><br/>Reintroduction began in 1991 with the release of one group into the Shirley Basin of Wyoming. Since 1987, over 8,000 kits have been produced through captive breeding and since 1991, over 3,900 Ferrets have been released at 24 sites. When possible, populations are sampled and counted at least once a year as part of a management and recovery protocol. At the spring count of 2008 there were approximately 500 breeding adults in the wild, fewer than 250 of which had been born in the wild. The estimated number of breeding adults rose to 448 in 2009, but had declined to 274 in 2012, and was&#160;similar&#160;in 2015, at 295. The overall approximate population decline from 2008 to 2015 was about 40%. Of these, 206 mature individuals occur in self-sustaining free-living populations. These minimum population estimates occur in the spring. Maximum population estimates occur in the fall and include young of the year.",Decreasing,"Historically, Black-footed Ferret was&#160;found throughout the Great Plains, mountain basins, and semiarid grasslands of west-central North America, from southern Canada to northern Mexico wherever its prey, prairie-dogs <em>Cynomys</em>, were located (Hillman and Clark 1980). This species was extirpated from most of its former range mainly as a result of prairie-dog control programmes and sylvatic plague - an exotic disease which was introduced to the wild population. Today, it occurs in the wild as 17-22 reintroduction efforts, only four of which are self-sustaining.

As of 2008, there are six institutions (one federal facility and five zoos) participating in the propagation programme under the supervision of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Beginning in 1985, more than 8,000 Black-footed Ferrets have been born in captivity, with 323 kits weaned in 2014.

The cessation of harvest in the later 20th century means that quantification of the subsequent decline rates is not possible, but these are assumed to have continued at a rate resembling those during the mid 20th century - observed and estimated to be at least 30% over the last three generations (13-14 years) and which are considered likely to continue for the next three generations.&#160;Further, multi-decadal trends in the number of individuals captured purposely or incidentally by fur trappers suggest the population is in broad decline across many portions of its range (Wires and Baker 1994, Landholdt and Genoways 2000, Gompper and Hackett 2005, Sasse and Gompper 2006, Nilz and Finck 2008, Leberg and Davis 2012).","The three subspecies of Eastern Spotted Skunk occur in separate physiographic regions and their habitat preferences vary accordingly, with a consistent theme being the need for dense cover.&#160; The most well studied subspecies is&#160;Midwestern&#160;<em>Spilogale p. interrupta</em>, for which a radio-tracking study revealed that it selected forested areas with dense understorey (Lesmeister <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; Survivorship analyses further revealed that a majority of moralities occurred when the subspecies entered or occupied more open forest habitats (Lesmeister <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/> Based on historical records and ongoing research, the subspecies known as the Appalachian Eastern&#160;Spotted&#160;Skunk (<em>S. p. putorius</em>) is primarily found in higher elevation forested habitats in the Appalachian region. Historical records of <em>S. p. putorius</em> extend down into the piedmont and coastal plain of Virginia and the Carolinas. However, no detections have been made in those regions for at least the past 30 years.&#160;Because of&#160;a general lack of structured monitoring, it is still unclear if <em>S. p. putorius</em> is rare or just cryptic within the mountains of Appalachia.&#160;However, limited evidences suggest that, similar to <em>S. p. interrupta</em>, it prefers&#160;forested habitats with dense understorey (Reed and Kennedy 2000) with many of the most dense and frequent sightings occurring at high elevation (Diggins <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160; <br/><br/>The Florida race (<em>S. p. abarvalis</em>) is the least studied, but most frequently encountered, subspecies.&#160; Multiple anecdotal reports suggest that in contrast to the other subspecies, <em>S. p. abarvalis</em> is often encountered in and near human habitation, making dens in backyards and human structures.&#160; Observations in more rural areas suggest a strong association with Gopher Tortoise <em>Gopherus polyphemus</em>&#160;burrows (Frank and Lips 1989).<br/><br/> All three subspecies are known to be fairly opportunistic omnivores.&#160;Although the only intensive studies of feeding habits are from decades ago and from agricultural settings (Selko 1936, Crabb 1941), it is generally reported that the&#160;species is&#160;primarily insectivorous, and when insects are unavailable, it preys&#160;on small mammals or birds (Boppel and Long 1994, Kinlaw 1995). However, no detailed diet studies have been conducted in forested habitats.&#160;The species is primarily nocturnal and produces&#160;one litter per year, typically in the late spring or early summer (Kinlaw 1995).","<p>While each subspecies varies somewhat in specific suite of threats, a number of patterns have emerged that require further investigation. First, while Eastern Spotted Skunk is currently reported as infrequent, incidental captures by fur trappers and the historical overharvest could have contributed to population declines (Gompper and Hackett 2005). Second, the timing of declines in the mid 20th century coincides with the first wide-scale use of synthetic pesticides, suggesting a possible link between synthetic pesticide use and spotted skunk declines. Third, landscape change associated with modern row-crop agriculture, mesophitication of eastern forests, or other large-scale habitat alterations have negatively affected the availability of early successional forest habitat and shrub cover prefered by the species. Interestingly, this has been most recently been observed in attempts to conserve Red-cockaded Woodpecker <em>Leuconotopicus borealis</em>, where pine stands managed with an open understorey for conservation of the endangered woodpecker conflict with management strategies for this skunk, which requires dense understory (Lesmeister <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fourth, predator communities have similarly changed over the past century, potentially leading to altered competition dynamics. Fifth, a number of diseases could be linked to spotted skunk decline, including parvoviruses, distemper virus, and rabies (Gompper in revision). Overall, it is likely that simultaneously several of these threats influenced, and continue to influence, Eastern Spotted Skunk&#160;populations, and that threats could differ somewhat between subspecies. Further research is urgently needed in this area to explain the species's decline and its current distribution.</p>","<p>This species is widely distributed and was once common and harvested for pelts in many areas. Harvest data are available for many US states, and these data reveal large geographic variation in the numbers of individuals harvested within any given year in the mid 1900s as well as massive declines in the numbers harvested over time (Gompper and Hackett 2005, Sasse and Gompper 2006). These declines are not attributable to decline in the number of trappers attempting to harvest furbearers. For instance, harvested animals declined from between 30,000 and 90,000 per year in Iowa between the 1920s and mid 1940s, to fewer than 100 per year when harvest of the species ended in the 1970s. Similar patterns are noted elsewhere; across the Great Plains, and beginning in about 1940, harvests dramatically declined, such that by the early 1950s total harvests in all states were below 10% of pre-crash harvest, and by the 1980s harvests were below 1% of those during pre-decline. In northern, southern and eastern states, the historical harvest was lower, but similar patterns of population declines are observed (Gompper and Hackett 2005, Sasse and Gompper 2006). The species is now considered very rare or even absent from several states within its&#160;historical range (e.g., Minnesota DNR, n.d.).<br/><br/>Few reports of population density for <em>Spilogale putorius</em> are available. Crabb (1948) calculated estimates in an agricultural area of Iowa of between one per 11.4 ha and one per 5.0 ha, depending on the method of calculation. The work in Iowa occurred when the species was still common in the state (it is now almost absent). Data collected in 1973–1974 on a barrier island in Canaveral National Seashore, Florida, revealed an extremely high density of 40/km² (Kinlaw <em>et al.</em> 1995).</p>",Decreasing,"The Eastern Spotted Skunk <em>Spilogale putorius</em>&#160;is found from as far north as Minnesota, USA (and marginally into southeastern Manitoba and southwestern Ontario, Canada) to as far south as Tamaulipas, Mexico. In the eastern portion of its range it occurs in south-central Pennsylvania, USA, and south in the Appalachian Mountain chain to Florida, USA, and its western historical range extends to eastern Colorado and Wyoming, USA (Hall 1981, Kinlaw 1995). The geographic limits of its range are poorly described. Range expansion is reported to have occurred in the western USA during the late 1800s and early 1900s, and has been attributed to anthropogenic landscape change which facilitated population expansion in states such as Iowa, South Dakota, and Colorado (van Gelder 1959, Choate <em>et al.</em> 1974).",This species is widely distributed and was once common and harvested for pelts in many regions.,Terrestrial,"Based on historical trapping records, a range-wide decline of at least&#160;&gt;90%&#160;&#160;is likely to have occurred since the 1950s (Gompper and Hackett 2005). The plains subspecies (<em>S. p. interrupta</em>) is likely to be the race most in need of conservation action, and is included in a current Federal petition for listing as 'endangered' under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Most states throughout the range of the species now list it as either 'endangered', 'threatened', or a species of 'conservation concern'.<br/><br/> Overall, given the lack of knowledge regarding primary threats (see Threats) and causes of decline, research is urgently needed to guide conservation action. Fortunately, researchers from multiple states and universities currently have ongoing research projects on the species, and in 2015 the Eastern Spotted Skunk Cooperative Study Group was formed to help inform managers of research priorities and potential conservation actions.<p> <br/> </p>  <p> <br/> </p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The number of mature individuals in the entire population in 2011 was 632, a reduction of 20.4% from the 795 mature individuals in 1983. Currently the species is still in overall decline with two distinct trajectories between the populations in the NWHI (4.0% per year decline) and the MHI (6.5% per year increase; Caretta <em>et al</em>. 2013). The NWHI decline is mainly due to food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators. The overall decline of more than 20% within two generations (30 years) meets IUCN criterion C1 for Endangered.<br/></p>      <em></em>","Adult Hawaiian Monk Seals reach lengths of about 2.1 to 2.4 m and weigh 170-240 kg. Pups are about 1 m and 16-18 kg at birth and when weaned six weeks later they weigh 50-100 kg (Kenyon 1981, Antonelis <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Female Monk Seals first give birth at 4-10 years old. Births occur during all months of the year, with most occurring during March to August (Johanos <em>et al</em>. 1994). Age specific fecundity rates for mature animals range from 50% to over 80%, and differ among subpopulations (Harting <em>et al</em>. 2007, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011). Males in this polygynous species patrol the water adjacent to rookeries or land near females with pups. Male dominated sex ratios have occurred at some colonies, and that has resulted in mobbing of oestrus females some of which have been severely injured or killed in such events (Johanos <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Monk seals are generally solitary, both on land and at sea. Even when seals gather together on land, they are not normally gregarious and only mothers and pups and recently weaned seals regularly make physical contact. On land, Hawaiian Monk Seals haul-out and breed on substrates of sand, coral, or volcanic rock. Sandy beaches with shallow protected water near shore appear to be preferred for pupping (Westlake and Gilmartin 1990).<br/><br/>At-sea movements and habitat use of Hawaiian Monk Seals have been investigated using satellite-linked dive recorders and animal-borne video cameras. In the NWHI, Monk Seals forage within atolls, in the shallow waters surrounding atolls and islands, and farther offshore at submerged banks and reefs (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the MHI, Monk Seals tend to stay within 50 km of shore and forage almost entirely within the 200 m bathymetric contour of the islands. Seals carrying cameras in both regions searched for and preyed on benthic fish and invertebrates in coral reefs, sand flats, as well as areas of rubble and consolidated bottom material, along areas of transition of benthic habitat types, and also in deepwater coral beds (Parish <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2002; NMFS unpublished data). Most dives that have been recorded have been less than 150 meters deep, although some individuals dived to more than 550 m (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2006, NMFS unpublished data). Hawaiian Monk Seals are known to eat a variety of fishes, eels, cephalopods, and crustaceans (Goodman-Lowe 1998, Iverson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cahoon <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Recovery of Hawaiian Monk Seals has been affected to an unknown degree by disturbance from military activities in the NWHI including the alteration, development, and occupation of bases on several key islands that started before World War II (Ragen and Lavigne 1999). However, the military no longer has bases in the area and the vast majority of Monk Seals live where they are isolated from most direct human contact. The only permanent structures remaining in the NWHI are US Fish and Wildlife Service facilities at Tern Island and Midway Atoll, and remnants of former Coast Guard facilities at Kure Atoll. Degradation of these structures, particularly at Tern Island, poses a significant entrapment hazard for Monk Seals. There are also concerns about legacy chemicals and contaminants that were left behind.<br/><br/>Current threats to Monk Seals are thoroughly reviewed and analysed in National Marine Fisheries Service (2007). The most crucial threats in the NWHI at this time are: 1) food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators; 2) entanglement in marine debris, largely fragments of net and line discarded by North Pacific fisheries; 3) predation by sharks, especially on pre-weaned and recently weaned pups; and 4) intraspecific aggression by sub-dominant males. An emerging threat in this region may be the loss of terrestrial habitat due to sea level increases resulting from global warming (Baker et al. 2006). The situation in the MHI is different, with the main threats there being: 1) interactions with commercial and non-commercial fishing gear especially hookings and entanglements in gillnets; 2) possible transmission of diseases from feral animals, domestic pets, and livestock to seals; and 3) intentional killing and harassment.","Hawaiian Monk Seals are distributed throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago. Within the Monk Seal’s range, two regions are often distinguished: the NWHI, comprising eight subpopulations located on remote atolls and small islands, and the MHI, comprising eight large high islands and associated small islets. Seals in the MHI are considered to be a single subpopulation. The status of the Hawaiian Monk Seal is assessed annually and updated by the US National Marine Fisheries Service’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. The most recent reliable abundance estimates, from 2011, were used for this assessment.<br/><br/>The generation time for Hawaiian Monk Seals, estimated as the average age of reproducing individuals, is approximately 15 years. The best estimate of the total number of seals of all age classes in 2011 is 1,209. The population is comprised of approximately 632 sexually mature seals with the following distribution across subpopulations: Kure Atoll 58, Midway Atoll 27, Pearl and Hermes Reef 101, Lisianski Island 77, Laysan Island 113, French Frigate Shoals 117,&#160; Necker Island 38, Nihoa Island 43, and the MHI 58 (NMFS unpublished data). <br/><br/>The earliest information on Monk Seal abundance comes from 1958 (Kenyon and Rice 1959, Rice 1960). However, those data consisted of beach counts only and did not include an estimate of total population size. In order to compare total abundance over time, we have used an estimate for NWHI abundance in 1983 (Gerrodette 1985) at which time there were negligible numbers of seals known to exist in the MHI. This number is compared to the 2011 estimate for total abundance for both the NWHI and MHI. The total abundance estimate for 1983 was 1,520. In 2011, total range-wide abundance was estimated to be 1,209. Over this 28 year period the number of mature individuals declined by 20.4%, from 795 to 632. Extrapolating this decline pattern across two generations (30 years: 1984-2014) gives an estimated overall decline of 21.8%.<br/><br/>Overall, the Monk Seal population is still in decline, but with two distinct trajectories between the populations in the NWHI (4.0% per year decline) and the MHI (6.5% per year increase; Caretta <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is expected that species will continue to decline for at least the next 12 years if trends remain the same. At that point the number of animals in the MHI will surpass that in the NWHI and growth in the MHI will offset losses in the NWHI (NMFS unpublished data).",Decreasing,"Hawaiian Monk Seals occur throughout the Hawaiian Island chain. Their six main reproductive sites are in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) at Kure Atoll, Midway Atoll, Pearl and Hermes Reef, Lisianski Island, Laysan Island, and French Frigate Shoals (National Marine Fisheries Service 2007). While sightings were previously rare in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), Monk Seals are now regularly seen there and births have been documented on all of the major islands (Baker and Johanos 2004). Sightings outside of the main range have occurred at Johnston Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island (Ragen and Lavigne 1999).<br/><br/>Hawaiian Monk Seals are non-migratory, and tend to remain near the atoll where they were born. However, approximately 10% of seals will relocate temporarily or permanently to other sites in the island chain, and long distance wanderers have been recorded.<br/><br/>There are approximately 1,693 km of coastline habitat for Monk Seals in Hawaii (US Census Bureau 2012). However, the terrestrial habitat available for their use in the NWHI is very limited. The total area of emergent land is only about 13.5 km² and only a fraction of that is suitable for use by seals (Ragen and Lavigne 1999).<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence for Hawaiian Monk seals is approximately 1,500,000 km² and the area of occupancy is approximately 293,000 km².<br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"The Hawaiian Monk Seal has been listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act since 1976. That law contains a number of provisions to protect the seals and their critical habitat. They are also covered by a general prohibition against unpermitted taking by the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1973.<br/><br/>Virtually all of the land and waters in the NWHI is included in one or more protected areas (the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands State Marine Refuge, the Kure Atoll State Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, and the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument) where human activities that could effect the seals or their habitats are either prohibited or strictly controlled.<br/><br/>Hawaiian Monk Seals are the focus of one of the most proactive marine mammal recovery programs in the world (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2011). Historically, the primary focus of the species’ recovery program was to increase survival of juvenile and adult female seals in the NWHI. Important recovery efforts include: 1) cleaning up of marine debris and toxic chemicals; 2) minimizing human activities that could disturb seals hauled out on beaches; 3) mitigation of shark predation of young pups through limited shark removals or pup translocations; 4) removal and translocation of adult males to mitigate mortality associated with male aggression towards juveniles and females; and 5) regulating fisheries to reduce the likelihood of direct and indirect interactions. In spite of these efforts the population has continued to decline, however, the efforts have mitigated some of the severity of that decline.&#160; A recent analysis has shown that up to 30% of the current Monk Seal population is alive today due to the small-scale mitigation efforts targeted towards individual seals over the past 30 years (Harting <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/>Efforts to increase juvenile survival are also being expanded using a variety of translocation strategies. Over the past thirty years, numerous Monk Seal translocations have been conducted with a variety of objectives, including reducing shark predation and conspecific male aggression, stopping human–seal interactions, and taking advantage of different demographic patterns between subpopulations to improve survival. (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014).<br/><br/>Management agencies are currently developing a vaccination plan to guard against a disease outbreak that could decimate the population. Two viruses, <em>Morbillivirus</em> and West Nile Virus, have been identified as infectious agents with a high risk to Hawaiian Monk Seals. Marine <em>Morbillivirus</em> strains have been recently identified in Hawaii and it considered only a matter of time before West Nile Virus makes it to Hawaii (Kilpatrick <em>et al</em>. 2004, West <em>et al</em>. 2013). Background surveys conducted on Hawaiian Monk Seals show that they remain naïve (no detectable antibodies) to both viruses. The vaccination program could begin as early as 2015.<br/><br/>In 2014, a privately funded and managed rehabilitation facility was constructed to support recovery efforts.&#160; This Hawaiian Monk Seal hospital will serve to care for seals from across the archipelago that are sick, injured, emaciated, or otherwise in need of rehabilitation.<br/><br/>With the increase of Monk Seals in the main Hawaiian Islands, the recovery program has had to develop a number of strategies to maintain population growth while mitigating human-seal interactions (Lowry et al. 2011).&#160; The program is currently working on strategies to prevent and modify unwanted seal behaviors including fisheries interactions and animals conditioned to interact with people.&#160; A significant component of this work includes community engagement on how to avoid negative wildlife interactions.",Oceanian,,false,false,Global

However, abundance estimates are somewhat dated and have considerable uncertainty around them and therefore, the population trend is unknown.<strong> </strong>Ross Seals depend on sea ice for reproduction and at some time in the future they could be adversely affected by a reduction in sea ice due to continued climate warming. The Ross Seal is a widespread and abundant species that does not qualify for any of the IUCN threatened categories, thus they should be listed as Least Concern<strong>.</strong><br/><em></em>","At maturity, Ross Seals are the smallest of the four Antarctic phocids. Based on a small sample of measured animals, Ross Seal males reach 1.68-2.09 m in length and 129-216 kg and females are slightly larger at 1.96-2.5 m in length and 159-204 kg. It is estimated that pups are about one metre and 16 kg at birth; eight suckling pups examined in November were 109-138 cm in length and 40-75 kg. Age at sexual maturity is thought to be three to four years for females and two to seven years for males (Ray 1981). Adults reach final body size at approximately nine years of age and can live to at least 20 years (Skinner and Klages 1994).<br/><br/>Most pups are born in November, with a peak from early to mid-November (Southwell <em>et al.</em> 2003). Weaning takes place at about one month of age, although little is known of the relationship between mother and pup. Nursing pups have been seen swimming between ice floes so they appear to be aquatic to some degree. Mating is thought to occur in the water, but has not been observed. Although this species has been presumed to be polygynous, genetic studies do not support this hypothesis and indicate a monogamous mating system (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2011). Moulting is believed to occur in January, at which time many Ross Seals appear to fast (Skinner and Klages 1994), and moulting seals can form large aggregations on ice floes. During summer Ross Seals exhibit a diel haulout pattern with most seals hauled out on the ice at midday (Ray 1981, Bengtson and Stewart 1997, Southwell 2003). Satellite tracking suggests that Ross Seals are pelagic foragers, spending months in the open ocean foraging in association with the Antarctic Polar Front&#160; and returning to the pack-ice to breed in October-November (Blix and Nordøy 2007).<br/><br/>Recent work using electronic devices to monitor at-sea behaviour of Ross Seals has revealed that the species dives continuously throughout the day (average of 108 dives per day), frequently reaching depths of 100–300 m, and displays a clear diel pattern in their diving depth. The deepest dive recorded for the species was 792 m, while the longest dives were over 30 minutes in duration (Blix and Nordøy 2007). The diet of Ross Seals is largely unknown, but the limited available data indicate that they eat mostly squid, with lesser amounts of fish and some invertebrates including krill (Ray 1981, Southwell <em>et al.</em> 2012). Skinner and Klages (1994) identified only Antarctic Silverfish (<em>Pleurogramma antarcticum</em>) in 20 animals examined; no other fish were present. Several species of squid were also recorded in this latter study, but many stomachs were empty when the animals were collected in January, suggesting that this species eats little or fasts entirely during the post-breeding moult period.<br/><br/>Killer Whales and Leopard Seals are presumed to be predators of the Ross Seal.","Ross Seals are typically found hauled out in dense consolidated pack ice and can usually only be reached by icebreakers. Small numbers of animals have been collected for commercial purposes, scientific studies and museums, but otherwise interactions with humans have been few. When wandering outside the pack ice zone, Ross Seals could come in contact with commercial fishing operations, but there are no reports of interactions to date.<br/><br/>Ross Seals have antibodies to phocine herpesvirus confirming some exposure, but in the only available study they did not have antibodies to <em>Trichinella</em>, <em>Toxoplasma</em>, or phocine distemper virus (Tryland <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Our very limited knowledge about the species makes it difficult to make any projections about how global climate change might affect the Ross Seal. However, Learmonth <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggest that Ross Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. Siniff <em>et al</em>. (2008) suggest that they will be among the least impacted of the Antarctic seals because they do not feed in sea-ice covered areas. Climate change will affect them when loss&#160;of sufficient areas of consolidated ice habitat used for pupping, resting, and avoidance of predators comes to a critical level. Further, due to their pelagic nature, reductions of sea ice would imply longer travel distances to reach their preferred foraging areas. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rises on Antarctic Ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as seals are largely unknown.","Ross Seals typically haul out in dense consolidated pack ice and are spread over large geographic areas. As these areas can usually only be reached by ice-breaking ships or long-range aircraft, it is difficult to estimate population size and trend with high certainty. Published global population estimates range from 20,000-50,000 (Scheffer 1958) up to 220,000 animals (Gilbert and Erickson 1977). However, early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. Analysis of ship and aerial sighting surveys carried out around the Antarctic Continent between 1968 and 1983 provided an estimate for the global population of Ross Seals in the pelagic pack ice of the Southern Ocean in the order of 130,000 animals (Erickson and Hanson 1990). No indication of the uncertainty around that estimate was given. The most ambitious and coordinated effort to determine abundance of this species to date was the Antarctic Pack-Ice Seal (APIS) project which conducted aerial and shipboard surveys around the continent during 1996-2001. This international programme also included deployment of satellite-linked dive recorders to investigate haulout behaviour. APIS surveys resulted in an estimate of 78,500 (95% CL 39,400-231,200) Ross Seals in the surveyed areas (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). Given the uncertainty in the estimates, only gross changes in Ross Seal population size could be confidently detected from repeated surveys (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2008). New data from genetic studies estimating the effective population size of the species indicate a larger population size for the Ross Seal than that estimated using traditional population size surveys (Curtis <em>et al</em>. 2011), but those methods have not been rigorously tested.",Unknown,"Ross Seals have a circumpolar distribution in Southern Ocean waters surrounding Antarctica. In the summer, they are usually seen in dense consolidated pack ice where they haul out to breed, moult and rest. Satellite tracking suggests that Ross Seals spend several months each year foraging in the open ocean in association with the Antarctic Polar Front (Blix and Nordøy 2007). Vagrants have been reported from many sub-Antarctic islands including the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orknies, and Falkland, Scott, Kerguelen and Heard Islands, as well as from southern Australia (Rice 1998, Thomas 2002).",This species is not used at present.,Terrestrial|Marine,"Ross seals are protected by the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, and are not listed as threatened or endangered on any national Red List.",Antarctic,,false,false,Global
45231087,41671,Pagophilus groenlandicus,Least Concern,,2015,2015-06-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its large population size, and the increasing trend in two of three major population groups, the Harp Seal should continue to be classified by IUCN as Least Concern. However, climate change poses a serious threat to this ice-associated species and Harp Seals should be reassessed within a decade. Reductions in pup production and declines in body condition have recently been documented in the Northeast Atlantic breeding groups that are thought to be due to environmental change linked to warmer water and less sea ice.","Harp Seals are medium-sized phocids. Adult males and females are similar in size, about 1.8 m long and weighing about 130 kg. Females reach sexual maturity between four and eight years of age (e.g., Frie <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003), and this has varied considerably over the last century, in part as a consequence of population size that has been largely determined by harvest levels and food availability. Males probably do not participate in breeding until they are somewhat older, though they reach physiological maturity around the same time as females. <br/><br/>Birthing takes place in vast herds from late February to April. There is some variation across the range in the precise timing but herds are highly synchronized (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Pups are born on the open, free-floating, pack ice and nursed for 12 days, during which time they gain weight at about 2.2 kg per day (Kovacs and Lavigne 1985, Kovacs 1987, Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1991, Lydersen and Kovacs 1996). To minimize energy expenditure, most pups are sedentary for the first month; some are so immobile that they melt into the ice beneath them, forming ice “cradles” (Kovacs 1987). Pups are referred to as “whitecoats” because they are born with an insulating coat of white lanugo. Lactating females spend up to 85% of their time in the water, depending on the weather (Lydersen and Kovacs 1993). Towards the end of lactation, females come into oestrus and mate (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Weaned pups remain on the ice for up to six weeks, losing up to 50% of their weight before entering the water to feed. During this post-weaning fast they complete moulting of the lanugo. After this coat is shed, the black and silver-gray pelage is exposed and the juveniles are known as “beaters” until they are about a year old. <br/><br/>Gestation lasts about 11.5 months, including a three to four month period of delayed implantation (Stewart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1989). The maximum life span of a Harp Seal is approximately 30 years; most animals that reach sexual maturity live to over 20 years. Both males and females are sexually active until the ends of their lives, showing no reproductive senescence (Ronald and Healey 1981). <br/><br/>Harp Seals older than pups undergo a moult in the post-breeding months, from early April to early May (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Harp Seals are highly migratory, and after breeding Canadian Seals follow the pack ice up the coast of Labrador, with small numbers going into Hudson Bay and around Baffin Island, and the rest travelling up both sides of Davis Strait. The Jan Mayen and White Sea groups migrate northward and mix in the Barents Sea (Folkow <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). The Canadian Seals also spend the summer months in the Arctic; their round-trip migration is over 5,000 km long (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). They begin the return trip to their breeding grounds (either the Gulf or the Front) in late autumn. <br/><br/>Harp Seals consume a wide range of prey that varies along their migration routes. Their recorded diet includes 67 species of fish and 70 species of invertebrates (Lavigne 2002). Pups and juveniles take a lot of invertebrate prey, especially Euphausiids (<em>Thyanoessa </em>spp.) and pelagic Amphipods (<em>Parathemisto </em>spp.; Haug <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Nilssen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Adults in Greenland eat pelagic crustaceans, and fish such as Capelin (<em>Mallotus villosus</em>), Sandeel (<em>Ammodytes</em> sp.), Polar Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>) and Arctic Cod (<em>Arctogadus glacialis</em>). Commercial species such as Atlantic Cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>) appear to be of minor importance in the diet (Kapel 2000), largely because Harp Seals of all ages eat relatively small prey and tend to specialize somewhat on polar species such as Polar Cod and Capelin (Lindstrom <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). In the Barents Sea, Harp Seals eat Amphipods, Shrimps and small fish including Polar Cod, Sculpin (<em>Cottidae</em>), Snailfish (<em>Liparidae</em>) and Capelin (Nilssen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995); but they show a clear preference for large Polar Cod (Wathne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Lindstrom <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The Seals off Newfoundland eat Capelin and Arctic Cod, and off Labrador they eat Arctic Cod and Atlantic Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>). In the Gulf of St Lawrence, the Seals consume Capelin, Herring, Atlantic Cod, Arctic Cod and Redfish (<em>Sebastes </em>sp.; Lawson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). Harp Seals feed heavily in winter and summer and less in spring and autumn. They are a highly social species that travels and forages in groups, yet they maintain a stratification of diet according to age class and depth of the feeding dives. <br/><br/>Harp Seals are relatively shallow divers. Animals satellite-tagged at Jan Mayen stayed close to the edge of the pack ice during the spring moult, usually diving to less than 100 m, but by July tagged Seals in the Barents Sea dove to 400 m. Overall, the deepest dives occurred during the day in winter (Folkow <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004).<br/><br/>Natural predators of Harp Seals include Polar Bears, Killer Whales and Greenland Sharks (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). In Svalbard, 13% of Polar Bear prey is comprised of Harp Seals (Derocher <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002).","As noted earlier, Harp Seals have been harvested for thousands of years but currently the population is large and the number of animals harvested is declining.<br/><br/>Reduced availability of potential prey, especially Polar Cod, Capelin and Herring, is a threat to Harp Seals. Several Harp Seal “invasions” took place in recent decades along the north coast of Norway. By-catch mortality in nets during those events was estimated to be as high as 100,000 animals in 1987 and 21,474 in 1988 (Haug <em>et al.</em> 1991). The reason for these emigrations out of their normal range within the Barents and Greenland Seas seems to have been a collapse of Herring and Capelin stocks due to a combination of overfishing and shifting oceanographic conditions (low temperatures and salinity, and extensive ice cover; Haug <em>et al.</em> 1991, Woodley and Lavigne 1991). More recently, declining Krill abundance has been correlated with declines in both pup production and body condition of Harp Seals in the Barents Sea region, which are likely related to reductions in sea ice in this area (Øigård <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>A small tourist industry that visits the whelping patches in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is not thought to pose any risk to the Seals; it uses a rotational mode of operation such that individual Seals are not visited repeatedly (Kovacs and Innes 1990). <br/><br/>Oil spills in the Northwest Atlantic off the east coast of Canada remain a threat to Seals. There is a concern about the impacts of tanker traffic, particularly in places like Lancaster Sound in the eastern Canadian Arctic, which is an important Harp Seal summering area (Reijinders <em>et al.</em> 1993). The discharge from a ruptured tank on the shore of New Brunswick, Canada in March–April 1969 led to 10,000 to 15,000 Seals being heavily coated with oil. The high number of dead pups washing ashore after this event was evidence of the lethal effects of the oil (St. Aubin 1990). Oil development in the Barents Sea is ongoing and poses a future threat to Harp Seals in the White Sea and West Ice stocks. <br/><br/>Harp Seals have been found to carry significant loads of contaminants including metals, DDT and PCBs (Ronald <em>et al.</em> 1984ab). Organochlorines are still present in their blood, despite DDT levels in the environment (and PCBs to a lesser extent) declining from the early 1970s to the 1980s (Addison <em>et al.</em> 1984) and further in the 1990s and 2000s (Muir and de Wit 2010). <br/><br/>Phocine distemper virus (PDV) was first found in Harp Seals from the West Ice off Jan Mayen in 1987 and 1989. It is widespread in Harp Seals, but only shows up as antibodies; it is not known if there are significant health effects or mortality from PDV infection in this species (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 1993, Duignan <em>et al.</em> 1997). Harp Seals might have been the carriers responsible for the Harbour Seal PDV epidemic in Europe in 1988 (Markussen and Have 1992). PDV also appeared Harp Seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1991, but not in epidemic proportions (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 1993). <br/><br/>Global climate warming is of notable concern for this species. There have already been major reductions in the extent and seasonal duration of sea ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008,&#160;Laidre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Pinnipeds such as the Harp Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting and resting are likely to be heavily impacted by future changes in their sea ice habitats (Johnston <em>et al.</em> 2005, Friedlaender <em>et al.</em> 2007, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011,&#160;Kovacs&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). The high variability in pup production numbers in Canada, as well as the condition declines in the Northeast Atlantic, are thought to be linked to changing oceanographic and sea ice conditions. The degree of plasticity Harp Seals might show with respect to temporal or spatial shifts in breeding times and areas is not known.","The Harp Seal is the most abundant pinniped species in the northern hemisphere. Globally this species numbers close to nine million animals with an annual pup production for all breeding sites combined of approximately 1.2 million (ICES 2013, Hammill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The Northwest Atlantic stock is estimated to number close to 7.5 million (Hammill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). This stock is thought to be relatively stable, showing little change between the 2004 and 2012 surveys, although pup production has become highly variable with extremely high pup mortality in some recent years. This is a marked recovery from an estimated low of around 1.8 million in the early 1970s, which was a result of overharvesting (Sergeant 1976). Over the period of recovery, catch levels have been increased such that they likely approached potential biological removal levels by the late 1990s (see Johnston <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2000). The current quota of 400,000 is likely not sustainable, but this is not a concern because the combined Greenlandic and Canadian harvest average only about half of this number. <br/><br/>The breeding group in the West Ice near Jan Mayen (often referred to as the Greenland Sea population) was estimated to be 296,000 in 1994; this population increased to approximately 348,000 by 2003 and in 2013 was estimated to be 627,000 (ICES 2013, Øigård <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The quota is approximately 20,000 animals, but an average take in the hunt in recent years is about 6,000 (ICES 2013). <br/><br/>The White Sea breeding group was estimated to be 1.8 million animals when surveyed in 2000 (Potelov <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003). An estimate produced in 2013 using data from several pup counts done between 1998 and 2010 suggested that the population had dropped to 1.4 million, most likely due to reduced pup production (ICES 2013). Hunting in recent years in the White Sea has been extremely limited (annual takes of zero to 200 animals); harvesting of pups less than one year of age was banned in Russia in 2009. Norwegian harvests of this population during summer when they are in the Barents Sea have also been very small in recent years, with no hunt at all in 2013 (ICES 2013).<br/><br/>A new Harp Seal whelping patch was found near South Greenland in 2007 (Rosing-Asvid 2008). The source of these animals and the inter-annual stability of this group are not known. This finding was particularly interesting in light of the fact that the Greenlandic harvest of this species has increased from about 1,500 per year in the 1970s up to approximately 100,000 in the year 2000, and has remained at an average of around 85,000 since then (DFO 2012).",Increasing,"Harp Seals are widespread in the North Atlantic and the adjacent Arctic Ocean and shelf seas. Their range extends from a western extreme in northern Hudson Bay and the Foxe Basin, Baffin Island and the Davis Strait, eastward through the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Newfoundland region in the western North Atlantic, along the southwest and south coasts of Greenland, continuing east to Iceland and from there to northern Norway and the White, Barents and Kara Seas. The northern limit in the eastern North Atlantic is at least to Franz Joseph Land and Svalbard; in some years Harp Seals may range northward to between 82° and 85° north, depending on ice conditions (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Rice 1998, Lavigne 2002). <br/><br/>The southern limit of Harp Seal distribution off North America shifts southeast in some years to the Gulf of Maine and Sable Island where large numbers of animals have been recorded at times since the mid-1990s (Lacoste and Stenson 2000, Harris <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Lucas and Daoust 2002). Harp Seals often occur as vagrants outside this range, south to Virginia in the United States (Scheffer 1958, Rice 1998). Similarly in Europe, Harp Seals occasionally reach the United Kingdom (Ronald and Healy 1981), the Faroe Islands, Denmark, Germany, France and even Spain (van Bree 1997, Bloch <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000).<br/><br/>Prehistorically, Harp Seals occurred in the Baltic Sea. Genetic drift, interspecific completion and overhunting by humans are all factors that are likely to have contributed to their extinction in that region (Stora and Ericson 2004).","Harp Seals have been harvested for thousands of years by indigenous peoples of the Atlantic Arctic, including coastal Northern Europeans (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Basques whalers began taking Harp Seals in the 1500s. By the mid-1600s, French settlers developed land-based netting techniques on the St. Lawrence River. French-Canadians exported 500 tons of oil per year by the mid-1700s, obtained from an estimated take of 6,000 Harp Seals per year. In Newfoundland, English settlers hunted Harp Seals on a larger scale that accounted for an estimated average take of 7,000-12,800 Seals per year for most of the 1700s. By the 1800s, schooner-based sealing developed and the number of Seals harvested rose dramatically; from 1803-1816 the average annual take was 117,000. The peak of sealing in the Northwest Atlantic occurred between 1818 and 1862, when 500,000 Seals were harvested in many years, with maximum yearly takes between 640,000 and 740,000. During that time, it is estimated that 18.3 million Harp Seals, mostly whitecoats, were killed for oil. The records show somewhat lower figures for the Northeast Atlantic. At Jan Mayen, the catch began falling in the late 1850s; the drop in catch was likely attributable to over-harvesting. From 1860 to 1900, an estimated 12.8 million Seals were harvested from the West Ice.<br/><br/>During the 20th century Harp Seals became more valued for their pelts than their oil. In 1917, 143,000 Seals were taken. The catch dropped for a time, then escalated in the 1950s, when it averaged 312,000 Seals per year. In 1960, Canada became concerned about the large numbers of adults being killed, so it placed limits on the length of the hunting season. During the 1960s, an average of 284,000 Seals were taken per year from the Northwest Atlantic stock. In the mid 1960s, adult females became protected on the breeding grounds, and Norway was excluded from sealing in Canadian waters. In 1971 a quota management program was established; from 1970 to 1987 quotas varied from 127,000 per year to 245,000 per year, but the actual harvest was often much lower than the quota (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). In 1983, the European Economic Community imposed an import ban on all whitecoat products and the average annual harvest in Canadian waters fell to 52,000 Seals from 1983-1995. By 1987, Canada banned the killing of whitecoats and the focus of the hunt switched to beaters (post-weaning to 13 months of age; DFO 2006a). From 1999-2003, the estimated annual mortality of Harp Seals in the Northwest Atlantic was 453,962, broken down into an average of 232,915 taken in the commercial harvest by Canada, 83,000 taken from 1999-2002 in Greenland, and approximately 5,000 taken in the Canadian High Arctic, plus a by-catch of close to 20,000 in the Newfoundland Lumpfish fishery, plus an average annual struck and loss rate of 119,430 from all harvests (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>The Canadian harvest increased with the combined three-year quota (“Total Allowable Catch”) introduced for the period 2003-2005 set at 975,000 (DFO 2005). Given the age structure of the current hunt, this quota would not be sustainable (see Johnston <em>et al.</em> 2000). The current quota is 400,000, but the number taken in the hunt is much less (see above). In addition to Canada’s commercial harvest, some Harp Seals are taken in subsistence hunts in Labrador, Newfoundland, northern Quebec and in Nunavut, as well as in Greenland. In Canada, aboriginal peoples and non-aboriginal coastal residents who reside north of latitude 53 degrees can hunt Seals for subsistence purposes without a permit (DFO 2006b).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, Norway established a commercial hunt in 1846, which peaked in the 1870s-1880s when annual catches ranged from 50,000 to 120,000 animals. In the 20th century, annual harvests increased to an average of more than 100,000 per year, with the maximum in the 1920s and 1930s when the catches were 200,000-300,000 per year. In 1989, Norway banned the killing of whitecoats (N-RFC 2005) and harvests in the last few decades have been small compared to historical numbers. Russia also banned the killing of white-coats in 2009 and the White Sea hunt has been almost negligible since that time.<br/><br/>The numbers of Harp Seals struck-and-lost in the both the current commercial hunts (which focus largely on one plus animals) and in subsistence hunting is high, and most harvest estimates do not account for this additional mortality (see Lavigne 1999). The struck and loss rate for Harp Seals in Greenland could be as high as 50% (Sjare and Stenson 2002).",Marine,"<p>Canada has in place sealing regulations pursuant to the 1993 Marine Mammal Regulations that require annual quotas, referred to as “Total Allowable Catches” hunting licenses, and official observers of the commercial Harp Seal hunt (DFO 2005). In the northeast Atlantic, quotas for sealing are based on recommendations made by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). Russia is responsible for managing Harp Seals in the southeast part of the Barents Sea, while Norway is responsible for managing stocks in the Greenland Sea near Jan Mayen (N-RFC 2005, NMFCA 2006). However, these harvest control mechanisms are no longer particularly influential given the declining interest in Seal harvesting by commercial operators.</p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231738,41676,Pusa sibirica,Least Concern,,2016,2015-07-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The current population size of the Baikal Seal is thought to be at the level of the Lake Baikal ecosystem’s carrying capacity (80,000–100,000 individuals). If global warming continues the quality of habitat of the species will decline dramatically which may cause the population to decline. However, Baikal Seals have survived periods of quite extreme warming in the past and the population undergoes periodic monitoring such that declines would be detected rapidly should they occur. Thus, at the current time the Baikal Seal is listed as Least Concern.","Baikal Seals are an exclusively freshwater species, and are thought to derive from the marine ancestor of the <em>Pusa </em>genus. It is hypothesized they colonized Lake Baikal from the Arctic via rivers and glacial dam lakes present in northern Siberia 300,000-400,000 years ago (McLaren 1960, Pastukhov 1969a, Koyama <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997, Sasaki <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Palo and Väinöla 2006). However, this is at odds with the current DNA sequence based estimate of around 2 million years for the divergence of the <em>Pusa </em>genus. This suggest a complex history of vicariance with the group, but the underlying paleogeography remains to be determined (Palo and Väinöla 2006, Fulton and Strobeck 2010, Nyakatura and Bininda-Emonds 2012).<br/><br/>Baikal Seals are among the smallest of the pinnipeds, with adults reaching 1.1-1.4 m and weights of 50-130 kg. Pups are born at 3-3.5 kg and approximately 70 cm (Pastukhov 1971, Thomas <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982). Adult males at physical maturity are slightly larger than adult females of the same age. Final body size is reached at approximately 15 years of age (Amano <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Males reach sexual maturity at 7-10 years of age (Pastukhov 1993). Female Baikal Seals become sexually mature between 3-7 years and some have their first pup by age 4, most by 5-6 years, with some not pupping until they are 9 years old (Pastukhov 1969b, Thomas <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982). Baikal Seals continue to produce pups until they are 43-45 years old and may have the greatest longevity of any pinniped species. Approximately 10% of the population is older than 20 years of age, with records of adult females reaching 56 years of age and adult males 52 years of age (Pastukhov 1990, 1993).<br/><br/>The annual cycle of the Baikal Seal is driven by ice more than food (Ivanov 1938). In mid-October, the Seals begin to move towards bays, lagoons and river deltas, mostly along the eastern shore where ice forms and expands out into the lake. They spend January to May spread throughout the lake, usually singly, in deep water in the central basins. Adults stay primarily in the north while immature Seals are more often found in the southern part of Lake Baikal. Pups are born from late February to early April, with peak numbers born in mid March (Pastukhov 1990). Pupping takes place on the ice in dens that females actively build and maintain. During the pupping season, females are widely spread out on the ice. Their surface home ranges, including the den and breathing holes, are a minimum of 0.26 km² and do not overlap with other females (Ivanov 1938, Elagin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1990, Pastukhov 1993, Martinkova <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). Pups do not usually enter the water for their first 2-3 weeks.<br/><br/>Most pups are weaned in 2-2.5 months, although some are believed to be nursed for 3-3.5 months (Pastukhov 1971). Females move pups and construct new dens if the dens become damaged; this may be necessary to protect small pups from predators. Mating is believed to take place in April, approximately one month after the female gives birth (Pastukhov 1993). Although births take place throughout the lake, more pups (51%) are born in the northern third of the lake, as compared to the central third (31%) or the southern third (17%) (Pastukhov 1971, Thomas <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982, Petrov <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997).<br/><br/>The ice breaks up in May and June, a time when Baikal Seals undergo their annual moult. More than half of the population moves to the remaining ice in the northern and northeastern parts of Lake Baikal, forming aggregations that can be as large as 1,000-3,000 animals. Moulting takes place during an approximately month-long period, during which Baikal Seals feed very little (Pastukhov 1993). Many Baikal Seals congregate in the southeastern part of the lake in the ice-free season to haul-out on rocky islands and shorelines between feeding excursions (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1993, Petrov <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The eastern side of the lake is preferred because it has less human disturbance and greater biological productivity (Pastukhov 1993). It is not known whether Baikal Seals have a regular annual movement pattern. Satellite-tagging of four juvenile Seals revealed that they moved throughout the lake in the course of a year, traveling from 400 to 1,600 km between September through May. Although it may not be typical of adult Seals, the pattern of frequent diving and movement demonstrates that juveniles move considerable distances and spend little time hauled-out during the fall and winter months. Two of the four Seals tagged in autumn returned to their tagging sites the following spring after wandering widely throughout the lake (Stewart <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996). Diving patterns are not well documented; tagged juvenile Baikal Seals dived most frequently to between 10 and 50 m, with some dives exceeding 300 m. The mean depth in Lake Baikal is 758 m (Kutyrev <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Dive depths were shallower at night, consistent with the vertical movements of their preferred prey fish, the two species of Golomyankas (<em>Comeophorus </em>spp.) that ascend from depths of 100 m or more during the day to forage at 10-25 m at night. Dive durations were generally 2-4 minutes, with 14-30% of dives lasting 6-10 minutes. The longest recorded dives exceeded 40 minutes and occurred during the winter in areas of heavy ice cover (Stewart <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996). Baikal Seals feed on fish and 29 species have been recorded in their diet. Along with the two species of Golomyankas mentioned above, they also consume two species of Sculpin (<em>Cottocomephorus </em>spp.) as primary prey. Diversity of fish species consumed is highest in the summer with 17 species eaten, declining to 8 species in fall, and only 4 principal species eaten in winter. Juveniles may also consume amphipods during winter (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1967, Gurova and Pastukhov 1974, Thomas <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982).","Major rivers flowing into Lake Baikal pass through regions of industrial activity and there are concerns over contamination from persistent organic pollutants such as polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs), dioxins, flame retardants and other related chemicals (Mamontov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). Exposure to such bioaccumulative chemicals has potential to impair fertility and immunocompetence (De Swart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995, Kannan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). Numerous studies have assessed contaminant levels in Baikal Seals from the 1990s to present (e.g., Kucklick <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994; Nakata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995, 1997; Tarasova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997; Tanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003; Tsydenova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, 2004; Iwata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004; Ishibashi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008; Imaeda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). These show complex and varying temporal trends, with levels of DDTs and non-ortho PCBs declining through the 1990s to mid-2000s, while others such as mono-ortho PCBs showed no decline and perflourochemicals increased (Tanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Tsydenova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004, Ishibashi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Imaeda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). This variation reflects differences in environmental half-life and rates of inflow of chemicals stemming from changes in industrial usage patterns.<br/><br/>Overall contaminant burdens at the population level for Baikal Seals are lower than pinniped species from areas of Europe and North America with high industrial contamination, but greater than Seals from ‘cleaner’ Arctic environments, although some individual animals have been found to have high burdens. The most recent study (Imaeda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009) found that 40% of Seals in the tested sample from 2005 had TEQ (Toxic Equivalent – a measure for summarising relative toxicity of complex contaminant mixtures) levels above a threshold associated with immune suppressive effects identified in Harbour Seals (De Swart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). Organochlorine accumulation is age related, so older adult males are the most likely component of the population to be above these thresholds (Iwata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). However, demonstrating effects of contaminants in the wild is difficult, and there is currently no direct evidence of contaminant burdens affecting disease susceptibility or influencing population demography in Baikal Seals. Recent studies on liver gene expression profiles in Baikal Seals suggest changes to liver metabolism consistent with toxicity in relation to environmental contaminant exposure, but the overall health significance is not clear (Hirakawa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Industrial development is increasing around the Baikal watershed so it is important that monitoring of contaminant exposure in Baikal Seals is continued in the future (Reijnders <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993, Nakata <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Mamontov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Grachev 2002, Imaeda <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>An outbreak of a canine distemper virus killed approximately 6,500 Baikal Seals in 1987-1988 (Grachev <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1989, Pronin and Kabanov 1992, Belykov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997), and is believed to have been transmitted to Seals from a terrestrial source, probably feral or domestic Dogs (Barrett <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992). Recent surveys show that the virus is still circulating in the population, although without causing further mass mortalities to date (Mamaev <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Butina <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, 2010). However, future epizootics remain possible, and it is recommended that surveillance of CDV strains circulating in the population be continued (Butina <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Natural predation does not appear to be a significant source of mortality for Baikal Seals, with only Brown Bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) reported as predators (Pastukhov 1993).<br/><br/>As a landlocked ice-breeding species, Baikal Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change since they cannot move to alternative habitats (Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012). Future climate warming has the potential to reduce the extent and duration of ice-habitat Baikal Seals rely on for breeding, and to also affect Baikal food webs (Mackay <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Hampton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Moore <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009), both of which could drive population declines. The potential effects of changes in winter ice on Baikal Seal population demography remain to be assessed in detail, but the species has persisted through previous episodes of climate variation.","Following hunting in the early 20th Century, the Baikal Seal population increased from the 1970s through the early 1990s to over 100,000 individuals (Petrov <em>et al</em>. 1997; Petrov 2002, 2003). Population abundance&#160;subsequently&#160;declined slightly, probably due to commercial harvesting and outbreaks of canine distemper virus.&#160;Reports of current&#160;abundance vary between the different studies carried out since 2002, with estimates ranging&#160;between 82,500 and 115,000 individuals including pups (Petrov 2002, 2003, 2006; Ministry of Natural Resources 2013). The most recently reported figures derive from surveys carried out by the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources (2013), and report an increase from 97,400 individuals in 2012 to 108,200 in 2013, with an estimated pup production of 23,600, although the methodological details of this survey are not available. The population estimates may be subject to survey errors of about 30% (Petrov <em>et al</em>. 1997), and incomplete or inadequate coverage of the breeding range throughout the lake makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions about population demography. Therefore, short term abundance trends based on count data may merely reflect survey error variations. Currently Baikal Seals are considered to be at the carrying capacity level of the Baikal Lake ecosystem.",Stable,"Lake Baikal is located in southern Siberia, Russia, near the Mongolian border. The lake is 636 km long and at its maximum 79.5 km wide (Kutyrev <em>et al</em>. 2006). Baikal Seals are basically confined to Lake Baikal (31,570 km²), though they do travel short distances into rivers that flow into and out of the lake. An exception is one animal that was found 400 km downstream in the Angara River, the only river that flows out of the lake (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1993, Rice 1998).","Subsistence hunting of the Baikal Seal extends back at least 9,000 years to the Neolithic period (Khlobystin 1963, Weber <em>et al.</em> 1993, Nomokonova <em>et al.</em> 2015). Commercial hunting began in the second half of the 18th century (Ivanov 1938, Pastukhov 1993), becoming a regular industry in the early in the 20th century. Annual harvests fluctuated between 2,000 and 9,000 Seals in the early 20th century, then from under 1,000 to nearly 6,500 in the 1930s (Svatosh 1923, 1925; Ivanov 1938). Harvests from 1977 to 1983 were consistently high. The official harvest quota and catch level was about 6,000, plus an estimated “unofficial hunting” level of up to 3,600 Seals (Pastukhov 1993). In the late 1980s and early 1990s the official statistics were not reliable and did not reflect the actual harvest level. Estimates vary between 4,000 and 8,000 animals (Petrov <em>et al.</em> 1997) killed annually. Harvesting continues today. During 2004-2006 about 2,000 Seals were reported killed in annual official statistics with estimations of an additional “uncounted” harvest of between 1,500 and 4,000 animals annually (Petrov 2007). The “uncounted” harvest includes wounded or drowned animals, incidental catch in fishing gear, and poaching. More recently, total hunting including poaching was estimated at between 2,300-2,800 annually for 2012 and 2013 (Ministry of Natural Resources 2013). A quota of 2,500 was set for the official hunt in 2013-2014, with a Potential Biological Removal level of 5,000 individuals. There are some calls to expand hunting, with skins, meat, and blubber as the products being utilized.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Numerous measures, such as establishing commercial harvest quotas, changing methods and equipment used for harvesting Seals, and changing the timing of the hunt and the age class of Seal that can be taken, have all been used during the history of the commercial harvest to regulate the catch (Svatosh 1923, 1925; Ivanov 1938; Pastukhov 1993; Petrov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997). Recent recommendations for the protection and conservation of the Baikal Seal include several measures to reduce the impact of poaching by local residents (including increased penalties for illegal hunting) and mandatory reporting of incidental catch in fishing gear (Pastukhov 1993). There are many protected areas and reserves throughout Lake Baikal.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
46178068,22780,Urocyon cinereoargenteus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Grey Fox is widespread in forest, woodland, brushland, shrubland, and rocky habitats in temperate, semi-arid and tropical regions of North America, and in northernmost montane regions of South America. Grey Fox are also increasingly common in urban environments. Available evidence suggests that Grey Fox numbers are probably stable across their range, and not subject to any range-wide threats causing marked declines in the overall population size despite being trapped for their pelts in many parts of their range. Available evidence suggests they are frequently incidentally captured when other more highly sought furbearers (e.g., Bobcat) are targeted.","In eastern North America, the Grey Fox is most closely associated with deciduous/southern pine forests interspersed with some old fields and scrubby woodlands (Hall 1981). In western North America, it is commonly found in mixed agricultural/woodland/chaparral/riparian landscapes and shrub habitats. The species occupies forested areas and thick brush habitats in Central America and forested montane habitats in South America (Eisenberg 1989). Grey Foxes occur in semi-arid areas of the south-western USA and northern Mexico where cover is sufficient. They appear to do well both within and on the margins of some urban areas (Harrison 1997, Castellanos <em>et al</em>. 2008).","There are no major range-wide threats to the species, but extreme habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation may be problematic in regions where human habitation is increasing rapidly and habitat is converted for agricultural, industrial, and urban uses. However, they are overall relatively adaptable and have become increasingly common even in urban environments. Grey foxes have been involved in some large die-offs due to canine distemper virus in parts of their range, and may also be affected by canine parvovirus and rabies.","The species is generally common, but appears to be restricted to locally dense habitats where it is not excluded by sympatric Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>) and Bobcats (<em>Lynx rufus</em>) (Farias 2000b).",Stable,"The Grey Fox ranges widely from the southern edge of central and eastern Canada, and Oregon, Nevada, Utah and Colorado in the United States south to northern Venezuela and Colombia; and from the Pacific coast of the United States to the Atlantic and Caribbean oceans. The species is not found in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States, or in the Caribbean watersheds of Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and western Panama (Fritzell and Haroldson 1982, Fuller and Cypher 2004). They have expanded their range in recent decades into habitats and areas either formerly unoccupied or from which they were extirpated.","Because of its relatively lower fur quality compared with other species, commercial use of the Grey Fox is somewhat limited. However, 90,604 skins were recorded taken in the United States during the 1991 and 1992 season (Linscombe 1994). In Mexico, Grey Foxes are frequently sold illegally as pets (Fuller and Cypher 2004).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Not listed in the CITES Appendices.

Basic ecological and demographic information is needed for each of the major habitats occupied by Grey Foxes, and there remains limited information available on the impacts of disease (such as canine distemper and canine parvovirus) in most parts of the range, although ongoing work in north-western Mexico will provide new and important information (R. List pers. comm. 2015). Also, additional research on the response of Grey Foxes to human-altered landscapes (e.g., urban environments) is needed.

46363646,2891,Bos gaurus,Vulnerable,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2016,2016-05-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Gaur qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion A (VU A2cd+3cd+4cd). The population&#160;decline in parts of its range especially Indochina and Malaysia,&#160;perhaps also Myanmar and China, is likely to be well over 70% over the last&#160;three generations (generation length estimated at 8-10 years), whereas in India&#160;and Nepal the overall decline rate is considerably lower. This reflects that in&#160;the various reasonably well-protected areas, and a small number of animals in some non-protected areas where they are protected for cultural reasons, population trends are stable, and in a few areas which have been neglected but are the focus of improved&#160;protection, populations are rebuilding. Karanth <em>et al.</em> (2010) estimated average local extinction rates of Gaur distribution at 60% over past 50 years in India with the rates varying from 7% from reasonably protected habitats to a high of 98% from unprotected habitats. The global distribution of the Gaur has reduced by over 80% in past 100 years and Gaur is now mostly limited to habitats within protected areas (Groves and Grubb 2011). Weighting these by population size gives&#160;an overall decline of at least 30% over the last three generations. Similar&#160;reductions are projected, largely because the causative factors (especially wild&#160;meat hunting and hunting for the trade in horns in Southeast Asia, habitat loss and hunting for meat in South Asia) are still&#160;operative. Although the proportion of the global population which is in&#160;relatively well protected habitats in India is increasing, and thus the averaged global&#160;decline rate ought to decrease, an ongoing decline of 30% (in the next three generations) or more is adjudged likely. The recent history in Malaysia proves&#160;that directed Gaur poaching can induce rapid declines in regions previously&#160;judged relatively safe. Poaching in Malaysia is undertaken by international&#160;gangs and it is likely that once returns in Malaysia drop they will move to&#160;other countries, though there is no evidence for this yet; the patterns in other high-value species in more advanced&#160;declines (e.g. southeast Asian otters) indicate that incursion even to southern&#160;India is likely. The species could potentially qualify for Vulnerable under criterion C, although there are not enough quantitative data available.","The Gaur occurs from sea level up to at least 2,800 m asl (Wood 1937, Wharton 1968, Choudhury 2002). Despite the many reports that call it an animal of hill-country, low-lying areas seem to comprise optimal habitat (Choudhury 2002): in Conry’s (1989) study area, elevations ranged from 46 to 1,079 m asl but the three radio-tracked Gaur only used areas below 381 m. Elevations below 61 m were used most intensively and all three animals selected these low-lying areas; elevations above 61 m were selected against or used in proportion to availability (Conry 1989). Similarly, in the Tenasserim-Dawna mountains, Thailand, signs of Gaur were more abundant in the lowlands than in the hills, noting that this was the opposite of the patterns that would be predicted if hunting (itself concentrated heavily in the lowlands) was the chief determinant of population densities, although solitary animals were found mainly in the hills (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2008). Schaller (1967) compared vegetation maps of India with the (mid-20th century) distribution of Gaur and concluded that the species was largely confined to evergreen, semi-evergreen, and moist deciduous forest but it also occurred in dry deciduous forest areas at the periphery of its range. He considered Gaur habitat to be ""characterized by (1) large, relatively undisturbed forest tracts, (2) hilly terrain below an altitude of 5,000 to 6,000 ft (1,500-1,800 m asl), (3) availability of water, and (4) an abundance of forage in the form of coarse grasses (including bamboo), shrubs, and trees"". However, He cautioned that the apparent preference of Gaur for hilly terrain may be partly due to the earlier conversion of most of the plains and other low lying areas to croplands and pastures. Kumar (2010) investigated factors influencing spatial distribution of Gaur abundance in Nagarahole-Bandipur reserves and observed that the Gaur abundance patterns were primarily determined by protection effectiveness, local levels of human disturbance and undulating terrain. He also observed that these ecological and anthropogenic factors induced variation in local abundance from less than 1 per km² to about 50 animals per km² (Kumar 2010). Similarly, Wharton (1968) concluded that Gaur appeared to avoid evergreen rainforest, ""preferring foothill tracts of sub-humid or deciduous forest adjacent to savannah forest, glades or other open terrain affected by man and fire thus co-existing with and exploiting low human populations in hill zones with moderate to heavy rainfall"". Throughout the range of Gaur, habitat destruction and human presence is usually higher in lowlands than in hills, meaning that differential human pressures may have caused the apparent preference of Gaur for hills. Gaur occurs in many forest types in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia including truly evergreen and montane forest, but populations in closed canopy forests especially those at higher elevations might naturally be at much lower densities than those in lowland areas with a mosaic of open and closed forest types, and in closed canopy forests areas the species appears to frequent grassy openings (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Greiser Johns 2000, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). Although no significant difference was found in overall Gaur densities in moist compared with dry deciduous forests in Nagarahole, India (Karanth and Sunquist 1992), local variation in Gaur densities ranged between less than 1 per km² to more than 45 per km² in Nagarahole and Bandipur reserves due to variation in local habitat factors conducive for Gaurs (Kumar 2010). Steinmetz et al. (in prep.) considered that Gaur herds in an expanding population were consistently concentrated in mixed deciduous forest rather than semi-evergreen forest, although the total area of study, that was safe from poaching, was only 20 km². <br/><br/>Gaur can persist in fragmented areas with some habitat disturbance and hunting, including in landscapes dominated by plantations (such as on parts of the Valparai plateau, south India), but in Southeast Asia it has been too heavily hunted in such areas to survive in them. Gaur can better tolerate rugged terrain and denser forest than other wild and domestic cattle, provided that there are adequate water sources (Kumar 2010, Smith and Xie Yan 2008). In Thailand it uses former cultivation amid forest, and populations in such areas can recover well if not hunted (Anak Pattanavipool pers. comm. 2006, R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2006). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Gaur only in those coffee areas within 1 km of the Sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Gaur both grazes and browses, reportedly eating mostly young green grasses but also leaves, fruit, twigs, and bark of various woody species, as well as coarse dry grasses, and bamboo. It seems able to maintain good condition on relatively low quality feed. At least 180-190 species of plants have been recorded in the diet (Kumar 2010). More information is given about Gaur’s diet in Dunbar Brander (1923), Hubback (1937), Schaller (1967), Wharton (1968), Krishnan (1972), Khan (1973), Conry (1981), Ebil Yusof (1982), Ramachandran <em>et al</em>. (1986), Prayurasiddhi and Smith (1993) and Sankar <em>et </em>al. (2000). Captive Gaur are reported to eat about 20 kg of green fodder per day (Ramachandran et al. 1986). During the cool season (November-February) the Gaur that Schaller (1967) studied in central India ate various herbs, large quantities of the leaves and seeds of bamboo, various other grasses, and the leaves of a number of tree species; but by the beginning of the hot season (March-June) coarse dry and semi-dry grasses made up the bulk of their diet, averaging 85% by volume (range 66-100%; four rumen samples), with browse only making up about 10%. Gaur also feeds on crops including corn, cassava, and young rubber trees, sometimes causing great damage (Wharton 1968, National Research Council 1983). Schaller (1967) reported that Gaur in Kanha National Park drank at least once per day during the hot season, usually in the evening. The mean annual group size of re-introduced Gaur in Bhandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, was estimated at 7.3 ± 0.76 (SE). The overall estimated summer, monsoon and winter home ranges of gaur were 290 km², 137 km² and 155 km² (Minimum Convex Polygon) respectively. The overall individual male home ranges varied from 135 to 142 km2, and overall individual female home ranges varied from 32 to 169 km2. In summer, Gaur largely preferred grassland (P&lt;0.0001), whereas in monsoon and winter, Gaur preferred bamboo mixed forest (P&lt;0.0001). Gaur avoided open mixed forest (P&lt;0.0001) and agricultural land in all three seasons. In total, Gaur fed on 68 plant species (Sankar <em>et al </em>2013). Sahai (1972) stated that Gaur drink at least twice in a 24-hour period but there appears to be no fixed time for drinking. In undisturbed areas, Gaur is mainly diurnal, but in areas of high human disturbance, it is reported to become mainly nocturnal.<br/><br/>The basic social group appears to be a female-juvenile unit with larger groups tending to be more-or-less temporary assemblages (as in the other large species of Asian Bovini). Maternal herds containing several adult cows, juveniles, and calves frequently occur but their composition is somewhat fluid, particularly during the rut; these herds can often contain several subadult and adult males. The number of bulls in a herd changes with the time of year. Mature males associate with cows primarily during the rut: during Schaller’s study in Kanha National Park 65% of herds were accompanied by a mature male during April (the peak of the rut) but during the second half of the year the proportion dropped to 31% (Schaller 1967). Neither Schaller (1967) nor Sahai (1972) found any evidence to support Powell’s (1964) statement that young bulls usually live apart from the maternal herds; nor did Schaller’s observations support Dunbar Brander’s (1923) statement that the ’master bull’ drives all other males from the herd. Males not associating with mixed herds either live in all-male groups or are solitary. The bull herds are generally unstable, although sometimes two or more animals may frequently associate. The typical herd size appears to be in the range of 5-12 animals and herds are rarely larger than 20 (Dunbar Brander 1923, Hubback 1937, Hislop 1961a, Schaller 1967, Prater 1971, Sahai 1972, Pal and Guin 1986). Large groups of 20, 40, or even 100 animals are probably temporary aggregations of smaller groups (Pal and Guin 1986).<br/><br/>The majority of the 125-150 Gaur studied by Schaller (1967) in Kanha National Park (India) ranged over an area of at least 78 km²; and the herds he studied travelled on average 2-3 miles (3.2-4.8 km) a day, although on occasion the distance could be much less. In West Malaysia Gaur home ranges have been estimated to be: approximately 13 km² (the Kuala Tahan herd in Taman Negara National Park) (Weigum 1972); and 29.9 km² for a yearling male, 52.1 km² for a yearling female, and 137.3 km² for an adult male in Pahang (Conry 1989). The large differences between the two studies probably reflect the different methods employed by the two workers (see Conry 1989: 60). Home ranges that can be as large as 137 km² hinder the setting aside of conservation areas for Gaur, particularly as Gaur often occurs in those areas where the pressures for economic development are highest.<br/><br/>In central India, most Gaur mate in December and January, and calves are born in August and September according to Dunbar Brander (1923); Stebbing (1911) and Sanderson (1912) generally agreed with Dunbar Brander but noted that calves may also be born in April, May, and June. In Kanha National Park (central India) Schaller (1967) recorded rutting bulls from December to June, with an apparent peak of sexual behaviour in March and April; however, the occurrence of a few new-born animals throughout the year indicated that some mating must occur in every month. In southern India the majority of matings reportedly take place between November and March (Morris 1937). In Cambodia the majority of Gaur births occur in December and January (Wharton 1957). In Myanmar, calves are born throughout the year (Evans 1912, Peacock 1933); and in West Malaysia young Gaur are seen in all months except October to December (Hubback 1937).<br/><br/>The gestation period of Gaur is reported to be nine months by Hubback (1937) and Crandall (1964) and 270 days, ‘a little shorter than for Banteng or domestic cattle and longer than for yak and Kouprey’, by National Research Council (1983: 49). Only one calf is born to a cow per pregnancy; there are no records of twins (Hubback 1937, Schaller 1967). Females probably first mate when about two years old and thus have their first calf at three years old (Schaller 1967). If the food supply is favourable, most adult females probably calve every year. In Kanha National Park, approximately 90% of adult cows bore young during a year but calf mortality was high, with about 50% of the calves dying before reaching one year old; the main cause of death was predation by Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) (Schaller 1967).<br/><br/>Rarely, bulls kill each other when fighting, and occasionally they are severely injured while fighting. Predation is by far the major cause of Gaur mortality, perhaps followed by disease (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). For example in Bandipur, Gaur is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Tiger (42%) and Leopard Panthera pardus (15%) (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Bandipur, Gaur remains were found in about 24% of Tiger faeces and 9% of Leopard faeces (Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole, the proportion of Gaur in Tiger’s diet was about 45% in kills, 17% in scats (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Tadoba-Andhari, Gaur together with Sambar contributed to nearly 70% of the prey biomass consumed by Tiger, whereas in Pench-Maharashtra it was 80% (Karanth and Kumar 2005). In well protected forest reserves where different body-sized ungulates are abundantly available, Gaur is selectively predated by Tiger (Karanth and Sunquist 1995).","The set of threats and the gravity of each threat to Gaur differs greatly between south and central India, and Southeast Asia; China and most of northeast India are more similar to Southeast Asia in this respect (Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008), and are so treated in the following discussion.<br/><br/>In Indochina, Myanmar, and northeast India, hunting is the major problem, compounded by loss of suitable habitat: large tracts of suitable habitat hold few or no Guar. Ongoing habitat degradation and conversion is continually reducing the potential population, should hunting be brought under control (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Timmins and Ou 2001, Choudhury 2002, Steinmetz 2004, Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006, R.J Timmins pers. comm. 2008, F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is often for meat and a variety of methods are used (Choudhury 2002). There is also a flourishing international trade in Gaur parts, both horns (decorative) and internal organs (for medicinal purposes). Given the small size of the remaining Southeast Asian subpopulations and the number of trophies found for sale in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Myanmar during essentially opportunistic surveys, trade is clearly a major threat (Srikosamatara <em>et al</em>. 1992; Baird 1993; Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1994, 1995; Martin and Phipps 1996; Srifa La-Ong <em>et al</em>. 1997; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The most important population in Cambodia is scattered through a forest landscape that encompasses four provinces (Mondulkiri, Kratie, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri) and five conservation areas (Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area, Mondulkiri Protection Forest (including the Srepok Wilderness area) and Phnom Nam Lyr Wildlife Sanctuary). Hunting is still rife in much of this area, and forest fragmentation is rapidly accelerating with human population immigration, infrastructural developments (especially roads), commercial agricultural expansion, economic land speculation and mineral extraction. However, although perhaps less than 20% of this area is well protected from the aforementioned threats and protected area management is only close to effective in two areas, the most significant constraint to the area’s Gaur is the long-term uncertainty of continuation of effective conservation management of the Srepok Wilderness Area and Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area. Although conservation efforts for Gaur and many other species are, in both these areas, extremely encouraging, both face an uncertain future with the possibility of degazettement of conservation status of parts of them, the possible loss of adequate external funding necessary to maintain high standards of management, the possible loss of political support necessary to uphold high protection standards and the uncertainties of maintaining a motivated well trained staff. Almost throughout Southeast Asia, protected areas are not yet stalling declines in mammals with commercial value, such as Gaur. Areas with stabilized populations (in addition to the two Cambodian areas, perhaps only a few areas in Thailand (see Population) and Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam) are exceptional (R. Steimetz pers. comm. 2008, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>Surprisingly, given its retention of healthy populations of other high-value very large mammals (Tiger and Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>); Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007; S. Hedges pers. comm. 2008 for elephants), Malaysia has among the most rapidly declining populations of Gaur. This reflects targeted hunting for large mammals of high commercial value, even within protected areas (Abdul Kadir 1998, Wan Shahruddin 1998, Lynam 1999, DWNP/Danced 2002, Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007). Given the rapid decline within the 1990s and the lack of information traced since 2002, the exact current situation of Gaur in Malaysia is unclear. Kemasul Forest Reserve, where the species was found in Laidlaw’s (2000) survey of virgin jungle reserves, probably no longer exists as such. Even at the time of survey, most of the Forest Reserve was due to be converted into an <em>Acacia mangium</em> plantation, although still nominally a Forest Reserve. Kemasul was, long ago, part of a massive block of lowland forest which included the famous Jengka Triangle and Krau ""Game"" Reserve. Only Krau remains, albeit much reduced (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). Even Krau, which was set up (in 1923) principally for the protection of Gaur, numerous in the area then, faces multiple threats (R. Dunlop pers. comm. 2008). In the surveys for DWNP/DANCED (2002), evidence of hunting, including cartridges, was found within the reserve, particularly in the easily accessible lowland areas; there were plenty of hunting stories by and about all of the different local communities, without exception, although their preferred target species differed. Conversion from natural forest to other land-uses of adjacent state-land combined with new ease of access has undoubtedly made Krau more of a focal point for such activity. There is a new (metalled) road and land conversion right up to the boundaries, facilitating access and easing the use of hunting methods such as spotlighting, as well as reducing habitat. The salt licks (for which Krau used to be famous) increasingly fall outside the forest (reflecting shrinking reserve boundaries and farmland encroachment into the reserve) and are now mostly in zones of high human activity of one sort or another. Temporary grasslands generated through traditional indigenous farming, which were often fairly difficult to get to and thus relatively free from hunting, were previously important Gaur habitat. A forester who used to work in Malaysia in the 1940s said that Gaur herds used to follow the Orang Asli settlements, moving in when they moved out, and Weigum (1972) even recommended ""...to maintain herds in the park it is recommended that 45 acres of land be clear-cut preferably in 15 acre plots ½ mile apart and be recut every three years"". Gaur meat is, or at least was being, sold at restaurants in placed like Cameron and Grik.<br/><br/>In south and central India, densities are likely to be widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock, although this conclusion is based on rather few empirical studies and there are some outstanding populations in well-secured protected areas. Substantial declines and local extinctions of Gaur were driven by hunting (for meat), competition with livestock, and habitat conversion, particularly during the first half of the twentieth century, resulting in a drastically reduced and fragmented distributional range, especially outside the protected area network (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Hunting is much less prevalent than in Southeast Asia, reflecting the general enforcement of wildlife protection laws (Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Nonetheless, even in high-profile reserves, it is still suppressing densities significantly. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low, because of poaching, by comparison with what the habitat should support (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the measured density in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park was only a third of that in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, preventive measures are uneven across it, and Gaur is still poached, at least sporadically, wherever protection effectiveness is low (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). Gaur, has reportedly been exterminated from three Indian protected areas, Thattekad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Bhandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) and Kanger Valley National Park (Madhya Pradesh) (Pasha <em>et al</em>. 2004). Interaction with domestic stock is greatly under-appreciated as a threat to Gaur, but is probably the main factor which currently limits populations in south and central India: livestock are widely grazed even in otherwise well-managed protected areas. Mean densities of Gaur were fully 132 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas of Bandipur, and in shared grazing areas Gaur densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities; in the grazed area studied, halving the livestock density allowed increases of Gaur by a factor of 57 (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>, and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but the effects of these on Gaur populations warrant further study. Killing of Gaur in retaliation to crop damage (through consumption and trampling) occurs, but is of limited significance to conservation (Choudhury 2002, Farshid Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). Some animals also die from ingestion of agrochemicals, and human response when wandering into farmland and villages; these could be significant for already isolated and reduced populations (Choudhury 2002).<br/><br/>Throughout the range, diseases, particularly rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, transmitted by domestic cattle are a potentially serious threat. Foot-and-mouth is the most frequent, but rinderpest has had a particularly dramatic impact in India and several sub-populations of Gaur were nearly destroyed as a result of the disease in 1968 (Krishnan 1972, Pal and Guin 1986, Choudhury 2002), while in Bhadra, it nearly wiped out Gaur populations in 1988–1989, when nearly 800 individuals died (Girish D.V. pers. comm. 2008). In north and central Myanmar anthrax was a major factor in the decline of the species (Salter 1983). Pasha <em>et al</em>. (2004) considered that “in fact no wild animal in India [is] so profoundly influenced by transmitted infections from domestic livestock as Gaur”. There is little research or other evidence to determine impacts of introgression with domestic oxen on Gaur populations, although such factors might be expected to be most serious in India, given the wide overlap of domestic stock with Gaur. Farshid Ahrestani (pers. comm. 2008) saw a Gaur herd of 20 individuals far from human habitation with one domestic ox in the Palni Hills, so it seems likely that introgression occurs to at least some extent.<br/><br/>Srikosamtara and Suteethorn (1995) drew attention to the pressing threats facing Gaur, placing it in the same league of trade-driven threat as better-known species such as Tiger and Asian Elephant, and emphasising the international dimension of trade. Subsequently, the population collapse in Malaysia seems to have been driven by hunting teams from Lao PDR and Thailand (as proven by language at hunting camps in Temenggor), co-opting local Malaysian associates (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). It is reasonable to expect that when returns in Malaysia drop (as they probably have done already) these teams may turn their attention to other countries’ Gaur populations.","The global population is estimated to lie within 15,000-35,000 animals. Field data suggest that the proportion of mature individuals in the population is likely to be 0.4-0.6, indicating a total of 6,000-21,000 mature individuals, with fewer than 10 populations estimated to have over 1,000 individuals. Most population figures given for numbers of Gaur are little more than guesses.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, Gaur is probably extinct (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008). A few were thought still to occur in the Chittagong, Chittagong Hill Tracts, Sylhet, and Mymensingh areas in the early 1980s (Sarker and Sarker 1984), but none had been seen in Pablakhali Wildlife Sanctuary in the Hill Tracts since the early 1970s (Khan 1985). Choudhury (2002) stated that Gaur individuals from Mizoram and Tripura (India) still cross into Bangladesh, although the records on which this was based were not given. In Bhutan, Gaur apparently persists all over the southern foot-hill zone, notably in Royal Manas National Park, Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary (Choudhury 2002).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, Gaur must have declined substantially, almost certainly by well over 50% in the period from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. However, they remained widespread, outside the lower Mekong and Tonle Sap lowlands, with large populations in some areas, although in generally low numbers overall (Heng Kimchhay <em>et al</em>. 1998, Daltry and Momberg 2000, Timmins and Ou 2001, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). From the 1990s to the present almost certainly the rate of decline increased. By far the most substantial Gaur population of the country remained in eastern Cambodia centred on Mondulkiri province, where in the late 1990s potentially several hundred to a thousand may have survived in a forested landscape of over 15,000 km²; other significant populations probably numbering in the low 100s also remained in several other areas including Virachey National Park and adjacent forests, the northern plains including Preah Vihear Protection Forest and Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, the Prey Long area of the central plains and the Cardamom Mountains (Timmins and Ou 2001, Tordoff <em>et al</em>. 2005, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). With increasing national stability and economic growth further declines probably of the order of 50% or more, but more importantly an almost certainly accelerating rate of decline, took place from the early 1990s to the present (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). As of 2013 the most significant population by far in Cambodia still remained within Mondulkiri Province (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013 based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. Clements pers. comm. 2007; T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2007; Gray 2012). Protection efforts in part of this landscape between 2005 and 2013 have probably stabilised the population there (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013 based on WCS and WWF unpublished data; T. Clements pers. comm. 2007; T.D. Evans pers. comm. 2007). However increasing pressures, including an upsurge of snaring and wild-meat demand from Vietnam, since approximately 2015 mean this protection is now not sufficient and Gaur populations are likely declining. Distance-based line transects in the landscape fail to detect sufficient Gaur (<em>c.f.</em> Banteng) to robustly estimate population size (T. Gray pers. comm). Protection outside these two areas is limited and for Cambodia as a whole the trend is still a significant decrease (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In China, Gaur occurs in Yunnan and southeast Tibet (Ma Yiqing and Wang Yingxiang 1995). Up until the 1950s–1960s, all sites in Yunnan (except Yingjiang) formed one large contiguous population, but this is now heavily fragmented. By the 1980s, the species was extinct in Lancang county, and the remaining animals were split into two populations: Xishuangbanna-Simao and Cangyuan (Wang Yingxiang verbally 1998 to Duckworth and Hedges 1998). Some sources suggest that a population of 600-800 existed in Yunnan Province in the mid-1990s, with the majority occurring in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve (Ma Yiqing and Wang Yingxiang 1995); other sources suggest that only small numbers of Gaur remain in Yunnan (along the border with Myanmar) and that hunting had led to the local extinction of Gaur in Xishuangbanna (Xiang and Santiapillai 1993).<br/><br/>In India, four major (Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, Central India and North-East) and two minor (Bihar and West Bengal) priority ‘Gaur conservation areas’ have been identified, reflecting the remaining distribution (Sankar <em>et al</em>. 2000, Choudhury 2002). The Western Ghats and their outflanking hills in south India constitute one of the most extensive extant strongholds of Gaur, with good numbers in Wynaad - Nagarahole – Mudumalai - Bandipur complex (Ranjitsinh 1997, Ahrestani and Karanth 2014). Recent distributional assessment surveys in the Karnataka part of the Western Ghats showed the presence of Gaur in more than 60% of the 22,000 km² landscape (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Ranjitsinh (1997) estimated 12,000-22,000 Gaur in India, while Choudhury (2002) suggested that there were about 23,000-34,000 Gaur in India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh; but the true number is simply not known, as shown by the wide ranges. Reliable figures on Gaur population densities are rare because of the huge effort required to sample these low-density populations in dense forested areas (Ahrestani and Karanth 2014). Major populations have been reported in Nagarahole National Park (probably over 3,000; 5.1 per 100 km²; Ahrestani and Karanth 2014), Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary (over 1000; 3 per 100 km²; Karanth 2014), Melghat Tiger Reserve (perhaps 1000; 1 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2005), Bandipur National Park (over 4,000; 5.3 per 100 km²; Ahrestani and Karanth 2014), Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and adjoining areas (over 1,500 individuals) Kanha National Park (probably around 4000; Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2015), Pench Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh (0.7 per 100 km²; Karanth and Nichols 2000) and Maharashtra (0.8 per 100 km² ,Karanth and Kumar 2005) (perhaps &gt;500 individuals), Bhandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (re-introduced population, 65 individuals), Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (over 1,300; 1.8 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2005), Periyar Tiger Reserve and adjoining forest complex (500-1,000), Annamalai range complex (Parambikulum, Valparai, and Grass Hills) (500-700), Silent Valley and adjoining forest complex (500-1,000), Agastyamalai forest complex (about 500), Biligirirangangswamy Wildlife Sanctuary (2.8 per 100 km²; Karanth 2013) and Cauvery-Malemahadeswara Hill range (0.2 to 0.7 per 100 km²; Rayar 2010) (together over 1500), Anshi-Dandeli Tiger Reserve and adjoining forest mosaic (perhaps about 700; 1 per 100 km²; Karanth 2014), Kudremukh National Park and its adjoining forest complex including Someshwara and Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuaries (&gt;600), Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (&gt;1,200 individuals; 4.4 per 100 km²; Karanth and Kumar 2015); Satpura Tiger Reserve (&gt;1,000; 1.6 per 100 km²; Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2015). Many other areas are known or suspected to hold small populations, but in many sites such small numbers are unlikely to be viable (Choudhury 2002). For example, small populations of unknown size exist in Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary and Manas Sanctuary. Most of the foregoing figures are based on rigorous line transect survey methods. In recent years Gaur has reportedly been exterminated from three protected areas, Thattekad Wildlife Sanctuary (Kerala), Bhandhavgarh (Madhya Pradesh) and Kanger Valley National Park (Madhya Pradesh) (Pasha <em>et al</em>. 2004). Information on population status from the states of Andhra Pradesh (probably over 300 individuals), Orissa and North-East is limited (Choudhury 2002); there are demonstrably very few Gaur in Kaziranga (Karanth and Nichols 2000). Gaur populations are known to fluctuate annually even in well-protected reserves such as Nagarahole and Bandipur (Karanth and Kumar unpub. data) due to a variety of reasons (disease outbreak, seasonal movement patterns etc). No densities could be estimated, despite the use of suitable survey methodology, at Kanha or Namdapha, implying relatively low populations, and none was found during such surveys at Kaziranga or Ranthambore (Karanth and Nichols 2000); only small numbers persist in Kaziranga (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). In Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, Tripura, North East India, the estimated population of Gaur is &lt;50 individuals with estimated density as 1.5 individuals/km² (Dasgupta <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching (using snares, dogs and shotguns) and livestock grazing. However, the Gaur population there is now steadily increasing with successful conservation interventions (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar&#160; unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared the fauna of an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site: this found respective densities of six and two Gaurs per km² (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Byers <em>et al</em>. (1995) stated that the national population was approximately 1,000. This number is possible (field records exist from many areas), but animals would have been widely dispersed and at very low density in the extensive forest tracts across the country, with perhaps fewer than six sites holding more than 50 animals (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Steinmetz 2004, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). A large population of Gaur was found in Nakai-Nam Theun NPA and the adjoining Nakai Plateau in the mid 1990s, when signs were readily found and even the animals themselves seen directly (Duckworth 1998, Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Evans <em>et al</em>. 2000). Resurveys of both areas, although using comparable methodology only on the plateau, indicate massive declines in the subsequent decade, with, for example, fairly intensive camera-trapping not recording the species at all, although small numbers persist in localised areas of the interior (Dersu 2007; Johnson and Johnston 2007, C. Coudrat and Chanthavy Vongkhamheng in litt. to R.J. Timmins 2013). The last decade has seen major reductions (in general, probably of well over 50%), in many large mammal populations across Lao PDR and it is now likely that many of the populations listed in Duckworth and Hedges (1998) have become locally extinct (Timmins and Robichaud 2005; R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008). In addition to Nakai Nam Theun NBCA, two other protected area, Nam Et–Phou Loey and Nam Kading National Biodiversity Conservation Areas have been relatively well surveyed (although not specifically for wild cattle) with disappointing results suggesting very small remnant Gaur populations, another area Xe Sap NBCA appears to retain a small but more substantial population, while a fourth area, Xe Pian NBCA, along the border with Cambodia (mainly in Champasak Province) may also have a more substantial population, but data are scarce (BirdLife International Cambodia Programme 2012, Timmins 2012, unpub. data collected for AWCSG-GWC 2011, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013, Akchousan Rasphone, J. Goodrich, C. Hallam and A. McWilliam in litt. to R.J. Timmins 2013). These five areas amount to the majority of the largest forest blocks remaining in Laos, with few other areas capable of supporting significant Gaur populations, but as of the end of 2013 it is likely that the most significant Gaur population survives in the extreme south of Lao along the border with Cambodia, particularly within Attapu province adjacent to the Virachey National Park area, in areas that remain poorly surveyed and not formally protected at the national level (unpub. data collected for AWCSG-GWC 2011, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, in 1994 the population was stated to be less than 500 individuals and it was thought to be declining (J. Brennan pers. comm. to Read <em>et al</em>. 1994; a number of other stated numbers from around that time, all of the same general order of a few hundred, and none derived allowing a quantification of error margin, are presented in Hedges in prep.), with then confirmed records from various sites, e.g., the Sungai Singgor area of Temenggor Forest Reserve, Hulu Perak (Ratnam <em>et al</em>. 1995). In the subsequent few years, the population collapsed, despite optimism through relatively stronger control of guns in Malaysia than elsewhere on the southeast Asian mainland, and a perception (e.g., Nash 1993) of relatively strict control of wildlife trade in Malaysia. Densities in Taman Negara were crudely estimated from surveys during 1999-2001 as 0, 3 and 22 Gaurs per 100 km² in three study sites (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004). Although these authors adjudged large mammal poaching to be negligible in Taman Negara, high levels were confirmed there by Wan Shahruddin (1998) and camera-trapping (suitable in methodology and intensity to find Gaur if any significant numbers were present) did not record Gaur at a fourth sector of Taman Negara in 1999 (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2007). In 2015, camera-trapping work done by MYCAT in south-western Taman Negara corridor (outside the park) showed the existence of Gaur. How many animals were not ascertained. Also camera-trap of individuals and prints were seen in Taman Negara, the wildlife corridor as well as in the contiguous forest adjoining it (M.T. Gumal pers. comm 2016). No Gaur was photographed at all in eight other potential Tiger areas surveyed by Lynam <em>et al</em>. (2007) during 1997-1999, including Temenggor (see Ratnam <em>et al</em>. 1995); because these were selected as the areas most likely to support Tigers and as Tiger-oriented camera-trapping elsewhere in South-east Asia usually yields photographs of Gaur, this study proves that only very low numbers of Gaur remain in Malaysia, no doubt way below the estimate in Read et al. (1994). However WWF Malaysia does have records of Gaur still existing in Belum-Temenggor (M.T. Gumal pers. comm. 2016). Further supporting this,none was found in the Jerangau Forest Reserve, from which it was suspected to have been eradicated by hunting (Azlan 2006). Gaur was found in only two of 14 sites (seven virgin jungle reserves and seven adjacent logged areas), making it among the most localised mammal species which was detected in a study assessing the importance of virgin jungle reserves. The two occupied sites were a contiguous pair in each management class, and among the biggest sites surveyed (over 100 km²); the virgin jungle reserves themselves rarely exceed 3 km² (Laidlaw 2000). Also the Endau-Rompin landscape has been camera trapped between 2008 to 2015, and with 231 camera-trap stations and found no signs of Gaur (an effective camera trapping area of 4,179 km²) (M.T. Gumal pers. comm 2016).<br/><br/>In the 1960s, there were estimated to be approximately 40 Gaur in Krau Wildlife Reserve, a figure deemed optimistic at the time; in the 1980s there were thought to be 22-31; in 1995 the estimate was only seven. When surveying the reserve in 2000 (see DWNP/DANCED 2002), R. Dunlop (pers. comm. 2008) covered the whole reserve (about 440 km²) with camera-traps in 119 one km-grid squares. Out of a total of 6,918 periods of 24-hour trapping, 61 species were recorded in 1,804 photographs of wildlife, yet only one photograph was of a Gaur. In almost 100 days of field searching for signs, Gaur tracks were recorded only on eight days, on each occasion as prints of isolated animals. The photograph, the sole sighting, and the eight track records were all in the south-east lowland area of the reserve, moving between an area of salt-licks and grazing just outside the reserve. This survey corroborated the 1995 estimate of seven animals, and the 2000-2001 figure could be even lower. Sumatran Rhinoceros (<em>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</em>) and Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) have both disappeared from Krau, and Gaur may be the next species to go. R. Dunlop (pers. comm. 2008) considers there no reason to expect this recent history not to typify that of Gaur populations at all sites in Malaysia. There are very recent records from: Tanjong Mentong in Taman Negara, where tracks were found during elephant surveys in late 2006 (Nurul Huda, WCS Malaysia pers. comm. 2008); Belum, in 2007, where animals were camera-trapped at salt-licks several times, including a herd of seven (Ahmad Zafir, WWF Malaysia pers. comm. 2008); and Temenggor, where individual animals (no herds) were camera-trapped nine times (never at salt licks, always on logging roads) in 2,364 trap-nights in 25 locations (Mark Darmaraj, WWF Malaysia pers. comm. 2008). A recent camera trapping study of fruiting gardens, which conducted 1024 camera trap nights at 15 sites within Krau, found no sign of Gaur (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, the status of Gaur is poorly known (J.W. Duckworth and Than Zaw pers. comm. 2006). A March 1994 survey of Taminthi Wildlife Sanctuary, Myanmar's largest protected area, guessed that 100-200 Gaur remained, and that they were in danger of being extirpated from the area if current levels of poaching continued (Rabinowitz <em>et al</em>. 1995). A national Tiger survey camera-trapped Gaur in 11 of 15 camera-trapped sites, commonly in several (Lynam 2003); these sites were selected for their chances of holding Tigers, so, because the two species face similar threats, it may present the most positive picture of Gaur occurrence in the country.<br/><br/>In Nepal, the Gaur population was estimated to be 250-350 in the mid-1990s, with the majority in Chitwan National Park and Parsa Wildlife Reserve; a few other areas hold small numbers (Choudhury 2002). In total the population of this species is more or less stable, with some annual fluctuations. A 2008 census in Parsa Wildlife Reserve counted up to 37 Gaur, in 2011 a combined survey of Parsa Wildlife Reserve and Chitwan National Park counted 21 and 312 respectively. In 2013, Parsa Wildlife Reserve showed a total of 69 animals, a marked increase from the last count. The Gaur population found in east Nepal mainly confined to Trijuga forest, Udayapur District has been nearly extirpated. Currently national count is being held and it is expected that the numbers will be higher than previous years. The rough estimate is around 400 in Nepal.<br/><br/>In Thailand, an estimated total of 920 Gaur remained in 1994. Only 6-7 populations were thought to contain 50 or more animals and there were no Gaur outside protected areas. The most important protected areas for Gaur were Khao Yai National Park, Tap Lan National Park and Pang Sida National Park, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaeng Krachan National Park and Mae Nam Phachi Wildlife Sanctuary, the Khlong Nakha complex, and possibly Om Koi and Mae Tuen Wildlife Sanctuaries. Even in protected areas with much suitable habitat Gaur densities were very low, for example in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary the population density was less than 50% of the estimated carrying capacity of the area (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1995, S. Hedges pers. comm. 2000). Gaur populations are probably now increasing in several sites in Thailand, notably in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, with effective tackling of poaching. In Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, sign monitoring in one small area (20 km²) over six years since poaching absolutely ceased indicated an annual population growth rate there of 0.31, although the relative contributions of birth and immigration could not be distinguished. Breeding herds became much more common, compared with the situation 10-15 years previously at the height of poaching (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the Khao Paeng Ma reforestation site adjacent to Khao Yai National Park the population apparently expanded from two to 100 Gaur in less than 10 years, initially reflecting recolonization but apparently mostly from reproduction among animals at the site, all within a 10 km² area of secondary forest. The population stabilized at about 100 animals during 2004â€“2007 (based on counts from hilltops). As the forest grows and browse and grass diminish, reproduction is likely to decline (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). This herd has flourished only by dint of the provision of 24-hour security (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008). Numbers also seem to be expanding rapidly in Kuiburi National Park in southern Thailand, again from an artificially lowered population and again within a secondary forest area adjacent to semi-evergreen forest. In early 2008, a (temporary) herd of almost 50 animals was spotted by elephant-watchers in a tree hide; only a few years previously, there were probably far fewer than this in the whole area (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2007; R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). By contrast, Gaur is largely gone from southern Thailand forest remnants, although it may be safe on the Malaysian border, reflecting tight control of illegal access and activities by the Border Patrol Police, and the danger of operations because of insurgency (A.J. Lynam pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the current status of Gaur is poorly known. Several areas in Dak Lak Province (the Easo and Easup areas and Yok Don National Park) were known to contain Gaur in 1997 (Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. 1997) but very little reliable information was traced for other parts of the country by Duckworth and Hedges (1998). Several herds of Gaur persist in Cat Tien National Park and in adjacent state forest enterprises (Polet and Ling 2004), where the population is now probably stable and even perhaps increasing (based on various secondary and verbal sources R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013). Elsewhere however there seems little room for doubt that the Gaur population is still threatened, although at this point in time (late 2013) it is possible even probable that Gaur have largely been extirpated from all areas where no form of protection exists, and that even in most protected areas that harbour residual groups that declines are still the predominant trend, and many of the sites reported in Duckworth and Hedges (1998) may now have lost the species.",Decreasing,"Gaur historically occurred throughout mainland south and southeast Asia and Sri&#160;Lanka. Currently it occurs in scattered areas in the following range states:&#160;Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Lao PDR, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia only),&#160;Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, and Viet Nam. However, it is extinct in Sri Lanka and also, as&#160;a resident, apparently in Bangladesh (Grubb 2005, Md Anwarul Islam in litt.&#160;2008, Hedges in prep.). The species is now seriously fragmented within its&#160;range, and the mapped distribution is generalised, especially in India, Lao, Myanmar, China and Malaysia.The domesticated form of Gaur, considered by IUCN a separate species (<em>Bos&#160;frontalis</em>; Mythun, Mithan or Gayal), occurs in parts of India, China, and&#160;Myanmar as feral, semi-feral, and domestic animals. This animal is excluded from&#160;the red-listing considerations for Gaur.","The Gaur is hunted for food, medicinal products and handicrafts products. A domesticated 'form' of Gaur (considered by many, including for Red List purposes as a separate species <em>Bos frontalis</em>) occurs in parts of the Indian subcontinent and is used as a draught animal and for meat. However such uses do not supply the same markets as 'wild' Gaur <em>Bos gaurus</em> products.",Terrestrial,"Gaur is listed in CITES Appendix I, and is legally protected in all range states. It occurs in many protected areas, although in north-east India, Myanmar, China, Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Malaysia many such areas retain only tiny populations or have already lost the species.<br/><br/>South and central India have a well established network of wildlife refuges and protection activities, to a large extent, are effective in many of them (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008) and Gaur population in Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in South India is perhaps the most secure one (Ahrestani and Karanth 2014) with about 5000 individuals (also the largest population of Gaurs in the world). However, conservation-oriented research and interventions on Gaur are limited and seem unlikely to expand much in the short-term, meaning that the species benefits largely through general protection activities (particularly those focused around Tiger and Asian Elephant), while species-specific negative factors or worrying long-term trends are likely to go unmanaged and even unnoticed (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). The chief of these seems to be competitive interaction with grazing stock: Gaur densities were the most depressed of all ungulates surveyed by Madhusudan (2004), perhaps reflecting higher niche overlap with domestic cattle than shown by the others (chiefly deer). There is long-term monitoring of some Gaur populations, for instance Mudumalai, Bandipur, Bhadra and Nagarahole (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008, Karanth and Kumar unpub. data). Rinderpest has reportedly been eradicated from India (Choudhury 2002). Choudhury (2002) listed proposed aspects of protected area expansion and consolidation to slow further fragmentation of Gaur populations in southern and central India. <br/><br/>In some protected areas (recent examples being Bhadra and Kudremukh in Karnataka), formerly forest-dwelling human communities have resettled closer to markets, clinics, school and other services (Karanth and Karanth 2007). This expands habitat available to Gaur (that which was formerly fields and houses) but more significant is the removal of a source of hunters and the cessation of grazing competition with domestic stock (see Karanth et al. 2006). Such conservation interventions have helped recovery of Gaur populations in this region. Increasing development aspirations mean that out migration is likely from further areas, e.g. Mudumalai (F. Ahrestani pers. comm. 2008). <br/><br/>In contrast in Southeast Asia economic development and political stability in tandem with increased globalisation has resulted in accelerated loss and fragmentation of Gaur habitat, greater wildlife trade demand and a more insidious trade network (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>As the majority of the Gaur population is in South Asia, conservation activities are important there. It is also important that populations are maintained at least in several areas in Southeast Asia, to maintain Gaur presence through its historical range, to preserve Gaur genetic diversity and through its importance to the ecosystems within which it lives. Given the regional pattern of threats and current successes to date, implementing effective conservation interventions is considerably more challenging, and therefore a higher priority in the Southeast Asian region. <br/><br/>Gaur occurs mainly in protected areas in Southeast Asia, although Cambodia and Myanmar may both have large populations outside them and some may persist is such areas in Lao PDR (Duckworth 1996, Hansel 2004, SUFORD 2010). In most protected areas of Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia which still retain Gaur, protected status offers little, if any, real protection to the species, exceptions being Cat Tien National Park in Viet Nam, the Srepok Wilderness Area and the Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area in Cambodia; in the latter two Cambodian areas, there are now even signs of population recovery (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2008), as there are at Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, with effective tackling of poaching (R. Steinmetz pers. comm. 2008). Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary form part of Thailand's 'Western Forest Complex' which if these recent gains are consolidated will, in the long term, hold the largest functional Gaur population in Thailand and perhaps South-east Asia. <br/><br/>The most important conservation measure for the species in Cambodia is the continued strengthening and support of conservation efforts in Siema Biodiversity Conservation Area and the Srepok Wilderness Area, and to a lesser extent support of protected area conservation management in the northern plains and central Cardamoms. Likewise in Viet Nam, the most important conservation measure is the continued support of protection efforts within Cat Tien National Park, in Thailand it is to continue the consolidation of the 'Western Forest Complex' and to continue the high-intensity protection of the rebuilt herd in Khao Paeng Ma reforestation site, adjacent to Khao Yai National Park. In Myanmar the Hukaung Valley is an exceptional area of lowland plains forest, grassland, and wetlands. Part lies within the Wildlife Sanctuary and some of the rest of the outstanding plains habitat is within an enormous proposed extension. Through its size and mostly little-encroached condition, this is the most outstanding remaining landscape-level floodplains habitat for very large mammals remaining in tropical Asia, and although wildlife populations are highly depleted, warrants the strongest effort to conserve it. It faces a number of daunting challenges (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2008). In Lao PDR, any of a large number of areas could become key Gaur conservation sites, but there is as yet no precedent in the country for effective conservation of high-trade-value large mammals. Xe Pian, Xe Sap, Nam Et-Phou Louey, and Nakai-Nam Theun NPAs could all be highly significant areas for the species (Duckworth and Hedges 1998, Steinmetz 2004, Johnson et al. 2006, Timmins 2012) but so could almost any other NPA; the reality is that the most success with Gaur conservation is likely to come through identifying areas with positive underlying situations to achieve conservation, rather than identifying the area with the most intrinsic importance for Gaur as the focus for efforts. Choudhury (2002) listed aspects of protected area expansion and consolidation to slow further fragmentation of Gaur populations in north-east India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and perhaps allow repopulation of Bangladesh. <br/><br/>The most important actions in Malaysia are to determine if any viable population remains in the country and, if so, to implement effective anti-poaching measures and to work at the policy level to allow effective control of large mammal hunting and trading. Under the current circumstances, any site-based activities are likely to require the sort of 24-hour security employed at the reforestation site adjacent to Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, which has allowed a rapid population growth of Gaur. It may also require reintroduction. The Department of Wildlife and National Parks have a breeding population of captive Gaur in enclosures in the Jenderak ranger station (within Krau Wildlife Reserve), for captive release. <br/><br/>A large captive population exists of wild-type Gaur (as well as of Mythun); given the complexity of field conservation of large ungulates, particularly in South-east Asia, it is clearly in resolving issues of hunting, trade, and protected area effectiveness that conservation interventions must focus.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The number of mature individuals is now likely to be &lt;250 and the species may also be close to meeting Critically Endangered under criterion C2","Hirola inhabit semi-arid thorn bush, open bush grassland, to light woodland, and lush savanna grassland. Their preferred habitat is seasonally flooded, open grassland with scattered small shrubs and trees on well-drained soils with short leafy swards of grass formed by fire, or by the combined grazing pressure of wildlife and domestic livestock (Bunderson 1981, Butynski 2013).","Hunting, disease, drought, habitat loss, predation and competition with livestock threaten the Hirola. Moreover lack of effective protection in many parts of the remaining range leaves it vulnerable to poaching. The development of the cattle industry, compounded by rinderpest and drought are continuing threats (East 1999, Butynski 2013). The situation for the Hirola remains grave, given its extremely rapid decline and the severe political and environmental problems that currently prevail over the natural range (Butynski 2013).","In 1979, there were <em>ca</em> 16,000 animals in Kenya (within 17,900 km²). Estimated numbers decreased from 12,500 in the early to mid-1970s to about 7,000 in 1977-83, followed by a drastic decline (85 to 90%) between 1983 and 1985 caused by the severe drought of 1984 (Butynski 2000). Ground surveys suggested a population of between 500 and 2,000 in Kenya in 1995/1996 (Andanje and Ottichilo 1999, Butynski 2000, Dahiye and Aman 2002). Somalia had <em>ca</em> 2,000 Hirola in 1979, but has few, if any, today (Butynski 2000). Overall, numbers have fallen by 85 to 90% since 1980 and are still declining (East 1999, Butynski 2013). Surveys in 2011 suggested a population of 402-466 animals (<em>ca</em> 280-330 mature individuals) within their natural range (King <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, numbers have fallen steadily since; few if any remain in Arawale National Reserve. The population in Ishaqbini Community Conservancy outside the predator-proof sanctuary fell from 152 in 2008 to 63 in 2016, though some of this decline is accounted for by the 48 animals transferred into the sanctuary: these had increased to 97-103 in February 2016 (King <em>et al</em>. 2016).

In Kenya, Hirola occur between Garsen, Bura and Galma Galla/Kolbio over an area of <em>ca</em> 8,000 km² (Butynski 2000), but its numbers and range are continuing to decline. Its current status in south-west Somalia is not known, but its former range has been badly affected by prolonged civil and military conflicts that was continuing up to late 2016. <br/><br/>There is a small translocated population in Tsavo East National Park, outside the species’ natural range, originating from a translocation of 30 animals from Garissa District conducted in 1963. It is thought that most of these perished soon after release and that the size of the 'effective founder population' was only 11 to 19 animals (Butynski 2000). A further 10 animals were translocated to Tsavo East in 1996 (Hofmann 1996).","Hirola have suffered drastic declines as a result of over-hunting in the past, and a lack of effective protection leaves it still vulnerable to poaching.",Terrestrial,"This is one of the most highly threatened antelopes in Africa and the extinction of Hirola would represent the first extinction in historic times of a genus of mammal endemic to Africa (Butynski 2013). Recommendations for the long-term conservation of the Hirola in Kenya have been included in a conservation action plan (Magin 1996) and a conservation evaluation report (Butynski 2000). These recommendations are now part of the current conservation and management plan for the Hirola in Kenya (Hirola Management Committee 2004) and are being acted upon by the Kenya Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Hirola Management Committee and local conservation NGOs. Despite these efforts, Hirola numbers have continued to decline across their range. They are rare or even no longer occur in the Arawale N.R. which has been subjected to scrub encroachment. Community conservation and anti-poaching activities must be established over a large portion of the remaining range, but insecurity is now a serious problem in this region. Consideration should be given to establishing protected areas at Galma Galla and to expanding the Tana Primate N.R. to the east to include at least 300 km² of prime habitat for Hirola (Butynski 2013). <br/><br/>Intensive conservation efforts, led by the Northern Rangelands Trust.,  are maintained in the Ishaqbini Community Conservancy, including regular patrolling by teams of committed rangers.

50189609,11036,Kobus kob,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species is still widespread and numerous overall, particularly the population in the Sudd, but it is highly vulnerable to poaching and habitat loss which has caused population declines. Overall these are not estimated to approach the threshold for Vulnerable. While the status of the Kob will likely not change as long as there is effective protection and management for the various protected areas in which the species can be found, its future is highly dependent upon these conservation measures. The species could easily become threatened if current conservation measures cease to be effective or disappear altogether, or if there are significant changes to the core habitat in the Sudd. There is particular cause for concern over the status of Buffon's Kob.","Typical habitat includes riverine grasslands and floodplains of major rivers; grasslands; seasonal floodplains and grasslands near water within savanna woodlands (East 1999). Kobs are almost exclusively grazers, and confined to regions that have year-round access to water (Fischer 2013). Social organization in the Kob is dependent on density and includes two discrete mating systems, changing from a lek system at high densities (&gt;14 animals/km²) to a resource-defence system at lower densities (Fischer 2013, and references therein).","Although very abundant in the past, Kobs are victims of unsustainable hunting over most of their range (Fischer 2013). Buffon's Kob, in particular, has been eliminated from large parts of its former range by poaching for meat and now survives mainly in and around protected areas. Poaching has caused large-scale declines of key populations of Kob in areas such as Comoé National Park (Côte d'Ivoire) and northern and eastern Central African Republic during the 1990s (East 1999, Fischer 2013).<br/><br/>Loss of habitat to the expansion of settlements, agricultural development and livestock is another major cause of population reduction. For example, the Uganda Kob formerly occurred in south-western Kenya and north-western Tanzania in grasslands alongside Lake Victoria, but was exterminated by the spread of settlement and agricultural development. Droughts, disruption of the natural flooding regime (e.g., the construction of the Maga dam on the Logone floodplain, Cameroon), and outbreaks of rinderpest have also been cited as significant causes of population decline (East 1999, Fischer 2013).","East (1999) estimated 95,000 Buffon's Kob, but populations have undergone significant declines since then. Fay <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated more than 753,572 White-eared Kob in South Sudan. East (1999) estimated 100,000 Uganda Kob and populations in protected areas may be stable (Fischer 2013) but there is no updated estimate available. Overall, numbers of Kobs are declining throughout their range (Fischer 2013).<br/><br/>Kob can reach high densities when well protected in areas of favourable  habitat, ranging from 15-40 animals/km² (Fischer 2013, and references  therein); however, in areas of heavy hunting pressure, densities decline  to less than 1/km² (Fischer 1998). The highest densities of Kob  (1,000/km²) have been reported around drinking sites in the dry season  (Fryxell 1987).",Decreasing,"Kob (<em>Kobus kob</em>) were formerly distributed across the whole West and Central African savanna zone from Senegal and Guinea-Bissau to South Sudan and extreme south-west Ethiopia, extending south into Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. <br/>Current distribution is patchy and the species has undergone extensive declines. <em>K</em><em>. k. kob</em> (Buffon’s or Western Kob) were formerly one of the most abundant antelopes in West and Central Africa but are now largely confined to protected areas, having gone extinct from Gambia and Sierra Leone (and perhaps Mauritania) (Fischer 2013). <em>K. k. leucotis</em> (White-eared Kob) has the smallest range centred around the Sudd in South Sudan and still retains a large population. <em>K. k. thomasi</em> (Uganda Kob) are mainly found in Uganda and surrounding areas; these remaining populations represent less than 1% of its original distribution in East Africa (J. Kingdon pers. comm. in Fischer 2013).","The sedentary nature of Kobs and their tendency to occur in relatively large concentrations in open areas make them highly susceptible to hunting. This has led to high levels of unsustainable hunting over most of their range and therefore large-scale declines (Fischer 2013). However under strict protection Kob numbers can recover quickly, allowing sustainable offtakes of about 7% of the population (Mayaka <em>et al. </em>2004)",Terrestrial,"While the Kob is highly susceptible to hunting, loss of habitat and disruption of the natural flooding regime, it has the ability to recover its numbers rapidly from very low levels with effective protection. For example in Cameroon, the population of Waza National Park decreased from 25,000 in 1962 to 2,000 in 1988-94. This resulted from a general drying out of its habitat caused by droughts and disruption of the natural flooding regime from 1979 by the construction of the Maga dam on the Logone floodplain, which formed Lake Maga. Additional mortality of the Waza population was caused by poaching and the 1982-83 rinderpest outbreak. Since 1994, the Netherlands-funded IUCN/CML Waza-Logone project has investigated rehabilitation of the floodplain by release of excess water from Lake Maga and the Logone River. By 1997, the Kob population was increasing in response to the reflooding activities of this project. While large-scale rehabilitation of the Waza-Logone floodplain is contemplated, this may not be possible unless increasing security problems and a degenerating social climate in the region are overcome (Scholte <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>Protected areas important for the survival of Buffon’s Kob, include: Niokolo-Koba (Senegal), Comoé (Côte d’Ivoire), Arly-Singou (Burkina Faso), Mole and Bui (Ghana), Pendjari (Benin), Waza and Benoué and Faro National Parks of the North Province (Cameroon), Zakouma  (Chad), and Manovo-Gounda-St. Floris (Central African Republic) (East 1999, Fischer 2013). Levels of protection within these sites are very variable and poaching is not effectively controlled in some. <br/><br/>Less than 1% of the total population of White-eared Kob occurs in protected areas, such as the Boma and Badingilo National Parks in south-east Sudan (East 1999). <br/><br/>The Uganda Kob survived in good numbers in Murchison Falls-Aswa Lolim, Queen Elizabeth and Tore-Semliki NPs (Uganda) and Garamba and Virunga National Parks (DR Congo) (East 1999), but the protection status of these protected areas in DRC has deteriorated since then due to insecurity.

There is a continuing decline due to snaring, poaching for bushmeat, encroachment into protected areas (PAs) and expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing. The rate of decline is predicted to exceed 10% over three generations (24 years). Effective protection in PAs and well-managed sustainable trophy hunting programmes play a key role in the conservation of this species and any weakening of these efforts will accelerate the rate of decline.","Giant Eland inhabit woodlands and forested Sudanian to Guinean savannas, never far from hilly/rocky landscapes nor from water (Planton and Michaux 2013). Kingdon (1997) considered that it is quite strictly confined to <em>lsoberlinia doka</em> woodland, but recent studies indicate that its range includes areas of <em>Terminalia-Combretum-Afzelia</em> woodland where there is no <em>Isoberlinia</em>, for example, in parts of Cameroon’s North Province such as Boumedje Hunting Concession (Bro-Jorgensen 1997). Giant Elands feed mostly on leaves, shoots, herbs and fruits (but occasionally on grasses), and will drink daily where water is available (Planton and Michaux 2013).","The distribution of Derby Eland is mainly restricted to PAs and hunting zones. In CAR and South Sudan, political instability and armed conflict are major barriers to the implementation of effective protection and management. Bushmeat hunting, snaring, encroachment by livestock grazers and smallholder cultivation are threats across most of the range. In the past, Giant Eland suffered heavy mortality from rinderpest, to which it is said to be more susceptible than any other antelope. Its demise in The Gambia has been attributed primarily to the devastating effects of this disease (Camara 1990). Populations in the Central African region crashed by 60-80% during and after the 1983-1984 rinderpest outbreak, but later recovered (East 1999).<br/><br/>The Western Giant Eland has been reduced to very low numbers by factors  such as over-hunting for meat and habitat destruction caused by the  expansion of human and livestock populations.","East (1999) estimated that there were probably more than 15,000 Eastern Giant Eland remaining, with over 12,500 in the CAR. Numbers increased in CAR, Cameroon and Chad in the 1990s. The numbers that survive in South Sudan are unknown (165 estimated in Southern NP, South Sudan in 2007; Fay <em>et al</em>. 2007). This suggests a total population of the Eastern Giant Eland at the time of around 15,000-20,000. However, political instability and civil conflict in South Sudan and CAR in the last 10-15 years have greatly disrupted protection and management in PAs and halted trophy hunting operations in many parts of CAR. At the same time, hunting for bushmeat and encroachment into PAs by agriculturalists and livestock herders have increased. Numbers in northern Cameroon may be stable or declining more slowly, but overall the global population is now estimated to be no more than 12,000-14,000 and declining.<br/><br/>Total numbers of the Western Giant Eland are probably 150-200  individuals, with almost all the surviving animals in Senegal (Brandlová <em>et al. </em>2013, Planton and  Michaux 2013).",Decreasing,"In the past, the Giant Eland probably occurred throughout the relatively narrow belt of savanna woodland which extends across West and Central Africa from Senegal to the Nile.

The subspecies is confirmed in south-eastern Senegal, and may occur seasonally in the far north of Guinea, and south-western Mali and possibly E Guinea-Bissau (East 1999, Darroze 2004, Planton and Michaux 2013).<br/><br/>Eastern Giant Elands&#160;(<em>T. d. gigas</em>)&#160;were formerly distributed from north-eastern Nigeria to north-west Uganda.

Hejcmanová, in Planton and Michaux 2013), and a second enclosure has been built in Fathala Reserve, to which a male-only group (9) and a breeding nucleus (1, 3) were translocated in mid-2006 (Antonínová <em>et al.</em> 2006). The semi-captive populations in Bandia and Fathala reserves totalled 92 animals in 2013 (Brandlová <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>A conservation strategy for Western Giant Eland has been developed (Brandlová <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
50655874,12521,Lynx rufus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bobcat is listed as Least Concern because it is abundant and wide-ranging and is not suspected to be declining at a rate that would qualify it for Near Threatened. Bobcats are widely-distributed and their current range consists of most of the United States, southern Canada, and Mexico where the state of Oaxaca remains the southern-most limit for the species. However, local threats may present challenges for long term persistence in some regions including market hunting for the fur trade, direct habitat loss caused by increased urbanization, and indirect effects of urbanization such as genetic isolation and lethal/sublethal exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (southern California). Florida is the only US state to report Bobcat declines with Bobcat observations decreasing dramatically as invasive pythons have increased in the southern part of the state. Additionally, some concern exists about sustainability of current bag limits with the increasing value of Bobcat pelts (West Virginia). Other local threats include possible disease transmission (canine distemper in Bobcats in eastern Canada), direct conflict with domestic/feral animals including feral dogs (northern Mexico), and poisoning and medicinal uses of Bobcats (central and southern Mexico). Bobcat densities are low in central and southern, compared to northern, Mexico. The recent discovery of hybridization between the Bobcat and the sympatric Canadian Lynx may result in conservation actions for the endangered lynx recovery.","In the US, the Bobcat ranges through a wide variety of habitats, including boreal coniferous and mixed forests in the north, bottomland hardwood forest and coastal swamp in the southeast, and desert and scrubland in the southwest. Only large, intensively cultivated areas appear to be unsuitable habitat. Areas with dense understory vegetation and high prey density are most intensively selected by Bobcats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The requisite features of Bobcat habitat typically include areas with abundant rabbit and rodent populations, dense cover, and shelters that function as escape cover or den sites (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In Mexico, Bobcats are found in dry scrub and grassland, as well as tropical dry forest including pine, oak and fir (Monroy-Vilchis and Velazquez 2003, Arzate <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, C. Lopez-Gonzalez pers. comm. 2007). <br/><br/>Like its close relative <em>Lynx canadensis</em> the Bobcat preys primarily on lagomorphs (rabbits), but is much less of a specialist. Rodents are commonly taken, and Bobcats are capable of taking larger prey, including young ungulates (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A study in Virginia found Bobcats preyed on a wide variety of species (15 total) including squirrels, chipmunks, white-tailed deer, voles, and rabbits, appearing to switch prey seasonally as certain prey items became more available (Montague 2014, Morin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in review).<br/><br/>Bobcats in New Hampshire appear to favour areas with few roads, limited human development, high stream densities, and steep topography (Broman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Similarly, Bobcats in Vermont have positive responses to shrub, wetland, deciduous, and coniferous cover types, and negative responses to road and mixed cover types, and Bobcats prefer to move through forested land and scrub/rock cover rather than move through developed land cover types (Donovan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). The recently re-established Bobcats in Iowa showed a strong preference for forest over any other habitat type (Reding <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013, Tucker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). In Virginia, Bobcats were also shown to occur more often father away from roads (Kelly and Holub 2008). So while Bobcats can adjust to some levels of human encroachment, studies support the preference of Bobcats for vegetative cover and water in areas away from roads. Bobcat populations have been shown to decline in areas where forests have matured and no longer support abundant prey, namely cottontails (Litvaitis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Additionally, in Texas, when in the presence of Ocelots, Bobcats selected areas with &lt;75% canopy cover, likely facilitating coexistence between the two predators and demonstrating the Bobcat’s flexibility in habitat selection (Horne <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Alternatively, another study has shown the Bobcat will expand its use of different environmental features and use of marginal habitat in the presence of Canada Lynx (Peers <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Ferguson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2009) gathered home range information from 29 Bobcat populations across the US and found that on average, males maintained home ranges 1.65 times the size of females. Female home ranges were 0.989–42.7 km² with a mean of 15.83 km² compared to male home ranges of 2.86– 167.9 km² with a mean of 39.70 km². Females demonstrated a strong positive association between home-range size and productivity (i.e. food availability), whereas males were influenced more by changes in size of female home ranges than by resource availability (Ferguson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009, Sandell 1989).","World demand for Bobcat fur rose gradually in the late 1960s and early 1970s and jumped in the mid-1970s after CITES entered into force, when the pelts of cats listed on Appendix I became legally unobtainable for the commercial fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Of particular and concern is the recent increase in Bobcat pelt prices from $85 in 2000, to record highs of $589 in 2013,&#160; $447 in 2014, and $305 in 2015, driven by high demand for fur in China, Europe, and Russia (Knudson 2016). The number of Bobcat pelts exported from the U.S. has quadrupled in recent years, climbing to a high of 65,000 in 2013 when pelt prices were highest. <br/><br/>The US government has found that trade is not detrimental to Bobcat survival and is well-managed by state authorities. They have petitioned CITES numerous times, most recently in 2007, to remove the Bobcat from the CITES Appendices, arguing that the Bobcat does not meet the biological criteria for CITES listing and that their research indicates that importing governments should be able to reliably distinguish Bobcat skins from other species to prevent illegal trade (Govt of US 2007). However, the proposal was rejected by majority vote of the Parties to CITES (Nowell <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is viewed as another primary threat to bobcats in all three range countries. Increasing urbanization results in direct habitat loss when human density is high, although Bobcats have proven to be fairly adaptive to urbanization (Ordenana <em>et al.</em> 2010, Tracey <em>et al.</em> 2013 ) and low density developments (one house per two acres), particularly in areas with landscaped green spaces and golf courses, and Bobcats have been documented denning and raising litters in human structures (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2010). However, as Bobcats adjust to human developed landscapes, indirect effects increase. Vehicle collisions can be a primary source of mortality in urban Bobcat populations (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2006) and in populations with a high proportion of transients (Blankenship <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, exposure to common rodenticides in urban landscapes can result in direct mortality (anticoagulant toxicosis) and increased susceptibility to severe notoedric mange resulting in the death of Bobcats (Riley 1999, Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003, Riley <em>et al.</em> 2006,&#160; Riley <em>et al.</em> 2007, Ruell <em>et al.</em> 2009, Serieys <em>et al.</em> 2013). Increases in urbanization and roads have also resulted in recent genetic isolation of Bobcats populations in several areas, indicating human developments are affecting historic dispersal patterns and gene flow, resulting in local and regional population structure (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003, Croteau <em>et al.</em> 2012, Ruell <em>et al.</em> 2012, but see Millions and Swanson 2007). &#160;<br/><br/>There is concern in the northeastern US about interspecific competition with expanding coyote populations (Moruzzi <em>et al.</em> 2002, Litvaitis and Harrison 1989, Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, in Florida, where Coyotes have also increased, Thornton <em>et al.</em> (2004) found that Bobcats and Coyotes favoured different prey species, with coyotes taking larger ungulates and Bobcats rodents and smaller mammals, and Coyotes and Bobcats coexist throughout most of the western portions of their ranges, likely through niche shifts in diet and activity (Fedriani <em>et al.</em> 2000). Bobcats coexist with Ocelots in Texas (Horne <em>et al.</em> 2009) and Canada Lynx in zones of sympatry (Peers <em>et al.</em> 2013) through habitat partitioning. Aside from exploitative competition, there is evidence of interference competition through intraspecific killing by Mountain Lions (Haas 2009) and hybridization has been detected with few federally threatened Canada Lynx (<em>Lynx canadensis</em>) in Maine, Minnesota, and New Brunswick (Homyack <em>et al.</em> 2008). In addition, increased or novel sources of depredation in have been documented in several areas.&#160; Bobcat observations in southern Florida have decreased dramatically as invasive python densities have increased (Dorcas <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Ventura County, California, Coyotes were found to be the leading source of Bobcat kitten mortality (Moriarty 2007), although this increase in predation pressure is likely a result of reduced avoidance options in highly fragmented urban habitat (Riley <em>et al.</em> 2003). Interactions with domestic dogs may also present threats to the Bobcat population. Canine distemper and canine distemper-associated encephalitis has been documented in Bobcats in eastern Canada (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 2009) validating the proposed role of dogs as a pathogen-mediated apparent competitor with Bobcats (Vanek and Gompper 2009), and several studies demonstrate negative correlation between domestic dog activity and Bobcat activity (George and Crooks 2006, Reed and Merenlender 2011). &#160;<br/><br/>In localized areas Bobcats take domestic livestock and are persecuted as pests (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). In addition, there have been recent concerns about the effects of harvest on local Bobcat populations in West Virginia (WV-DNR), and Michigan (Preuss and Gehring 2007) and poaching may result in higher harvest rates than anticipated in some areas (Millions and Swanson 2006), which can result in population declines as it has in New Hampshire (Litviatus <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, there is evidence from a survey of state game management agencies that Bobcat populations are stable or increasing, with densities greater than initially estimated, in all US states with the exception of Florida (Roberts and Crimmins 2010).","In 2010, Roberts and Crimmins surveyed state wildlife management agencies in each of the 48 contiguous states regarding the current population status of Bobcats. Populations were reported to be stable or increasing in 40 states, with six states unable to report population trends and only one state (Florida) reporting decreases in Bobcat populations. The total Bobcat population for the US is estimated to be between 2,352,276 to 3,571,681 individuals, indicating that Bobcat populations have increased throughout the majority of their range in North America since the late 1990s. In particular, Bobcat populations have rebounded in the Midwestern states in recent decades. Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Five Canadian provinces reported stable Bobcat populations, one reported a stable or increasing population, and one reported a fluctuating population. Bobcat population sizes and status in Mexico are not well known.<br/><br/>Despite being widespread, there are only a few estimates for the densities that bobcats can attain. Density estimates include: 57-62 / 100km² in California (Alonso <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015), 48/100 km² in Texas (Heilbrun <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006), 25/100 km² in Arizona (Lawhead 1984), &lt;9/100 km² in Idaho (Knick 1990), and 11/100 km² in Virginia (minimum estimate, M. Kelly and D. Morin pers. comm. 2015). Bobcat densities in the northern parts of their range are generally lower than in the south (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). A density estimate for Bobcats in Mexico was low, at five individuals per 100 km² (Arzate <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Bobcat densities can vary dramatically depending on site and Thornton and Perkins (2015) found that densities in Texas were lowest in the most heavily modified landscape, and that Bobcat capture probability was positively related to forest cover.",Stable,"Bobcats occur in southern Canada and throughout the United States and Mexico. In Canada, Bobcats appear to be extending their range northward as forest clearing occurs (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Recent confirmation of Bobcats via remote camera, suggests Bobcat range extends further into the Canadian Rocky Mountains than previously thought (Lobo and Millar 2010). In the United States, bobcats were thought to be extirpated by the early 1900s from several Midwestern states including Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri, due to habitat loss and exploitation (Lariviére and Walton 1997), but they have recently recolonized these areas (Roberts and Crimmins 2010). Bobcats now occur in all contiguous United States except Delaware. Bobcats are found throughout Mexico, particularly in western Mexico and southward from the Sonoran desert. Competitive interactions with ecologically similar felids could be a factor in limiting their southern distribution, but similar competitors are present in other areas of Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). Thus, the absence of<em> Lynx rufus</em> below the Isthmus of Tehuantepec may be due to the absence of prey species. However, confirmative data of Bobcat presence throughout Mexico is somewhat scanty. While Bobcat range is thought to stop at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico (Sanchez-Cordero <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Gonzalez-Salazar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), this is based on habitat modeling rather than verified confirmations. While generally favoring low and mid-elevations, in the western US, Bobcat have been trapped at elevations up to 2,575 m (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In Mexico, radio-collared Bobcats were located at 3,500 m on the Colima Volcano in western Mexico (Burton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003).","For information on use and trade , see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix II. The Mexican subspecies <em>Lynx rufus escuinapae</em> was listed on CITES Appendix I until 1992, when it was downlisted to Appendix II on the grounds that it is not a valid taxon (Govt of US 2007). Bobcats are legally harvested for the fur trade in 38 US states, and in seven Canadian provinces. In Mexico, the Bobcat is legally hunted in small numbers as a trophy animal (Govt of US 2007). There appears to be little illegal international trade (Govt of US 2007), although within the US, Millions and Swanson (2006) used molecular forensics techniques to determine that skins reported as originating from an area with a higher bag limit were probably illegally taken from an area with a lower limit.<br/><br/>Bobcat status in the mid-western United States has improved since their extirpation in the early 1900s. In Iowa, Bobcats were downgraded to threatened in 2001 and are now harvested in many counties. In Illinois, Bobcats were removed from the states’ list of&#160; threatened in 1999 and they are now found in nearly all counties. Indiana has sightings in much of the state and Bobcats were downgraded to special concern in 2005. In Ohio, the Bobcat is still classified as an endangered species and provided full protection.<br/><br/>Reintroduction of Bobcats to Cumberland Island, Georgia was highly successful (Diefebach <em>et al.</em> 2013) suggesting Bobcats can do well when protected. In addition, Kapfer and Potts (2012) found Bobcat harvest in Minnesota could be predicted by season length and suggest population densities can be manipulated by change in length of hunting season.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Males usually call from vegetation overhanging the fastest-flowing stretches of streams, 1-3 m above the water. Amplexus and oviposition are unknown for this species. Eggs are deposited under rocks in streams, and the tadpoles attach themselves to rocks by means of the large oral funnel (Savage 2002).","This species appears to have undergone rapid, dramatic declines across its range, including disappearances within undisturbed habitat, which has been associated with chytridiomycosis as observed in many other montane, steam-associated species across Mesoamerica. Climate change or the synergistic effects of multiple factors could be additional factors in the declines (Pounds&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006; Costa Rica Red List Assessment Workshop September 2019).&#160;Chytrid fungus has been confirmed from within this species' distribution (Puschendorf<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2009), although testing of museum specimens (N=26) so far have revealed no evidence of <em>Bd</em> (De León <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species is still being recorded at some sites, but in much lower numbers than historically. Ranavirus has been documented in other sympatric species at Bosque Eterno de los Niños, so it may represent a threat to this species (S. Whitfield pers. comm. September 2019). Ongoing habitat loss in Panama as a result of logging, cattle ranching, and agriculture is a major threat to the species.","This species was once relatively common across its range (Savage 2002), but experienced drastic declines in all known sites. In Costa Rica, there were no new country records as of 2007, despite some survey effort within its historical range (F. Bolaños pers. comm. 2007). However, in 2010, the species was recorded in&#160;Bosque Eterno de los Niños (F. Bolaños pers. comm. August 2010), and in 2012, one individual was observed in the same area (G. Alvarado and S.

The species prefers dense canopy, but may also be found near bodies of water in clearings or pastures. The subpopulation close to the Parque Nacional Juan Castro Blanco was found in an open area close to secondary forest and some shallow ponds of slow moving water, with additional animals found in secondary growth forest (A. Rojas C.  pers. comm. 2008). Calling and mating take place at night, with males generally calling from vegetation in water. Breeding sites include shallow ponds, puddles or slow-moving waters. Eggs are attached to vegetation (Savage 2002).","This species appears to have undergone historical dramatic declines across Costa Rica, including disappearances within undisturbed habitat, which has been associated with chytridiomycosis as observed in many other montane,&#160;water-associated&#160;species across Mesoamerica.

72477893,5953,Cuon alpinus,Endangered,C2a(i),2015,2015-05-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Dholes have disappeared from most of their historical range. Populations are still declining in most areas due to several main threats which include depletion of prey base, habitat loss, persecution due to livestock predation, disease transmission from domestic dogs, and possibly interspecific competition. Although there is uncertainty in our estimation, we calculate a total population of 4,500-10,500 individuals, of which only 949-2,215 are mature individuals. Most if not all current subpopulations of Dholes are relatively small and isolated, and often exhibit severe fluctuations in numbers. One of the largest remaining subpopulations of dholes was estimated to contain 207-304 individuals, of which only 44-64 were mature individuals. Therefore, Dholes warrant listing as Endangered under criterion C2a(i).","The Dhole is a habitat generalist, and can occur in a wide variety of vegetation types, including: primary, secondary and degraded forms of tropical dry and moist deciduous forests; evergreen and semi-evergreen forests; temperate deciduous forests; boreal forests; dry thorn forests; grassland–scrub–forest mosaics; temperate steppe; and alpine steppe. Consequently, their elevation range is from sea level to as high as 5,300 m asl in Ladakh (R. Simpson pers. comm.). They have not been recorded in desert regions.<br/><br/>The Dhole is one of only three canid species with specialized dental adaptations for an exclusively carnivorous diet, termed hypercarnivory (Van Valkenburgh 1991). Although Dholes consume a wide variety of prey species, ranging from small rodents and hares to Gaur (<em>Bos gaurus</em>; Karanth and Sunquist 1995, Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ramesh <em>et al</em>. 2012, Selvan <em>et al</em>. 2013a), the preferred prey are ungulates with a body mass of 40-60 kg (Selvan <em>et al</em>. 2013b). However, if this prey size is not available, Dholes will selectively prey upon both smaller and larger ungulate species (Kamler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Seasonal changes occur in the Dhole diets, reflecting seasonal changes in availability and numbers of prey (Thinley <em>et al</em>. 2011). In India, Dholes form relatively large packs (usually five to 10, but up to 25 adults) to efficiently hunt large numbers of prey, as well as to protect litters, which are usually large (usually five to 10, but up to 12 pups; Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, in tropical evergreen forests of Southeast Asia, Dholes appear to persist in smaller packs and presumably have smaller litters, probably due the low prey biomass and small size of ungulate prey in these habitats (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2008).<br/><br/>Due to the demands imposed by hypercarnivory, sufficient numbers of ungulate prey are the Dhole’s major habitat requirements. In India, tropical dry and moist deciduous forest may represent optimal habitats, based on the areas thought to hold the largest Dhole populations. Ungulate biomass, particularly that of cervid species, is highest in these habitat types when compared to other habitats in the same region (A. Venkataraman and V.N. Babu unpubl.). Besides prey numbers, other important factors that may influence habitat use include levels of human disturbance, water availability, tiger presence, and suitability of breeding sites (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2013, Srivathsa <em>et al</em>. 2014, J.F. Kamler unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Home range sizes of Dholes reportedly ranged from 23-199 km<sup>2</sup> in India (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Karanth and Sunquist 2000, Acharya 2007) and from 60-80 km<sup>2</sup> in Thailand (Grassman <em>et al</em>. 2005, K. Jenks unpubl. data).","<strong>Depletion of prey base</strong>: This may be the single greatest factor that contributed to the range collapse of Dholes in the northern half of their former distribution, and might be the primary factor for the continued decline of Dholes in the southern half of their distribution. Throughout Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and southeastern China, ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004). All ungulate species, except perhaps Muntjac (<em>Muntiacus</em> spp.) and Wild Pig (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), are ecologically or fully extinct across extensive parts of the region (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004). This situation will likely hinder any possibility of recovery by the region's Dhole populations, even if the other issues could be addressed. Dholes can probably persist as fragmented populations in large protected areas of Bhutan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Indonesia (Sumatra and Java) and Thailand, as long as prey numbers remain sufficient and other threats are controlled. In large protected areas in southern and central India, Dhole numbers are stable where prey densities are high. In northeastern India, prey depletion is contributing to the decline of Dholes in the region (Gopi <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Habitat loss and transformation</strong>: Habitat loss and degradation are serious threats to Dholes in southern Asia, particularly because this threat is closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. Although extensive areas of natural or semi-natural vegetation remain in Lao PDR and Cambodia, habitat conversion and fragmentation are proceeding unabated. In Viet Nam, very few natural areas greater than 50 km<sup>2</sup> remain. Habitat loss and fragmentation is a major threat to protected areas in Indonesia, particularly those on Sumatra. Habitat loss is driven by several different factors, including logging, palm and rubber plantations, agriculture expansion, rural biomass extraction, livestock grazing and major infrastructure expansion (e.g., hydropower dams, irrigation projects, new highways, etc.).<br/><br/><strong>Persecution</strong>: Persecution of Dholes stems mainly from retaliatory killings due to livestock predation, and this factor is driving some Dhole populations towards local extinction (Lyngdoh <em>et al</em>. 2014). Dholes appear to be especially susceptible to poisoning of carcasses using strychnine or other rodenticides, which often are readily available to rural people in southern Asia. Consequently, unsystematic but consistent poisoning of carcasses can easily wipe out Dholes within an area, especially because the entire pack will feed on a carcass. For example, poisoning of livestock carcasses apparently wiped out Dholes from Bhutan in the 1970s and early 1980s, although this species began to re-occupy the country starting in the 1990s (Wangchuk 2004, Thinley <em>et al</em>. 2011). Killing of Dholes by poisoning livestock carcasses also has been reported in China, Nepal, India and Indonesia, and is likely is widespread in southern Asia. Poisoning campaigns also were thought to have contributed to the extirpation of Dholes in the countries of the former Soviet Union (Ginsberg and Macdonald 1990).&#160;<br/><br/>Dholes reportedly have been shot by humans, as Dhole carcasses with gun-shot wounds were found near the boundary of protected areas in Thailand (K. Jenks and N. Songsasen unpubl.). Dholes are probably susceptible to non-selective snaring, particularly where this activity is widespread such as in Viet Nam, Cambodia, China and Lao PDR. In India, and possibly elsewhere, Dholes living outside or on the edge of core protected areas are particularly vulnerable to human kleptoparasitism.<br/><br/><strong>Disease and pathogens</strong>: Dholes are susceptible to rabies, canine distemper, canine parvovirus and sarcoptic mange among others (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004), which are usually contracted from domestic village dogs that act as reservoirs. Dholes appear to be especially susceptible to disease epizootics due their large pack sizes and high levels of amicable behaviour within packs, even among adults (Johnsingh 1982). Such behaviours likely result in relatively high intraspecific contact rates, which are conducive for disease epizootics, at least compared to other wild canids such as jackals (<em>Canis aureus</em>) which are more solitary. Disease epizootics may contribute to the sudden disappearance of Dholes from protected areas, and often cause severe local population fluctuations resulting in relatively small pack sizes (Karanth and Sunquist 2000, J. Kamler pers. obs.). In Cambodia, a recent outbreak of canine distemper in 2011-2012, thought to have originated in local domestic dogs, caused the near-extirpation of Dholes from protected areas in the eastern and northern parts of the country (J. Kamler unpubl.), although populations appear to be recovering; mortalities associated with canine distemper also have been observed in a protected area in Thailand (N. Songsasen and K. Jenks unpubl).&#160;The range-wide effects of diseases on Dhole population dynamics is unknown, but it is likely significant across southern Asia, and might result in an increased probability of extirpation for Dhole populations in isolated protected areas.<br/><br/><strong>Competition with other species</strong>: Aside from humans, the main competitors of Dholes for limited resources are Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and Leopards (<em>P. pardus</em>). Although Dholes are much smaller in body size, packs of Dholes reportedly have killed both Tigers and Leopards, although the reverse also has been reported (Burton 1940). The dominance hierarchy between Dholes and Tigers is not clear, although Dholes likely avoid tigers especially if packs are small. Dholes appear to be behaviourally dominant over Leopards, and packs of Dholes often tree this species when they interact (Venkataraman 1995). Whether large felids can negatively affect Dhole numbers is unknown, although the exploitive and interference competition between them likely becomes more intense as prey populations are reduced by humans, possibly resulting in spatial exclusion where prey numbers are lowest. Free-ranging dogs also may compete with Dholes for limited food resources where prey numbers are low.","<strong>Background</strong><strong><br/></strong>Because so little is known about Dhole ecology, we used African Wild Dogs (<em>Lycaon pictus</em>) as a surrogate species for estimating the proportion of mature individuals and generation length. Of the canids, African Wild Dogs are arguably most similar to Dholes. Both species have specialized dental morphology for obligate hypercarnivory (Van Valkenburgh 1991), which is rather unique among canids. Phylogenetic research shows both species are in the same monophyletic group (Lindblad-Toh <em>et al</em>. 2005), and otherwise both species are similar in body size, reproduction, social behaviour and feeding behaviour (Johnsingh 1982). Consequently, much of the text below comes directly from the IUCN assessment for the African Wild Dog (Woodroffe and Sillero-Zubiri 2012).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the number of “mature individuals” is challenging for Dholes, because like African Wild Dogs, they are obligate cooperative breeders (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman 1998). Consequently, within a pack the alpha male and female are the parents of the majority of surviving pups (Venkataraman 1998). Although the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012) define mature individuals as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction”, it does not specify the time period within which reproduction is considered possible. The User Guidelines (IUCN 2014) go on to state “in many taxa there is a pool of non-reproductive (e.g., suppressed) individuals that will quickly become reproductive if a mature individual dies. These individuals can be considered to be capable of reproduction”. As with African Wild Dogs, a high proportion of individual Dholes within a park are indeed reproductively suppressed (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman 1998), but these animals do not necessarily become reproductive “quickly” if an alpha individual dies. In a mature pack, most pack members are offspring of the alpha pair; for these animals, death of an alpha would usually not open up a breeding opportunity because no unrelated mates would be available within the pack. Given these complexities, and in keeping with the spirit of capturing a “snapshot” of current conditions, we have chosen to define mature individuals as those considered capable of reproduction within the current breeding season. The number of mature individuals thus comprises the number of alpha males and females, and the number of sub-dominant (i.e. non-alpha) animals that breed successfully.<br/><br/>Following that reported for Africa Wild Dogs (Woodroffe and Sillero-Zubiri 2012), we estimated for Dholes the number of mature individuals (Nm) from populations of adults and yearlings (Nc). The number of alpha males (NaM) and alpha females (NaF) would be estimated with the following equations:<br/><br/>NaM = Nc x 0.55 x 0.176NaF = Nc x 0.45 x 0.215<br/><br/>The above equations result in approximately equal estimates of the numbers of alpha males and alpha females. Also following that reported for African Wild Dogs (Woodroffe and Sillero-Zubiri 2012), we estimated for Dholes the number of sub-dominant breeders (Nsub) as:<br/><br/>Nsub = (NaM x 0.10) + (NaF x 0.08)<br/><br/>Therefore, the number of mature individuals (Nm) for Dholes could be calculated using the following equation:<br/><br/>Nm = NaM + NaF + Nsub<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Population size and densities</strong><br/>Population estimates of Dholes are not available for any country. Therefore, we made an attempt to estimate the total population of Dholes by classifying countries within their current distribution as having high (1,500-3,000), medium (750-1,500), or low (250-750) numbers of Dholes. These classifications were based on estimates of relative abundances and area covered by Dholes within each country. We classified one country as having high numbers of Dholes (India), two countries with medium numbers (Thailand, Myanmar), six countries with low numbers (Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Nepal), and four countries with negligible numbers (Bangladesh, Korea DPR, Pakistan, Viet Nam). Consequently, we estimate the total population of Dholes to be 4,500–10,500. Although there is relatively high uncertainty with this population estimate, it has a large range and we feel that it adequately represents the possible population size of Dholes.<br/><br/>To calculate total population of mature individuals, we used the equations above to show an estimate of 436-1,016 alpha males (NaM), 435-1016 alpha females (NaF), and 78-183 sub-dominant breeders (Nsub). This resulted in an estimate of 949-2,215 mature individuals (Nm), which is below the 2,500 threshold (i.e., one of the criteria for listing as EN under C).<br/><br/>The only estimates of local Dhole densities come from a few protected areas in India. Only one of those estimates has been obtained through systematic sample-based survey methods (Selvan <em>et al</em>. 2014), whereas the others are presumably based on estimates of the number of packs within the protected areas (derived using known home range areas and knowledge of mean pack sizes). Reported Dhole densities were 0.066 Dholes/km<sup>2</sup> in Pakke Tiger Reserve (Selvan <em>et al</em>. 2014), 0.095 Dholes/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, 0.13 Dholes/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Bandipur Tiger Reserve, and 0.3 Dholes/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Pench National Park (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The size of subpopulations of Dholes has not been reported anywhere. Therefore, the following is our estimate of the size of one of the largest subpopulations of Dholes, which is presumed to be in the Western Ghats of India, based on high prey numbers and extent of protected forests in the region. This region contains the most intensively studied subpopulation of Dholes in the world (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Karanth and Sunquist 1995, Venkataraman 1998, Karanth and Sunquist 2000, Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ramesh <em>et al</em>. 2012, Srivathsa <em>et al</em>. 2014). Srivathsa <em>et al</em>. (2014) estimated the proportion of area occupied by Dholes in the Malenad landscape (Western Ghats in the State of Karnataka), by assessing ""true occupancy"" in 206 grid-cells (188&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;each). This area covers 16 wildlife reserves, where the highest numbers of Dholes are likely restricted to four source populations: Anshi-Dandeli, Bhadra, Nagarahole-Bandipur and Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) reserves. Abundance was derived from estimates of occupancy, based on the Royle-Nichols (2003) occupancy model [abundance in a grid-cell= Log (1/(1-PSI))] for all the 206 grid-cells. We calculated a range of abundances for each source population, which likely represent one metapopulation. The lower limit of this range is the sum of grid-cell-wise abundances from those cells that intersect with the reserve boundaries; the upper limit of this range is the sum of grid-cell-wise abundances for the reserve+the cells that are first order neighbours for the reserve cells (with contiguous forest habitats). The following are the abundance ranges for the four source populations: Anshi-Dandeli = 15-46; Bhadra = 23-39; Nagarahole-Bandipur = 85-91, BRT = 24-28. We estimate the remaining forested landscape may support 60-100 Dholes, resulting in a total population of 207-304 individuals. To calculate total number of mature individuals in this subpopulation, we used the above equations which resulted in an estimate of 44-64 mature individuals (20-29 alpha males, 20-29 alpha females, four to six sub-dominant breeders). Clearly, even one of the largest subpopulations of Dholes contains well below 250 mature individuals (i.e., the criterion for listing as EN under C2a(i)).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Change in population size</strong><br/>There is almost no quantitative information on Dhole population trends through their distribution. In fact, a common characteristic of Dhole populations is that they often exhibit severe local population fluctuations (Johnsingh 1982, Venkataraman 1998, Karanth and Sunquist 2000, Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004, J. Kamler pers. obs.), which makes estimating populations and population trends difficult. We estimate that the total population of Dholes is still decreasing, due to the continuous decline in their distribution.",Decreasing,"Historically, Dholes occurred throughout South and East Asia, to as far north as the southern parts of the Russian Federation (including the Amur region and upper Lena River north of Lake Baikal), and as far west as the mountains ranging from eastern Kazakhstan to northern Pakistan (Altai, Tian Shan, Pamir and western Himalayan mountains; Heptner and Naumov 1967). Dholes have disappeared from &gt;75% of their historic range, and most remaining populations are fragmented and still appear to be declining based on scattered surveys and personal observations. Their current distribution, based on recent information we consider reliable, is described below.<br/><br/><strong>Central and East Asia</strong>: there have been no confirmed reports of Dholes in more than 30 years from the Russian Federation, Mongolia, Kazakhstan (formerly in the Altai and Tian Shan mountains), Kyrgyzstan (formerly in the Tian Shan and Pamir mountains), Afghanistan (formerly in Pamir Mountains), Tajikistan (formerly in Pamir Mountains) or Uzbekistan (formerly in Tian Shan Mountains), and they are likely extirpated from these regions (A. Poyarkov and N. Ovsyanikov in litt., D. Miquelle pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Bangladesh</strong>: Dholes still occur in some forest reserves in the Sylhet area in northeastern Bangladesh, as well the Chittagong Hill Tracts in southeastern region. However, these areas are unlikely to contain viable populations because Dholes are usually sighted only as solitary individuals, or in small groups of two to three adults. Dhole numbers appear to be decreasing in these areas due to a decreasing prey base (S. Chakma pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Bhutan</strong>: Although Dholes were nearly extirpated in Bhutan in the 1970s and early 1980s due to poisoning campaigns, this species began to re-occupy the country starting in the 1990s (Wangchuk 2004, Thinley <em>et al</em>. 2011). Based on sign and interviews with park managers, they now occur in most, if not all, protected areas in the country (J. Kamler unpubl. data).<br/><br/><strong>Cambodia</strong>: There are recent (under five years old) records of Dholes in the Cardamom Mountains (FFI-Cambodia Programme unpubl. data), the northern plains landscape (WCS Cambodia Program unpubl. data), the eastern plains landscape (J. Kamler unpubl. data), and northeastern Cambodia (Siem Pang Province; D. Willcox unpubl. data). Dholes do not likely exist in viable populations outside of these areas. A recent outbreak of canine distemper in 2011-2012, thought to have originated in local domestic dogs, caused the near-extirpation of Dholes in both the eastern and northern plains landscapes (J. Kamler and A. Suzuki unpubl. data), but it appears these populations are slowly recovering as of 2015.<br/><br/><strong>China</strong>: Historically Dholes occurred throughout China, but their current status and distribution is highly uncertain, and they are likely extirpated throughout most of the country. Despite extensive surveys throughout the country, recent (&lt;10 years) records from China come only from six provinces: Gansu, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and Xinjiang. In northern Gansu Province, Dholes were recently reported from the Qilian Shan Mountains as a pack was observed there in 2003 (Harris 2006) and a mother with pups was photographed in Yanchiwan Nature Reserve in 2013 (Riordan <em>et al</em>. 2015). As the Qilian Shan Mountains extend into northern Qinghai Province, Dholes still might occur there as well. In southeastern Xinjiang Province, camera traps recorded Dholes during 2012-2013 in the Altun (Altyn-Tagh) Mountains (Xue <em>et al</em>. 2014). In western Xinjiang Province, there were sightings by local people during 2011-2013 in Taxkorgan Nature Reserve (Riordan <em>et al</em>. 2015). In central Sichuan, a Dhole was photographed in 2012 in Heishuihe Nature Reserve in the Qionglai Mountains (Y. Zhou pers. comm.). Although one Dhole was observed in 2003 in Tangjiahe Nature Reserve in northern Sichuan (Y. Zhou pers. comm.), there have been no camera trap photos or other confirmed records in the past 10 years (S. Li pers. comm.). Dholes may occur in the Minshan Mountains (northern Sichua) and Daxue Shan Mountains (western Sichuan), as there are former records from there and current prey densities are relatively high (S. Li pers. comm., Li <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Shaanxi Province, a Dhole was recently recorded during a camera trap study in Guanyinshan Nature Reserve in the Qinling Mountains (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, camera trap studies in several other nature reserves in Shaanxi failed to record Dholes (S. Li pers. comm.), so their numbers must be extremely low in the area. In Yunnan Province, Dholes were photographed in camera traps in both the Nangunhe and Xishuangbanna nature reserves in 2012-13 near the border with Myanmar (Wildlife Institute, Beijing Forestry University, unpubl.), but Dhole numbers are likely low there due to highly fragmented habitat, high poaching, and extremely low prey densities (S. Li pers. comm.). In TAR, camera traps recorded Dholes in 2014 in Motuo (Mêdog) County (southeastern TAR; S. Li pers. comm.). Although there are few recent records, Dholes may still occur in the southern parts of TAR, as this species was recorded in the Mt. Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) Nature Reserve (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014). In southeastern China, the last two records of Dholes come from Jiangxi Province: the unconfirmed report of one captured in early 2000s (C. Bellamy pers. comm.), and an unconfirmed photo taken by a camera trap in Taohongling Nature Reserve in 2010 (S. Li pers. comm.). However, there have been no confirmed reports or additional records from other areas, and they are now likely extirpated from the region. Interviews with local people suggested that Dholes disappeared from large areas of central and southern China during the 1980s and early 1990s, after locals starting poisoning carcasses in retaliation for livestock losses from Dholes (S. Li pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>India</strong>: Dholes occur in several regions of India, and this country undoubtedly contains the largest numbers of Dholes. That said, Dholes have disappeared from 60% of their historic range in India during the past 100 years (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2010). Relatively high populations of Dholes are still found in the Western Ghats and central Indian forests, due to high prey numbers and extent of protected forests, whereas lower numbers of Dholes are found in the Eastern Ghats (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2009). Dholes are also found in the northeastern states, although numbers are low and decreasing in this region due to a decreasing prey base and retaliatory killings from livestock predation (Gopi <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lyngdoh <em>et al</em>. 2014). Dholes are found in some areas of Terai region in northern India (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2009), although their exact distribution there is unknown. In the Himalayan region, Dholes were recently reported from Sikkim (Bashir <em>et al</em>. 2014), and in 2008 near Tso Kar in Ladakh (R. Simpson pers. comm.), thus they may occur in other areas of Ladakh as well.<br/><br/><strong>Indonesia (Sumatra and Java)</strong>: Historically, Dholes occurred throughout both Sumatra and Java; however, their current distribution on both islands is fragmented and greatly reduced. On Sumatra, Dholes have recently been confirmed in several national parks along the Barisan Mountain range, ranging from the northern to southern parts of the island (e.g., Gunung Leuser, Kerinci Seblat and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks; FFI, WCS and WWF country programs unpubl. data). Dholes also have been recently confirmed in several protected areas in lowland forests in the east-central part of the island (e.g., Tesso Nilo and Bukit Tigapuluh National Parks, Harapan Rainforest and Batang Hari Protection Forest; FFI and WWF country programs unpubl. data). On Java, Dholes have recently been confirmed in national parks only in the extreme western (e.g., Gunung Gede Pangrango, Ujung Kulon and Gunung Halimum Salak National Parks) and eastern (e.g., Baluran National Park and Alas Purwo National Park) parts of the island (A. Ario pers. comm.). They are likely extirpated in other regions of the island.<br/><br/><strong>Korean peninsula</strong>: Historically, Dholes occurred on the Korean peninsula, but were likely extirpated throughout most of their range by the 1970s (Won and Smith 1999). In the 1980s Dholes were confirmed to still occur on Mt. Pakdoo in northeastern Korea DPR, near the Chinese border (Won and Smith 1999). However, there have been no available data since that time, so their status in Korea DPR remains uncertain. They are certainly extirpated from the Republic of Korea.<br/><br/><strong>Lao PDR</strong>: There are recent (under five years old) records of Dholes from northern Lao PDR (Nam Et-Phou Louey [NEPL] and Nam Ha protected areas) and in central Lao PDR (Nakai-Nam Theun and Nam Kading protected areas; WCS-Lao PDR program unpubl. data, C. Coudrat pers. comm.). The most studied and perhaps largest population of Dholes in the country is in NEPL (Kamler <em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no recent records of Dholes in southern Lao PDR, and they are probably extirpated from this region.<br/><br/><strong>Malaysia (peninsula)</strong>: The historical range of Dholes likely included the entire Malaysian peninsula, possibly even what is now Singapore. Dholes are now extirpated from Singapore and the southern forests of the Malaysian peninsula (Endau-Rompin complex; WCS Malaysia Program, unpubl.). Based on recent camera trapping surveys, Dholes still occur in the central (Taman Negara) and northern (Belum-Temengor complex) forested areas of the Malaysian peninsula (K. Kawanishi pers. comm.).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Myanmar</strong>: The current distribution of Dholes in Myanmar is uncertain. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, they were recorded by camera traps at 11 of 15 survey areas scattered across the country (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, numbers and distribution may have decreased since that time. For example, Dholes had been recorded in Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary in western Myanmar, where they reportedly predated on livestock. Apparently, local people persecuted Dholes in retribution, and consequently Dholes were not detected in Chatthin during recent camera-trapping surveys (N. M. Shwe unpubl. data). Since 2005, Dholes have been recorded from several protected areas in Myanmar, including the northern region (Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctcuary and Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary), west-central region (Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary and Namataung National Park), southwestern region (Rakhine Yoma Elephant Range), and peninsula region (Tanintharyi Nature Reserve; WCS Myanmar Program unpubl. data). From 1999-2002, Dholes were recorded in at least eight additional forest tracts and protected areas the in northern, western, and central parts of the country (WCS Myanmar Program unpubl. data), thus Dholes may still occur throughout these regions. There are few confirmed records of Dholes from eastern Myanmar, although they likely occur near the tri-border area with Lao PDR and Thailand, as there are records in that area from those countries. There are recent records of dholes from camera-trap studies in Karen (Kayin) State (R. McEwing pers. comm.), but their status in other areas of eastern Myanmar is not known.<br/><br/><strong>Nepal</strong>: Dhole sightings in Nepal are not common, yet there are recent reports of this species in several areas of country. In the Himalayan region, Dholes reportedly occur in the western (Rara and Khaptad National Parks, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve; R. D. Choudhary pers. comm., A. Aryal in litt.) and extreme eastern parts (Kanchenjunga Conservation Area; Khatiwada 2011) of the country. In southern Nepal, Dholes are found throughout much of the Terai Arc Landscape, including Chitwan and Bardia national parks (Thapa <em>et al</em>. 2013, A. Khatiwada pers. comm.), and Parsa and Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserves (A. Khatiwada pers. comm.). Dholes also are reported in several districts of Nepal outside protected areas, but all populations are extremely low and threatened by low prey base, poisoning and habitat loss (A. Khatiwada pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Pakistan</strong>: Although there are no confirmed records of Dholes from Pakistan, they historically occurred in the western Himalayan Mountains in the northern part of the country. They might still occur in the Ladakh region of northern Parkistan, as Dholes recently have been recorded in the India-administered region of Ladakh.<br/><br/><strong>Thailand</strong>: Dholes have been extirpated from most areas of Thailand, and are now absent from the peninsula and eastern parts of the country. Dholes are still found in fragmented populations in several large protected-area complexes, including the south-central region (Phayayen-Khao Yai and Eastern Forest complexes), north-central region (Phumieng-Phuthong and Phukhieo-Namnow complexes), northwestern region (Srilanna-Khutan and Doi Phucar-Maeyom complexes), and western region (Western Forest Complex; Jenks <em>et al. </em>2012; Department of National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Thailand). It is not yet known how stable are these isolated populations, and if the protected-area complexes are large enough to conserve viable Dhole populations in the long term.<br/><br/><strong>Viet Nam</strong>: There are very few recent confirmed records on Dholes in Viet Nam. The last confirmed records of Dholes were in Pu Mat National Park in 1998-99 (D. Willcox pers. comm.) and in Yok Don National Park in 2003 (J. Eames pers. comm.) despite extensive camera trapping in &gt;25 protected areas throughout the country. Along with other large carnivores, Dholes are likely extirpated from Viet Nam, although individuals may occasionally enter the country from neighboring Cambodia or Lao PDR","There is no widespread exploitation of Dholes for fur or other purposes, and there apparently is little if any value for their use as traditional medicines. Thus, wildlife trade does not directly affect Dholes.",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legal protection</strong><br/>It is included in CITES – Appendix II (2013).&#160;Dholes are legally protected in the countries where they occur. However, enforcement of laws is insufficient to provide effective protection of Dholes in many of their range countries. Local governments sometimes may still offer bounties on Dholes to reduce livestock predation, as was recently the case in western Myanmar. In Thailand, Dholes were recently blamed for the decline of wild ungulates in some protected areas, and as a result some government officials have proposed to eliminate Dholes from those areas (K. Jenks and N. Songsasen unpubl.). Dholes also may have been intentionally extirpated from some protected areas by local officials in southeastern China in an attempt to boost ungulate numbers (S. Li pers. comm.). Providing compensation, incentives or insurance for livestock-Dhole conflicts to reduce retaliatory killing of Dholes may be a good conservation strategy and should be tested (Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2011, Gurung <em>et al</em>. 2011). Similarly, incentives for conservation of habitat, Dholes and their prey should be explored.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Although this species occurs in protected areas throughout its range, there are no conservation measures specifically focused on Dholes, except for a few isolated localities like eastern Nepal. For the putative northern Dholes, their occurrence in China was recently confirmed by camera traps in several isolated nature reserves. However, lack of data on numbers of Dholes and their prey in these reserves prevent a valid assessment as to their potential for conserving Dholes in the long-term. For the putative southern Dholes, both Project Tiger and Project Elephant in India have the potential to conserve populations of Dholes and their prey in areas where they coexist with tigers and elephants. However, Dholes require up to five times the land area as tigers to maintain viable long-term populations, and consequently Dholes have disappeared from more reserves than have tigers (Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1998). Thus, relatively large (&gt;750 km<sup>2</sup>) reserves in India might be the most effective for conserving Dhole populations. Large protected-area complexes for Tiger conservation in Bhutan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Indonesia (Sumatra), and Thailand, also are conserving Dhole populations, thus these areas hold the greatest potential for the long-term conservation of Dholes in South and Southeast Asia. Consolidating more forest areas and including them in protected area networks would greatly enhance the conservation of Dholes in these regions.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>As of August 2013, there were at least 223 Dholes in 38 zoos worldwide (International Species Information System [ISIS] unpubl.), including zoos in Europe (24 zoos), Asia (nine zoos), North America (four zoos), and Australia (one zoo). There also are captive Dholes in additional zoos and breeding farms which are not members of ISIS. The origin of most captive Dholes is unclear, and their subspecific classification is probably wrong. The most numerous subspecies in captivity is listed as <em>C. a. lepturus</em>, which occurs in at least 20 zoos worldwide and is the most common Dhole in European zoos. Firstly, inbreeding may be an issue because captive Dholes listed as <em>lepturus </em>trace their origin to only three founders: a single Dhole from a game farm in North America with an unknown origin (H. Maisch pers. comm.), and Dholes from the Moscow Zoo, which originated from only two individuals captured in Qinghai Province, China in 1957 (Sosnovskii 1967). Secondly, the Dholes captured in Qinghai Province should represent either <em>C. a. hesperius</em> or <em>C. a. fumosus</em>, from the putative northern Dhole group, rather than <em>lepturus </em>which historically occurred only south of the Yangtze River and is part of the southern Dhole group (Durbin et al. 2004). The putative southern Dholes are represented in several Indian zoos (probably <em>C. alpinus dukhunensis</em>), and in zoos in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Sydney, Australia (<em>C. alpinus infuscus</em>). Other zoos do not list subspecies, thus it is likely that putative subspecies from different origins have been interbred (M. Boeer pers. comm.), such as that done in Singapore Zoo. The European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) does not consider subspecies, but it does regard Dholes in European zoos as a Chinese ecotype, and prevents mixing this type with Dholes from other origins (e.g., India, Cambodia). Nevertheless, the value of any of captive Dholes for potential reintroduction efforts is uncertain, at least until genetic studies can confirm their origin and subspecific classification. Until that time, we recommend that captive Dholes from the putative northern and southern groups be managed separately, such as that done by the EEP.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Research needs</strong><br/>More research is needed on Dholes to better understand their ecology and assist conservation efforts. These include: 1) develop cost-effective surveys to determine the abundance of Dholes, as data on Dhole numbers would allow us to better understand their conservation status; 2) investigate the genetic and morphological differences between the putative northern and southern Dholes, and the distinctiveness of other putative subspecies such as the Sumatran and Javan Dholes; 3) determine the area and prey requirements needed to maintain a viable Dhole population; 4) investigate the effects of disease on Dhole population dynamics, and; 5) investigate effects of Dholes on ecosystems, specifically their interactions with other large carnivores, and their impacts on prey and smaller carnivores.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
81069636,23049,Vulpes bengalensis,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Indian Fox is endemic to the Indian subcontinent. Although widespread, it occurs at low densities throughout its range, and populations can undergo fluctuations due to prey availability and disease. Due to loss of short grassland-scrub habitat to intensive agriculture, industry and development projects the Indian Fox population is likely to be experiencing a slow decline. However, any decline is unlikely to be sufficient to warrant the listing of the species in a threatened category and the species is currently assessed as Least Concern.","The Indian Fox prefers semi-arid, flat to undulating terrain, scrub and grassland habitats where it is easy to hunt and dig dens. It avoids dense forests, steep terrain, tall grasslands and true deserts (Johnsingh and Jhala 2004). The species is relatively common in areas of low rainfall, where the vegetation is typically scrub, thorn or dry deciduous forests, or short grasslands (Rodgers <em>et al.</em> 2000). In the Indian peninsula, the species is restricted to plains and open scrub forest. Home ranges have been estimated at about 2 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Maurya 2012). Diet mostly consists of arthropods, rodents, reptiles, fruits and birds, in that order of occurrence in scats (Home and Jhala 2009). Pups are born between December and February, but can be as late as March. Short resource rich grassland patches in an agro-pastoral landscape are preferred for denning and pup rearing (Punjabi <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Although the Indian Fox is widespread, it occurs generally at low densities throughout its range, and populations can undergo major fluctuations due to prey availability and disease (rabies and canine distemper virus have been recorded to cause local population declines in western India). They can tolerate some human disturbance, although with expanding human populations and continued development of grasslands for agricultural and industrial uses, the habitat of the Indian Fox is continuously being depleted. The combination of above factors along with disease and/or natural mortality could potentially cause localized extirpations. In certain states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, Indian Fox habitat is widespread with minimal threats, while in other states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu the habitats of the Indian Fox are under threat (Johnsingh and Jhala 2004).","Although widespread, the Indian Fox is nowhere abundant in its range, with densities greatest in semi-arid grasslands of peninsular&#160;India. Densities seem to track rodent abundance (Johnsingh and Jhala 2004), which fluctuates widely between years in the species' prime habitat (arid and semi-arid zones) (Prakash 1975, Tripathi <em>et al.</em> 1992). Densities of breeding pairs ranged from 0.25–0.4/km<sup>2</sup> in the Kutch area of Gujarat (Maurya 2012).",Decreasing,"The Indian Fox is endemic to the Indian subcontinent. It ranges from the foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal to the southern tip of the Indian peninsula (but it is absent from the Western and Eastern Ghats). The species' range extends from Sindh province of Pakistan to north Bengal in the eastern part of India (Johnsingh and Jhala 2004). Occurs up to 1,500 m in Nepal and north-eastern India (Gompper and Vanak 2006).","There are no known commercial uses for the Indian Fox, although there is limited localized hunting and trade for skin, tail, teeth and claws for medicinal and charm purposes. There is otherwise no trade or potential for trade of the Indian Fox.",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>The populations of India are listed on CITES Appendix III.

Occurrence of the Indian Fox in Langtan National Park and Shey Wildlife Reserve in Nepal was reported by Shrestha (1997); however, this has not been confirmed and is considered unlikely (Johnsingh and Jhala 2004).&#160;In India, the species also occurs in the Desert National Park in Rajasthan; Velavadar Blackbuck National Park, Kachchh Bustard Sanctuary, Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary in Gujarat; Sholapur Bustard Sanctuary in Maharashtra; Rollapadu Wildlife Sanctuary in Andhra Pradesh as well as several other protected areas. &#160;<br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>The Indian Fox is held in captivity in several zoos in India, where the species breeds well. In 2001, there were 15 males, 14 females, and 11 unsexed individuals in several zoos (Central Zoo Authority pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Gaps in knowledge</strong><br/>A status survey is needed to identify areas throughout the species' range that have large, relatively secure fox populations. In some of these areas, an in-depth, long-term study is needed on population dynamics of the Indian Fox.

It is also common in its native range in East Asian countries. Although subject to some possible localized declines, there is no evidence to suggest that the species is at any risk of extinction, and is listed as Least Concern.","Two features are typical of the habitat of Raccoon Dogs: 1) they are often found near water; and 2) during autumn they are more or less dependent on fruits and berries, which affect their habitat selection. In Japan, their habitat includes deciduous forests, broad-leaved evergreen forests, mixed forests, farmlands, and urban areas from coastal to subalpine zones. In the countryside, the species prefers herbaceous habitat and uses less <em>Cryptomeria</em> plantation throughout year, while riparian areas are often used (Kauhala and Saeki 2004b). In urban areas, Raccoon Dogs inhabit areas with as little as 5% forest cover (Yamamoto <em>et al</em>. 1995). In the Russian Far East, the Raccoon Dog favours open landscape, especially damp meadows and agricultural land and avoids dark forests (Judin 1977). <br/><br/>In the introduced range, Raccoon Dogs favour moist meadows and other habitats with abundant undergrowth, mixed forests and shores of rivers and lakes, especially in early summer (Korneev 1954, Nasimovic and Isakov 1985, Kauhala 1996). In late summer and autumn, they favour moist heaths with abundant berries (Morozov 1947, Kauhala 1996). However, in the Finnish archipelago, they live in barren pine forests where they feed on crowberries (<em>Empetrum nigrum</em>) (Kauhala and Auniola 2000).&#160;In Finland, generally the best landscape for Raccoon Dogs is a landscape with abundant undergrowth, a mosaic of moist forests, damp meadows, gardens and agricultural area (Kauhala and Auttila 2010, Kauhala <em>et al</em>. 2010). The population is sparse in large coniferous forests.","Raccoon Dogs are still persecuted across much of their native range as a pest species. They also may be affected locally by predation from feral dogs, road kills, and from epidemics (including scabies and canine distemper virus), and in some cases may be declining due to extreme habitat loss. The Raccoon Dog is an important vector and victim of rabies in Europe, with increasing significance towards the east and north.","Outside of Japan, where the species is common, there is no information on abundance in their native range. Lau <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted that in China they probably still exist in the wild in parts of Guangxi and Guangdong, but are otherwise likely to be threatened. Population estimates have never been&#160;conducted in Japan, but indirect indices (e.g., road-kills per km of the National Express-ways and harvest&#160;density per prefecture), suggest that relative abundance is high in south-western parts of Japan (i.e., Kyushu, Shikoku, and Chugoku) and low in Hokkaido, Chubu, and extremely urban areas (Kauhala and Saeki 2004b; and see&#160;Table 5.4.2 therein). In Viet Nam, the southerly extent of their range, there is very little information available on their status. A survey undertaken in 2004 in five areas in Na Hang District, Tuyen Quang Province, recorded two captive young animals in Na Vang village after apparently having been taken from a small cave (presumably a den) in Lung Nhoi area (Le Trong Trai <em>et al</em>. 2004), but there is otherwise no other recent information.<br/><br/>The species is common in the introduced range; for example, in Finland the adult population consists of 110,000-120,000 individuals (hunting bag 160,000-170,000 individuals each year). The autumn population, including the young of the year would be about 320,000.",Stable,"The native range of this species extends from northern Indochina (ranging as far south as north-eastern Viet Nam, east of the Red River, and southern Yunnan province in China) through the eastern provinces of China and the Korean Peninsula to the south-east corner of Russia and Mongolia. In the Japanese Archipelago, the species is present throughout Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Awaji island, Sado island and other islets of Japan except those south of Kyushu (e.g., Okinawa islands, Nansei islands, Miyako islands and Ogasawara islands). Introduced to Yakushima island (S. Azuma, in Kauhala and Saeki 2004b).&#160;Absent from Hainan and Taiwan, Province of China.&#160;<br/><br/>The species was introduced in the early to mid-part of the 20th Century to European parts of the former Soviet Union and since then the species has become widespread in northern and eastern Europe, thriving in a landscape which is a mosaic of moist forests with abundant undergrowth, damp meadows and gardens (Kauhala<em> et al</em>. 2010). The northern limit of distribution lies in areas where the mean temperature of the year is just above 0°C, the snow cover &lt;800 mm, the duration of the snow cover &lt;175 days and the length of the growing season &gt;135 days (for example, in Finland the northern limit of permanent distribution is between 65°N and the Arctic Circle). In recent years, when winters have become milder, the Raccoon Dog has expanded its range northwards (in Finland, up to 67°N). Raccoon Dogs appear to have been expanding their range in recent times, including a record in 2002 from the central part of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (at the time the southernmost point of its European range; Ćirović 2006) and a road-kill in south-eastern Spain in 2008 (Kauhala and&#160;Kowalczyk 2011). The latter authors provide a detailed review of the history of colonization of the Raccoon Dog in Europe.","The Russians introduced Raccoon Dogs into the wild in the European part of the former Soviet Union because they wanted to establish a valuable new fur animal in the wild. Raccoon Dog furs continue to be commercially sold, although today they are produced in fur farms. While the species is still commonly farmed for fur in Finland (albeit less intensively than 20-30 years ago), Raccoon Dogs are no longer farmed in Sweden or Hungary, where the last fur farm was closed in 1995. In Japan, Raccoon Dog fur is also used in the production of calligraphic brushes, stuffed animals, and other products. Today, Raccoon Dogs are mainly hunted because they are considered pests.&#160;In Japan, legal culling increased from the 1970s to 15,176 animals in 2012. However, the numbers harvested has declined from a peak of 76,000 in 1981. In China, about 15 million Raccoon Dogs were held by fur farmers in 2010, and China is the largest producer and exporter of Raccoon Dog fur in the world (Petry and Liting 2010). In Finland, the yearly hunting bag for 2013 was about 160,000 animals (Finnish Game and Fisheries Research Institute 2014). In Poland, where Raccoon Dogs are hunted from August to March, the annual bag was 450–600 in the early 1990s, but more than 11,000 are now hunted annually (Kauhala and Kowalczyk 2011). In Germany, 30,000 Raccoon Dogs were hunted in the hunting season of 2008/2009 (Anon., in Kauhala and Kowalczyk 2011).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Not listed in the CITES Appendices.<br/><br/>In many countries in the introduced part of their range, where the Raccoon Dog is legally hunted, hunting is permitted year round (e.g., Sweden, Hungary). However, in Finland, females with pups are protected in May, June and July, and in Belarus hunting is allowed from 1 October to the end of February. In Japan, hunting/trapping of the species requires a licence or other form of permission and can only occur within the designated hunting season (November 15 to February 15). The Raccoon Dog on Mukojima island (18.4 km²), Hiroshima prefecture, is designated as a natural monument under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties, and permission from the Director-General of the Agency of Cultural Affairs is required for capturing the animals on the island.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Raccoon Dogs occur in national parks and other wildlife protection areas in Japan, where hunting and some other activities are prohibited. Elsewhere across their range, they occur in numerous protected areas and wildlife sanctuaries. <br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>In Japan, around 40 zoos hold captive animals and successful breeding has been reported (e.g., Kobe Municipal Zoo).

It migrates on a broad front, the autumn migration beginning in late July and peaking in August or early September (in Europe and Egypt), with birds beginning to arrive in East and West Africa in early September, peaking in October (Scott and Rose 1996). Once the species reaches Africa it migrates in relation to seasonal flooding, the central point of its occurrence shifting gradually along the course of rivers as the winter progresses (Alerstam 1990). The spring migration begins in February, with birds beginning to arrive on breeding grounds from mid-March to early-May (Scott and Rose 1996). It is a highly sociable and gregarious species (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988), and whilst breeding can be found in single pairs or small groups, but regularly forms large congregations of several hundred on passage, and flocks of up to several thousand are common in African and Asiatic winter quarters (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). Adults undergo a post-breeding moult period that leaves them flightless for 3-4 weeks, with males moulting between mid-July and mid-August, and females between mid-August and September (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Kear 2005b). The Volga Delta, in particular, is a major moulting area for this species. Birds of this species are both diurnal and nocturnal feeders, and when migrating often travel by night and rest on open water during the day (Johnsgard 1978). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding </em>In the breeding season this species frequents small, shallow ponds and lakes with abundant floating, emergent and fringing vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992) (that is not too tall or dense, such as bulrush - <em>Typha spp.</em>) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Green 1998), in grass dominated environments, like swampy meadows, flooded fields, shallow freshwater marshes (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992, Schricke 2001).<em> Non-breeding</em> During this season the species shows a preference for large freshwater or occasionally brackish lakes, again with abundant floating, emergent and fringing vegetation (Kear 2005b), also shallow flood plains, shallow dams, pans and sewage ponds (in South Africa) (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species also frequents coastal saltmarshes and lagoons on passage (de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992) and may spend the day resting on marine inshore waters when migrating (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> When breeding this species is omnivorous (Johnsgard 1978). In spring and summer its diet is dominated by animal matter: chiefly molluscs, aquatic insects and their larvae (waterbugs, caddisfly, waterbeetles, midges), crustaceans (ostracods and phyllopods especially), worms, leeches, young and spawn of frogs, and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). Seeds, roots, tubers, stems, leaves and buds of plants such as Hornwort <em>Ceratophyllum</em>, Naiad <em>Najas</em>, sedge, grass and other aquatic plants are also important at this time (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992). <em>Non-breeding</em> During this season the birds are mainly vegetarian, with a diet dominated by the seeds of pondweeds, smartweeds <em>Polygonum</em>, sedges, dock <em>Rumex</em>, wild rice and grass (Kear 2005b), (with the seeds of <em>Echinochloa colona</em>, <em> Nymphea micranthia</em> and <em> Nymphea lotus</em> being the most preferred food items) (Treca 1981). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Meadows are the favoured nesting areas of this species, with nests rarely located more than 150 m from water (usually within 20 m) (Cramp and Simmons 1977). The nest itself is a depression in the ground, typically situated under rushes or tall grasses (such as manna grass, <em>Glyceria</em>), but not generally under shrubs (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo<em>.</em> 1992). <strong></strong>","<em>Breeding</em> The most significant threat encountered by this species on its breeding grounds in Europe is habitat deterioration through the drainage and reclamation of wetlands (Kear 2005b), the increasing climatic aridity and subsequent lowering of the water table, and the transformation of wetlands to dammed reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996).  Other threats to this species include the destruction of nests during the early mowing of meadows (Kear 2005b), increased human disturbance (Kear 2005b), lead poisoning, botulism during hot summers (Kear 2005b) and hunting disturbance in Africa and Europe (Vaananen 2001) (&gt; 500,000 are shot annually in Russia, Ukraine, France and Poland) (Kear 2005b). The invasive species American Mink <em>Mustela vison</em> also poses a threat through nest predation (Opermanis <em>et al.</em> 2001), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza (particularly strain H5N1) so is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).<em> Non-breeding</em> On its wintering grounds in Nigeria and Senegal the species is threatened by habitat destruction through dam construction, vegetation overgrowth and desertification (del Hoyo&#160;1992, Polet 2000, Triplett and Yesou 2000), and in West Africa it is threatened by large-scale river diversion and irrigation schemes (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also at risk from avian influenza in its African wintering grounds (Gaidet <em>et al.</em> 2007) as well as in its breeding areas (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The proportion of the species which migrates via the West Siberian flyway is susceptible to West Nile Virus, and is therefore threatened by future outbreaks (Ternovoi <em>et al.</em> 2004). <strong>Utilisation</strong> This species is hunted in Denmark , but there is evidence that this may be sustainable (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006).

The return passage to northern breeding grounds occurs between late-February and mid-May (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), where the species breeds between late April and June (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). In mild winters some birds may also remain in the breeding grounds of southern Scandinavia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species generally occurs in low concentrations during passage and at stop-over sites, although it may occur in small scattered groups of up to 30 individuals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) in the winter, with aggregations of over 50 being unusual (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season this species inhabits damp areas in swampy, old pine, spruce or alder woodland and montane forest with many fallen and rotten tree stumps, marshy forest floors and heavy carpets of lichens and mosses, generally in the vicinity of rivers, streams, swamps, ponds, lakes (Johnsgard 1981) and bogs (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season this species shows a preference for a wider variety of inland freshwater habitats such as marshes, lake edges, sewage farms, small dams and ponds, ditches, riverbanks and forest streams, often near villages and cultivation (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) (although less often in the vicinity of woodland) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It is also very rarely found in intertidal areas such as creeks and the channels of saltmarches (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is omnivorous, although its diet is predominantly made up of aquatic and terrestrial insects (Snow and Perrins 1998) (e.g. dragonfly larvae, ants, waterbugs, moth larvae, and the adults and larvae of beetles, Diptera and Trichoptera), annelids, small crustaceans, spiders and fish, as well as plant fragments (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Breeding site</strong> This species frequently nests high in trees in the abandoned nests of passerine species such as Common Woodpigeon <em>Columba palumbus</em>, thrushes <em>Turdus</em> spp. (Hayman <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), crows, jays and shrikes (Johnsgard 1981), but may also nest in squirrel dreys (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998), on natural platforms up to 20 m high (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and occasionally on tree stumps or mounds of accumulated pine needles, among branches and tree roots, or amongst fallen trees on the ground (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998).<strong></strong>",This species is susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).,"The global population is estimated to number c.1,200,000-3,600,000 individuals (Wetlands International, 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 616,000-1,050,000 pairs, which equates to 1,230,000-2,100,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Aquatic habitats in which the species breeds range from slow moving rivers to stagnant permanent ponds and pools; gravel and clay pits are also used. The larvae of this species frequently hibernate. The species can occur in suitable modified habitat such as traditional agricultural land, and even urban areas (e.g., in Barcelona).","General habitat loss, largely to agricultural development (including loss of breeding sites), has contributed to the decline of the species in some areas. Fragmentation of populations might be a problem for the species, e.g. in Spain, Portugal and Germany. Certain populations of the subspecies <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Alytes obstetricans pertinax</span> in protected areas of central Spain have severely declined and disappeared as a result of chytridiomycosis (Bosch <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Bosch <em>et al.</em>, 2000); a few specimens have recently been found again in this area (M. García-París and J.W. Arntzen pers. comm.). Additional mortality of the species through disease (iridovirus) has been recorded in Carris Lake, Peneda-Gerês National Park, Portugal (Soares <em>et al.</em>, 2003); the disease might be non-native and have been transferred to the lake by an introduced North American predatory fish (<em>Lepomis gibbosus</em>). Mortality initially attributed to the bacteria <em>Aeromonas hydrophila</em> ""red-leg disease"" has also been reported (Márquez <em>et al.</em> 1995). Predation by<em> L. gibbosus</em> and other introduced predatory fish species, such as salmonids, is also a considerable threat to this species.","it is reported to be declining (including local extinctions) across its range, but it is still widespread and common in many areas (e.g., in much of France).",Decreasing,"This species ranges from the northern half of Portugal and Spain (where populations are very fragmented, and there is a small Area of Occupancy within its Extent of Occurrence), through most of France, to southern Belgium, extreme southeastern Netherlands, Luxembourg, western and north-central Germany, and western and northern Switzerland.

88135664,4819,Chrysocyon brachyurus,Near Threatened,,2015,2015-08-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The current population of Maned Wolves is estimated at approximately 17,000 mature individuals (≥ 2 years of age), with the majority of the population (&gt;90%) in Brazil. In the last decade or so, the species’ main habitats in Brazil have been subject to intense deforestation. A population viability model for Brazil generated using real and predicted deforestation rates over 15 years (three generations) resulted in an estimated reduction of ~20% in the metapopulation (based on current estimates of habitat loss ranging from 1.0 to 1.5% per year). If deforestation reaches the maximum estimated rate of loss (2% per year), then simulation suggests a national population reduction of 56% at the end of 100 years (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008, Paula and Desbiez 2014). In addition to the estimated population reduction from deforestation, the species is also subject to other threats, including road kills, direct persecution by humans, and disease due to contact with domestic animals (Paula and Desbiez 2014). In other range countries (Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia), the species’ status is even more precarious with small isolated populations and declining numbers due to the low quality of habitat and hunting. The Maned Wolf does not meet the thresholds for listing under criteria B, C or D, but taking into account the combined impacts of habitat loss, persecution and disease, it approximates the thresholds for listing under A3, and is therefore assessed as Near Threatened. The species’ situation is considered to be of major concern due to the various threats acting throughout its entire range and should be regularly re-evaluated.","In general, Maned Wolves inhabit open habitat types favouring grasslands, shrub habitats, woodland with an open canopy (cerrado), mixed forest/grassland, and wet fields (which may be seasonally flooded). Rocky fields associated with open grasslands in higher altitudes (1,000-2,000 m asl) can be an important habitat for the species in some areas (Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. Paula pers. obs.). In central Brazil, similar to Bestelmeyer (2000), who found Maned Wolves prefer areas with low to medium shrub density, Vynne <em>et al</em>. (2011) found they avoided areas where the closed canopy was ≥30%. Coelho<em> et al</em>. (2008) found the Maned Wolf strongly avoided the forested areas that border the Cerrado and Atlantic forest ecoregions. In northeastern Argentina, south/southeastern Brazil, and southeastern Paraguay, Maned Wolves have been recorded in the exotic eucalyptus, pine, soybean and sunflower plantations (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2009, Soler 2009, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015, R. Paula pers. obs.) and in remnants of &#160;Atlantic forest (Chiarello 2000, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). Also, the presence of Maned Wolves in populated rural and urban areas was also documented in the last ten years in Santa Fe, Corrientes, Chaco and Santiago de Estero provinces in Argentina (Pautasso <em>et al</em>. 2009, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a). In addition while Maned Wolves preferred open, natural grasslands, they were as likely to use low-standing croplands within five kilometres due to the high density of rodents (Vynne <em>et al</em>. 2011). While Queirolo <em>et al</em>. (2011) proposed that Maned Wolves are expanding their former range in Brazil to include areas converted from inhospitable primary or thick secondary forest into open areas for grassland, agriculture and livestock. Muir and Emmons (2012) failed to find evidence of Maned Wolves expanding into agricultural areas in Bolivia. In Paraguay, preliminary studies with camera traps suggest that sustainable cattle-ranching was compatible with high Maned Wolf activity (A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). Vynne (2010) suggests the foraging benefits of agricultural areas are negated when the crops become tall, homogenous, monoculture crops (e.g., sugarcane). Vynne <em>et al</em>. (2014) found that Maned Wolves may be tolerant of these habitat conversions as long as there are sufficient remnant vegetation patches for den sites, food, water and resting, including gallery forests (Dietz 1984), cerrado and marshy areas near rivers (Bestelmeyer 2000, F. Rodrigues pers. comm. 2015). &#160;<br/><br/>The omnivorous diet of the Maned Wolf includes a wide variety of plant material and animal matter, including fruits, arthropods and small- to medium-sized vertebrates (Dietz 1984, Carvalho and Vasconcellos 1995, Motta-Júnior <em>et al</em>. 1996, Azevedo and Gastal 1997, Motta-Júnior 1997, Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 1998, Jácomo 1999, Santos 1999, Silveira 1999, Juarez and Marinho-Filho 2002, Amboni 2007). Although the frequency of plant and animal items found in faecal samples is approximately equal, the biomass of animal items is usually greater than that of plant items (Motta-Júnior <em>et al</em>. 1996, Santos 1999, Motta-Junior <em>et al</em>. 2014). The relative importance of specific food items may vary depending on location and season (Bueno and Motta-Júnior 2006, Amboni 2007). In areas of high food availability, the degree of overlap of home ranges increases and can reach levels of 92% between female-female and 100% for male-female (couple; Amboni 2007, Azevedo 2008, R. Paula pers. obs.).<br/><br/>While historically Maned Wolves were considered to be crepuscular-nocturnal in their activities, recent observations in Bolivia and Brazil reveal that their activity is actually variable or cathermeral, with activity patterns changing according to daily temperatures and the season (dry or wet; Emmons 2012). In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Emmons (2012) found Maned Wolves tend to forage for longer distances when temperatures are cooler (between 21-28°C) and show considerable decreases in activity levels when temperatures increase (&gt;28°C). In addition, while the Maned Wolf is strictly nocturnal during the dry season, it varies in its temporal activity pattern during the wet season (Emmons 2012). These patterns shift some in southeastern Brazil, an area defined by higher humidity levels, abundant permanent water sources in the form of rivers, well-defined seasons reflecting extreme temperature differences, and shifts in the seasonal food availability. While the activity pattern of Maned Wolves in Brazil is cathemeral and affected by overall temperature and seasonality, the high degree of daily variation in minimum and maximum temperature in a season means that there is additional variation in the daily pattern each season (R. Paula pers. obs.). For example, during the dry season when temperatures drop to 5°C during the night, the species is more diurnal having higher activity during the day when temperatures are likely to be warmer. In contrast during the wet season activity is typically nocturnal, except after extended periods of rain when the species can be active during the middle of the day. &#160;<br/><br/>The home range of Maned Wolves is variable, ranging from 20-115 km<sup>2</sup> (fixed kernel, 95%). Despite considerable variation ranges average between 50-80&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(fixed kernel, 95%; Rodrigues 2002, Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2008, Azevedo 2008, Emmons 2012) and about 30&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in agricultural landscape of northern Argentina (L. Soler pers. comm. 2015). Food availability and habitat integrity have been linked to variation in home range size (Amboni 2007, Azevedo 2008, R. Paula pers. obs.). Sharing of home ranges has been noted in Brazil and Bolivia (Azevedo 2008, Emmons 2012). While home range overlap can be found during the breeding season, it is possible throughout the year in areas with high food availability. In these areas, the greatest sharing of home ranges is between females followed by male-female pairs with very little sharing tolerance noted among males (Azevedo 2008).&#160;<br/><br/>In northern Argentina the Maned Wolf shows a preference for open grassland habitats and also utilizing human disturbed areas such as cattle ranches (Soler and Carenton 2008). Direct competition with other carnivores has not been observed; however, scat analyses reveal that Maned Wolves, Crab-eating Fox (<em>Cerdocyon thous</em>) and Pampas Fox (<em>Lycalopex gymnocercus</em>) and Crab-eating Raccoon (<em>Procyon cancrivorus</em>) consume many of the same prey species (Soler and Carenton 2008).&#160;<br/><br/>Paula <em>et al</em>. (2008) calculated a generation time of 5.3 years in Vortex (using the exponential growth rate as another variable to account to the net reproductive rate calculations, which is the age-specific survival multiplied by fecundity over all age classes; see Lacy <em>et al</em>. 2015 for further details). Using the formula Sum (x l<sub>x</sub> m<sub>x</sub>)/Sum (l<sub>x</sub> m<sub>x</sub>) where l<sub>x</sub> represents the survivourship over x years and m<sub>x</sub> the maternity over x years, Paula and Desbiez (2014) calculated a generation length of 7 years. No differences on population reduction were observed when using the two different generation times.","The four main threats affecting Maned Wolf populations throughout their distribution range are: habitat loss and alteration, especially due to conversion to crop fields and pasturelands; human persecution due to livestock losses and cultural beliefs; increasing vehicular traffic in highways resulting in road kills; and pathogens contracted from domestic animals due to increased contact in disturbed environments (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013, Emmons 2012, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a).&#160;<br/><br/>The intensive conversion of native habitat for agriculture results in loss of optimal habitat and creation of areas often subject to desertification. The fragmentation of highly suitable habitat causes isolation of subpopulations and often results in the remaining intact landscape become intersected by high speed roads. Many Maned Wolves are killed on roadways throughout its range. In central Brazil, road kills are a threat of major concern potentially leading to local extinction of small, isolated populations as estimates range from four to 10 individuals killed/year in some regions (Paula and Gambarini 2013, Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2014). Similar impact of vehicular collisions was detected in marginal populations from Argentina where 21 Maned Wolves were reported dead along National Route 34, concentrated between 2000 and 2005 (Orozco <em>et al.</em> 2013a). The same negative effect is potentially true in the humid Chaco of Paraguay where increased traffic on the Trans-Chaco highway leads to numerous road kills each year (A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). Extreme climatic conditions such as uncontrolled fires and droughts are likely to exacerbate the scarcity of living resources and consequently the loss on roadways, as Maned Wolves are forced to travel farther for food and water (Pautasso <em>et al</em>. 2009, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a); the latter is especially important during periods when females are lactating (Emmons 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Direct interactions with humans also pose a threat to the species. Conflicts with people, road mortality, the potential for infectious diseases spread by domestic dogs and direct persecution resulting from widely held superstitions and beliefs, are the primary threats facing Maned Wolves (Songsasen and Rodden 2010). In some areas of Argentina, Maned Wolves are persecuted with hunting, trapping, and shooting due to a mix of long-standing cultural beliefs, general ignorance of the species, and trophy hunting (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2009, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Soler 2014). In southeastern Santiago del Estero (Argentina), 30 Maned Wolves were reported sold to game ranches in a 10-year period (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a). In Brazil and Paraguay, this targeted persecution of Maned Wolves extends beyond the traditional and natural medicine needs to include the low public tolerance of poultry depredation, for which Maned Wolves are constantly blamed (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013, Cartes <em>et al</em>. 2014, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). In some areas this hunting pressure is so high it is having a significant negative effect on local Maned Wolf numbers (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013). While illegal trade is not common, Orozco <em>et al</em>. (2009) found it was widespread in Argentina, and even included the sale of young animals or pups to private zoos and collections. Of the Maned Wolves kept in captivity in Argentina during the last five years 68% were wild born and came from/were victims of illegal trade, road collisions or were orphaned after their mother was killed (P. Gonzalez Ciccia pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/>Domestic dogs pose a serious threat to Maned Wolves on several levels, as often times domestic dogs accompany humans into the field for recreation and hunting. In addition, both Maned Wolves and dogs overlap in their use of habitat that has been converted to agriculture and pasture. Dogs are known to pursue Maned Wolves, which often results in the killing of the animal (Soler <em>et al</em>. 2005, Pautasso <em>et al.</em> 2009, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Soler 2014, A.J. Giordano pers. comm. 2015). In a study carried out in Argentina, 26% of sightings by local villagers involved close contact between Maned Wolves and domestic dogs (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Dogs are also a source of infectious diseases and parasites. However the epidemiological effects remain unclear for Maned Wolf conservation. Rural domestic dog populations in Argentina had very high seroprevalence for <em>Neospora caninum</em>, canine coronavirus, canine adenovirus,&#160;<em>Dirofilara&#160;</em><em>immitis</em>, canine distemper virus, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, and <em>L. interrogans</em> spp. In the same area, all of these agents (except <em>N. caninum</em>, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> and CCV) were serologically positive in local Maned Wolves (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a). In a Bolivian population, Maned Wolves were serologically positive for two domestic dog pathogens (morbillivirus and parvovirus) that can cause pup mortality and high levels of potentially fatal (<em>Dirofilara immitis</em>) and debilitating (<em>Dioctophyme renale</em>) parasites were detected (Deem and Emmons 2005, Bronson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Deem<em> et al</em>. 2012, Emmons 2014). In Brazil, Maned Wolves were serologically positive for several dog-related infectious diseases including parvovirus, canine distemper virus, coronavirus, and leishmaniosis (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2014). These data from Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina suggest that other wild populations are at risk in areas where domestic dogs are present (May Jr and Felippe 2014). The frequent use of dogs for herding and hunting, along with their frequent foraging in natural habitats, could favour direct or indirect transmission of multiple pathogens (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013a).","A Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) workshop held in 2005 estimated the total population (newborn pups, juveniles and adults) of Maned Wolves at ~23,600 animals, including 21,746 in Brazil, 830 in Paraguay, and 660 in Argentina (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). If only mature individuals (≥ 2 years of age) are considered, the population size is estimated at 17,000 animals, including 15,849 in Brazil, 613 in Paraguay, and 487 in Argentina (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). Numbers in Bolivia are unlikely to exceed 1,000 animals. Numbers in Pampas del Heath, Peru are less than 40 individuals, declining, and likely geographically isolated from the adjacent Bolivian population (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2012). The population estimates from the PHVA workshop were generated using Vortex simulation computer models and so do require some caution (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). Even though the species has been supposedly expanding into new areas in Brazil, the species’ overall range has contracted in the Brazilian Cerrado (its typical habitat) and in other countries. In addition, over the last 10 years some of the areas previously defined as the most suitable in Brazil have suffered from habitat degradation, suggesting that these prior published estimates may now be considered high.<br/><br/>To account for the effects of habitat loss, one of the main threats to Maned Wolf, on persistence, simulations of the effects of habitat loss using detailed data on deforestation rates in Brazil were performed (and measured as permanent reduction in K or carrying capacity). This was modelled as a linear decrease (1.5% / annum) in carrying capacity over one generation or five years, which effectively reduced the maximum size a population could attain. The simulation model showed that small populations were affected more than large populations, with populations &lt;25 individuals showing negative growth rates due to their vulnerability to stochastic processes. Populations with ≤25 individuals declined with a high probability of extinction within 100 years; however, populations of 50-100 individuals persisted, albeit with low levels of genetic diversity. Therefore, several hundred wolves may be needed to maintain a long-term, viable population depending upon the severity of threats, management goals, and acceptable levels of risk for wildlife managers.<br/><br/>In the last 10 years, the main habitats of Maned Wolf in Brazil have been subject to intense deforestation. For the current assessment, a population viability model was generated using recent observed deforestation rates, ranging from 1.0 to 1.5% per year over 15 years (three generations). These results suggested a 20% reduction in the metapopulation based on these rates of loss. If deforestation rates reach a loss of 2% per year, the simulation suggests a 56% reduction in the Brazilian population in 100 years (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008, Paula and Desbiez 2014). The areas of supposed distribution expansion were not accounted for in this simulation since they represent edge areas for the distribution range and because from what is known presently these areas do not seem to hold stable and resident populations of the species.<br/><br/>Maned Wolves are found at low densities throughout the range. Even in Brazilian protected areas, population densities range from 0.01 to 0.05 animals/km<sup>2</sup> (Silveira 1999, Rodrigues 2002). The highest density reported is 0.08 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Serra da Canastra, Minas Gerais, Brazil (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Argentina, information about wild populations is scarce and the northern population is thought to be declining (Soler and Carenton 2008). Despite the lack of information on population densities across it range, high food availability may potentially support higher population densities (Amboni 2007, Azevedo 2008).",Unknown,"The Maned Wolf inhabits lowland grasslands and scrublands of central South America, south of the mouth of the Parnaiba River in northeastern Brazil, throughout eastern Paraguay east of the Rio Paraguay, extending into north/northeast Rio Grande do Sul State in Brazil, south to Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces in Argentina and west to the Pampas del Heath in Peru (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Brazil, the range is limited by the Amazon forest in the north/northwest and by the arid Caatinga in the northeast (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the last five years, the Maned Wolf has been recorded in areas where no records (&gt; 50 years) previously existed, specifically in areas where habitat degradation and conversion are occurring. In the “Amazonian arc of deforestation”, south of Amazonas and south/east of Para states, the species has been increasingly registered in areas that were converted from forests into pastures and agricultural fields (R. Paula pers. comm. 2015). The same is true, but to a greater degree, in southeastern Brazil where the Atlantic Forest biome has been deforested and the Cerrado has been degraded (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011). Although these records might suggest an expansion of the species’ distribution range, records are scattered and populations may not be stable. In Argentina, the species is present in the northern and central region of the country (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011) but a range contraction has occurred in the south with most recent records in the provinces of Chaco, eastern Santiago del Estero, northeastern Córdoba, northern Santa Fe, northern Entre Ríos, Corrientes, and southern Misiones (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011). The range across eastern Paraguay is considered widespread, but discontinuous, with no large concentration in any single area (Cartes <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Maned Wolf is distributed across the savannas of Bolivia; however, all detailed information for this country is limited to a single park in the department of Santa Cruz (Emmons 2014). The species historically ranged into northern Uruguay, but to date there have been only sporadic and unconfirmed occurrences in the north-east (Queirolo <em>et al</em>. 2011) since the last confirmed record in 1990 (Mones and Olazarri 1990).<br/><br/>Two recent evaluations of Maned Wolf distribution have provided an update on the full extent of the range (Quierolo <em>et al</em>. 2011), including range shifts within Brazil (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013). These studies recorded that the Maned Wolf distribution covers nearly five million km<sup>2</sup> with ~72% of the range located in Brazil, which corresponds to an increase in the total area reported 30 years ago (3,414,169&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) by Dietz (1984). This increase in the Maned Wolf distribution is likely due to both genuine change (the species’ expansion into new regions) as well as non-genuine change (mostly new or additional records from the field).&#160;<br/><br/>More recently, to seek greater precision concerning the distribution range of the species in Brazil, potential distribution and probability of presence were modelled with Maxent, a software using maximum entropy algorithms (R. Paula and E. Ferraz pers. comm. 2015). All Brazilian biomes, with the exception of the Amazon and Caatinga, neither of which are suitable for the Maned Wolf, were modelled using &gt;1,000 presence points collected in the last 10 years combined with several variables (including topographic, bioclimatic, geophysical and anthropogenic) at a resolution of one&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. The results indicate that the potential distribution area for Maned Wolves in Brazil is 2,815,061&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. The majority (70%) of this area represents areas with &lt;25% probability of presence and those areas are considered unsuitable for the Maned Wolf occupancy. In addition, the highly suitable area (i.e., &gt;75% probability of presence) accounts for only 0.4% of the total of the species’ distribution area within Brazil. These declines in both total area and overlap with lower probabilities of presence reflect an increase in deforestation rates in the Cerrado over the last 20 years. While the species has been documented in other biomes, the model suggests a retraction of their distribution within the Cerrado due to the ongoing conversion of intact habitat to areas with agriculture and pastures; therefore, while there is evidence that Maned Wolves can persist in mosaics of natural and disturbed areas, extensive monocultures and exotic pasturelands have been indicated as unsuitable areas.","There is no commercial use. Indications are that the use of Maned Wolf parts for medicinal purposes does not involve any sort of large-scale commercial transactions and is confined to native folk medicine (Soler <em>et al.</em> 2008, Orozco <em>et al.</em> 2009, Emmons 2012, Paula and Gambarini 2013).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legislation</strong><br/>It is included on CITES Appendix II. Maned Wolves are protected by law in many parts of their range, but enforcement is frequently problematic.

It is classified as Vulnerable in Brazil (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2013). Hunting is prohibited in Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and in Argentina.

Raising public awareness and using proactive methods to prevent conflict are among the main tools used in increasing tolerance towards the species. In addition, campaigns to vaccinate domestic dogs in areas that border or overlap with Maned Wolf populations have been ongoing for several years (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2014). New proposals to reduce the high number of road kills in southeast Brazil have been discussed at a political level. The 2005 Population and Habitat Viability Assessment workshop for Maned Wolves generated an Action Plan aimed at addressing the five main themes that effect the long-term conservation of the species across its distribution: 1) threats and habitat management; 2) distribution and status; 3) environmental education, social aspects, and economic alternatives; 4) ex-situ conservation; and 5) population dynamics and modelling (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). Each of these themes address gaps in knowledge for the species or specific problems associated with the species survival. Each theme was broken into multiple goals with specific actions set to address the associated problems, names of personnel responsible for seeing the action is completed, timeline for when these actions should be completed, associated costs, potential obstacles, and expected outcome defined (Paula <em>et al</em>. 2008). As a follow up to this workshop, Brazil and Argentina used information on recent and ongoing changes in the species’ status and threats to modify the international Action plan and generate specific National Action Plans that could help direct local efforts in Maned Wolf conservation. In 2014, the Brazilian government officially recognized the technical advisory group (originally formed in 2010) aimed at assisting the government on implementing the strategies developed in the National Action Plan. A Maned Wolf working group has also been implemented in continental level under the coordination of the IUCN SSC Canid Specialist Group, with an aim to ensure long-term coordination among researchers across the Maned Wolves distribution and work together to share strategies directed at reversing population decline. &#160;&#160;<br/><br/>In Argentina, the GAAG (Grupo Argentino Aguará Guazú or Maned Wolf Argentine Group) was founded as a national strategy to develop, manage, execute, and monitor the Action Plan for the Maned Wolf’s conservation in Argentina. The group comprises 16 institutional members, which includes provincial and national government agencies, zoos, NGOs and research groups from universities and museums. Between 2002 and 2011, GAAG carried out 10 regional workshops aimed at: 1) mapping threats for Maned Wolf in natural habitats; 2) prioritizing conflicts in the wild and problems in captivity; 3) prioritizing strategies and actions for its ex situ and in situ conservation; 4) developing recommendations for conservation in the wild and management in captivity; 5) developing efficient education strategies for Maned Wolf conservation both <em>in situ </em>and <em>ex situ</em>, and 6) validating methodologies and strategies for conservation education. Since 2005, five species-directed projects have been developed and include work in five of the eight provinces in the Maned Wolf’s distribution (Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Extensive surveys of farmers and ranchers have provided valuable information about the distribution of the species and also about people's attitudes towards Maned Wolves (Songsasen and Rodden 2010). Ongoing education programs are aimed at changing negative perceptions of this wild carnivore (Soler 2008, Orozco <em>et al</em>. 2013b).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

There is a high probability that such threats and subsequent declines will continue into the future, and as such this qualifies as Vulnerable. In addition, the species' life history strategy (long-lived, slow-breeding) puts the species under greater possible threat of declines. More accurate trend data may become available in the near future and so further reassessment may be required in the future. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>It lives in groups of 2-9 members, rarely 12, and is a co-operative breeder, with the dominant pair assisted by adult, mostly male, and immature helpers to defend a territory and provision a nest (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). The breeding pairs have previously been assumed to be monogamous, but molecular techniques have revealed that extra-pair copulations do occur (Theron <em>et al. </em>2013). Groups occupy year-round home ranges of 50-100km<sup>2</sup>, determined primarily by the availability of suitable nest sites and food availability during the dry season (Kemp 2005; Wilson and Hockey 2013). Laying occurs in large cavities in trees, cliffs or earth banks (L. Kemp <em>in litt.</em> 2016), mainly from September to December, with a clutch of 1-3 (usually 2) eggs, although only one survives to fledging (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001; Chiweshe, Kemp and Webster <em>in litt.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. One study in South Africa showed that a family group produced on average only one fledgling every nine years, although birds in the Okavango Delta appear to breed more frequently (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001; S. Tyler <em>in litt. </em>2010). Juvenile mortality is reported to be high in a large protected area, and this is likely to be even higher in unprotected areas where anthropogenic threats are present (Kemp 1990). <strong>Habitat </strong>It inhabits woodland and savanna, also frequenting grassland adjoining patches of forest up to 3,000 m in parts of its range in eastern Africa. The species fares well in protected areas where human threats are excluded and rural areas where cattle assist in maintaining their preferred short grass habitat. If cultural protection is still practiced, the species is productive, but in areas where there is no cultural protection or it has diminished due to the appropriation of Western culture, the species is highly fragmented (L. Kemp <em>in litt.</em> 2016). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet is mainly made up of arthropods, and, especially during the wet season, snails, frogs and toads, and sometimes larger prey such as snakes, lizards, rats, hares, squirrels or tortoises. It will on occasion feed on carrion, taking scraps and associated insects. Fruits and seeds are also recorded in its diet, although infrequently (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.  <p></p>","A major threat to the species is loss of nesting habitat due to clearance for small-scale use, agriculture, and because of fires and violent storms (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). It can become heat stressed and exhibits heat avoidance behaviour in temperatures above 26<sup>o</sup>C, and increasing temperatures with climate change could pose a threat (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). Widespread livestock grazing has also lead to the erosion of suitable grassland in Kenya, with perhaps only 10% of suitable habitat remaining in the country (S. Thomsett <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Although cultural beliefs offered some protection in the past in Kenya, recent generations tend not to hold such values, and the species may be directly persecuted as a result (S. Thomsett <em>in litt. </em>2010). Persecution may occur directly because the species breaks window panes by attacking its own reflection in glass (incurring costs and creating human-wildlife conflict), indirectly by consuming poisoned bait meant for other species, and it is sometimes killed for traditional rituals against drought (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001; K. Morrison and Y. Friedmann <em>in litt.</em> 2005; L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. In South Africa and Zimbabwe, where these beliefs are upheld, there is actually a significant protection given to this species because it has high cultural importance, and these beliefs outweigh any offtake for traditional use (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). Collisions with powerlines may also be a threat in South Africa (K. Morrison and Y. Friedmann <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, although only one such mortality has been recorded and more mortalities may occur from electrocution by standing on step-down transformer boxes - especially if an insect nest has been built on or near the box which could act as an attractant for the species (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016; R. Little <em>in litt. </em>2016). Such threats are exacerbated by the slow reproductive rate and maturation, longevity and social structure of the species (S. Thomsett <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. This species can be susceptible to Newcastle's Disease Virus (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016), and may be under threat from stepping on land mines in areas of conflict (L. Kemp <em>in litt.</em> 2016).<br/><p></p>","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be widespread and common but sparse. However, there are fears that Allee effects may occur as a result of fragmentation and unnatural mortalities creating a lag in declines being noticed (L Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). Range wide genetic analysis and population trends analyses are ongoing (L. Kemp. <em>in litt. </em>2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Bucorvus leadbeateri </em>is found from southern <strong>Kenya</strong>, <strong>Rwanda</strong>, and <strong>Burundi</strong>, through south-eastern <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo </strong>and <strong>Tanzania</strong>, <strong>Zambia</strong>,<strong> Mozambique </strong>and <strong>Zimbabwe</strong>; south-west to <strong>Angola</strong> and northern <strong>Namibia</strong>; and south through <strong>Botswana </strong>and eastern <strong>South Africa</strong>, including <strong>Swaziland </strong>and <strong>Lesotho</strong>. It is described as widespread and fairly common, and the population in South Africa in 1992 has been estimated at c.1,400 mature individuals - perhaps a 50% decline on historical population numbers (Kemp and Webster <em>in litt.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, although certain areas are seeing recoveries due to groups recolonising areas (e.g. Limpopo Valley; Theron <em>et al.</em> 2013). Declines have continued and a reassessment is underway, and assessments in Namibia as well as South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, have listed the species as Endangered (Simmons 2015; Taylor and Kemp 2015). Although data for other range countries are lacking, several threats are also thought to be causing population declines in Kenya (S. Thomsett <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>, Botswana (S.

It commutes to adjoining habitats, such as riverine vegetation and agricultural areas, to forage and drink (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>.

In the dry season it congregates in large flocks of up to 800 or more in some areas (Warburton 1999b)<strong></strong>. It relies on water sources that are not regularly disturbed by humans and livestock (Warburton and Perrin 2005d, T. Dodman<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. It breeds in holes in mature mopane trees near roosting sites<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995b, Warburton and Perrin 2005a)<strong></strong>, during January-May<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(L. S. Warburton <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000, Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. Fidelity to nest-sites is suspected<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. The breeding season coincides with the annual maximum rainfall and the beginning of the dry season<strong></strong>, and pairs usually raise a single clutch (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>. Broods of six and seven nestlings have been observed (Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>. The species roosts in naturally formed cavities in live mopane trees (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005a)<strong></strong>. Food largely consists of annual grass seeds, other seeds of annual herbs and ripening crop seeds (millet and sorghum) (<strong></strong>Dodman 1995c, <strong></strong>Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005b)<strong></strong>. They have also been observed to consume invertebrates, leaves, flowers, nectar, bark, lichen, resin and soil (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005b)<strong></strong>. The crop-ripening season coincides with the species's breeding season<strong> </strong>(Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005d) and its appetite for crop seeds has earned it a reputation locally as a pest<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. In south-west Zambia, it has been recorded that 18% of millet seed heads suffered more than 20% damage from the species during the ripening season (Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. Flocks were observed feeding in sorghum and millet fields in early 2012, mainly east of the Machile River (N. Buys <em>in litt. </em>2012).<p></p>","Three factors are thought to have caused its decline the past century: heavy exploitation for the cage-bird trade from the 1920s<strong></strong> to the 1960s (Moreau 1948, Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>, gradual desiccation of its habitat (Moreau 1948, Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, which is thought to be (currently) the main threat given the highly localised range of the species (Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>, and the partial replacement of sorghum and millet crops, (an attractive food source [Dodman 1995b, L. S. Warburton <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000]<strong></strong>), with maize, between c.1930 and 1950 (Dodman 1995c, Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000)<strong></strong>. There is evidence that the wild-caught trade in this species is currently at a very low level, with only isolated incidences of trade and export (Dodman 1995c, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>, although it is clear that any international demand would be met eagerly<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Warburton and Perrin 2005a, d)<strong></strong>. Some birds are caught for subsistence consumption and it is also persecuted as a pest, however these birds would usually be eaten as well (Dodman 1995c, Warburton and Perrin 2005c<strong></strong><strong></strong>)<strong></strong>. Farmers take measures to mitigate damage to crops<strong></strong>, but they are largely ineffective and rarely lethal (Dodman 1995c, Warburton 2003)<strong></strong>. The current levels of hunting and capture are unlikely to have any serious long-term impact on the population, but could threaten local populations suffering from the effects of desiccation (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. Recently there may have been local declines due to loss of surface water supplies in the dry season, perhaps due to long-term climate change<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995b, c, Warburton 1999b, Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000)<strong></strong>. The direct effect of climate change on the species's habitat may not be that great, but the indirect effect through the effect on human populations could have a large impact on the species (Segan <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;The number of permanent water sources in mopane woodland has decreased since the early 20th century<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. The low availability of water in the dry season is probably the principal factor in the disappearance of permanent populations from the Bovu and Sinde Rivers, and changes to the Ngweze River population (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. This is exacerbated by a decrease in the annual rainfall in the species's habitat of, on average, about 5 mm per year between 1950 and 1995, increasing the species's reliance on artificial water sources (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>. The recent establishment of hand-pumped boreholes along the catchments of the Ngweze, Sichifulo, and Machile rivers may lead to a decrease in the availability of surface water as people reduce their water source creation activities in riverbeds (Warburton and Perrin 2005d)<strong></strong>. In some areas, water pools are poisoned to kill fish and this can impact the species (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. The species may be threatened by the declining dry-season availability of water in temporary rivers in south-western Zambia, due to declining levels of rainfall<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (T. </strong>Dodman<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Mopane woodland is exploited for firewood and timber, with large areas cleared (T. Mzumara <em>in litt. via </em>C. Downs 2016),&#160;though the habitat is regenerating and encroaching into other habitats in some areas (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease Virus is present in the wild population (Warburton 2003, Warburton and Perrin 2005c)<strong></strong>, but there is no evidence that this is a serious threat. <p></p>","The population, based on surveys in 1994, has been estimated at c.10,000 individuals, however due to suspected declines in the population since this year, the population is placed in the range bracket 2,500-9,999 mature individuals. This equates to 3,750-14,999 individuals, rounded here to 3,500-15,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Agapornis nigrigenis</em> occurs patchily in south-west <strong>Zambia</strong> between the Kafue river to the north and the Zambezi river to the south (Warburton 1999b)<strong></strong>, with an Extent of Occurrence of c.14,400 km<sup>2</sup>, within which the core breeding areas cover c.2,500 km<sup>2</sup> (Dodman 1995b, Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2000)<strong></strong>. The species is found in an area of 4,550 km<sup>2</sup> of mopane woodland, 3,200 km<sup>2</sup> of which occurs in the Zambezi catchment (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>.

However, these might refer to birds from wild populations (Dodman 1995c)<strong></strong>. There have also been unconfirmed records from <strong>Botswana</strong> and <strong>Zimbabwe</strong>. The core population can be split into two subpopulations during the dry season, those in the Zambezi catchment (c.6,200 birds in 1994) and the Kafue catchment (c.3,800 birds in 1994)<strong> </strong>(Dodman 1995c).

It is a specialist frugivore (possibly territorial so that it can exploit fruits as they become available), foraging solitarily or in pairs (Brooke and Jones 1995)<strong></strong>. Research in 1991/1992 recorded 19 different plants in its diet, with <em>Procris pedunculata</em> constituting the major food. A preference for fruit with a high water content suggests that the species may rely on its food for obtaining water, especially during dry spells (as there is no permanent water on Henderson) (Brooke and Jones 1995)<strong></strong>. From two nests, each with a single egg recorded in March, the breeding season would appear to be at the beginning of the calendar year and clutch-size is probably one (Brooke and Jones 1995)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The species appears little affected by the presence of Pacific rat <em>Rattus exulans</em>.

However,&#160;<em>P. insularis&#160;</em>numbers were seemingly unaffected based on counts in 2015 (Oppel and Bond <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;The accidental introduction of a more aggressive predator, such as another <em>Rattus</em> species, could be devastating, and introduced diseases, such as avian malaria and pox, are another potential threat. The introduction of exotic plant species could have serious consequences for the native vegetation (Waldren <em>et al</em>. 1995)<strong></strong> and therefore for this species too.

However, given the potentially long movements of this species it is difficult to extrapolate this sample from a limited (but unknown) area to a global population estimate&#160;(Oppel and Bond&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). The trend estimated for counts from 2009 - 2015 indicated that the species was slightly increasing (mean trend 0.074, 95%CI: 0.041 - 0.106).

It winters in freshwater marshes, wet grassland, coastal tidal flats and farmland. Paddy fields and meadows are commonly used habitat for foraging, though the species has a flexible strategy depending on food availability, with a range of habitats utilised (Zheng <em>et al.</em> 2015). Flock size has been found to be influenced by food availability and level of disturbance (Yang <em>et al. </em>2015) and foraging behaviour is influenced by changes in water levels at Shengjin Lake (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Conversion of rice-paddies to cotton fields at Longgan Hu and Dongting Hu has caused declines. A newly discovered wintering site at Suncheon Bay, South Korea, is threatened by development. The artificially high concentration of birds at Izumi, as a result of supplementary feeding, risks a major population reduction from disease or another catastrophe. &#160;The situation at Izumi is particularly sensitive because the area is a major poultry center so that huge economic interests could be threatened by a disease outbreak. Efforts to disperse Hooded Cranes to other locations has met with small success, and establishment of additional winter sites (together with a reduction in the concentration at Izumi) are considered essential to the species’ security (J. Harris <em>in litt. </em>2016). Other threats in China include pollution of coastal waters, invasive cordgrass<em> Spartina alterniflora </em>in tidal areas, pesticide poisoning, increased levels of human disturbance and over-fishing. Some poaching and hunting of breeding birds occurs but disturbance by geese hunters is a larger issue than direct hunting (W. Heim <em>in litt. </em>2016).

The wide range in the current population estimate reflects the difficulty of counting the dense flocks of cranes at Izumi and the lack of recent range-wide winter counts for China (J.

Other documented threats include predation by introduced rats, the small Asian mongoose <em>Herpestes javanicus </em>and<em> </em>the native Hawaiian Hawk <em>Buteo solitarius </em>(classified as Near Threatened), as well as avian malaria and pox carried by introduced mosquitoes (Maxfield 1998) <strong></strong>and <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> carried by feral cats (Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2002, J. Burgett<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2007, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong>. Feral cats are ubiquitous in the species's habitat and are also potential predators (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Fledged chicks remain near the ground for several days before they can fly properly and are at particular risk from predation (Faike 2006, Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2002). Captive-reared birds have suffered from disease, with at least one dying from a bacterial infection, and diseases may have made others more vulnerable to predation (Maxfield 1998, Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). The captive population is inbred (Faike 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, and this may be reducing reproductive success. West Nile Virus, which could potentially be introduced by migrating shorebirds and waterfowl or commercial transport, and is spread by mosquitoes (Faike 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, could threaten reintroduction efforts in the future. West Nile Virus is presumed to be highly lethal in <em>C. hawaiiensis</em>, owing to a reduction in the population of the American Crow <em>C. brachyrhynchos</em> in mainland North America by 45% over eight years due to the virus (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","In 1992, there were only 11 or 12 birds in the wild (Maxfield 1998, Banko&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2002, Banko 2009)<strong></strong>, and the last two individuals were last seen in June 2002.&#160;The last known wild chick fledged in 1992, and the last viable wild egg was laid in 1996 (Faike 2006)<strong></strong>. The species persists in captive breeding facilities, with development of a reintroduction programme in progress (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Captive breeding started in the 1970s, but few fledglings were produced until eggs from wild nests were harvested and hatched in captivity during 1993-1996 (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, Banko 2009). A total of 27 captive-reared juveniles, originating from eggs laid either in the wild or in captivity, were released during 1993-1999 (Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). By 1999, 21 released birds had died and the remaining six were captured to protect them and preserve genetic diversity (Maxfield 1998, Conrow 1999, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals (49 at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center, 44 at the Maui Bird Conservation Center, and 1 at the San Diego Zoo), including 39 birds used as breeders (Switzer 2011).",,"<em>Corvus hawaiiensis</em> was distributed historically on Hawai`i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>USA</strong>), where the last individuals were found in and around the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Bones of this or a closely related species have been found on Maui, indicating a wider distribution before Western contact (Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2002, Banko 2009)<strong></strong>.&#160;Nesting by the last known wild birds was probably confined to higher elevations on Mauna Loa in South Kona (Faike 2006, Banko 2009)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Between 1993 and 2007, over 90 birds were hatched in the captive breeding programme (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009)<strong></strong>. Captive-raised individuals were released into lightly-managed habitat and monitored (Kuehler <em>et al.</em> 1994, Lieberman 1997, Banko 2009)<strong></strong>, but releases were stopped after January 1999 due to increasing mortality (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). About 75 birds need to be maintained in the captive flock for future reintroduction attempts to take place (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals, including 39 birds used as breeders  (Switzer 2011). Introduced mammalian predators were trapped in the Kona Forest Unit and, although this no longer takes place, predators will be managed at any future reintroduction sites (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Some areas of its former range are now fenced and free of feral ungulates, and the exclusion of ungulates will be extended into other areas (J. Burgett<em> in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Relocation of problematic <em>B. solitarius</em> failed because the birds homed back from over 32 km (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009)<strong></strong>. Two reintroduction sites have now been identified (Nelson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Following ungulate removal, fencing and habitat restoration, reintroduction at&#160;Puʻu Makaʻala Natural Area Reserve&#160;is due to begin with the release of 6 birds hatched in 2016. Ongoing restoration effort continues at the second site. A recovery plan was prepared in 1982 and revised in 2009<strong></strong>,  outlining recovery actions including expanding the captive propagation  to minimize loss of genetic diversity,  protecting suitable habitat and  managing threats to the species,  establishing new populations in  managed habitat, establishing a program  to increase public support, and  continuing research and adaptive  management practices for species  recovery (USFWS 2009).

The primary short-term driver of the decline is prolonged drought, which has reduced mamane pod production, but other contributing factors include habitat degradation by introduced ungulates, predation by introduced cats, and competition for caterpillar food from introduced parasitoid wasps. </p>  <p></p>","It is confined to altitudes of c. 2,000-3,000 m, favouring dry mamane and mamane-naio forest. It feeds primarily on mamane seeds, flowers, and insects (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2002a, Banko and Farmer 2014, Hess <em>et al.</em> 2014), with the availability of mamane seeds affecting productivity and adult survival. The species is morphologically and behaviourally adapted to feeding on mamane seeds, grasping pids with its feet and using its stout bill to tear them open. A recent study found that in both mamane woodland and mixed-woodland the species spent more time foraging on pods than flowers, but in mixed-woodland took more flowers than pods (Hess <em>et al.</em> 2014). In drought years, most birds do not attempt to breed (Jacobi <em>et al.</em> 1996, <strong></strong>Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. The species exhibits low rates of reproduction (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2002a, Banko and Farmer 2012),&#160;laying fewer eggs and taking longer to raise its young compared with mainland songbirds (Hess and Banko 2006)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The most significant declines in this species's range and population are thought to have been caused by human-induced habitat loss and degradation and impacts from feral and domestic ungulates (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2002a, Banko and Farmer 2014, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b). The subalpine forest habitat of this species has been severely overbrowsed by sheep, mouflon sheep, goats, cattle,&#160;and its nests and adults are preyed upon primarily by feral cats, but also by introduced Black Rats <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Rattus rattus</span>, Short-eared Owl <em>Asio flammeus</em>, and rarely Hawaiian Hawk <em>Buteo solitarius</em><span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>(Banko <em>et al.</em> 2002a, Banko and Farmer 2014)<strong></strong>. Up to 11% of nests are depredated by feral cats each year (Hess and Banko 2006)<strong></strong>. Grazing by cattle was a historical factor in the species's decline, although cattle are now limited to pastures that are unsuitable for <em>L. bailleui </em>(C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2007, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b)<strong></strong>. Alien grass cover is high in much of the species's range (Banko and Farmer 2014)<strong></strong>,  suppressing mamane regeneration and potentially increasing the threat of fire (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009). Increasing human activities, such as military training, could further increase the chances of fire (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009)<strong></strong>. In 2006-2007, there were numerous fires on and near Mauna Kea, and fires in August and September 2010 affected c.560 ha of suitable habitat  on the southern slope of the mountain (American Bird Conservancy 2010, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b)<strong></strong>. A fire in the species's core area could potentially affect &gt;90% of the population<strong></strong>. The opening of trails for all-terrain vehicles in the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve is a concern (C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, and may cause disturbance and habitat degradation. Continuing threats include grazing by feral sheep, wild sheep <em>Ovis gmelini musimon</em>, and their hybrids, which slows mamane regeneration (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1997, Banko and Farmer 2012, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b), and alien insects preying on and parasitising native insects (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1997, Banko and Farmer 2012)<strong></strong>, particularly at low elevations (Banko and Farmer 2012)<strong></strong>. Native caterpillars are an important source of protein for nestlings, and possibly breeding females; however, they are preyed upon by Yellow-jacket Wasps <em>Vespula pensylvanica</em> and several ant species, particularly Argentine Ants <em>Linepithema humile</em>, whilst parasitoid wasps kill the caterpillars by laying their eggs on or inside them (Banko and Farmer 2012)<strong></strong>. In addition to the aforementioned threats, this species's very restricted range means it could be extirpated by extreme events such as drought and storms (Banko and Farmer 2012)<strong></strong>, and drought contributed to the species's recent decline (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013)<strong></strong>. Demographic patterns of mamane mortality are under investigation, as mamane may be under threat from pathogens (USFWS 2006, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b)<strong></strong>. Climate change poses a long-term future threat to the species, as drought frequency and intensity are expected to increase at higher elevations, further affecting vegetation structure and compositions, and reducing the&#160;habitat's palila carrying capacity&#160;(Benning <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2002, Giambelluca and Luke 2007, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013). <p></p>","Survey results from 2016 suggest that the population numbered c. 1,900 individuals, with the number of mature individuals estimated at 1,660 birds (C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2016).",Decreasing,"This species is restricted to the island of Hawaii in the&#160;Hawaiian islands&#160;(<strong>U.S.A.</strong>), where it was abundant, although locally distributed, until the beginning of the 20th century, and evidence from the fossil record suggests that the species occurred throughout the archipelago prior to human settlement (Olson and James 1982, Burney <em>et al.</em> 2001). In 1997, it occupied an estimated 78 km<sup>2</sup> and numbered 4,396 birds,<strong><sup> </sup></strong> mostly on the western slope of Mauna Kea, where 20.5 km<sup>2</sup> was estimated to hold 72% of the total population (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Fancy <em>et al.</em> 1997, Banko <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. Comparison of annual counts from 1980-2007 suggests that the population size has historically been subject to fluctuations (1,007-6,356 individuals) (Leonard <em>et al.</em> 2008), but since 2003 it has undergone a consistent and rapid decline (67% decline in the core population&#160;since 2003 and a linear projection of this decline indicates extinction by 2025)<strong></strong>&#160;(R. Camp <em>in litt.</em> 2016, C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2016). In 2016, the population was estimated at&#160;1,934 individuals (R. Camp <em>in litt.</em> 2016). The species's range remains centered on the western slope, and it has contracted such that c.96% of the population is found in 4,600 ha of forest (R. Camp&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2014)<strong></strong>. It has not been found in annual surveys on the east slope since 2004 (P. Banko <em>in litt.</em> 2007, C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2007, R. Camp <em>in litt</em>. 2014, 2016)<strong></strong>. A small colony of reintroduced individuals has been extirpated on the northern slope (P. Banko <em>et al. </em>2014a)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species's population has been monitored since 1980 (Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Leonard <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camp <em>et al</em>. 2016). In 1979, 1987 and 1998, federal courts ordered the eradication of feral goats and feral and wild sheep species from the species's habitat on Mauna Kea, and these rulings have remained in effect despite six legal challenges (Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Banko <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Forest regeneration has improved as a result, although current efforts to reduce sheep have not been sufficient to allow the complete recovery of mamane forests (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b).&#160; Palila have some site fidelity, but have also been detected moving around Mauna Kea into new forested areas (Banko and Farmer 2014). In 1993, some birds were translocated to a new site on the eastern slope where predators were controlled and, although many homed back to their capture site, at least two pairs stayed and bred successfully (Fancy<em> et al</em>. 1997). Six additional translocations have taken place since, and by the end of 2006, 188 wild birds had been translocated from the western to the northern slope of Mauna Kea (Banko and Farmer 2014). Approximately 34% persisted for longer than two months, and a small colony of up to c.23 birds remained on the northern slope and bred successfully until 2010. Although F2 generation offspring were observed, the colony was not sustainable without additional management (Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Banko and Farmer 2014) and it was extirpated by 2011 (P. Banko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Egg-laying occurred in 2004, and independent juveniles were produced in every year from 2005-2010 (Banko and Farmer 2014). This translocation programme was aided by a captive breeding programme initiated at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center in 1996 (USFWS 2006, Banko and Farmer 2014). Of 28 captive-reared birds released in 2003-2009, at least 10 persisted in the reintroduction area for at least one year, with 2 males successfully producing fledglings with translocated wild females in the north slope colony before its extirpation (Banko and Farmer 2014). <br/><br/>The construction of a highway through unoccupied, federally designated critical habitat was approved in 1999. A mitigation plan accompanied the development, including the suspension of cattle grazing in pastures adjacent to the species's range on the northern and western slopes. The species's conservation&#160;was the subject of detailed research, and funding from the mitigation plan supported translocation research and enabled the expansion or continuation of studies into the species's ecology and limiting factors, mamane ecology, food availability, predator ecology and management, and fire ecology (Banko and Farmer 2014). The state of Hawaii continues&#160;habitat restoration and research into restoration methods (Banko and Farmer 2014). Work is being carried out to restore habitat by controlling fountain grass <em>Pennisetum setaceum</em>, which increases the frequency and intensity of fires, and Cape ivy <em>Delairea odorata</em>, which reduces the vigour of native trees (American Bird Conservancy 2010). The state of Hawaii&#160;has begun programmes to control cats and rats (Pratt <em>et al</em>. 1997, E. VanderWerf <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999, Banko and Farmer 2014). Goats have been removed from the mountain (C. Farmer <em>in litt.</em> 2007), and construction is underway to build 24.5km more fence which will then enclose the majority of Palila critical habitat. Once completed there will be 100.8km of fence preventing the ingress of sheep and goats, and allowing for forest recovery to occur naturally (G. Wallace<em> in litt.</em> 2009, American Bird Conservancy 2010). The fence is c. 2m high and encloses c. 94 % of the species's&#160;federally designated critical habitat. In 2010, a comprehensive fire management plan was being developed for the Mauna Kea area (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009, American Bird Conservancy 2010).<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Remove and fence out ungulates from all critical habitat and the mitigation parcels (Banko <em>et al.</em> 2013, Banko and Farmer 2014, Banko <em>et al.</em> 2014b). The restoration and protection of mamane in woodlands adjacent to its current range would allow the species to exploit increased food availability in areas of their former range (Hess <em>et al.</em> 2014). Reforest areas adjacent to the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve and areas where alien grasses and grazing threaten mamane (Pratt <em>et al</em>. 1997). Carry out forest restoration research to find ways to accelerate the rehabilitation and regeneration of mamane trees within the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve. Continue to restore forest above Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Benning <em>et al.</em> 2002), including expanding work on Kanakaleonui Bird Corridor. Intensify control of mammalian predators (especially feral cats) and grazing ungulates (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1997, H. Baker and P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, T. Pratt<em> in litt. </em>1999, P.

All of its range is fenced to protect from past degradation by introduced feral pigs, although deer now pose a new habitat threat. The species remains at risk from chance environmental events, such as hurricanes, as well as habitat degradation and the effects of exotic taxa.","It is now restricted to montane mesic and wet forest at 1,200-2,350 m (mainly 1,500-2,100 m), and is absent from adjacent areas dominated by exotic trees (Mountainspring 1987, T. Pratt <em>in litt.</em> 1999, D. Leonard <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. This habitat is probably marginal, as heavy rainfall leads to drastic losses during the breeding season (Simon <em>et al. </em>2000)<strong></strong>. It feeds mainly on the larvae and pupae of wood- and fruit-boring beetles, moths and other invertebrates (Mountainspring 1987, Simon <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. Range size is 9.29 ha and territories are defended year-round<strong></strong> (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 2001,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Warren <em>et al. </em>2015). The nest is cup-shaped and placed in the outer canopy forks of mature ohia (<em>Metrosideros polymorpha</em>), a situation that may afford some protection from introduced predators (Simon <em>et al. </em>2000)<strong></strong>. During the breeding season (between November and June), one chick is usually raised per year and young are dependent on parents for 5-8 months (Lockwood <em>et al.</em> 1994, T. Pratt <em>in litt.</em> 1999, J. C. Simon <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Simon <em>et al. </em>2000)<strong></strong>. Studies in the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (NAR) in east Maui in 2006-2011 found nest success probability of 19 % (n=30) and seasonal nest success of 46 %, with 49 of 106 breeding pairs monitored successfully producing one fledgling (Mounce <em>et al. </em>2013).  <p></p>","From 1945-1995, the invasion of feral pigs on Haleakala caused chronic habitat degradation (Loope and Medeiros 1995)<strong></strong> and facilitated the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes into remote rainforests (Pratt 1994)<strong></strong>. All of the species's range is now fenced, and the species may respond positively as a result. However, the interaction between malaria and climate change is a potential future threat, as modelling has suggested a possible population decline of c. 75% by 2090 (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>Furthermore, having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpubl. data)<strong></strong>. Weather influences the survival of young and thus potential recruitment rates (Simon <em>et al.</em> 1997, Becker <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>Other limiting factors include&#160;logging, cattle ranching and silviculture (VanderWerf 2012) and&#160;predation and competition from exotic bird and insect species (Mountainspring 1987, Simon <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. Rats have been observed high in native 'olapa trees and are both a potential predator of eggs and young and a potential source of competition for berries (Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project 2008)<strong></strong>. Although they have not been documented as predators of parrotbill nests, rats have been documented predating Akohekohe nests at similar heights. Mounce <em>et al. </em>(2013) found no significant difference in reproductive success between birds in an area with predator control (bait stations loaded with rodenticide and snap traps) and those in an area without, suggesting that current control efforts may not be sufficient.  Nest predation by Short-eared Owl (<em>Asio flammeus</em>) has been observed, though its extent and effect is unknown. Removal of small mammal nest predators may result in owl populations switching to a greater proportion of birds in their diet (Mounce 2008)<strong></strong>. Invasive plants represent a threat to habitat and require constant monitoring (D. Leonard <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).<br/><p></p>","Extrapolating density estimates from 2001 over the species's estimated range gives a population estimate of 380-800 birds, roughly equivalent to 250-540 mature individuals (D.

The East Maui watershed is cooperatively managed with fencing at c.1,070 m and removal of feral ungulates (Loope and Medeiros 1995, P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. In the Waikamoi Preserve, Hanawi Natural Area Reserve and Haleakala National Park, conservation practices additionally combat the establishment of alien plants and, since the late 1980s, feral pigs have been controlled <strong></strong>(Loope and Medeiros 1995, Simon <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. As a result, the forest understory has recovered well and non-native plant invasions have slowed (Loope and Medeiros 1995, T. Pratt <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>.

The species is found at its highest densities in koa plantations and forests with a high percentage of koa trees (Pejchar<em> et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is the only species on Hawai`i to exploit the woodpecker niche, but is rare despite the lack of competition (Ralph and Fancy 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It feeds primarily on lepidopteran and cerambicid larvae under the bark of koa trees, and it only occasionally feeds on nectar (Pejchar and Jeffrey 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Its preference for koa trees is evident despite the relative scarcity of this tree species in the environment<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pejchar<em> et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. As an apparent alternative to nectar the species regularly feeds on sap from `ohi`a trees all year round, perhaps to supplement insect larvae, whose populations fluctuate. The species acquires sap by drilling 3-5 mm deep holes into the phloem of suitable trees and drinking the sap that emerges. The preferred trees (known as ""Aki trees"") are rare (2 ha<sup>-1</sup>), spatially clustered and defended by the species.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure).

Large flocks also gather in the dry (non-breeding) season (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong> on suitable waters (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, but these break up and disperse to breeding grounds at the onset of the rains (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> This species inhabits grassy ponds or lakes in savanna, open woodlands along large rivers and lakes (Johnsgard 1978)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, swamps (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, marshes, floodplains, river deltas (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, flooded forest, pastures and rice-paddies (Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and occasionally sandbars and mudflats (Johnsgard 1978)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists largely of vegetable matter, including the seeds of grasses and sedges, the soft parts of aquatic plants (e.g. water-lilies [Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982])<strong><sup></sup></strong>, agricultural grain (e.g. rice, corn, oats [Johnsgard 1978]<strong><sup></sup></strong>, wheat and groundnuts [Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005]<strong><sup></sup></strong>) as well as aquatic insect larvae and locusts (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong>Breeding site</strong> The species nests close to water (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, building rough structures of twigs and coarse grass (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong> in large hollow tree cavities (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, between 7 and 12 m high (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, or in holes in the walls of isolated buildings (Madge and Burn 1988) (or other cavities with a floor diameter of c.200 mm [Kear 2005a]<strong><sup></sup></strong>).

At present, poaching is a minor problem but still occurs, particularly south of 43°S latitude where control of hunting is difficult to implement. Extirpation of the Southern River Otter began in local basins but has become widespread. The lack of re-establishment of the species is probably due to high mortality or reproductive failure following the dispersal of otters into unsuitable areas (Medina 1996). This is resulting in a population that is becoming increasingly fragmented and more susceptible to local extinctions through habitat destruction, human disturbance, predation by domestic dogs, and demographic or environmental stochastic events. Genetic studies have confirmed a lower genetic diversity in the northern freshwater subpopulations in comparison to those from the south confirming a past bottleneck probably due to anthropogenic factors (Centron <em>et al.</em> 2008,&#160;Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species has suffered a suspected past population decline of ≥50% over the last 30 years or three generations (based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) in its range countries due to habitat loss and degradation, water pollution, overhunting for the pelt trade, and direct persecution due to retaliation (Chehébar 1990). Accelerating habitat destruction and degradation throughout the Southern River Otter's range is the greatest threat to the species, and is suspected (based on current trends) to lead to a future ≥50% reduction in population size over the next 30 years (three generations based on Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) for those subpopulations using rivers and lakes (freshwater habitats), and for the subpopulations using the southern fjords and islands (marine habitats) the population decline may be due to the impacts of intensive fishery activities. Therefore, based on the suspected population decline in the past and future, the species is categorised as Endangered under criteria A2cd+3cde.</p>","<p>The Southern River Otter is distributed in the southern temperate forest of South America. This species presents a distribution associated with inland waters in the northern parts of its range, and marine habitat in the southern part of its range. In freshwater habitats otters are associated with the presence of macro-crustaceans from the genus <em>Aegla spp.</em> and <em>Sammastacus spp. </em>(Aued <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;Cassini <em>et al.</em> 2009,&#160;Sepúlveda <em>et al. </em>2009), which are the otter’s main prey (Medina 1997,&#160;Medina-Vogel and Gonzalez-Lagos 2008,&#160;Fasola <em>et al. </em>2009,&#160;Rodríguez-Jorquera and Sepúlveda 2011,&#160;Franco <em>et al. </em>2013). Other species of crustaceans, fish and amphibians are also in the otter’s diet but are of marginal occurrence. The species uses rivers with abundant vegetation (Chehebar <em>et al.</em> 1986,&#160;Medina-Vogel <em>et al.</em> 2003) and inhabit diverse types of wetlands including Andean lakes, rivers of different sizes, ponds and estuaries. A study using telemetry described an average home range of 11.3 km, with solitary behaviour and a low spatial overlap between individuals of same sex suggesting intrasexual territoriality (Sepúlveda <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the marine range the species uses the marine rocky coast with abundant vegetation cover and low exposure to wind and waves (Sielfeld 1992,&#160;Sielfeld and Castilla 1999). In this environment the Southern River Otter is sympatric with the Marine Otter (<em>L. felina</em>), but the latter is segregated by its use of more wave-exposed coastal areas (Sielfeld 1992,&#160;Ebensperger and Botto-Mahan 1997). The diet in the marine environment is composed of coastal fish of the genera <em>Harpagifer</em>, <em>Patagonotothen</em>, <em>Eleginops</em>, <em>Cottoperca</em> and crustaceans of the genera <em>Munida, Taliepus, Cancridae, Galatheidae, Lithodidae, Lithodes, Paralomis </em>and<em> Campylonotus&#160;</em>(Sielfeld and Castilla 1999,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2013). In general, for both marine and inland waters the Southern River Otter seems to be a specialized aquatic bottom forager preying on slow benthic fish and crustaceans.</p>","The Southern River Otter habitat is very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts (Medina-Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). In those subpopulations inhabiting freshwater environments, the high demand for water by human activities such as agriculture, human use, etc. is altering watercourses through canalization and drainage and loss of riparian vegetation. These activities are promoted to increase the amount of agricultural lands but are impacting those otter subpopulations distributed in lowlands, particularly in the Central Valley and the Coastal Range of Chile (Medina-Vogel&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003,&#160;Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009). In the case of Andean lakes, where the species occurred historically, the high level of urbanization and tourism has been proposed as the main causes responsible for the local extinction of the species in those areas (Medina 1996). Other threats are poaching (Medina 1996,&#160;Espinosa 2012), predation by free-ranging domestic dogs (Espinosa 2012) and transmission of diseases such as Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014). Free-ranging dogs are an important threat to carnivores because of predation and disease transmission (Vanak and Gompper 2009), and are present in rural and protected areas where the Southern River Otter occurs (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Implementing dog population control measures as well as vaccination programmes are an important measure to mitigate the impact of dogs on this species (Sepúlveda&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In several parts of the otter's distribution range, hydroelectric dams are installed or are planned to be built in the near future but no research on the potential impact of these on the otters has been conducted so far. The presence of wild exotic salmon and the salmon farming industry are suggested as a potential threat to otter prey leading to potential competition between otters and salmon (Medina 1996,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009) but no studies have confirmed this as yet. In relation to the invasive American Mink (<em>Neovison vison</em>), although several studies have investigated competition between these mustelids and river otters (Medina 1997,&#160;Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003,&#160;Fasola <em>et al</em>. 2009,&#160;Valenzuela <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013), there is no clear evidence of a negative effect of the mink on the otter. Indeed, current studies in the marine part of the range suggest a negative effect of otters over minks by habitat (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013) and temporal segregation (Medina‐Vogel <em>et al</em>. 2013). The invasive mink is a potential vector of CDV to otters given their behavioural similarities and sharing of latrines (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014).","Most studies on this species have been made based on indirect signs of the species, hence, there are no estimates of population or subpopulation size. The freshwater subpopulations have been studied more than those in marine environments. Monitoring of signs such as spraints or tracks has been implemented particularly for the population in Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina by the Administration of National Parks for over 30 years (Chehebar 1985, Chehebar <em>et al</em>. 1986, Chehébar and Porro 1998, Aued <em>et al</em>. 2003, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pozzi and Chehebar 2013). A relatively stable otter distribution has been observed in this area with some marginal expansion outside the Nahuel Huapi Park in the Limay River (Carmanchahi <em>et al</em>. 2006). In this population recent volcanic activity during 2011 could have disrupted freshwater ecosystems, consequently affecting the otter population, but there are no studies on the subject, which are of utmost urgency.<br/> <br/> Freshwater subpopulations have been described as fragmented and comprised of seven isolated subpopulations (Medina 1996) but subsequent surveys have identified presence in areas previously thought not to have otters (Rodríguez<em> et al</em>. 2008); it is not clear if this is the result of a recent recolonization or sampling bias in earlier studies, and more research is needed. A radio-telemetry study in the Queule River found densities of 0.25 otters/km of river (Sepúlveda<em> et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Studies of the marine population in Chile indicate that the otter distribution in this environment would be continuous and abundances estimated are 0.57 otters/km of coast (Sielfeld 1992). Studies based on indirect signs in marine populations in Argentina, indicate two separate subpopulations, one in Isla de Los Estados (Provincial Reserve) and the other in Bahia Lapataia, Tierra del Fuego National Park, in the Beagle Channel (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> During 1910–1954 a total of 38,263 otter pelts (<em>Lontra felina</em> and <em>L. provocax</em>) were exported from Chile but after that period no exports exist due to the implementation of different laws and international agreements (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986).",Decreasing,"The Southern River Otter occurs in Chile and Argentina in freshwater and marine environments. The freshwater distribution is located in the northern part of the otter’s range and was historically wider in both countries. In Chile, river otters occurred from Cachapoal River (34ºS) (Gay 1847, Reed 1877) up to the Peninsula de Taitao (46ºS) with a continuous distribution in rivers and lakes (Medina 1996). The current distribution in Chile has been strongly restricted from north to south due to land use change and human colonization (Medina 1996), as a consequence, the otter populations are only found at present from the Imperial River (38ºS) (Rodríguez-Jorquera and Sepúlveda 2011) to the south. &#160;In Argentina freshwater subpopulations were distributed historically from the Neuquen Province (36ºS) to the Lake Buenos Aires (46ºS) and mostly associated with water courses from the Andean Range and the steppe (Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012). The present freshwater distribution in Argentina is mostly restricted to the Limay watershed, mainly within the Nahuel Huapi National Park (Chehebar 1985, Cassini <em>et al</em>. 2010, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Southern River Otter subpopulations that inhabit marine environments are distributed along the Pacific coast of Chile from 46ºS to Tierra del Fuego in Chile (Cabrera 1957, Redford and Eisenberg 1992, Sielfeld 1992, Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006). In Argentina, marine subpopulations are present only in the Archipielago Fueguino in Los Estados Island and the Beagle Channel (Malmierca <em>et al</em>. 2006, Valenzuela <em>et al.</em> 2012, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2013). Marine river otters in Argentina are probably a continuous subpopulation of the main otter subpopulation in Chile (Sielfeld 1992).",The species is hunted for their pelts which are used to make clothing.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The Southern River Otter is listed on CITES Appendix I and listed on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Appendix I.<br/> <br/> In Chile, the conservation status is listed by the Reglamento de Clasificación de Especies as Endangered in VI, VII, VIII, IX, XIV and X Districts and as Data Deficient in XI and XII Districts (Chile 2011). In Chile, the Subsecretaria de Pesca is the governmental agency responsible of their conservation and management. In those populations inside official protected areas the Corporacion Nacional Forestal is responsible for their conservation. National Action plans in Chile are developed by the Minisiterio del MedioAmbiente, but despite its conservation status, no Action Plan exists for this species at present, which is the most urgent conservation action priority. Hunting is prohibited since 1929 in Chile (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986) and the governmental agency responsible for hunting permits and enforcement is the Servicio Agricola y Ganadero.<br/> <br/> In Argentina, the conservation status is Endangered (EN A3cd) (Valenzuela et al. 2012). At national level, the governmental agency responsible of native wildlife conservation and management is the Secretaría de Ambiente y DesarrolloSustentable de la Nación through the Dirección de Fauna Silvestre. The Administración de Parques Nacionales (National Parks Administration) is responsible for conservation of those populations inside the national protected areas, where the species is classified as Special Value Species (APN 1994.). The two populations in Argentina from freshwater and marine habitats are mostly inside national protected areas.<br/> Because of the several agencies involved in the management of the species a strong coordination with clear responsibilities and a work agenda is a major urgency in the short term. Actions recommended for both Chile and Argentina are:</p>  <ul>  <li>To develop a Conservation      Bi-National Plan for the species;</li>  <li>To develop specific National      Conservation Plans for each country;</li>  <li>To develop validated Monitoring      Programmes in protected and unprotected lands; particularly in Chile where      there is no such activity in any population; and</li>  <li>To reinforce the importance of environmental impact assessment      projects in relation to the species in order to adequately determine: a)      presence of otter population in areas of projects, and b) in those      projects requiring to implement adequate actions to incorporate: 1)      measures of monitoring, 2) mitigation and 3) compensation activities.</li> </ul>  <br/> There have not been any reintroduction attempts, which could be an appropriate conservation action considering the success of such plans in North American and European species. Although otters are one of the most appealing species in zoo/aquarium exhibitions providing good opportunities for education and awareness about conservation issues in aquatic environments, no known individuals of the Southern River Otter are currently in captivity and there are no historical records for any captive animals.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
97218336,3787,Capra falconeri,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-09-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species is assessed as Near Threatened: it nearly qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion C2a(i) as there are less than 10,000 mature individuals (estimated 5,808, based on our analysis of data from 2011-2013) and each subpopulation, except one, has less than 1,000 mature individuals. The largest subpopulation had an estimated 1,697 mature individuals in 2011. There is no observed, estimated, projected or inferred continuing decline of the total population. However, stable and increasing subpopulations are restricted to areas with sustainable hunting management and protected areas. Were these conservation activities to cease in the future, poaching would likely increase, possibly changing positive trajectories in these areas downward, and the species would then qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The previous (2008) assessment of Endangered appears erroneous. The data available would have qualified the taxon for the category Vulnerable based on criterion C with &lt;10,000 mature individuals, because the most recent estimates cited by Valdez (2008) ranged from 5,080 to 5,630 (mean 5,355) individuals, of which 60% or 3,213 would have been mature animals. Further, there had been an inferred continuous decline (C1), and in the largest subpopulation in the Torghar Hills there were an estimated 1,600 individuals, of which 960 (60%) would be assumed to be mature, just meeting the threshold of criterion C2a(i) for the category Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The reason for the change from category Vulnerable (the corrected 2008 assessment) to Near Threatened is Genuine (recent, since assessments 1994, 1996 and 2008). Available data show that the earlier population decline had ceased for more than five years due to effective conservation measures. This has led to the stabilization of key subpopulations and increase in parts of the species range. Since 2002, the largest subpopulation has been estimated at &gt;1,000 mature individuals for a number of years. Thus, criteria C1 and C2a(i) for Vulnerable have not been met for five or more years.</p>","<em>Capra falconeri</em> is adapted to mountainous terrain with steep cliffs, between 600 and 3,600 m elevation. The species is typically found in areas with open woodlands, scrublands and light forests. In Pakistan and India these are made up primarily of oaks (e.g. <em>Quercus ilex</em>), pines (e.g. <em>Pinus gerardiana</em>), junipers (e.g. <em>Juniperus macropoda</em>) and Deodar Cedar (<em>Cedrus deodora</em>) as well as spruce (<em>Picea smithiana</em>) and fir (<em>Abies spectabilis, A. pindrow</em>) in certain areas. In Tajikistan the vegetation in the lower parts consists of open woodland and shrub communities with Pistachio (<em>Pistacia vera</em>), Redbud (<em>Cercis griffithii</em>) and Almond (<em>Amygdalus bucharica</em>); with increasing elevation juniper trees (<em>Juniperus seravschanica</em>), (<em>J. semiglobosa</em>), mixed with shrubs of maple (<em>Acer regelii</em>, <em>A. turkestanicum</em>), rose (<em>Rosa kokanica</em>), honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera nummulariifolia</em>) and <em>Cotoneaster spp.</em>. Markhor rarely use the high mountain zone above the tree line. Markhor are diurnal, but most active in the early morning and late afternoon. They alternate seasonally between grazing (summer) and browsing (winter), eating grasses and leaves. Females gestate for 135-170 days and give birth typically to 1-2 kids. The animals are sexually mature at 18-30 months, and live up to 12-13 years. Predators include Wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), Snow Leopard (<em>Panthera uncia</em>), Lynx (<em>Lynx lynx</em>) and on kids Golden Eagle (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>). <em></em>","<em></em><em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></strong></em><br/>Within Afghanistan, Markhor have traditionally been hunted in Nuristan and Laghman, and this may have intensified during the Afghan wars since 1979. According to surveys by WCS in Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008), Markhor continue to be the most important game for local hunters (despite a nominal nationwide ban on hunting). Petocz and Larsson (1977) wrote that rangelands and forests were likely capable of supporting a higher Markhor population than that observed. They assumed that impact of livestock grazing on habitat conditions was limited because the number of domestic animals was restricted by the area's capacity to produce and store winter fodder, as heavy snowfall prevents winter grazing. Recent numbers of livestock are unknown for Nuristan, but recent increases associated with an expanding human population may create competition for forage (WCS 2008). According to a study using recent satellite imagery (Delattre and Rahmani 2007) no large-scale deforestation of the coniferous forests was observed in Markhor habitat in Afghanistan. However, the extent of deforestation for the last five years in a region affected by war and largely out of state control is unknown.<p><br/>In India, all Markhor populations are small (usually &lt; 50) and fragmented. The largest population, in Kajinag, may have potential for long-term survival if immediate conservation measures can be implemented. Key threats to the Markhor’s range are insurgency-related effects, intensified local resource use, poaching, and large-scale development. Poaching by professional hunters may have been the primary cause of decimation of Markhor in the past, but communal hunting during winter was practised until recently. Armed conflicts may have increased poaching by both the military and militants, while poaching by local people may have declined due to confiscation of arms and restriction on human movements. Other pressures come from habitat encroachment by camps of Gujjars and the armed forces, excessive livestock grazing by local and nomadic Bakkarwal herders in parts of the range, and collection of timber and other forest products. Large scale development includes the proposed Mughal road connecting the state capital Srinagar with Rajouri, which passes through the Hirpura Wildlife Sanctuary, and limestone and gypsum mining around Limbar and Lacchipora Wildlife Sanctuaries. The Indian Government has fenced the entire Line of Control with multi-layered barbed wire. This may have caused further fragmentation of populations of Markhor (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2009). <br/><br/>In Pakistan, control of poaching in Chitral Gol National Park and in several community-based conservancies has been successful. There, the population is stable or increasing. However, many subpopulations of Flare-horned Markhor are still small (&lt; 100) and the level of connectivity between them is unknown. The major threat outside established conservancies is poaching.&#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri heptneri<br/><br/></em></strong>In Afghanistan, interviews suggested that within Markhor range overhunting is a considerable problem, with little capacity for enforcement of the national hunting ban (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012). As a result, Markhor appear to be under threat due to unsustainable hunting. (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012) Poaching in adjacent areas of Tajikistan is reported to threaten the source population of Markhor in Shahr-e Buzurg District (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, Michel <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>In Tajikistan, Markhor are poached for meat. There are published reports of skins and horns of about 100 poached Markhor being detected in a camp of Afghan poachers in Tajikistan (Michel 2010). According to Moheb and Mostafawi (2011), hunters in northern Shahr-e Buzurg in Afghanistan told numerous stories of groups of hunters going to Tajikistan to poach, and they showed horns and two skins said to originate from there. Because of remoteness, logistical hurdles and lack of security, the international border in this area remains difficult to control.&#160; Cross-border poaching affects the security situation for game wardens, researchers, tourists, and legal foreign hunters and thus jeopardizes the conservation of Markhor in the Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve and adjacent areas. A recent report (Alidodov <em>et al.</em> 2014) suggests that in some areas poaching is mainly targeted at mature males (including illegal trophy hunting, Vaisman <em>et al. </em>2014), and that there is a low proportion of adult males (4-5% of the total number, compared to above 20% in other areas). Habitat quality has deteriorated in some locations due to excessive and poorly regulated fuel wood cutting and intensive grazing.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, increasing grazing of goats and intense poaching threaten Markhor (Lukarevski 2002), whereas Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997b) reported that in 1995 grazing and illegal hunting seemed well controlled in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, Markhor are now largely restricted to the Surkhan State Strict Nature Reserve and its buffer zone. Despite their protected status, illegal cutting of trees and shrubs, livestock grazing, and poaching were reported (UNDP 2007). No specific information on the current status of these threats is available, but recent Markhor population data (Xoliqov 2013) suggest that the threats are controlled, at least to some extent.<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros<br/><br/></em></strong>Valdez (2008) reported that in Afghanistan excessive hunting by local people and forage competition with livestock were pushing Markhor to the periphery of its range. Such severe pressure was leading the population to a slow demise, and its status is unlikely to have improved since.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most important threat to subpopulations outside the Torghar Conservancy is illegal hunting. Other threats include competition with livestock, risk of disease transmission from livestock (Woodford <em>et al.</em> 2004), habitat degradation, and habitat loss (Sheikh and Molur 2004). According to Hess <em>et al. </em>(1997), significant habitat loss was caused by logging in the Sulaiman Range, which they considered the most important area of straight-horned Markhor’s distribution. No recent data on the Markhor in the Sulaiman range are available and recent satellite images from 2011 and 2013 (Google Earth, accessed 2014) suggest that habitat conditions in the Sulaiman range are still largely suitable for Markhor.<br/><br/>Another threat for all Markhor subspecies may be posed by the spillover of contagious diseases from domestic goats and other livestock sharing Markhor habitat. Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP), a contagious, lethal disease to caprids, perhaps overlooked for long time in the north of Pakistan, was recently confirmed to be present in domestic goats in Gilgit-Baltistan and south-western Tajikistan (Peyraud <em>et al.</em> 2014). <em>Mycoplasma capricolum</em> subsp. <em>capricolum</em>, an infectious bacterium hosted by domestic goats, killed at least 64 Markhor in fall 2010 in one area in Tajikistan (Ostrowski<em> et al</em>. 2011). In India diseases such as foot and mouth disease are reportedly common in livestock and can infect Markhor (Ranjitsinh<em> et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>Hybridization with domestic goats may be a potential threat for all subspecies as goats commonly graze in Markhor habitats. Hammer <em>et al.</em> (2008) found introgressive hybridization with domestic goat among 35.7% of Markhor from three zoos, and speculated that in some cases introgressed wild living ancestral <em>C. falconeri</em> herds may have been the source populations of captive Markhor.</p>  <em></em>","The criteria for Red List Categories refer to mature individuals, but most available population data present total numbers. Here we referred to these total numbers; and for the assessment we assumed that 60% of each population estimate were mature individuals, defined as “the number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of Markhor, this definition excludes kids and yearlings.<br/><br/>The most recent data for most of the species’ range are from different time periods (2008–2014) and of variable quality, including information based on observations, estimates and educated guesses. Data from 2011-2013 are available for most areas, suggesting a total of about 8,800 Markhor. This number does not include some areas for which no data are available for that period. Based on older data and trends we assumed that in total approximately 900 Markhor existed in those areas, for a global population of about 9,700. We therefore assess the global population to be more than 5,800 mature individuals.<br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></em></strong><br/>In Afghanistan, during a survey in April 1972, 37 Markhor were counted in the upper Alingar Valley, and numerous signs of presence and reports by local hunters were documented there and in the upper Alishang Valley, suggesting a viable population (Petocz 1972). In south central Nuristan Petocz and Larsson (1977) recorded 350 Markhor, but considered this number a small proportion of the local population. The observed sex-age structure indicated high reproduction and possibly a fairly stable population size or moderate decline despite hunting pressure. In contrast, in eastern Nuristan Petocz <em>et al</em>. (1977) found a dramatic decline caused by hunting. Camera surveys, hunter interviews, and participatory distribution mapping conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in south central Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2011) suggested that the species was still present in the area surveyed by Petocz and Larsson (1977) and that the occupied range area was still largely the same. Although a 370 km transect survey by the WCS team recorded only three individuals, information obtained from local hunters and the importance of the species as main object of hunting indicated a population at least in the range of up to a few hundred animals.<br/><br/>In India, a survey of the species October 2004 to April 2005 in the Hirpura and Kajinag areas of the Pir Panjal Mountains in Jammu and Kashmir, recorded 35 Markhor groups, comprising 155 individuals (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005). This count, as well as interviews with key local informants, indicated that 350–375 Markhor may have existed in the surveyed area of Jammu and Kashmir. This is slightly higher than earlier numbers of 200–300 (Schaller 1977, Fox and Johnsingh 1997), probably because earlier reports were incomplete guesses based on information from only parts of the Kashmir Valley. The taxon’s range had contracted from about 300 km² in the late 1940s to about 120 km² in 2004–2005. (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009)<br/><br/>For Pakistan, population numbers are available for various time periods and for different locations. Areas were surveyed during different seasons. The numbers we present are based on differing methods (counts, estimates, guesses), and names, locations and borders of specific sites are not always clearly defined. Most recent numbers are available for 2011 and 2012, suggesting a total number of about 4,500 Flare-horned Markhor. More than 1,500 occurred in Gilgit-Baltistan (WCS 2012), 2,959 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Iftikhar Uz Zaman pers. comm. 2014); and Arshad (2011) believed that in Azad Jammu and Kashmir approximately 50 Markhor existed. If these figures are correct, they indicate a substantial increase from the previous Red List assessment (Valdez 2008), when less than 2,500 to 3,000 Flare-horned Markhor were assumed to survive in Pakistan. Approximately 21 years before the current assessment (or about three generations), there were thought to be in total about 2,075-2,575 Flare-horned Markhor, including 1,075 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP 1992) and 1,000-1,500 in Gilgit-Baltistan (NA Forest Department unpubl. information 1993, reported in Valdez 2008). Thus numbers in Gilgit-Baltistan may have remained stable or increased, while the population in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa appears to have increased substantially.<br/><br/>Schaller and Khan (1975) assumed a total of at least 5,250 Flare-horned Markhor living in Pakistan and in India. Petocz (1972) and Petocz and Larsson (1977) counted 387 animals in Afghanistan. The total population number of the subspecies at this time was thus about 5,650 Markhor (about 3,380 mature individuals). Available data suggest that during the period 1985-1993, the total number for the subspecies might have been around 2,950 (1,770 mature individuals). Arshad (2011) assessed the total population number for “Kashmir” Markhor alone at 1,800–2,000 individuals. An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that as of 2012, the total population of <em>C. f. falconeri</em> was close to 5,000 (i.e., about 3,000 mature individuals). Hence the total population of this subspecies apparently decreased from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, but since then it appears to have recovered.<br/><br/>Data for specific locations in Pakistan show varying trends of population numbers:<ul><li>In 1970, the Chitral Gol, a valley of 77.5 km² in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province (formerly NWFP), and at that time the private hunting reserve of the Mehtar of Chitral, was estimated to harbour 100 to 125 animals (Schaller and Mirza 1971). In 1984, this area was declared a National Park, and by 1985-86, it contained 160 (recorded) to 300 (estimated) animals. In addition, the proportion of males &gt; 4.5 years in the population increased during the same period (Hess 1986). Within this time span, Aleem (1979) recorded a maximum of 520 animals in Chitral Gol in 1979. The increase was attributed to better protection from poaching and to other improvement efforts in the Park (Malik 1985). However, according to Ahmad (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008), the population in Chitral Gol National Park was reduced to 195 Markhor in 1987. Estimates by Arshad (2011) showed an increase to 373 in 2003 and 590 in 2005/2006. Ali (2008) confirmed the positive trend leading to 612 Markhor recorded in 2006 with a computed annual growth rate of 7.7%. I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population in Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division (including Chitral Gol National Park and its buffer zone, Arshad pers. inf. 2014) from 1,146 in 2009 to 1,364 Markhor in 2012, a greater rate of growth than that suggested by a projection of the data presented by Ali (2008). The precision of these estimates cannot be assessed, as some earlier counts may have been biased low, and the area covered during different surveys might have changed and be thus not directly comparable. Nevertheless, these estimates suggest a substantial increase in the Chitral Gol National Park and adjacent areas.</li><li>For the Tushi Game Reserve (GR) in the Chitral District, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 125 animals, similar to the estimate in 1985-86 (anonymous 1986, Hess in press, quoted in Valdez 2008). In the Tushi Shasha Conservancy, Ali (2008) observed 137 Markhor in 1990 and 545 in 2006, from which he calculated an annual population growth of 7.9%. For the entire Chitral Wildlife Division (without Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division) I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population from 1,049 in 2009 to 1,456 Markhor in 2012.</li><li>The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) estimated 221 Markhor in Kohistan and 58 in Swat of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. According to I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) numbers recorded in Kohistan from 2009 to 2012 varied between 128 and 233, whereas recorded numbers in Swat decreased from 110 in 2010 to 11 in 2012.</li><li>The population of Markhor in the Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary (Gilgit District of Gilgit-Baltistan Province) was estimated by Roberts (1969) as not less than 500 to 600 animals; by Schaller and Khan (1975) as 50; by Rasool (no date, probably 1976, quoted in Valdez 2008) as 109; by Hess (1986) as 50 to 75; and by Rasool (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008) in 1991 as 40-50. In 2012 this population had reportedly recovered to 300 animals (WCS 2012).</li></ul><br/><br/><em>Capra falconeri heptneri</em><br/><strong><em><br/></em></strong>WCS staff surveyed parts of the potential range of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> in Northern Afghanistan in 2011. Due to security problems these surveys covered only small areas. The team observed four Markhor between Payan-e Moor and Aspakha Villages in the Kohe Ghaws area of Shahr-e Buzurg in Takhar Province. Local hunters believed that there were perhaps 20 Markhor left in this area. The interviews in Shahr-e Buzurg strongly supported the historical presence of Markhor in this district: 41 informants from northern and central Shahr-e Buzurg believed that Markhor were abundant in northern Shahr-e Buzurg during the 1970s. In the area between Dahan-e Ab Kof and Leiwgard Village in the Gandamargh Valley (Kuf Ab District in Darwaz, Badakhshan Province), the team observed six Markhor. Interviews with local hunters suggested that this area held approximately 80 Markhor (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>In the ex-Soviet republics, the total population was estimated to be about 1,000–1,200 animals in the 1970s (Zhirnov 1977), generally decreasing in the 1990s to about 700 animals (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997a). However, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997b), based on reports from game wardens and local inhabitants, believed the local population in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve in eastern Turkmenistan increased during the mid-1990s.<br/><br/>Between 1960 and 1970, Zhirnov (1977) assumed that there were approximately 1,000 Markhor in Tajikistan, with the only viable population in the Kushvariston and Hazratishoh Mountains. In contrast, Sokov (1983, quoted in Baskin and Danell 2003) assumed that in 1967 only 500 remained in Tajikistan, decreasing to 400 by 1983. During the late 1980s in the Hazratishoh Range and in Kushvariston (Tajikistan) there were around 350 Markhor (Sokov 1989). Survey data from 2008-2012 (Michel et al. 2014) indicated that the subpopulation in the Hazratishoh and Darvaz Ranges of Tajikistan was stable and likely increasing, with a total of 1,018 recorded in 2012. A survey in 2014 recorded 1,300 in these areas (Alidodov <em>et al</em>. 2014) In the Sarsarak Range a separate population was rediscovered in 2014, with eight Markhor counted and about 30–40 reported by local hunters (K. Karimov pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>During surveys on the western (Turkmenistan) slopes of the Kugitang Range in 1995 and 2000, Weinberg et al. (1997b) and Lukarveski (2002) recorded 227 and 303 Markhor respectively. No recent information from Turkmenistan is available on the population number and trend of this subpopulation. Given the stable or slightly increasing numbers at the eastern (Uzbekistan) slope of the Kugitang Range, we assume that in Turkmenistan currently there are about 250 Markhor.<br/><br/>In the early 1980s there were 400 Markhor in Uzbekistan according to the Red Data Book of Uzbekistan (1983), but in 1994 there were only 270-290 estimated in Uzbekistan, with only 86 counted in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (western slope of Kugitang Range) in May 1993 (Chernogaev et al. 1995). Survey data by the administration of Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve suggested an increase since a low in 2003 (140-150 recorded, 160–180 guessed), reaching its maximum at 310–313 animals in 2013 (Xoliqov 2013).<br/><br/>An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that the recent (2011-2013) total population of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> was about 1,680 Markhor (1,008 mature individuals).<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros</em></strong><br/><br/>In Afghanistan, few animals survived even in the late 1990s, perhaps 50-80 in the Kohe Safi region, with a few in other isolated pockets (Valdez 2008). No recent information is available on the population numbers of Straight-horned Markhor in Afghanistan. The subspecies may be extirpated in the country, but potentially Markhor from Pakistan (e.g., Torghar hills) may cross into Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, population numbers for Straight-horned Markhor are well documented for the Torghar Hills (Baluchistan). Roberts (1969) believed that the main concentration of the Straight-horned Markhor was in the Toba Kakar and Torghar hills and numbers could have been less than 500. In 1984, Tareen estimated that fewer than 200 Markhor remained in the Torghar Hills (Mitchell 1989, quoted in USFWS 2012). The estimate by Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) of 1,684 for 1999 represents a substantial increase compared to Johnson (1997) who estimated there were 695 Sulaiman Markhor in the Torghar Hills in 1994. Rosser et al. (2005) summarized results from surveys that suggested Markhor in the Torghar Hills had increased to over 1,600 by the year 2000. Arshad and Khan (2009) presented an estimate of 3,158 Markhor in Torghar in 2008. M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) considered this estimate possibly biased, and based on a new, conservative analysis of these data, suggested revising this estimate to 1,729. The most recent population estimate of 2,829 in 2011 is from M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>There is no recent estimate for Straight-horned Markhor in other areas in Pakistan, but we assume there to be about 200 <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in other areas of Baluchistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 150 Straight-horned Markhor in the Takatu hills in 1971, but later Ahmad (1989) reported that only 50 still existed in these hills, and only 100 in the area of Koh-i-Sulaiman. In the Ziarat Mountains in Balochistan, Qadir Shah <em>et al</em>. (2010) recorded nine and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) counted 32 Straight-horned Markhor. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) gave a total of only 24 animals for the whole province: 12 for the Mardan area, and 12 for the Sheikh Buddin National Park.<br/><br/>Although an accurate estimate of the total number of this subspecies is not possible, it can be assumed that with the population in the Torghar Hills estimated at 2,829 in 2011 (M. Frisina pers. comm. 2014) the total number might be slightly above 3,000 animals. In the 1990s this total was assumed to be around 870 (Ahmad 1989, NWFP 1992, Johnson 1997 quoted in Frisina and Tareeen 2009, Valdez 2008). Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated that more than 2,000 individuals remained throughout the entire range of Straight-horned Markhor in Pakistan. Roberts (1969) estimated that the total population of the former subspecies <em>C. f. jerdoni</em>, restricted mainly to the Province of Baluchistan, may have exceeded 1,000 animals, but that it was severely threatened because it survived in discontinuous and isolated pockets. For this same area, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated fewer than 1,000 animals. Thus, over the past 20 years, numbers have recovered substantially, but this is known only for one area, the Torghar Hills.",Increasing,"<p>This species is found in northeastern Afghanistan, northern India (southwest Jammu and Kashmir), northern and central Pakistan, southern Tajikistan, southwestern Turkmenistan, and southern Uzbekistan (Grubb 2005). <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri</strong><br/><br/></em>Afghanistan: historically occurred in the eastern portion of the country, in the high mountainous, monsoon forests of Laghman (headwaters of Alingar and Alishang Rivers); Kunar and Nuristan (Habibi 1977, Petocz 1972, Petocz and Larsson 1977) and is still extant at least in south central Nuristan (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>India: restricted to part of the Pir Panjal range in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009). Populations are scattered throughout this range, starting from just east of the Banihal pass (50 km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu-Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009 observed Markhor only in Kajinag and Hirpura, and confirmed evidence of their occurrence in Boniyar and Poonch. In the areas of Shamsabari and Banihal Pass the taxon is likely extinct.<br/><br/>Pakistan: a&#160;detailed study on the past and present distribution of “Kashmir” Markhor by Arshad (2011) showed that the area of occupancy and the number of locations have declined greatly (approx. 70%) during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. However, historic ranges larger than present ranges are partly a result of too much generalization in the older distribution maps, which include large sections of unsuitable habitat. It is not clear to what extent exchange takes place between the often small groups of Markhor inhabiting different watersheds. Flare-horned Markhor are mainly confined to the Indus and its tributaries, as well as to the valleys of the Kunar (Chitral) river and its tributaries. According to Schaller and Khan (1975), along the Indus River, Markhor inhabited both banks from Jalkot (District Kohistan) upstream to near the Tungas village (District Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit on the Gilgit River, Chalt and (Haraspo) Sikandarabad on the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley on the Astor River. Currently, Markhor are known from various locations in the Diamer, Astor, Gilgit and Baltistan Districts.&#160;Markhor are&#160;found along the Nagar Hunza River from Sikandarabad downstream, in Naltar Valley, along the Gilgit River downstream from Singul and along the Indus River downstream from Basho to the provincial border with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). Markhor are known to be present in the Juglot Ghooro, Rahimabad and Haramosh valleys in Central Karakoram National Park (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, Ecologist, Central Karakoram National Park, pers. comm. 2014). The population in Haramosh was considered extinct by Arshad (2011), but since winter 2011 Markhor have been observed there (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, pers. comm. 2014), possibly indicating natural recolonization. The distribution range in Gilgit-Baltistan has been updated based on information from various sources (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Flare-horned Markhor were found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan where it inhabited valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River (Schaller and Khan 1975). The distribution range in Chitral has been updated based on Arshad (2011), and includes side valleys of the Indus River upstream from Dubair, the Shishi River Valley as well as the Chitral River Valley and its tributaries upstream from Chitral up to Kaghozi Gol (Mastuj River Valley) and Shogore (Lutkho River Valley).<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri heptneri</strong><br/><br/></em>This subspecies previously occupied most of the mountains lying along the banks of the Upper Amu Darya and the Pyanj Rivers from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan. Currently, it is found in only two or three scattered populations&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">and its distribution has been greatly reduced&#160;(Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997). The subspecies was confirmed to occur as well in Afghanistan on the bank of the Pyanj River (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Afghanistan: almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution before 1979 (Habibi 1977). Reconnaissance surveys and interviews with villagers have shown that, across from the two strongholds of Markhor in Tajikistan, this subspecies exists but in very low numbers in the Darwaz Region (Kof Ab district, ~ 38°02’ N, 70°23’ E) of Badakhshan Province, and in Shahr-e Buzurg District and neighboring Chah Ab District of Takhar Province (~ 37°31’ N, 70°02’ E). The Markhor seem to cross the Pyanj River (which forms the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Tajikistan: limited to the region along the Pyanj River east of Kulyab, southern Hazratishoh range (~ 70°05' E and 37°54' N), including the Kushvariston massif (~ 70°03' E, 37°35' N) and the Pasi Parvor mountains (~ 70°16' E, 37°44' N), and the eastern slope of the southwestern edge of the Darvaz range (~ 70°21' E, 38°05' N, Shuroabad&#160; district of Khatlon Region and Darvaz district of GBAO Region). Formerly markhor were reported from the Babatag Mountains (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Uzbekistan (Ishunin 1972) and from the Sanglak and Sarsarak Ranges (southern parts of the Vakhsh Range, ~ 69°7' E, 38°13' N) (Abdusalyamov 1988). No recent reliable information suggests that Markhor still exist in the Babatag (Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). The presence of Markhor in the Sarsarak Range was confirmed in 2014, but the species has been extirpated from the Sanglak Mountains (Khalil Karimov, Panthera, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Uzbekistan: found in the Kugitang Range (~ 66°36' E, 37°48' N) at the border with Turkmenistan. Its occurrence was reported in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century from the Babatag Range (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Tajikistan (Bogdanov 1992).<br/><br/>Turkmenistan: restricted to the western slope of the Kugitang Range (~ 66°31' E, 37°49' N), bordering Uzbekistan (~66°40’ E, 37°30’ N; Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997a).&#160;<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri megaceros</strong><br/><br/></em>In Afghanistan, at least until 1978, this subspecies survived in the Kabul Gorge (Kabul Province) and the Kohe Safi area of Parwan Province, and possibly in some isolated pockets of Paktia Province. Intensive hunting pressure had forced it into the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range (Petocz <em>et al.</em> 1977, Valdez, 2008). No recent information is available on whether or not the subspecies is still extant in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most comprehensive study of the distribution and status of the Straight-horned Markhor was published by Schaller and Khan (1975). The study showed a huge past range for this subspecies, but the actual range in Pakistan at that time consisted only of small isolated areas in Baluchistan Province, a small area in the former Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), and one unconfirmed occurrence in Dera Ghazi Khan District (Punjab Province). Virk (1991) summarized the information for Baluchistan Province, and confirmed the subspecies’ presence in the area of the Koh-i-Sulaiman (Zhob District) and the Takatu hills (Quetta District), both according to Ahmad (1989). The presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Torghar hills of the Toba Kakar range (Zhob District) has been repeatedly confirmed and it is possible that currently this area holds the only population consisting of more than 100 individuals of this subspecies (Tareen 1990, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Arshad and Khan 2009). Qadir Shah <em>et al. </em>(2010) and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) confirmed the presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Ziarat Mountains in Ziarat District of Baluchistan Province. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1987, 1992) considered that the areas of Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. There is no recent information about the Safed Koh range (Kurram and Khyber Districts) where, according to Schaller and Khan (1975) probably at least 100 animals lived on the Pakistan side of the border with Afghanistan in the early 1970s.</p>",See Use and Trade details under Threats.,Terrestrial,"<p>All subspecies and populations of <em>Capra falconeri</em> were uplisted from Appendix II to Appendix&#160;I of CITES in 1992. The 10<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Conference of Parties to CITES in 1997 passed a resolution (Conf. 10.15) allowing for an annual export quota of six Markhor trophies from Pakistan’s community-based hunting management areas to states parties to CITES. CITES increased the annual export quota to 12 in 2002, to further encourage community-based conservation (Resolution Conf. 10.15 (Rev. CoP 14)). The EU Scientific Review Group has expressed a positive opinion on the import of Markhor trophies from well-managed conservancies in Tajikistan (EU SRG 2014).<br/><br/>Within Afghanistan, the species was protected nominally in 2004 (WCS 2008) by a nationwide presidential decree banning hunting, but this ban was not generally enforced. In 2009 the species was listed on Afghanistan’s Protected Species List, making any hunting or trade within the country illegal. The species does not occur in any protected areas. Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>identify remaining populations, their distribution and numbers;</li><li>facilitate the development of community-based conservation in areas with extant populations or with potential for immigration of Markhor from neighboring countries and establish conservation incentives;</li><li>raise public awareness about the conservation importance of the country’s Markhor populations and potential benefits from their sustainable use;</li><li>develop trans-boundary collaboration between nature conservation authorities and community based initiatives, including the prevention of cross-border poaching (Petocz 1972; Petocz and Larsson 1977; Valdez 2008; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012; Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urgent measures are required to conserve the straight-horned “Kabul” Markhor <em>C. f. megaceros</em> if still extant. Surveys to assess numbers and distribution are important. Local people’s support for its conservation is essential, but this will be difficult to obtain, as the initiation of community-based hunting management is currently not possible due to the hunting ban and the difficult security situation in the area.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In India, Markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir’s Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978 (Ganhar 1979). Currently, Markhor in India occur in only three small protected areas: the Limber Game Reserve, and the Lachipora and Hirapora Wildlife Sanctuaries. Conservation measures proposed include:</p><p></p><ul><li>raise awareness among the army, policy makers and local people about the rarity of the Markhor and the importance of the region for its conservation;</li><li>the largest Markhor population, in Kajinag, merits the establishment of a protected refuge and the state’s Wildlife Department has already initiated a move to set up the Kajinag National Park;</li><li>involve local people, especially nomadic herders and the armed forces, in the conservation of Markhor, including the realigning of grazing practices so that important areas of Markhor habitat are excluded from grazing, and as much as possible mitigating the larger impacts due to fencing and insurgency (Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009);</li><li>consider future re-introductions to previously inhabited ranges in the Pir Panjal mountains.</li></ul><p></p><p>    </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Pakistan, the Markhor is completely protected by federal law (Rao 1986). In 1991, the Federal government imposed a 3-year ban on all big game hunting. This ban officially lapsed in 1993 but practically remained in effect, although it was ignored in the case of community-based trophy hunting programs (Shackleton 2001). The central government has issued permits only where a community-based trophy hunting program has been established; as of 2000, 80% of the permit fees were mandated to go to the community and 20% to provincial authorities in charge of nature conservation (although inter-community and provincial-federal disputes over receipts and permitting have occurred). The program continued through 2013 with trophy price for Markhor increasing from US $ 18,000 to about US $ 80,000-100,000. According to official records, between 1998 and 2008 approximately US $ 830,000 was distributed to communities within the former NWFP from hunter remittances from the 17 Markhor taken during this period (A. Khan unpublished data, NWFP Wildlife Management, 2008). With higher trophy fees during the last years, significantly higher contributions to the local communities have created substantial incentives for the conservation of Markhor in the participating conservancies. However, the small number of permits issued by the government (up to 12 per annum in accordance to the CITES export quota) may prevent an extension of the approach into still unmanaged areas.<br/></span><br/>In Pakistan several protected areas contain Flare-horned Markhor: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Chitral Gol NP, Drosh Gol GR, Gahirat Gol GR, Goleem Gol GR, Goleen Gol GR, Purit Gol- Chinar Gol GR, Tushi GR (NWFP 1992); Swat District: Totalai GR (Zool.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir - Muzaffarabad: Mauji CR, Qazi Nag GR, Hillan CR (Zool. Survey Dept. 1986); Poonch District: Phala GR (Qayyum 1986). Only one protected area is known to contain straight-horned markhor in Pakistan: Sheikh Buddin NP (previously a Wildlife Sanctuary) in Dera Ismail Khan District of NWFP (Zoological Survey Dept. 1987). The status of the subspecies in protected areas in Baluchistan is uncertain. Its occurrence is not confirmed in Chiltan-Hazarganji NP, and there is no reliable information for either Sasnamana or Ziarat Juniper WS’s. There are no reports of markhor in protected areas in Punjab.<br/><br/>The Torghar Conservation Project in Baluchistan has reduced poaching and competition by livestock (Johnson 1997; Frisina and Tareen 2009); the markhor population in this area is reported to have increased steadily since initiation of the program (Rosser <em>et al</em>. 2005, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Frisina, Montana State University, pers. comm. 2014). The TCP is the oldest community-controlled program in Pakistan and has been so successful that tribal groups in other mountain ranges of Baluchistan have expressed interest in setting up similar programs (Frisina and Tareen 2009, Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Throughout Diamer, southern Gilgit, and Astore Districts of Gilgit-Baltistan community based conservation programs aimed at Markhor conservation have created over 40 community conservation organizations and 18 registered conservancies, and trained and deployed over 100 community rangers. Markhor are now well-protected and appear to be experiencing a significant recovery (WCS 2012).<br/><br/>Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>treat Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary as a focal area for Markhor and enforce protection measures. Kargah is probably the best place for Markhor in the Gilgit District, and like the Chitral Gol, should be rather easy to control because it is a traditional wildlife sanctuary and is close to Gilgit;</li><li>adopt a similar procedure for the area around Bagheecha in the Indus valley, which is one of the best places in Baltistan for Markhor and also relatively easy to control and to the Haramosh and Sikandarabad valleys (in Hunza-Nagar District) in the region of Central Karakoram National Park;</li><li>develop a conservation and management plans that includes information on the status and distribution of <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in the areas it still inhabits outside the Torghar conservancy; consider the area of Koh-e Sulaiman and the Takatu hills as a focal area for conservation efforts and include participatory management in the tribal areas in this plan;</li><li>retain the hunting ban (with its exception for approved community-based trophy hunts);</li><li>encourage the development of community-based hunting management areas in currently unmanaged areas and buffer zones of national parks, and consider a slight increase of the annual quota to ensure more equitable access to benefits from trophy hunts for all conservancies (with quota set on the basis of monitoring results).</li></ul><p></p>    <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Tajikistan, Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik) with an area of almost 20,000 ha was established in 1973, but since the early 1990s poaching has become common, and the security situation deteriorated due to incursions by Afghans (Michel 2010, Moheb and Mostafawi 2011). Markhor are legally protected, but hunting by foreigners was permitted (at least two Markhor/year) in the early 1990s (Weinberg<em> et al.</em> 1997). For the hunting season 2013-2014 the Government of Tajikistan issued a hunting quota of six Markhor, and five were taken by foreign hunters. Hunts are restricted to conservancies established and managed by local small family businesses and community based non-governmental organizations. About 80% of the Markhor recorded by the recent survey (Alidodov<em> et al. </em>2014) were in these conservancies. All captive Markhor in Dashtijum and Romit Strict Nature Reserves and the introduced animals in Romit were poached during civil unrest during the 1990s. </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Proposed conservation measures include:</span></p><p></p><ul><li>strengthening community-based conservation and management through secure rights and obligations for conservancies, issuing of area-specific hunting quotas based on survey results, issuing of import permits for hunting trophies and sharing of benefits with local communities;</li><li>prevention of assignment of hunting rights to non-locals and business structures and of illegal trophy hunts;</li><li>reducing poaching through trans-boundary collaboration, community-based hunting management and law enforcement;</li><li>reducing the risk of disease transmission from domestic sheep and goats by implementing grazing regulations minimizing direct and indirect transmission risks, monitoring the presence of infectious agents in domestic stock and implementing efficient vaccinations on domestic sheep and goats at least against CCPP and Peste des Petits Ruminant disease;</li><li>preservation of the quality of habitat through regulation of forest use and grazing.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Turkmenistan the species is legally protected. Markhor occur in the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik), established in 1986 and covering about 27,000 ha. Lukarevsky (2002) suggested that ecotourism and trophy hunting may provide incentives for the conservation of Markhor. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested enlarging the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve because it protects only the high elevation summer habitat of Markhor and the currently unprotected lower winter ranges are grazed by livestock. Critical for any consideration of a potential trophy hunting programme would be the full involvement of local community members and a benefit sharing mechanism which would ensure their support.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, trophy hunting of Markhor took place in the 1990s (e.g. two in 1994; Weinberg <em>et al. </em>1997) and until about 2005, including hunting in an enclosure containing a small captive group, which no longer exists (S. Zagrebin pers. comm. 2013). The EU Scientific Review Group in 2006 expressed a negative opinion on the import of Markhor trophies originating from the wild, which led to a suspension of trade in 2007. Markhor in Uzbekistan occur in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik). With assistance by a UNDP/GEF project during 2008-13 a managed buffer zone was established, encompassing all current Markhor habitat outside the strict nature reserve. Collaboration between the Kugitang (Turkmenistan) and Surkhan Strict Nature Reserves would be of utmost importance for the conservation management of this trans-boundary subpopulation.</p>  <em></em>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Three-dimensional complex microhabitats with vegetated and rocky bottoms are key components for the survival of this species, which rarely uses simple, largely exposed microhabitats, such as sandy bottoms or open waters (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2017b).&#160;Individuals are found in areas adjacent to the lagoons where it occurs, in aquatic and terrestrial habitat, although most often in aquatic habitat (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160;It is not known from degraded habitats.<br/><br/>The tadpole was described by Cei (1965) and internal oral features described by Wassertsug and Heyer (1988). Cei (1965) mentioned the omnivorous, probably suctorial habit of the tadpoles.&#160;Breeding is seasonal and takes place within lagoons during the spring.&#160;Tadpoles have been found throughout the year (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2014), but only when the lagoons retain water all year.&#160;In permanent lagoons, tadpoles present two strategies: seasonal (short larval period; metamorphs in the same growing season) and overwintering tadpoles (long larval period, tadpoles undergoing metamorphosis the following spring). In temporary lagoons, desiccation appears to exert great pressure, with accelerated larval development,&#160;resulting in short larval periods, between spring and early autumn (Cuello&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Postmetamorphic individuals can exhibit two morphotypes: aquatic and littoral (= terrestrial; Cei and Roig 1968). In permanent lagoons, this frog mainly exhibits the aquatic morphotype, while in temporary lagoons individuals are able to change morphology to both aquatic and terrestrial environments in response to environmental changes (Cei and Roig 1968, Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;The diets of the two morphotypes are completely different, although both are carnivorous (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2006a; 2009c). The most important prey of postmetamorphic individuals in the aquatic environment are amphipods (<em>Hyalella</em>) and Odonata larvae, while in the terrestrial environment the preferred prey are terrestrial insects and arachnids (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2006a,b; 2009c).","The main subpopulation (Laguna Blanca) was extirpated after the introduction of exotic fishes (<em>Percichthyis</em> sp. and salmonids). The remaining subpopulations are isolated from this lake. Introduction of predatory fishes to the remaining lakes is a potential major threat to all subpopulations.&#160;Salmonids have been found in one lagoon where this frog occurs, while in another lagoon where perch were observed (Laguna El Alamo),&#160;<em>Atelognathus patagonicus</em> was not found (Cuello<em> et al.</em> 2009b).<br/><br/>The species is currently threatened by the degradation of its habitat caused by livestock drinking from the lagoons and grazing on the aquatic vegetation (Cuello<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2014, 2017b). Furthermore, the aquatic vegetation on which this species depends was severely deteriorated in all the lagoons as a consequence&#160;of the prolonged drought between 2010 and mid-2016&#160;(M.E. Cuello pers. obs.&#160;January 2017). The dramatic climatic cycles occurring in the region can act synergistically with other risk factors (M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017).<br/><br/>Fox <em>et al</em>. (2005) reported that most subpopulations had many dead and moribund tadpoles and frogs, all of which showed clinical signs of disease, and subsequently, ranavirus and&#160;<em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> were both detected in several subpopulations within Laguna Blanca National Park (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2006, Ghirardi <em>et al</em>. 2014).","The species was very abundant in&#160;Laguna Blanca&#160;until 1983 (Péfaur and Duellman 1980, Administración de Parques Nacionales 1993), grew scarce in 1984, and from 1986 on has not been observed at that site.&#160;Hypotheses to explain this drastic population decline and its extirpation from Laguna Blanca include habitat loss, competition, and predation by perch (<em>Percichthys colhuapiensis</em>)&#160;(Fox <em>et al</em>.&#160;2005,&#160;Cuello and Perotti, 2006,&#160;Ortubay&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006), which were introduced to Laguna Blanca and other small lagoons that are naturally fishless (Ortubay&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).&#160;<br/><br/>Surveys of this species in 15 lakes in and around Laguna Blanca National Park at various times between 2000 and 2002 revealed relatively high densities of individuals along transects near shorelines (overall average highest density per lake of 0.58 individuals/m<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Fox <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;Subsequently, surveys using underwater traps in Laguna Verde (Laguna Blanca National Park)&#160;during 2004-2009 also revealed high densities of postmetamorphic individuals (3.93 individuals/trap in one night, January 2006) and tadpoles (8.3 individuals/trap in one night, January 2006; Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2017b).&#160;Similar high densities were reported in Laguna Batea (Cuello <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Between January 2003 and&#160;March 2006, this species was found in 23 of the 28 lagoons surveyed, including the&#160;14 lagoons where it had been previously documented&#160;by Fox <em>et al</em>. (2005) and&#160;in nine new localities (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Given the isolation of each subpopulation, the population is considered to be severely fragmented, such that there is limited or no dispersal between subpopulations. Nevertheless, Martinazzo <em>et al</em>. (2011) found that the diversity index observed in <em>Atelognathus patagonicus</em> revealed low genetic variability from the lagoons of the Laguna Blanca system.&#160;<br/><br/>During 2010-mid 2016, all subpopulations suffered a new, drastic population decline caused by a prolonged drought, which suppressed reproduction during six years (Cuello <em>et al</em>. 2015, M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017). Surveys performed in years during the drought did not find any individuals (M.E. Cuello pers. obs.&#160;2011–2016). Additionally, the aquatic habitat was severely deteriorated in all lagoons as a consequence of the dramatic drought (M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017). By mid-2016,&#160;increased precipitation allowed the water levels to slightly recover, however the habitat was still degraded (M.E. Cuello pers. comm.&#160;October 2017). During 2017, surveys&#160;using subaquatic traps&#160;in Laguna Verde revealed densities of tadpoles and frogs&#160;much lower than those&#160;prior to the&#160;drought, <em>c</em>. 1% of the previous relative abundance (postmetamorphic individuals = 0.07 individuals/trap in one night and tadpoles = 0.1 individuals/trap in one night; M.E. Cuello pers. obs.&#160;January 2017). Similar low densities were registered in Laguna Antiñir. While this is likely to be the first stage of the recovery period (M.E. Cuello pers. comm. October 2017), the past population decline, estimated to be more than 90% over the last ten years, inferred from the observed reduction in population size and a decline in the quality of its aquatic habitat as a consequence&#160;of the prolonged drought between 2010 and mid-2016 remains a concern.",Increasing,"This species is endemic to north-western Argentinean Patagonia where it has been recorded from a system of endorreic and isolated lagoons scattered&#160;on the basaltic plateau in and around Laguna Blanca National Park, in mid-western Neuquén Province.

102331567,15932,Pan paniscus,Endangered,A4bcd,2016,2016-03-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to high levels of illegal hunting, and habitat destruction and degradation, <em>Pan paniscus</em> is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in the last 15–20 years and it is thought that this reduction will continue for the next 60 years. Currently, by far the greatest threat to the Bonobo's survival is poaching for the commercial bushmeat trade. It has been estimated that nine tons of bushmeat are extracted daily from a 50,000-km² conservation landscape within the Bonobo’s range. Not only is there is a massive demand for bushmeat stemming from the cities, but rebel factions and poorly-paid government soldiers add to that demand, at the same time facilitating the flow of guns and ammunition (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). In some areas, local taboos against eating Bonobo meat still exist, but in others, these traditions are disintegrating due to changing cultural values and population movements. Stricter enforcement of wildlife laws and more effective management are urgently needed.<br/><br/>Habitat loss through deforestation and fragmentation ranks second. Much of the forest loss in this region is caused by slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture, which is most intense where human densities are high or growing. Logging and mining do not yet occur on an industrial scale in the Bonobo’s range, but in future, industrial agriculture is very likely to become a serious threat. Minimising the conversion of intact forest to human-dominated land uses, will be critical for the future survival of Bonobos. Countrywide factors contributing to the decline include the mobility of growing human populations, opening markets, commercial exploitation of natural resources and road construction. As in the past, the survival of Bonobos will be determined by the levels of poaching and forest loss—threats that have been shown to accompany rapid growth in human populations and political instability (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2014). Due to their slow life history and a generation time estimated to be 25 years, Bonobo populations cannot withstand high levels of offtake. The population decline over a three-generation (75 year) period from 2003 to 2078 is likely to exceed 50%, hence qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A.<br/><p></p>","The geographic range of <em>Pan paniscus</em> is characterised by undulating terrain with elevations between 300 and 700 m asl and a humid climate (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bonobos inhabit closed, moist, mixed, mature and secondary forests as well as forest-savannah mosaics (<em>ibid</em>.). In the eastern and southern parts of their range, Bonobos occupy a mosaic of moist tropical forest, dry forest, savannah woodland, marshy grassland and swamp forest, yet they also require access to relatively-undisturbed mature forests. If available, Bonobos prefer primary forests and seasonally-inundated swamp forests, foraging in small streams and breast-deep ponds (Narat 2014, Serckx 2014).<br/><br/>Bonobos are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. They live in multimale-multifemale, fission-fusion communities, usually made up of 30–80 individuals. A single community occupies a home range of 20–60 km², and there is extensive overlap between the ranges of different communities (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bonobos are omnivorous; over 50% of their diet is comprised of fruits and seeds, which are supplemented with leaves, stems, shoots, pith, bark, flowers, truffles, fungus, and honey (Hohmann <em>et al</em>. 2006). They appear to be more dependent on terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, including aquatic plants, than chimpanzees. Bonobos have occasionally been documented hunting and eating vertebrates (e.g., duikers, primates; Hohmann and Fruth 2008) and invertebrates (e.g., termites, caterpillars; Kano 1992). Bonobos build new nests to sleep in each night and sometimes make day nests in trees at heights of 5–50 m (Fruth 1995). It has been reported that Bonobos also make ground nests (Kano 1983, Guislain and Reinartz pers. comm). Their role as seed dispersers is critical for forest regeneration (Tsuji <em>et al</em>. 2010, Beaune <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>There is no birth season. Gestation is about eight months. Interbirth interval at Wamba (1976–1996) averages 4.8 years, and females average 0.18 offspring per year of their adult life. Physical maturation is slow with infants being weaned shortly before birth of the next offspring. Infant and juvenile mortality is low, with 73% of offspring surviving to age six (Furuichi <em>et al</em>. 1998). Females migrate aged 6–13 years, settling into a new community when they start cycling at 9–12 years. They produce their first offspring at 13–14 years of age (Furuichi <em>et al</em>. 2012). One generation is estimated to be 23–25 years (Myers Thompson 1997, T. Furuichi pers. comm. 2007, Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><p></p>","<p>The major threats to Bonobos include: poaching (mainly for bushmeat and for some medicinal purposes); residue from civil warfare (availability of modern weaponry and ammunition; military-sanctioned hunting); human-induced habitat alteration (commercial logging and agriculture, traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, fallow land); human population growth and migration; and lack of education (insufficient awareness among urban and rural communities that hunting and eating Bonobos is unlawful). Bonobos reproduce slowly, and thus their populations are particularly susceptible to direct losses caused by humans.&#160;</p><p></p><ol><li><strong>Poaching</strong>: despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, poaching is the most direct and immediate threat to great apes in DRC. Although taboos against hunting Bonobos still exist in some regions, these taboos have become ineffective where poachers are not local. In other locations, transient and immigrant human populations with different cultural values have increased the frequency of hunting and eating of Bonobos. Poachers prefer large mammals, and since&#160;Bonobos are the largest primate in the region, they may be targeted along with ungulates and monkeys. Commercial poachers, aided by military and local administrations, are active even in legally-protected sites, such as Salonga National Park (SNP), Lomako-Yokokala Faunal Reserve, Tumba-Lediima Natural Reserve, Sankuru Natural Reserve, and the proposed Lomami National Park. The importance of these protected areas as significant reservoirs of Bonobos will be compromised rapidly if current levels of poaching continue. Between 2003 and 2006, Hart <em>et al</em>. (2008) recorded evidence of poaching in 51% of survey grids across SNP, with hunting pressure highest in the north and east. However, since then, investment in effective antipoaching measures appears to have protected at least the Lokofa Sector in the southern block of SNP, where Bonobo abundance remained stable between 2006 and 2015 (WCS 2015). Extrapolating from interview data gathered for a bushmeat survey conducted in the Lomami National Park (LNP) area in 2008, it was estimated that 270 Bonobos per year were consumed around Kindu, representing three Bonobos per 100 km² per year in the area investigated (Mirambo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Currently, this negative trend has been halted within the park through surveillance and collaboration with local communities (Hart and Hart 2011, 2015). The intake rate of orphaned Bonobos into the Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary may be viewed as another indicator of hunting pressure and/or anti-trafficking efforts. Hughes <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated that 4.2 Chimpanzees (2.6–8.9 individuals) are removed from the wild whenever a single live infant is obtained as a by-product of a hunt. Considering that Bonobos are more social than Chimpanzees, the ratio of dead&#160;Bonobos per orphaned infant may be higher. Data compiled between 1994 and 2012 show a small but steady increase in the number of orphans entering the sanctuary, with two peaks each of six infants in 1997 and 2000 during the Congolese wars, and a peak of 16 individuals in 2004 after the implementation of peace and return to the regular use of rivers as major transport routes (ABC 2012). An influx of nine Bonobos in 2012 was also notably high, but arrivals decreased to two in 2015. While various explanations for lower intakes are possible (e.g., decline of Bonobos in the wild, or effective anti-poaching and anti-trafficking measures, or Bonobos being exported illegally), it is important to remember that the variation in such small numbers may be stochastic, rather than a real trend.</li><li><strong>Habitat loss</strong>: subsistence agriculture, commercial agriculture, logging and road construction all cause forest loss and fragmentation that reduces the usable (or ‘effective’) habitat available to&#160;Bonobos. Moreover, civil strife has been shown to exacerbate destruction and degradation of&#160;Bonobo&#160;habitat: in Luo Scientific Reserve and Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve, primary forest loss in previously unfragmented core forests was over two times greater during a decade when conflict and war were predominant in the region (1990–2000) than during a relatively conflict-free period (2000–2010), when humans left their hiding in core forest areas and returned to their natal villages and farms within long-established agricultural complexes (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, as conflict recedes, large-scale commerce is expanding and industrial agriculture is likely to become a significant driver of forest loss. Oil palm is already being grown in what would otherwise be&#160;Bonobo&#160;habitat (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2012), and Africa is becoming the new frontier for oil-palm plantations, which offers excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperature conditions (Rival and Levang 2014). A staggering 99.2% of the Bonobo’s range is suitable for oil palm (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014), highlighting the enormous risk the palm-oil industry will pose unless sustainable management plans are developed and implemented to protect great apes and their habitats (IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014). It is worth noting that even though permits for prospection or resource extraction have already been granted, drilling for petroleum is unlikely to recommence in the near future, given the low price of crude oil on the international market. Although logging and mining do not yet occur on a large scale in Bonobo habitat, industrial extraction could become a serious threat in future. Minimising the conversion of intact forest in DRC to human-dominated land uses, will be critical for the survival of Bonobos, particularly when considering DRC’s high human population growth rate (2.45% in 2015; CIA 2015).</li><li><strong>Disease</strong>: infectious diseases are of particular concern in areas where Bonobos live in close proximity to human communities, or have been habituated to human observers for research or tourism purposes (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015). Diseases that pose a risk to Bonobos include human-borne pathogens such as respiratory viruses, and natural pathogens such as <em>Ebolavirus</em>. Respiratory disease outbreaks were observed among Bonobos at Wamba when displaced people and soldiers were moving through the forest (Sakamaki<em> et al</em>. 2009), and human respiratory syncytial virus and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> co-infection has been detected at Malebo, where Bonobo habitat is surrounded by a particularly high human density (Leendertz pers. comm.). In 2014, a human outbreak of Ebola virus disease occurred in the Bonobo’s range. Considering their highly cohesive social structure, and high rates of physical contact, an <em>Ebolavirus</em> outbreak could devastate a Bonobo community. Despite a lack of scientific investigation of disease in wild Bonobos, these cases highlight the increasing need for health monitoring and disease contingency plans, as recommended by Gilardi <em>et al</em>. (2015).</li></ol><p></p><p></p>","The size of the Bonobo population is uncertain because only 30% of its historic range has been surveyed. Estimates from the four known Bonobo strongholds, based around protected areas, suggest a minimum population of 15,000–20,000 individuals (IUCN and ICCN 2012, IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). Although Hickey <em>et al</em>. (2013) compiled and analysed all Bonobo survey data collected between 2003 and 2010, the survey coverage was too patchy to allow the total number of Bonobos to be estimated.<br/><br/>Sop <em>et al</em>. (in prep.) used spatial modelling to investigate trends in Bonobo nest encounter rates on recce and standard line transect surveys carried out in two different periods. Data were available from eight sites, covering a total area of 16,500 km². Site-specific change estimates were weighted according to population size, and then change in nest encounter rates between different years was used as a proxy for Bonobo population change. Rate of change was estimated using two approaches: site-level Generalized Linear Models (GLMs); and a simple exponential population change model (ExpM). Sop <em>et al</em>. estimated an annual decline of 5.95% with a total decline of 54.9% between 2003 and 2015 (95% confidence interval: -17.6% to +6.4% and -18% to +0.001% for the GLM and ExpM, respectively). Under the same conditions, the expected decline in abundance over one, two and three generations (25, 50 and 75 years respectively) would be 85.6%, 97.9% and 99.7%, respectively. However, not all sites experienced significant declines in Bonobo abundance. The Lokofa Sector of Salonga National Park, for example, has ecoguards deployed throughout and was the best protected of the eight sites in the analysis (WCS 2015). Although Sop <em>et al</em>.’s assessment incorporated data from both protected and non-protected areas, the total coverage was limited by data availability. In addition, the preliminary model had limitations with regard to the representativeness of sites and data availability, such as disproportionate sampling effort between years; and lack of data on seasonality, nest production, re-use and decay rates. If few nests are located and sample size is low, then precision tends to be poor, leading to weak detection of trends. Although a drop in abundance between the two time periods was detected, the small number of paired samples did not produce population sizes. The range-wide data required will eventually show areas considered to be suitable, but from which Bonobos are absent, and perhaps presence of Bonobos in areas not yet surveyed. Despite uncertainty around the modelled rate of decline, a strong negative trend is apparent in Sop <em>et al</em>.’s analysis. Even with an annual rate of decline of only 1%, total losses would exceed 50% over three generations, underscoring the need for monitoring of Bonobo populations and threats.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pan paniscus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> has a discontinuous range in the low-lying central basin of Equatorial Africa, south of the Congo River.

Bonobos are protected by national and international laws throughout their range, and the majority are found in national parks (IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). However, most protected areas lack resources and suffer from poorly-controlled poaching, and enforcement is generally weak.</p><p>An IUCN and ICCN (2012) Bonobo conservation strategy (<a href=""http://www.primate-sg.org/bonobo"">http://www.primate-sg.org/bonobo</a>)&#160;outlines five intervention strategies with objectives and conservation actions centred on the Bonobo&#160;‘strongholds’,&#160;which are to be implemented by 2022:</p><p></p><ol><li><strong>Strengthening institutional capacity.&#160;</strong>One objective under this strategy is the creation of new protected areas. Since SNP was established in 1970, an additional 35,580 km² supporting Bonobos has been officially designated. The Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve in the ‘northern block’ was created in 2012 (Sakamaki <em>et al.</em> 2012). The establishment of LNP, currently a provincial park with a ban on all hunting, will add 8,880 km² of protected habitat to the Bonobo’s range (Doumenge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Once LNP is officially gazetted, protected areas harbouring Bonobo populations will total more than 78,080 km². Protected areas, however, will not curtail poaching as long as law enforcement is ineffective, thus the objectives of eliminating poaching, monitoring and controlling the bushmeat trade, and eliminating the circulation of weapons and ammunition in protected areas are crucial. Considerable efforts have been made in SNP, with recent improvements in guard numbers, education and equipment. The government’s ‘Operation Bonobo’ aims to confiscate military weapons that have been in circulation since 2012, carry out joint FARDC and ICCN patrols, and liberate the parts of SNP under the control of poachers. A specially-trained ‘<em>Corps en charge de la sécurisation des Parcs Nationaux</em>’ will be in charge of anti-poaching in all national parks. However, law enforcement in the Bonobo’s range as a whole is still fragmentary, and conservation efforts are hampered by the vastness of the areas to be patrolled, as well as corruption and isolation, and persistent political and economic instability. NGOs and research projects with bilateral investment provide greater assurance of active and permanent on-the-ground enforcement, and are working to strengthen ICCN’s limited capacity throughout DRC.</li><li><strong>Consultation and collaboration with local actors.&#160;</strong>Here the main objective is to integrate conservation issues into national development plans, land-use and macro-zoning plans, and implement sustainable subsistence activities at key sites. In an attempt to transfer responsibility for&#160;managing natural&#160;resources to local communities, WWF began sensibilisation activities in the Lac Tumba and Salonga-Lukenie-Sankuru landscapes and around southern block of SNP, and assisted stakeholders to establish local development and conservation committees (<em>Comités locaux de développement et de conservation</em>).&#160;</li><li><strong>Awareness building and lobbying.&#160;</strong>Objectives include developing a nationwide communications strategy, undertaking awareness-building activities at key sites, sensitising urban communities and private sector operators, and lobbying government administration at national and provincial levels. In 1995, USAID established the 25-year Central Africa Regional Programme for the Environment (CARPE) to increase local, national and regional capacity and participation in natural resource management, and strengthen conservation policy development and implementation to reduce biodiversity loss. Recently, CARPE established two distinct but interdependent projects:&#160;an Environmental Monitoring and Policy Support (EMAPS) project intended to boost the quality and scope of conservation policy-making, and forest monitoring, analysis and information dissemination; and CAFEC (see below; USAID 2014). Smaller organisations are conducting conservation education programmes in areas adjacent to Bonobo habitat as well as urban centres, such as Kinshasa or Kisangani, where demand for bushmeat is high. For example, Lola ya Bonobo in Kinshasa welcomes more than 20,000 visitors per annum, half of them school children. Such education-outreach activities can influence local attitudes to wildlife (ABC 2014).</li><li><strong>Research and monitoring activities.&#160;</strong>The primary objective here is to develop a clear framework for monitoring Bonobo populations and the threats to Bonobos, which is necessary to track changes in population size and distribution, to assess the level and location of threats, and ultimately to assess progress towards the Goal and Vision of the 2012 conservation strategy. The Central Africa Forest Ecosystems Conservation (CAFEC) project, and the SCAEMPS programme (Strengthening Central Africa Environmental Management and Policy Support) were established under CARPE. CAFEC supports the sustainable management of targeted forest landscapes, which include most of the landscapes where Bonobos occur, and involves targeted, site-based activities. SCAEMPS is a regional ‘quality control’ programme, ensuring that standardised, state of the art methods of monitoring wildlife, law enforcement (such as SMART&#160;<a href=""http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org/"">http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org</a>), and livelihoods and governance are used across CARPE landscapes, and that databases are established to store the data collected. Supported by CARPE and other donors, ICCN and international NGOs have implemented surveys in about 40% of SNP. A three-year co-management agreement for the future monitoring and management of SNP was signed in 2015, focusing on the education, training and support of guards. Development of cost-efficient methods for biomonitoring (camera traps, drones) is underway. Development of a disease prevention plan to minimise human-Bonobo disease transmission, and establish an early detection mechanism and an emergency intervention plan to address potentially catastrophic disease outbreaks is not yet underway.</li><li><strong>Sustainable funding.&#160;</strong>Here, the objective is to evaluate funding needs for Bonobo conservation and create sustainable sources of funding. In the last 10 years,&#160;government donors (EU, KfW, USAID) have provided considerable conservation finance to support biodiversity conservation, park management, education or other developmental aid, rather than species-specific activities.&#160;While Bonobos will benefit from general support, a number of smaller donors (Arcus Foundation, Beneficia Foundation, USFWS, zoological gardens) are sponsoring the smaller NGOs and distinct projects focused on Bonobo conservation. Monetary support has slowly increased over time; however, the extent to which Bonobo populations outside protected areas is benefitting needs to be assessed. Fortunately, the Bonobo population does not need to be reinforced with individuals bred in captivity. In 2009 and 2011, Lola ya Bonobo, where intake rates and breeding have led to spatial constraints, released rehabilitated Bonobos back into the wild. The released individuals adapted easily to their new environment, became fully independent and reproduced successfully. Despite this success and the repopulation of a small area of former Bonobo habitat, reintroduction of great apes is controversial and often viewed as a mechanism for managing sanctuary populations (ABC 2014, C. André pers. comm.). Even more contentious are the potential ramifications for resident wild Bonobos, despite careful planning and selection of the site, and diligent preparation of the individual Bonobos released following IUCN guidelines for the reintroduction of great apes (Beck <em>et al</em>. 2007).</li></ol><p></p><p>In sum, for protection of Bonobos to be effective, commercial poaching must be halted, intensification rather than expansion of local agriculture&#160;must be supported, and local industries must be actively persuaded to support rather than subvert conservation objectives. The most urgent conservation measures needed are those that enhance Bonobo survival <em style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';"">in situ</em>: effective law enforcement; long-term project presence on the ground; population monitoring; and education at all levels of society.</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

107263066,41586,Lycalopex fulvipes,Endangered,C1,2016,2016-03-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Darwin’s Fox is endemic to Chile. The species occurs on a large extent of Chiloé Island and in Nahuelbuta National Park (Jiménez and MacMahon 2004). Surveys have revealed that the species is also present on private properties with well-preserved native forests outside of Nahuelbuta National Park. Until recently these were the only known populations for the species, with the exception of a skin found in Punta Chanchán, midway between Nahuelbuta and Chiloé (Vila&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). However, the recent finding of a Darwin’s Fox killed by a dog near Gorbea (D’Elia&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013) and several records in three protected areas in the Valdivian Coastal Range (Farías&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) have confirmed a larger extent of occurrence than previously reported (e.g., Jiménez and McMahon 2004). The presence of individuals has also been confirmed north of Llanquihue Lake, on the foothills of the Andes and approximately 60 km east to the coastal mountain range (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).<br/><br/>The Darwin’s Fox was previously classified in 2004 and 2008 as Critically Endangered based on an estimated population size of “less than 250 mature individuals with at least 90% of the population occurring in one subpopulation” (Chiloé&#160;Island) (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). New distribution information (Vila <em>et al</em>. 2004, D’Elia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014, J. Jiménez pers. obs., A. Farías pers. obs.) indicates that the extent of occurrence of the species is much larger than originally thought and clearly exceeds the threshold for listing it as threatened under criterion B. No reliable population data are available, although foxes seem to be more abundant and to occur at higher densities in Chiloé than on the mainland (J. Jiménez and A. Farías pers. obs.). A very conservative minimum estimate suggests at least 412 and 227 mature individuals occur on Chiloé and on the mainland, respectively. Based on this estimate, the species does not meet the thresholds for listing it as Critically Endangered under criterion C or for listing as Critically Endangered or Endangered under criterion D. Despite the conservative minimum estimate, it is nonetheless likely that total population size does not exceed 2,500 mature individuals and hence the species would meet the threshold for listing as Endangered under criterion C. Since the subpopulation on&#160;Chiloé&#160;very likely exceeds 250 mature individuals, it cannot meet subcriteria C2a(i) or C2a(ii).&#160;However, the combined impacts of forest loss and the risk posed by domestic dogs (especially of contracting Canine Distemper Virus, a risk supported by high seroprevalence in dog populations in areas inhabited by Darwin’s Fox [Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Acosta-Jamett <em>et al</em>. 2015b]), and the evidence for the impacts of these threats on populations, suggest a high likelihood that the population could undergo a decline exceeding 20% in the coming 6-8 years (two generations). Hence the species would meet the subcriteria for listing as EN under C1. It is acknowledged that this assessment might be slightly precautionary if the likelihood or rate of decline is overstated. In that case, the species would at least be listed as Vulnerable as it meets the threshold for listing as Vulnerable under criterion C, and based on the minimum estimate of subpopulation size for Chiloé would also meet subcriterion C2a(i). In summary, the species is considered to qualify for listing as Endangered under criterion C1.","<p>Early research in Nahuelbuta suggested Darwin's Foxes were associated with dense forest (Jaksic <em>et al</em>. 1990, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 1991). More recent radio-telemetry data indicate that animals are found more often in dense <em>Araucaria</em>-<em>Nothofagus</em> forest, open <em>Nothofagus</em> forest and occasionally in open pastures (McMahon <em>et al</em>. 1999). Preliminary data on camera trapping 20 km north-west of Nahuelbuta National Park indicate a similar pattern of occupancy of habitat types (J. Jiménez pers. obs.). More recently, Darwin’s Foxes in Nahuelbuta have been found to be positively associated with native forest availability, and negatively associated with roads (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015a). Positive response of foxes to fine grain habitat structure suggests commercial plantations may also provide complementary habitat and food resources for this diet-generalist species in Nahuelbuta (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015b). They have been recorded to ~1,400 m elevation in Nahuelbuta (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).<br/><br/>In the coastal range of Los Ríos Region, Darwin’s Foxes have been primarily recorded in old-growth and secondary evergreen forests, though they were also detected in unmanaged <em>Eucalyptus</em> spp. plantations (Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014). Foxes are apparently more frequent in the southern area of the Valdivian Coastal Reserve, an area that was less impacted by forest substitution and that have lower human (and dog) densities than the northern area (E. A. Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). Finally, records near the Llanquihue Lake were in a highly fragmented forest with intensive dairy farms having large pastures with linear strips of degraded Valdivian forest along streams (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).<br/><br/>In Chiloé, foxes use a variety of habitats. A study conducted in Chiloé, found that foxes used second-growth forests and scrublands according to availability, old-growth forest less than expected according to availability and that the use of dunes varied between individuals (Jiménez 2007). The consumption of crustaceans and direct observation provides evidence that sandy beaches are also used by this species (Elgueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jiménez 2007). In the north-east of the island, where the forest is fragmented, Darwin’s Fox occur in the larger forest fragments (Farías and Jaksic 2011). Home ranges vary between 103 and 488 ha (Jiménez 2007).</p>","<p>Domestic dogs and associated diseases are likely the main threats for Darwin’s Foxes (Jiménez&#160;and McMahon 2004). Dogs are a common problem in Chilean protected areas, including each of those where the Darwin’s Fox is present. Domestic dogs would represent a risk for foxes through intra-guild killing, as well as through disease transmission (Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Cabello <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b). The death of Darwin’s Foxes due to dog attacks has been reported both on the mainland (D’Elia <em>et al</em>. 2013) and in Chiloé (Espinosa 2011, J. Jiménez pers. obs.). Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2015a) found a negative correlation between the areas used by dogs and foxes in Nahuelbuta. Accordingly, in Chiloé Island, Darwin’s Foxes are rare or absent from old-growth forests frequently visited by dogs, while they are frequently recorded at camera traps in scrublands when dogs are absent (A. Farías pers. obs.), suggesting spatial displacement.&#160;It is important to note that the dog problem that affects Darwin’s Foxes, is caused in most, if not all, cases by poorly managed free-ranging dogs and not feral dogs (D. Moreira pers. obs., E.A. Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.).<br/><br/>The risk of disease spillover from dogs (mainly Canine Distemper Virus, CDV) is considered a major threat for Darwin’s Fox populations (e.g., Jiménez and McMahon 2004, Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015). Exposure of dogs to CDV has been shown in the proximity of Nahuelbuta National Park (Acosta-Jamett <em>et al</em>. 2015b) and Valdivian Coastal Reserve-Alerce Costero National Park (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014). Furthermore, exposure to CDV has been reported for invasive American minks (<em>Neovison vison</em>) in areas were the Darwin’s Fox is present (Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2014), as well as for Chilla (<em>Lycalopex griseus</em>) and Culpeo (<em>Lycalopex culpaeus</em>) in other regions (Acosta-Jamett <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Additionally, Jiménez <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported the death of three radio-collared foxes in Chiloé in sympatry with free-ranging dogs, suggesting that mortality could have been caused by CDV, although conclusive evidence was not available. CDV epizootics in canids have been reported worldwide (e.g., Goller <em>et al</em>. 2010, Di Sabatino <em>et al</em>. 2014), and CDV was implicated in a major decline in the population of the Island Fox (<em>Urocyon littoralis</em>) in Santa Catalina Island (Timm <em>et al</em>. 2009). In South America, Megid <em>et al</em>. (2009, 2010) reported CDV-related mortalities in wild canids in Brazil, and in Chile, Moreira and Stutzin (2005) reported the death of 27 Chilla and Culpeo foxes due to CDV in Coquimbo Region. The lack of conclusive evidence of declines due to CDV in the Darwin’s Fox may be well explained by lack of information, rather than by the absence of outbreaks.<br/><br/>Darwin’s Foxes can also be subject to human-caused mortality. According to J. Jiménez (pers. obs.) and Espinosa (2011), local people in Chiloé reported killing foxes because they attack domestic animals and to obtain their fur. Foxes rescued from traps as well as captured and translocated after predation on poultry have also been reported in Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.). Stowhas (2012) also indicated that local people reported killing foxes (undetermined species) in an area that included the surroundings of Oncol Park, Alerce Costero National Park, and Valdivian Coastal Reserve, as a response to predation on poultry. In Nahuelbuta range, foxes (without distinguishing to the level of species) are often considered as problem animals (Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, Darwin’s Fox is not commonly persecuted or killed by local people (but see McMahon <em>et al</em>. 1999) and its conservation would show a high social support (D. Moreira pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Forest loss is an important threat. The highest rates of forest loss occur in the coastal range of the Araucanía Region, where Nahuelbuta is located. There, the annual loss rate observed for the 1999-2008 period reached 4.8%, the second highest reported for Chilean temperate forest (Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2015). For the Valdivian Coastal Range, the net forest loss between 1985 and 2011 was 5.1% (and the gross loss reached 30%), but the loss rate was higher for the 1985-1999 period than for the 1999-2011 period (Zamorano-Elgueta <em>et al.</em> 2015). In northern Chiloé and Maullín, the annual rates of forest loss was close to 1% (1985-2007), although in the case of Chiloé this rate rose to 1.4% for the 1999-2007 period (Echeverría <em>et al</em>. 2012). Both in the Araucanía and Valdivian cases, cleared native forest was frequently converted to forestry plantations (Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2015, Zamorano-Elgueta <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although Darwin’s Fox has been recorded in plantations (Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014, J. Jiménez pers. obs.), evidence from the population in Nahuelbuta shows that foxes select for native forest (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015a). However, if managed through an increase of native understory cover, commercial plantations may provide complementary habitats and food resources for this species (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015b). Human-induced fires are an always-latent threat, especially for the Nahuelbuta range (D. Moreira pers. obs.). On the other hand, deforestation may favour other (larger sized) fox species (i.e. <em>Lycalopex</em>&#160;<em>griseus </em>and <em>L. culpaeus</em>), better adapted to open areas (e.g., Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2010), which can displace Darwin’s Foxes (Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 1991). The indirect effects of changes in land cover through alteration of interaction webs are still insufficiently known.<br/><br/>Indirect threats that need to be considered include the construction of bridges, highways and roads. Of major concern is the projected construction of the bridge connecting Chiloé to the mainland. This bridge, if barriers are not implemented, may facilitate the invasion of the island by other species such as congeneric foxes and Pumas (<em>Puma concolor</em>), with unknown, but potentially serious consequences for these populations. Road construction and improvement is an additional concern, given that they facilitate dog (Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015a, Sepúlveda <em>et al</em>. 2015) and human movement, and can lead to land cover change (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2005). Existing roads, as well as the construction of new roads and/or the improvement of existing public roads, is a concern for Nahuelbuta (Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014), the Valdivian Coastal Range (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015) and for Chiloé (J. Cabello pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Other threats that need to be taken into account include the translocation of rescued and problem animals (J. Cabello pers. obs.) and illegal tenure of foxes as pets (J. Jiménez pers. obs.).</p>","<p>In Ahuenco, Chiloé, Jiménez (2007) estimated a density of 0.92 foxes/km²&#160;in an area that seems to be prime for the species. In Nahuelbuta, D. Moreira <em>et al</em>. (pers. obs.) have recently found that foxes are patchily distributed across the landscape reaching densities of <em>c.</em> 0.75 foxes/km²&#160;in areas with less disturbed native forest. Foxes are described as common in Chiloé, except for the northern and eastern areas of the island (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). The presence of foxes seems to be largely explained by native forest (Moreira-Arce <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Farías and Jaksic (2011) report for north-eastern Chiloé (likely among the less suitable area for foxes in the island, Jiménez and McMahon 2004) that occupancy was associated with fragment size, with larger fragments mostly occupied. Moreira-Arce&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2015a) report occupancy of 32% for Nahuelbuta (around 10% of cameras with detections). Preliminary data from the Valdivian Coastal Reserve and Alerce Costero National Park (E. A. Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs., A. Farías and Svensson pers. obs.) suggests similar detection rates than for Nahuelbuta. Genetic variability is extremely low for both populations, and despite its presumed larger population size, is lower in Chiloé than in mainland (J. Cabello <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). Polymorphism in animals from Chiloé is lower than in other species (Cabello and Dávila 2014).<br/><br/>Jiménez and McMahon (2004) estimated that the extant Darwin’s Fox population was 78 individuals for Nahuelbuta National Park (and less than 100 for the Nahuelbuta range) and around 500 in Chiloé.&#160;For the purpose of this account a conservative approach was used to obtain an educated guess of the minimum population size of the Darwin’s Fox. Foxes were assumed to occupy 32% of the areas defined in the geographic range (see above). This number derives from the study in Nahuelbuta mentioned above (Moreira-Arce <em>et al</em>. 2015a), and is considered conservative especially when applied to Chiloé for three reasons. First, occupancy was not modelled at the home-range scale, but rather based on camera trap points; it is expected that increasing grain to the home range scale will also increase occupancy estimates. Second, Nahuelbuta is the northern limit of the distribution and the condition of the habitat is less favourable than in other areas such as Chiloé (J. Jiménez and D. Moreira pers.&#160;obs.), thus lower densities are expected in&#160;Nahuelbuta. Third, Nahuelbuta is located in an area that has been severely affected by land conversion (see Miranda <em>et al</em>. 2015), likely representing the most disturbed area within the current distribution of this fox. We then assumed that in occupied areas the density of mature foxes was 0.2 foxes/km². This number was calculated (1/488) from the largest home range (488 ha) reported in Jiménez (2007) and assumes that mature foxes do not have overlapping home ranges, an assumption that is extremely conservative as Jiménez (2007) showed high home range overlap (and a density of 0.92 foxes/km²). This procedure was equivalent to applying a density of 6.6 foxes/100 km². We did not attempt to estimate an upper limit of the population size. As a result we estimated a minimum of 412 mature individuals for Chiloé and 227 mature individuals for the areas in mainland where the fox is known to be present. If considering the areas where the fox is potentially extant, the minimum population size in mainland would approach 489 individuals.</p>",Decreasing,"Darwin’s Fox is endemic to Chile occurring in at least two distinct populations (Jiménez and McMahon 2004). One is found in the forests of Chiloé Island, while the second population is on the coastal range in mainland Chile. The mainland population is apparently discontinuous. Until recently, the fox was known to occur only in the Nahuelbuta range (e.g., Medel<em> et al.</em> 1990, Jiménez and McMahon 2004). However, recent records confirm the presence of the species in the Valdivian coastal range (Vila <em>et al</em>. 2004, D’Elia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Farías <em>et al</em>. 2014), including at least three protected areas: Alerce Costero National Park, the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (both ca. 40°05'S, 73°30'W), and the Oncol Park (39°42'S, 73°18'W). Nahuelbuta and the Valdivian Coastal Range are separated by heavily disturbed landscapes. A recent record near Maullín (41°27'S, 73°48'W) (A. Farías, pers. obs.) suggests that the species is potentially extant between Bueno River and Maullín. Finally, a few individuals detected in 2014 north of Llanquihue Lake&#160;(40°53'S, 72°50'W, J. Jiménez pers. obs.), on the foothills of the Andes, would suggest that the range of this species is larger than thought, although it cannot be ruled out that such individuals belong to the same subpopulation as those in the coastal range.&#160;In summary, the fox is considered to be extant in the following areas (see map): Nahuelbuta-Caramávida, Lastarria, Oncol-Chanchán, Valdivian Coastal Reserve-Alerce Costero National Park and surrounding forest, Maullín and Puerto Octay. Darwin’s Fox is potentially extant in the forested areas between the Bueno River and Maullín and the forested areas north to Mehuín (between Gorbea and Chanchán records).","There is no commercial use of this species. However, some animals have been illegally kept in captivity as pets (Jiménez and McMahon 2004), and there is some limited off-take for fur (Espinosa 2011).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Legislation<br/></strong>Included on CITES - Appendix II. Protected by Chilean law since 1929 (Iriarte and Jaksic 1986). Darwin’s Fox is listed as endangered in Chile (DS 151/2007 MINSEGPRES). Since 2012, the Ministry of the Environment is working in the elaboration of the Recovery, Conservation and Management plan for the species (RECOGE for its Spanish acronym), but this plan is not in effect yet.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in protected areas<br/></strong>The Darwin’s Fox occurs in the following public protected areas: Nahuelbuta National Park (Araucanía Administrative Region), Alerce Costero National Park (Los Ríos Administrative Region), and Chiloé National Park (Los Lagos Administrative Region). In addition, the species is found in the following private protected areas: Caramávida Reserve (Biobío Administrative Region), Oncol Park and Valdivian Coastal Reserve (Los Ríos Administrative Region), and Tantauco, Ahuenco and Tepuhueico Parks (Los Lagos Administrative Region). Some of these protected areas are targeting the species through monitoring, supporting research or attempting to address the dog problem (e.g., Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014, Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Darwin’s Fox is one of the conservation targets (Darwin’s Fox, guigna and pudu) of the Valdivian Coastal Reserve (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Following the criteria by Simonetti and Mella (1997), and the densities reported by Jiménez (2007), it is possible to assume that good quality areas of around 550 km²<sup>&#160;</sup>in size could sustain ~500 individuals (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al.</em> 2015). Tantauco Park in Chiloé, and the area protected by the Valdivian Coastal Reserve and Alerce Costero National Park as a whole, are the only protected areas that meet this criterion, although this does not guarantee the existence of such a number of foxes, as they appear to be scarcer in the Valdivian population (E. A. Silva-Rodríguez and A. Farías, pers. obs.), and the density of foxes in Ahuenco could be much higher than in other areas (Jiménez 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Species-based measures<br/></strong>Vaccination of dogs against CDV has been conducted around some of the above-mentioned protected areas with the aim of preventing disease outbreaks that could affect Darwin’s Foxes (e.g., Sánchez <em>et al</em>. 2014, Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). Current efforts to understand problems related to disease and its management in this species include the project ”Saving Darwin’s Fox: A Conservation Medicine Approach” led by Buin Zoo and several local organizations including among them Chiloé Silvestre and Parque Tantauco, as well as several universities.<br/><br/>Environmental education efforts are being conducted by several stakeholders. These include efforts by the Ministry of Environment, CONAF (Chile’s Forest Service), as well as private organizations such as the Committee for the Rescue of Nahuelbuta,&#160;Tantauco and The Nature Conservancy.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity<br/></strong>Currently, the only known captive Darwin’s Foxes are kept by Fauna Andina near Villarrica, where successful reproduction has been achieved in two consecutive years. These animals have been rescued from dog attacks and illegal ownership from Chiloé&#160;(F. Vidal pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Gaps in knowledge<br/></strong>Most known populations are currently being studied by researchers from multiple institutions. Key topics under study include genetics (J. Cabello pers. obs.), disease (E. Hidalgo pers. comm.), occupancy and habitat use (Silva-Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. pers. obs.). The later topic still deserves clarification regarding (1) the presence of the species between the Bueno and Maullín rivers (i.e. coastal mountain range of Osorno Province), (2) its potential presence in the Andes and lowlands between the Andes and the Coastal Range, and (3) under-explored areas in continental Chiloé. Furthermore, accurate information is needed regarding the abundance of the species in each of these populations.<br/><br/>Key issues that need to be addressed include the management of domestic dogs. Irresponsible ownership is the rule rather than the exception in Chile. Despite long legislative discussion, no serious solution is in place for this problem. Effective enforcement of responsible ownership is absolutely necessary to address this problem. Recently CONAF passed some rules that limit the entrance of dogs to protected areas (CONAF 2015), but these measures need to be supported by a coherent legislation.<br/><br/>The adequate management of exotic plantations is an important priority. Recent studies suggest that several forest species can use forest plantations if they have dense native understory (Simonetti <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thus, leaving understory in exotic tree plantations may be key to maintain connectivity in Darwin’s Fox populations, especially in Nahuelbuta (Moreira-Arce <em>et al</em>. 2016). The challenge is to implement these recommendations.</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The species has an extremely large range and the overall population trend is very difficult to determine due to varying trends in different populations along different flyways. The population using the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is thought to be experiencing severe declines due to habitat loss in the Yellow Sea, and the population using the East Atlantic Flyway may also be undergoing declines. Should new information arise providing clarification on the overall population trend it may warrant uplisting or downlisting.","This species breeds on slightly elevated areas in the lowlands of the high Arctic especially on southward-facing slopes, as well as along the coast and islands of the Arctic Ocean&#160;(Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). It shows a preference for open tundra with marshy, boggy depressions and pools (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Lappo <em>et al. </em>2012) from melting permafrost and snow (Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;The nest is a cup positioned on the margins of marshes or pools, on the slopes of hummock tundra, or on dry patches in&#160;<em>Polygonum</em>&#160;tundra (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;In the winter the species chiefly occurs on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal mud- and sand-flats, estuaries, saltmarshes (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), exposed coral, rocky shores and tidewrack on sandy beaches (Urban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986), and also inland on the muddy edges of marshes, large rivers and lakes (both saline and freshwater), irrigated land, flooded areas (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1996), dams (Urban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986) and saltpans (Khomenko 2006).&#160;On the breeding grounds the diet of this species consists mainly of insects, such as the adults, pupae and larva of Diptera (e.g. midges, craneflies (Johnsgard 1981)) and beetles, as well as bugs and leeches (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;In the winter its diet consists of polychaete worms, molluscs, crustaceans (such as amphipods, brine shrimps and copepods), and occasionally insects and seeds (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>1996). It is a full migrant, moving long distances by well-travelled routes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).","The key threat in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway population is thought to be loss of stopover habitats in the Yellow Sea (see Melville <em>et al. </em>2016). In China and South Korea important migrational staging areas of this species around the coast of the Yellow Sea are being lost through land reclamation, and degraded as a result of declining river flows (from water abstraction), increased environmental pollution, unsustainable harvesting of benthic fauna and a reduction in the amount of sediment being carried into the area by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers (Barter 2002, Barter 2006, Kelin and Qiang 2006). These losses are thought to be driving declines in shorebird populations (Amano&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Melville <em>et al. </em>2016). It is estimated that up to 65% of tidal flats in the Yellow Sea region have been lost over the past five decades, with an annual loss of 1.2% per year since the 1980s (Murray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The species is threatened on the south-east coast of India (Point Calimere) by illegal hunting (bird trapping), reservoir and marshland habitat alteration by salt-industries, and habitat degradation by diminishing rainfall (changing the salt regime) (Balachandran 2006). It is also threatened at Walvis Bay in Namibia, a key wetland site in southern Africa, by habitat degradation (e.g. changes in the flood regime due to road building, and wetland reclamation for suburb and port development), and disturbance from tourism (Wearne and Underhill 2005). This species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet <em>et al.</em> 2007) and avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.","The global   population is estimated to number c.1,085,000-1,285,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015). The minimum European population in winter is estimated at 1,000-1,800 individuals, which equates to 690-1,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). The population wintering in West Africa is estimated at 350,000-450,000 individuals (van Roomen <em>et al</em>. 2015). The East Asian-Australasian Flyway population has been estimated at 90,000 individuals (Hansen <em>et al. </em>2016).",Decreasing,"The species breeds across Arctic Siberia from the Chosa Bay to Kolyuchinskaya Gulf (north Chukotskiy Peninsula) (<strong>Russia</strong>) (Lappo <em>et al. </em>2012), and winters from sub-Saharan Africa through the Middle East and south and south-east Asia to Australasia (van Gils and Wiersma 1996). In the western Palearctic the species follows three migratory routes: down western European coasts to West Africa; across eastern Europe via the Black Sea and <strong>Tunisia</strong>&#160;to West Africa (following the coast of North Africa or via <strong>Mali</strong>); and via the Black Sea and Caspian Sea and across the Middle East and Rift Valley lakes to southern and eastern Africa (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). On return migration few birds use the western European flyway, instead moving up via Tunisia and Sivash (north Crimea). Birds that move south through Sivash winter in east, central and southern Africa and probably migrate north via the Caspian Sea. Birds also move across Siberia to <strong>India</strong>, continuing down through south-east Asia to <strong>Australia</strong> but many birds winter in southern India and <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>, they may also move overland to east Asia and via the coast of <strong>China</strong> to Australia (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed on Annex II of the Bern Convention, as well as being listed as part of AEWA and CMS.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct research to better understand the species's dependence on key migratory staging sites, and increase knowledge of the impacts of disturbance (Anon. 2015).

The breeding season varies between islands, but extends from January to September, with a peak between April-June. At least on Tenerife, breeding success appears to be low, as a consequence of intense nest predation (Hernández <em>et al.</em> 1999, Martín <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong>.

Although this figure is considerably higher than the previous estimate, the increase in numbers may reflect increased sampling effort rather than an actual population increase, however the species is now believed to be more widely distributed than previously thought (Martín and Lorenzo 2001, Martín <em>et al</em>. 2000).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is strongly migratory, undertaking significant cold weather movements of varying magnitude (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It leaves its breeding grounds in late summer (September) to arrive in its wintering grounds across Europe and Asia in October and November (Scott and Rose 1996, <strong></strong>Kear 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Populations leave their winter quarters again between March and April, and arrive in their breeding grounds in northern Russia during the second half of May (Scott and Rose 1996, <strong></strong>Kear 2005b)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>.

Nyala feed selectively on both the leaves and fruits of woody plants as well as grasses; although they drink daily where water is available, in parts of their range in Mozambique and Zimbabwe they are found where no surface water is present for several months of the year (Anderson 2013).","The Nyala disappeared from extensive areas of its former range mainly due to habitat loss to agriculture and cattle grazing, and the combined effects of rinderpest and hunting. However, today they remain relatively widespread both within and outside of their former range. There are no current major threats to Nyala populations, although some protected area populations have undergone declines, notably that in Lengwe National Park (Malawi).","East (1999) estimated the total population of Nyala to exceed around 32,000 individuals. More recently, Anderson (2013) estimates South Africa alone has at least 30,000, with the largest populations (25,000) in KwaZulu-Natal. There are now more than 1,000 individuals reintroduced (and introduced) to protected areas and ranches in Swaziland (Monadjem 1998). Nyala are still widespread in Mozambique but numbers probably do not exceed 3,000 (Anderson 2013). Zimbabwe has more than 1,000, while numbers in Malawi have declined from 3,000 (East 1999) to about 1,500, most notably in the population in Lengwe National Park (which was originally created especially for this species). Therefore in total 36,500 individuals. Extralimital to the species’ natural range, Namibia has about 250, all on private ranches.",Stable,"The Nyala's natural range comprises south-eastern Africa from the Lower Shire Valley in Malawi through Mozambique and Zimbabwe to eastern South Africa and Swaziland. It has been introduced to Namibia on private land in the northern commercial farming districts. Likewise it does not occur naturally in Botswana, but some of the Tuli block farms in the east have been colonised as a result of the spread of Nyala from populations introduced to farms in the adjacent region of South Africa (East 1999, Anderson 2013). In Swaziland, the species was extinct by the 1950s, but it has been successfully reintroduced.",Nyala are subject to hunting for meat and as trophies. This demand (especially for adult males by trophy hunters) has lead to the artificial dispersion of Nyala from game reserves in KwaZulu-Natal to other protected areas and private ranches in areas both within and outside of their former distribution (Anderson 2013). In Mozambique Nyala exist at very low densities due to uncontrolled hunting (Anderson 2013).,Terrestrial,"Over 80% of the estimated total population occurs in protected areas (East 1999). The major populations survive in South African protected areas in the KwaZulu-Natal Game Reserves of Ndumo, uMkuze and Hluhluwe-Umfolozi, and in Kruger N.P. (East 1999, Anderson 2013). Nyala also occur in substantial numbers on private land (10-15%) in South Africa, including extralimital areas (East 1999). Nyala respond well to protection, to the point where over-population can become a management problem. Efforts to rehabilitate Mozambique’s wildlife offer the prospect that the Nyala may recover its former abundance in areas such as Gorongosa and Banhine National Parks (East 1999).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
115165887,22053,Tragelaphus imberbis,Near Threatened,,2016,2016-05-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Total numbers are estimated to number at least 118,000, about 33% of them in protected areas. Numbers are considered to be in decline in much of the range, as a result of hunting, overgrazing, and outbreaks of rinderpest. In some other areas, bush encroachment has increased the amount of suitable habitat, and local range expansion and population increases have been reported. Nevertheless, the level of decline is suspected to have reached at least 20% over a period of 13 years (three generations), so approaching the threshold for Vulnerable under criterion A2cde. The Lesser Kudu will probably persist in the arid scrublands of northeastern Africa, as long as human and livestock densities remain relatively low in extensive parts of its range such as northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia. It nevertheless faces a continuing, long-term population decline as meat hunting and pastoralism increase within its remaining range. Its status may eventually decline to threatened.","The Lesser Kudu is closely associated with <em>Acacia-Commiphora</em> thornbush in semi-arid areas of north-eastern Africa; it generally avoids open spaces and long grass (East 1999, Leuthold 2013). They are largely confined to lowland areas up to 1,200 m (Stewart and Stewart 1963) but have been recorded at about 1,740 m near Mt Kilimanjaro (Grimshaw <em>et al.</em> 1995). The Lesser Kudu is primarily a browser, consuming mainly leaves of trees, shrubs and herbs (Leuthold 2013).","Its shyness and preference for thick cover enable it to withstand considerable hunting pressure, e.g., it is relatively plentiful throughout the Ogaden region wherever there is sufficient dense bush, despite widespread, uncontrolled hunting by local people (East 1999). On the other hand, its susceptibility to rinderpest resulted in a substantial decrease in its numbers in eastern regions of Kenya during the mid-1990s. These populations can be expected to recover following the subsidence of this rinderpest outbreak. There are relatively few parts of the Lesser Kudu’s range where protection against poaching reaches moderate levels or better, and eradication of rinderpest from cattle would be a major step towards reducing current pressures on its populations (East 1999).","Citing various authors, East (1999) indicated that population estimates based on recent aerial surveys are available for considerable areas of the Lesser Kudu’s range, but aerial surveys substantially underestimate this species’ true numbers. In addition, its populations are unknown in the remainder of its range. The sum of available estimates, about 22,000, is therefore probably a significant underestimate of the species’ actual total numbers. Correcting for under-counting bias in aerial surveys, East (1999) produced a total population estimate of 118,000. East (1999) suggests local densities of 0.5-3/km².&#160;Despite the species’ ability to persist in the face of uncontrolled meat hunting, its numbers are probably in gradual decline over extensive areas of its range as human settlement expands. There are however reports from some sites of increasing numbers as bush expands following extirpation of elephants.",Decreasing,"The Lesser Kudu occupies semi-arid areas of north-eastern Africa, commonly known as the Somali-Masai Arid Zone, in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. Its range extends from <em>ca</em> 12°N in the Awash area of Ethiopia southward through southern Ethiopia, much of Somalia except the northeast (i.e., east of 46°E and north of 08°N), most of Kenya except the southwest, extreme southeast Sudan, extreme northeast Uganda to northeast and central Tanzania (Leuthold 2013). It is probably extinct in Djibouti.<br/><br/>Two records of this species in Arabia (Harrison and Bates 1991) are based on sets of horns, one obtained in Saudi Arabia and the other in Yemen. No live animals have ever been reported from the region, there is no local word for the species, which is highly distinctive, and the import of horns and of live animals is common in the region.","Lesser Kudu are subject to meat hunting and trophy hunting for skins or horns (Leuthold 2013). Funaioli and Simonetta (1966) mention up to 20,000 skins having been sold in a single year in Somalia, with an average of 11,000 per year between 1952 and 1963, almost all as a result of poaching.",Terrestrial,"About one-third of the estimated total population occurs in protected areas. Important populations occur in protected areas such as Awash, Omo and Mago National Parks (Ethiopia), Tsavo National Park (Kenya) and Ruaha National Park and adjoining game reserves (Tanzania), but it occurs in larger numbers outside protected areas (East 1999). <br/><br/>The Lesser Kudu’s long-term survival prospects would be enhanced by improved protection and management of the relatively few protected areas which support substantial populations. In addition, its value as a trophy animal gives the species high potential for increased revenue generation in the extensive bushlands where it still occurs in good numbers outside national parks and equivalent reserves (East 1999).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
115576640,39994,Gorilla beringei,Critically Endangered,A4bcd,2019,2018-08-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Eastern Gorillas (<em>Gorilla beringei</em>) live in the mountainous forests of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, northwest Rwanda and southwest Uganda. This region was the epicentre of Africa's ""world war"", to which Gorillas have also fallen victim. The Mountain Gorilla subspecies (<em>Gorilla beringei beringei</em>), was listed as Critically Endangered since 1996. Although a drastic reduction of the Grauer’s Gorilla subspecies (<em>Gorilla beringei graueri</em>), has long been suspected, quantitative evidence of the decline has been lacking (Robbins and Williamson 2008). During the past 20 years, Grauer’s Gorillas have been severely affected by human activities, most notably poaching for bushmeat associated with artisanal mining camps and for commercial trade (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). This illegal hunting has been facilitated by a proliferation of firearms resulting from widespread insecurity in the region. Previously estimated to number around 16,900 individuals, recent surveys show that Grauer’s Gorilla numbers have dropped to only 3,800 individuals – a 77% reduction in just one generation (<em>ibid</em>.) This rate of population loss is almost three times above that which qualifies a species as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>Mountain Gorillas have been faring substantially better; one of the two subpopulations is recovering from an all-time low in the 1980s, making Mountain Gorillas the only great ape taxon that has been increasing in number (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013). A 2015–2016, survey of the Virunga population has confirmed that it is still growing and has now increased to over 600 individuals, bringing the total population to roughly 1,000 (Hickey&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Grauer's Gorillas continue to decline at an average rate of 5% per year (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Even with the growth of the Mountain Gorilla subspecies, the overall decline of the Eastern Gorilla species is expected to exceed 80% over three generations due to the high levels of poaching, loss of habitat as human populations expand, and civil unrest and lawlessness in parts of this species’ geographic range. If unabated, in 2054, only 14% of the 1994 population will remain. Therefore, Eastern Gorillas qualify as Critically Endangered under criterion A (A4bcd).","Grauer's Gorillas range between 600 and 2,900 m asl in dense mature and secondary lowland tropical rainforest through transitional forests to Afromontane habitat, including bamboo forest, swamp and peat bog. Mountain Gorillas are restricted to elevations above 1,400 m in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and above 1,850 m in the Virungas by human occupation at lower levels. Their habitat includes many Afromontane vegetation types, including bamboo forest, mixed forest, and subalpine grassland on the volcanic peaks. The Bwindi Mountain Gorillas live at lower elevations, in forest characterised by steep slopes of predominantly mixed forest habitat with a dense understorey.<br/><br/>Diets of Eastern Gorillas vary greatly with elevation and its effect on food availability. Mountain Gorillas are largely herbivorous and feed on stems, pith, leaves, bark, and occasionally ants. Their favoured food items are wild celery, thistles, nettles, bedstraw, wood and roots. Both subspecies feed almost exclusively on young bamboo shoots when they are in season twice a year. Gorillas at lower elevations have a more diverse and seasonal diet. Both Grauer’s Gorillas in lowland forest and Bwindi Gorillas are frugivorous.<br/><br/>Eastern Gorillas are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. After waking, they feed intensively and then alternate rest, travelling and feeding until night-time. All Gorillas build nests to sleep in, some in trees, but the majority of their nests are on the ground. Gorillas are not territorial, and there is extensive overlap between the annual home ranges of different groups, which vary in size from 6–40 km². Eastern Gorilla groups are polygynous or polygynandrous, with one or more adult males, several females, their offspring, and immature relatives forming the core of relatively stable groups. Median group size is 10 weaned individuals; maximum observed group size is 65 individuals.<br/><br/><u><strong>Life History</strong></u> (as summarised in Williamson and Butynski 2013)<br/>Male Eastern Gorillas are capable of reproducing when they become “blackbacks” at 8-12 years of age. They are considered “silverbacks” at 12 years of age, and reach their full adult size at 15 years. Female menarche occurs at 6-7 years of age, followed by a period of adolescent sterility. Average age of first parturition is 9.9 years. Females have a reproductive cycle of <em>ca</em> 28 days and are receptive for 1-4 days around the time of ovulation. They experience lactational amenorrhea while suckling infants. Young are weaned at 3-4 years of age, from which point they no longer travel on their mothers’ back. Females give birth every 3-4 years and generally produce 3-4 surviving offspring during their reproductive life span. Maximum life span is unknown, but it is certainly over 40 years. Eastern Gorillas have a generation time of 18.2 years for females and 20.4 years for males (Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Major threats to Eastern Gorillas are:<br/><ol><li><strong><u>Poaching</u> </strong>- Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, hunting represents the greatest threat to Grauer’s Gorillas (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). A high demand for bushmeat stems from the growing human population, the destabilising impact of armed groups, artisanal miners in remote areas and a general scarcity of affordable domestic protein in rural areas. The permanent presence of people who provide the workforce for exploitation of natural resources also constitutes a major factor in this problem. Miners working in national parks have admitted to poaching Gorillas, which are relatively easy to hunt with guns and provide large quantities of meat (Kirkby <em>et al</em>. 2015). Illegal capture of live infants is a secondary threat (after the mother has been killed and eaten), except on occasions when Mountain Gorilla infants have been the principle target, fulfilling the demands of a fictitious, international market. These orphans usually die or are seized by the wildlife authorities.</li><li><strong><u>Habitat loss and degradation</u></strong> - Agricultural and pastoral activities are leading to continued loss and fragmentation of Gorilla habitat in DRC. At present, there is no commercial logging in the Eastern Gorilla’s range, but there is continuous artisanal extraction of resources, which puts added stress on natural habitats. Illegal mining has decimated the lowlands of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, a Grauer’s Gorilla stronghold. Destruction of forest for timber, charcoal production and agriculture continues to threaten the isolated Gorilla populations that persist in North Kivu and the Itombwe Massif.</li><li><u><strong>Civil unrest</strong></u> - For two decades, refugees, internally-displaced people and numerous armed groups have placed enormous pressure on DRC’s forests through uncontrolled habitat conversion for farmland, harvesting of firewood, timber extraction and mining. Ongoing political unrest and military activity, including rebel occupation of national parks have compounded other threats (Yamagiwa 2003, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). A recent survey identified 69 armed groups operating in North and South Kivu (Stearns &amp; Vogel 2015), covering important portions of remaining Grauer’s Gorilla range. Armed conflict and the collapse of law and order in DRC brought a significant rise in the illegal circulation of military weapons and ammunition. Former traditional hunters have obtained guns, notably AK47s, and the commercial trade in bushmeat increased with the spread of firearms, often supplied by government soldiers and rebel militia. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Virunga Mountain Gorillas were also impacted by war and instability (Kalpers <em>et al</em>. 2003, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2011).</li><li><u><strong>Disease</strong></u> - Regulated tourism is a key strategy for Eastern Gorilla conservation; however, transmission of human diseases is a major concern (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015), as is excessive disturbance to Gorillas and their habitat (Macfie and Williamson 2010), which could jeopardize conservation programmes. Examples of likely or proven human-­to-­great ape disease transmission include respiratory viruses (Köndgen <em>et al</em>. 2008, Palacios <em>et al</em>. 2011, Spelman <em>et al</em>. 2013), human herpes simplex virus (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2014) and scabies (Kalema-Zikusoka <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some of these cases have been fatal and most have involved habituated Gorillas or Chimpanzees. Nonetheless, Mountain Gorillas visited by researchers and tourists have consistently shown higher population growth rates than unhabituated Gorillas, which is likely due to the daily monitoring of habituated groups. Continuous monitoring leads to better protection and facilitates veterinary interventions to remove snares and treat respiratory illnesses (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2011); it is almost impossible to treat unhabituated Gorillas.</li><li><strong><u>Climate change</u></strong> - Climate change is predicted to impact the forests of the Albertine Rift escarpment, leading to the upslope migration of species and key Gorilla habitat, notably montane forest (Ayebare <em>et al</em>. 2013). Increased temperatures and modified rainfall patterns are also likely to result in changes in food availability and habitat quality (McGahey <em>et al</em>. 2013). With almost all montane forest in the eastern highlands now destroyed and converted for agriculture to support some of the highest human population densities in the African Great Lakes region, climate change may have negative effects on food security for the human populations surrounding Gorilla habitat, which could also conservation efforts in the future.</li></ol>","It is likely that fewer than 5,000 Eastern Gorillas remain.&#160;<em>Gorilla b. beringei</em>&#160;lives in two isolated populations in three countries: DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. The first surveys of the Virunga Mountain Gorillas estimated a population size of 274 individuals in 1971–73 (Harcourt and Groom 1972, Groom 1973). The population fell to a low of 254 individuals in 1981 (Aveling and Harcourt 1981, Weber and Vedder 1983). Since then, protection measures have enabled the population to recover and the most recent estimate for the Virungas is a minimum of 600 individuals (Hickey <em>et al</em>. 2018). The second (Bwindi-Sarambwe) Mountain Gorilla population numbers about 400 individuals (Roy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Thus, the total population of the subspecies is now at least 1,000 individuals (Roy <em>et al</em>. 2014, Hickey <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In 1994–95, the total population of <em>G. b. graueri</em> was estimated to be 16,900 individuals (Hall <em>et al</em>. 1998a, 1998b). Since then, widespread insecurity and poaching for bushmeat, particularly around mining camps, have led to increasing fragmentation of the population and rapid reductions of numbers. Using survey data collected between 2010 and 2015, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated that the number of Grauer's Gorillas remaining in 2015 is only 3,800—a 77% loss since 1994-95. These population estimates were made using night nest abundance and distribution, and predictive modelling. Nest encounter rates indicate an ongoing rate of decline of ~5% per year at many of the sites surveyed, due to fragmentation and illegal hunting around the many artisanal mining camps and villages located in areas where Grauer's Gorillas occur (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"Eastern Gorillas are found in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), northwest Rwanda and southwest Uganda.<br/><br/><em>Gorilla beringei beringei</em> (Matschie 1903) is restricted to two populations in forests only 25 km apart, but isolated by land that is intensely cultivated and densely settled. One population is in the Virunga Volcanoes, straddling the borders between DRC (Virunga National Park), Rwanda (Volcanoes National Park) and Uganda (Mgahinga Gorilla National Park). The other occurs in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, with a small contiguous portion in Sarambwe Nature Reserve in DRC.<br/><br/><em>Gorilla beringei graueri</em> (Matschie 1914) is endemic to the forests of the Albertine Rift escarpment in eastern DRC. It has a discontinuous distribution from the lowlands east of the Lualaba River to the Mitumba Mountains and the Itombwe Massif. Mt. Tshiaberimu in Virunga National Park is the northern limit of Grauer’s Gorilla’s geographic range. The southern limit is a subpopulation in the Hewa Bora region, Fizi District (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Although formerly known as the Eastern Lowland Gorilla, <em>G. b. graueri</em> occurs over the widest altitudinal range of any Gorilla, from approximately 600 m to 2,900 m asl, overlapping considerably with the altitudinal range of <em>G. b. beringei</em> (1,400–3,800 m asl; Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013).","<p>Gorillas are completely protected by national and international laws in all countries of their range, and it is, therefore, illegal to kill, capture or trade in live Gorillas or their body parts.<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<em>Gorilla beringei</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES, and under Class A of the African Convention (as the species <em>Gorilla</em>). DRC has a legal framework for managing national parks and wildlife, but has difficulty applying its laws, and political will is limited. Underlying this is a difficult sociopolitical context – a breakdown of law and order during two decades of conflict, combined with poverty and economic insecurity, exacerbates the difficulties of enforcing the law in this region. To address the critical situation faced by Grauer’s Gorillas, NGOs are working with the government authorities to support protected areas and reinforce conservation programmes. However, the widespread presence of armed groups in eastern DRC restricts the ability of conservation organisations to operate in the field.<br/><br/>One quarter of the predicted range of the Grauer’s Gorillas occurs in national parks and nature reserves; the remaining three quarters is currently unprotected (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Gazetting of the Itombwe Reserve and establishing a protected area west of Kahuzi-Biega National Park could secure as much as 50% of the subspecies' range.<br/><br/>Conservation challenges are likely to increase as the DRC government continues its efforts to stabilize the east. Security will favour industrial extraction, large-scale agriculture and infrastructure. While development will increase the country's ability to support its human population and participate in the global economy, it will also result in increased human settlement in forest areas critical to Gorillas. Targeted conservation action in priority sites will be vital to slow further demise of this subspecies.<br/><br/>The entire Mountain Gorilla population resides in protected areas where there are active government programmes. Although the protected areas are relatively well monitored, illegal activities continue in some locations, therefore monitoring the impacts of both illegal activities and conservation actions should continue. While these national parks are legally protected, habitat fragmentation and degradation will be exacerbated if infrastructure developments are allowed within their boundaries.<br/><br/>To achieve conservation successes, long-term commitment is key, as shown by the international conservation organisations that have been working in difficult circumstances for decades to support the protected area authorities and try to secure the survival of Eastern Gorillas. IUCN has published a detailed conservation strategy with clear priorities for Grauer’s Gorillas (Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2012). See Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2015) for additional recommendations and see Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2011) for an overview of the impacts of conservation activities on mountain Gorillas in the Virunga Massif.<br/><p></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It also utilises wet grassland and arable fields during migration (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists chiefly of annelid worms and terrestrial insects (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) (e.g. Coleoptera and Orthoptera) (Johnsgard 1981) especially during the summer (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), although it will also take crustaceans, molluscs, polychaete worms (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, spiders (Johnsgard 1981)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, berries and seeds, as well as occasionally small fish, amphibians, lizards, young birds and small rodents (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression on the ground or on a mound (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong></strong> in the open or in the cover of grass or sedge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Management information</strong> A study into the effects of shellfish harvesting by hand in coastal intertidal habitats recommends that the harvesting load should be limited to -1 during this species's autumn migration (Navedo and Masero 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","The species is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of moorland habitats as a result of afforestation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Johnsgard 1981)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and of marginal grassland habitats as a result of agricultural intensification and improvement (Johnsgard 1981,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>Baines 1988,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996) (e.g. drainage, inorganic fertilisation and reseeding) (Baines 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species also suffers from high egg and chick mortalities due to agricultural practices (e.g. Tuellinghoff &amp; Bergmann 1993, Grant 1997, Fisher &amp; Walker 2015) human disturbance (Boschert and Rupp 1993) and higher predation rates if nesting on improved grasslands or in fragmented landscapes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Valkama and Korpimäki 1999, Douglas <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Conversely some populations have declined following abandonment of farmland and subsequent increases in the height of vegetation (Broyer and Roche 1991), rendering large areas unsuitable for nesting. Climate change is projected to have a large negative impact on this species during the breeding season (Huntley <em>et al.</em> 2007, Renwick <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Expansion of renewable energy projects including wind farms can also have an impact although more studies are required (Pearce-Higgins <em>et al.</em> 2009). It has also suffered population declines as a result of hunting (Johnsgard 1981)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;<br/>Wintering populations are threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002a, 2002b)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (e.g. from construction work (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002a)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and foot-traffic (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>), development on high-tide roosting sites, pollution (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and the flooding of estuarine mudflats and saltmarshes as a result of tidal barrage construction (Burton 2006, Porter <em>et al. </em>2008)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The species is also threatened by the degradation of migrational staging areas owing to land reclamation, pollution, human disturbance and reduced river flows (Kelin and Qiang 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Local populations of this species have also declined owing to hunting pressures (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and mechanised shellfish harvesting (Taylor and Dodd 2013).<p></p>","The global   population is estimated to number c.835,000-1,310,000&#160;individuals (Wetlands   International 2016).&#160;The European population is estimated at 212,000-292,000 pairs, which equates to 425,000-584,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015), and is roughly equivalent to 647,500-876,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;is widely distributed, breeding across Europe from the British Isles, through north-western Europe and Scandinavia into <strong>Russia</strong> extending east into Siberia, east of Lake Baikal.

Declines have also been reported for the Czech Republic, Denmark (down 17% between 1999-2011, though this followed a longer-term increase), Lithuania (20-30% per decade [L. Raudonikis <em>in litt.</em> 2007]), Poland (50-60% decline between 2000 and 2013), Slovakia, and Switzerland and the European breeding population overall is estimated to be decreasing by 30-49% in 31.2 years (three generations) (BirdLife International 2015). Unquantified, but potentially highly significant, declines have also been recorded in the central Asian populations of <em>N. a. orientalis </em>(J. Kamp and S.

For this reason the species is classified as Near Threatened. <p></p>,"It inhabits a variety of deep and shallow wetlands, both man-made and natural, freshwater and saline, open and forested. It breeds colonially in <em>Acacia </em>bushes (S. Subramanya&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016, H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016), tall trees or palms and feeds in open water, primarily on fish. Some populations appear to be sedentary. With the provision of nesting towers, the species does appear to make use of these for breeding (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","A crucial factor in its decline was the loss of the Sittang valley breeding colony in Myanmar through deforestation and loss of feeding-sites. Key threats are a combination of human disturbance at breeding colonies and wetlands, extensive felling of nesting trees (such as partially submerged <em>Acacia </em>[S. Subramanya <em>in litt. </em>2016]) (see also Taher 2007), the impact of invasive plants on the species's wetland habitat, hunting (Talukdar 1996) and poaching of eggs and chicks. Additional threats include the loss of important feeding-sites through siltation, agricultural intensification, aquaculture development, building of power stations, drainage and conversion of wetlands, declines in wetland productivity as a result of pesticide use, persecution by fishermen and over-exploitation of fisheries (Talukdar 1996, Chandrasekhar 2009). There is some persecution resulting from competition between the birds and fishers. A potential but as yet unqualified threat is posed by avian influenza (P.

Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;The global population is currently placed in the range 13,000-18,000 individuals globally, roughly equivalent to 8,700-12,000 mature individuals, though this may require revising upwards in the future.",Decreasing,"<em>Pelecanus philippensis</em> was formerly common across much of Asia, but suffered a widespread decline (BirdLife International 2001). However, owing to protection and increased knowledge its estimated population has been revised upwards from a low of 5,500-10,000 birds in 2002 to an estimated 13,000-18,000 individuals in 2006. Known breeding populations are now confined to <strong>India,</strong> <strong>Sri Lanka </strong>and<strong> Cambodia</strong>, and potentially also <strong>Thailand </strong>(W. Limparungpatthanakij <em>in litt. </em>2016). The Indian population<strong> </strong>is thought to exceed 5,000 birds in the south owing to increases resulting from improved protection of the species (S. Subramanya <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, plus c.3,000 in Assam (Choudhury 2000)<strong></strong>. In southern India there are 21 known breeding colonies in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu (Subramanya 2006)<strong></strong>. One of these at Kokkare Bellur, Karnataka, has doubled in size in recent years (Subramanya 2006), and recent surveys in southern India have located more pairs than were previously estimated for the state (Gokula 2011, Anon. 2012). However, another at Uppalapadu has declined from a historical high of 12,000 individuals, with only 1,500 observed in a recent count, though a more recent estimate is 4,000 individuals (S. Subramanya <em>in litt. </em>2016). The site is however threatened by human encroachment (M. Akhtar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2008), and despite recent increases this site showed population declines in 2016 (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016). The traditional breeding site at Kolleru has become operational again, though there was a decline noted there in 2016 (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016), and with the provision of nesting towers a new breeding site has become established in the Kolleru region (H. Taher <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Sri Lanka, c.5,000 birds were thought to breed, possibly overlapping with the southern Indian populations (S. W. Kotagama <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2001)<strong></strong>. However, recent evidence from Sri Lanka suggests a breeding population of fewer than 1,000 pairs, with counts from the three known colonies totalling just 400 pairs (C. Kaluthota <em>in litt.</em> 2006). In South-East Asia, an estimated 1,083 nests were&#160;at Prek Toal on the Tonle Sap lake in 2014, the highest reported there ever, though 2013 had the lowest number of nest records at 803 (Visal and Mahood 2015). It probably breeds in small numbers on Sumatra, <strong>Indonesia</strong>, but probably no longer in <strong>Myanmar</strong> (G. Chunkino <em>in litt.</em> 2006, Weerakoon and Athukorala 2007). There are recent records of migrants in <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong>, but it no longer occurs in the Philippines and China. Numbers recorded in Thailand have increased in recent years (P. Round <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. This is thought to be as a result of improved protection of the nesting colonies in Cambodia.

Conservation actions to reduce chick and egg collection and other forms of disturbance to the breeding colony at Prek Toal have been in place since the late 1990s. Eight out of 15 nesting sites in Tamil Nadu are protected. An awareness programme has been initiated in Sri Lanka as part of a project funded by the Conservation Leadership Programme. This has also set up research stations concerned with improving knowledge of the species (Weerakoon and Athukorala 2007).

K. Bilstein <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. It occurs up to 4,000 m, but is most numerous below 1,800 m. It feeds mainly on carrion, but also takes insects (and will congregate in large numbers during insect emergences [Smalley 2016]). In West Africa and Kenya it breeds throughout the year, but especially from November to July. Breeding in north-east Africa occurs mainly in October-June, with birds in southern Africa tending to breed in May-December. It is an arboreal nester, favouring <em>Ceiba pentandra </em>in Senegal (B. Bargain <em>in litt. </em>2016), and lays a clutch of one egg. Its incubation period lasts 46-54 days, followed by a fledging period of 80-130 days. Young are dependent on their parents for a further 3-4 months after fledging (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Measurements of nesting success at the Oifants River Provate Nature  Reserve, South Africa showed, success of 0.44-0.89 offspring per pair  per year in 2013 and 0.50-0.67 offspring per pair per year in 2014  (Monadjem <em>et al. </em>2016). <p></p>","Major threats to this species include non-target poisoning, capture for traditional medicine and bushmeat (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2013), and direct persecution (Ogada and Buij 2011, Ogada <em>et al</em>. 2016)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In Nigeria, a survey of medicinal traders found that Hooded Vulture was the most commonly traded species of vulture, with 90% of all vulture parts traded belonging to the species (Saidu and Buij 2013). And across West and Central Africa the species is one of the most heavily traded, with an estimated 5,850-8,772 individuals traded over a six-year period in West Africa (Buij <em>et al</em>. 2015). Hooded Vulture meat is reportedly sold as chicken in some places. Intentional poisoning of vultures may be carried out in some areas by poachers in order to hide the locations of their kills, but in Senegal at least vultures to receive a form of cultural protection from such killing because they are the totem for some families (B. Bargain <em>in litt. </em>2016). Secondary poisoning with carbofuran pesticides at livestock baits being used to poison mammalian predators is also an issue in East Africa (Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010, C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012).  Declines have also been attributed to land conversion through development and improvements to abattoir hygiene and rubbish disposal in some areas (Ogada and Buij 2011), and, in Senegal, a decline in the number of their favourite nesting tree species (B. Bargain <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. The species may also be threatened by avian influenza (H5N1), from which it appears to suffer some mortality and which it probably acquires from feeding on discarded dead poultry (Ducatez <em>et al</em>. 2007), although this is not well substantiated (C.

As such, assessments have been completed for each of the 10 subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the IUCN (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). At the global level, both geographic distribution and population size are much larger than required to qualify for a threatened category. The available long-term series of nest counts (used as an index of population abundance) show an important decrease in the past (47%). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle is considered as Vulnerable under current IUCN Red List Criteria (criterion A2b). The previous listing, published in 1996, was Endangered under criterion A1bd (Marine Turtle Specialist Group 1996).<br/><br/>Results indicate that the Loggerhead Turtle, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go extinct globally in the next generation according to any Red List criteria. However, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global Loggerhead Turtle population. Subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by IUCN Red List Categories), but also in the criteria under which the individual subpopulations qualified for a threatened category (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). For these reasons, the subpopulation-level assessments for the Loggerhead Turtle should be given priority in evaluating the true global conservation status of this species. This conclusion follows the precedent for other long-lived, widely distributed species, including the Leatherback Turtle (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><em><strong>Justification<br/></strong></em>The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy exceeds the thresholds for criterion B, and the population size exceeds the thresholds for criteria C and D. Regarding criterion A, trends were estimated on time series datasets with ≥10 years of data of nesting activities (nest counts) at 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations out of 10 (North West Atlantic, Mediterranean, South West Atlantic, North West Indian, South West Indian, North Pacific). These six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current annual nests globally (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). The analysis revealed different trends for different subpopulations, with an overall -47% population decrease relative to population size three generations ago, which qualifies for the Vulnerable category (under criterion A2). The species trend at a global scale is basically determined by the two most abundant subpopulations, the North West Atlantic and the North West Indian, which altogether comprise about 75% of the current annual nests. They showed positive and negative trends, respectively. The other four subpopulations for which trends could be calculated show positive trends. For the remaining four subpopulations (comprising about 10% of the current annual nests; North East Atlantic, North East Indian, South East Indian, South Pacific), current trends are unclear, however past negative trends are known or suspected at least for the South Pacific and the North East Atlantic subpopulations respectively.<br/>&#160;<br/>The overall scenario suggests that, on the basis of the current knowledge, the extinction of the species at the global level is highly unlikely to occur in the short and medium term. However, the global status of the species in terms of distribution, number of subpopulations, genetic variability, regional ecological roles, and vulnerability, could change dramatically from the past and current situations. For this reason, the global assessment cannot be considered as an indicator of the true conservation status of the species, and priority should be given to the subpopulation assessments.<br/><br/><em><strong>Assessment Procedure:</strong></em><br/><u>Criterion A</u><br/>For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (National Research Council 2010).<br/><br/>To apply criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of the Loggerhead, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 45 years (see the Habitats and Ecology section below). For criterion A, data from three generations ago (~135 years) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e., assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtles—with generation lengths of 30 years or more—are obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for a review). Abundance data from ~135 years ago are not available for Loggerheads anywhere in the world. Extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations ago (~135 years, one generation estimated 45 years; see Habitats and Ecology section below) was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation. A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another sea turtle species, the Leatherback Turtle (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013) and of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply criterion A we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations. For the Loggerhead global and subpopulation assessments we only considered time series datasets of ≥10 years.<br/><br/>For the global Loggerhead population, we considered time series datasets of 10-50 years, from 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations (see the individual subpopulation assessments). The index nesting sites included in the analysis are assumed to be representative of their subpopulations, and these six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current total annual nests (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>The assessment under criterion A was conducted in three steps, as follows. Please see the separate subpopulation assessments for further details.<br/><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> We estimated past trends for each of the six individual subpopulations. Specifically, from one past and one recent abundance values (each representing the annual average of five year nest counts) we calculated overall trends (past-present) for each index nesting sites within subpopulations, and then we calculated overall subpopulation past trends for each subpopulation (criteria A1-A2).</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The past and present total abundance values of the six subpopulations (obtained from Step 2) were summed and from these totals the overall population change (past-present) was calculated (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material). </li></ul>Five of the above six subpopulations showed positive trends and one showed a negative trend. Altogether, they showed a negative trend (-47%). The overall negative trend depended on the negative trend of one subpopulation (North West Indian) where criterion A2 was appropriate – i.e. the causes of reduction may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible. Therefore, the overall trend of the six subpopulations was assessed against criterion A2. The past estimated trend was above the threshold for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 (30% decline) but below the threshold for the Endangered category (50% decline). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle qualifies for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 and the applicable subcriterion is (b), an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (counts of nests or tracks).<br/><br/>Although these trends consider only 6 of 10 subpopulations, these subpopulations with sufficient available data account for about 90% of the current global population abundance (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Therefore, these trends likely reflect the complete global trend and represent the best information available about the global population trend. Similarly, the global Leatherback Turtle assessment used only five of seven subpopulations to estimate global trends due to lack of sufficient data for two subpopulations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><u>Criterion B</u><br/>Since the population area extends over entire oceans around the world, the extent of occurrence (EOO) exceeds the threatened category threshold (20,000 km²). The area of occupancy (AOO) for sea turtles is identified with the nesting beach habitat, which represents the smallest habitat for a critic life stage. Since the appropriate scale for AOO is a grid 2x2 km, the threshold of 2,000 km² corresponds to 1,000 km of linear coastal tract, which is easily exceeded (by orders of magnitude) by the total length of nesting beaches globally. In conclusion, the global population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion B.<br/><br/><u>Criterion C</u><br/>To apply criterion C, the number of adults is needed and can be derived from the number of nests per year with the following formula:&#160; Adults = Nests * Nests per female<sup>-1</sup> * Remigration interval * Female proportion<sup>-1</sup>. With a current estimate of annual number of nests of about 200,000, for any reasonable value of the other parameters the population would easily exceed the threshold of 10,000 adults required to qualify for a threatened category under criterion C.<br/><br/><u>Criterion D</u><br/>The number of mature individuals (see criterion C) and AOO value (see criterion B) exceeded the respective thresholds. In conclusion, the population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion D.<br/><br/><u>Criterion E</u><br/>Although population viability analyses (PVA) were attempted at subpopulation level (Conant <em>et al</em>. 2009, Van Houtan 2011), in most cases they were not suitable for criterion E under this assessment. No PVA has been attempted at species level and such an approach would also be questionable because the subpopulations are independent units by definition.<br/><br/><strong><em>Sources of Uncertainty</em></strong><br/>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (National Research Council 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (National Research Council 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Loggerheads, including age at maturity, generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, remigration intervals, etc.). These values can vary within and among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends. However, we have reduced this source of uncertainty by using in the analyses those data sets obtained though standardized monitoring.<br/><br/>For the trend analyses (criterion A) we used data from index rookeries from six populations out of 10. Possible negative past trends associated to high past abundances in the other four subpopulations not included in the analysis could have changed the final result of the assessment (past trends, criterion A2), if such information was available.<br/><br/>For further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle Red List assessments, see Seminoff and Shanker (2008).","The Loggerhead Turtle nests on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the temperate and subtropical regions worldwide. Like most sea turtles, Loggerhead Turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (Bolten and Witherington 2003). Upon leaving the nesting beach, hatchlings begin an oceanic phase in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Bolten and Witherington 2003, Putman and Mansfield 2015). After 4-19 years in the oceanic zone, Loggerheads recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in benthic prey or epipelagic prey where they forage and grow until maturity at 10–39 years (Avens and Snover 2013). Upon attaining sexual maturity Loggerhead Turtles undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas at remigration intervals of one to several years with a mean of 2.5–3 years for females (Schroeder <em>et al</em>. 2003) while males would have a shorter remigration interval (e.g., Hays <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wibbels <em>et al</em>. 1990). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres (Plotkin 2003). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (Bolten and Witherington 2003).<br/><br/><strong><em>Generation length</em></strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population (i.e., older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual) and care should be taken to avoid underestimation (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). Although different subpopulations may have different generation length, since this information is limited we adopted the same value for all the subpopulations, taking care to avoid underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).<br/><br/>Loggerheads attain maturity at 10-39 years (Avens and Snover 2013), and we considered here 30 years to be equal or greater than the average age at maturity. Data on reproductive longevity in Loggerheads are limited, but are becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches. Tagging studies have documented reproductive histories up to 28 years in the North Western Atlantic Ocean (Mote Marine Laboratory, unpubl. data), up to 18 years in the South Western Indian Ocean (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013), up to 32 years in the South Western Atlantic Ocean (Projeto Tamar unpubl. data), and up to 37 years in the South Western Pacific Ocean, where females nesting for 20-25 years are common (C. Limpus, pers. comm). We considered 15 years to be equal or greater than the average reproductive longevity. Therefore, we considered here 45 years to be equal or greater than the average generation length, therefore avoiding underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).","Threats to Loggerheads vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Loggerheads, were described by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011) as:<br/><ol><li>Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;</li><li>Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e., consumption, commercial products);</li><li>Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc;</li><li>Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e., through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (for example fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;</li><li>Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).</li><li>The relative impacts of individual threats to all Loggerhead subpopulations were assessed by by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Loggerheads globally, followed by coastal development and human consumption of eggs, meat, or other products. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Loggerheads—and other marine turtle species—should be a high priority for future conservation efforts. </li></ol>More detailed information at regional level can found in the specific subpopulation assessments.","Loggerheads are a single species globally comprising 10 biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) – hereafter subpopulations - which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. Regional management units are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are 10 Loggerhead subpopulations: NorthWest Atlantic Ocean, North East Atlantic Ocean, South West Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North East Indian Ocean, North West Indian Ocean, South East Indian Ocean, South West Indian Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010)  (shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).<br/><br/>Total population size is unknown. The most common proxy for population abundance in sea turtles is the annual number of nests. A total of about 200,000 clutches are laid annually by the 10 subpopulations altogether (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Considering a range of 3 to 5.5 clutches per female, the above value would correspond to approximately 36,000-67,000 nesting females annually.",Decreasing,"The Loggerhead Turtle is globally distributed throughout the subtropical and temperate regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).","Loggerhead Turtles and their eggs are taken for human use (i.e., consumption and commercial products).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Loggerhead Turtles are afforded legislative protection under a number of treaties and laws (Wold 2002). Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). A partial list of the International Instruments that benefit Loggerhead Turtles includes the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA), the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection, the Memorandum of Agreement on the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.<br/><br/>As a result of these designations and agreements, many of the intentional impacts directed at sea turtles have been lessened: harvest of eggs and adults has been slowed at several nesting areas through nesting beach conservation efforts and an increasing number of community-based initiatives are in place to slow the take of turtles in foraging areas. In regard to incidental take, the implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices has proved to be beneficial in some areas, primarily in the United States and South and Central America (National Research Council 1990). Guidelines are available to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations in coastal and high seas fisheries (FAO 2009). However, despite these advances, human impacts continue throughout the world. In most areas, the lack of effective monitoring in pelagic and near-shore fisheries operations still allows substantial direct and indirect mortality, and the uncontrolled development of coastal and marine habitats threatens to destroy the supporting ecosystems of long-lived Loggerhead Turtles.<br/><br/>More detailed information at regional level can be found in the specific subpopulation assessments.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It has apparently always been rare, although the reasons for this are unclear and the range and population trends are difficult to judge, because it is extremely elusive, and occurs in some areas that are difficult to access. Reintroduction of captive-bred individuals failed to lead to a significant population increase (Switzer <em>et al.</em> 2013); until declines in habitat quality are halted and predation by introduced mammals is addressed, the species will not recover. However, the population, whilst small, appears to be stable (Crampton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;<p></p> <p></p>","It is now restricted to high-elevation `ohi`a forests. It is a ravine specialist, favouring stream banks with a rich understorey (Kepler and Kepler 1983, <strong></strong>Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Conant <em>et al.</em> 1998)<strong></strong>. Many recorded nests have been placed in cliffs above streams. It is primarily frugivorous, with arthropods (particularly insects) forming an important dietary component (Kepler and Kepler 1983, <strong></strong> Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong><strong><sup></sup></strong>. At least one bird died after malaria infection in the wild, but some birds may be disease resistant (Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997, Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. Prevalence of malaria is increasing in this species, and survival of chronically infected birds was similar to that of uninfected birds (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 2014, VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2014). Breeding is typically between March and August. It has potentially high but variable productivity, with pairs producing 0.4 to 4.9 young per year in three years of observation (Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1999); annual variation in number of offspring produced is correlated with breeding season precipitation (Fantle-Lepcyk <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;It is now the sole native frugivore on Kauai, and probably plays a major role in seed dispersal within its range. <p></p>","Avian pox-like lesions have been observed on a mist-netted bird<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997)<strong></strong>, and avian malaria is suspected to cause some mortality; at least three captive birds that died soon after release were determined to be infected with malaria (Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1999, K. Wakelee <em>in litt.</em> 1999).&#160;Currently, there are no forested areas on Kaua‘i where the mean ambient temperature prevents the seasonal incursion of malaria; mosquitoes and malaria can survive across all parts of the island, at least periodically. An increase in temperature of 2° C would result in an 85 % decrease in the land area on Kaua‘i where malaria transmission currently is only periodic (Benning <em>et al. </em>2002). Between 2007-2013, 66 wild Puaiohi were tested for malaria and 11 (22.7%) were determined to be infected, whereas 0 of 7 were infected between 1994-1997 (Atkinson<em> et al. </em>2014). Thus, disease may limit Puaiohi from inhabiting low elevation areas with suitable nesting habitat. However, long-term survival of chronically infected individuals is similar to that of uninfected individuals (VanderWerf <em>et al</em>. 2014), so other factors, such as degradation of the native forest by non-native plants may also be limiting their range (Crampton <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Several plants, including blackberry (<em>Rubus argutus</em>)<em>, </em>Australian Tree Fern (<em>Cyathea cooperi</em>),<em> </em>Kahili Ginger (<em>Hedychium gardnerianum</em>) Daisy Fleabane (<em>Erigeron annuus</em>) and Strawberry Guava (<em>Psidium cattleianum</em>) have significantly altered areas currently and recently occupied by Puaiohi, and have the potential to convert the forest canopy, understorey and cliffs used for nesting substrate to unsuitable habitat (P. Roberts <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. The destruction of the understory by feral pigs has been implicated in this species's rarity (Kepler and Kepler 1983).<br/><p></p><p>Predation by native Short-eared Owls (<em>Asio flammeus</em>) and alien mammals (e.g. rats) suppresses productivity and competition for food with introduced insects, birds and mammals may also have negative impacts (Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1999, Snetsinger <em>et al. </em>2005). Low female and juvenile survival likely limits its rate of increase; at least some female and nestling mortality is caused by predation of rats at nests (VanderWerf <em>et al</em>. 2014; L. Crampton&#160;<em>pers. obs.</em>), and rats also likely take recently fledged birds. Although hurricanes have caused serious damage to its habitat, the species appeared to recover relatively well, probably because ravines are better sheltered (Conant <em>et al.</em> 1998, Snetsinger<em> et al. </em>1999).</p>","The population was estimated at 494 breeding individuals (95% CI 414-580 birds) in  2013 (Crampton <em>et al</em>. 2017). Previous estimates, derived from Conrow (1999), Lieberman and Kuehler (1998), Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> (1999), T. Snetsinger <em>in litt. </em>(2000), and P. Roberts <em>in litt.</em> (2007) totalled 200-525 individuals, roughly equivalent to 130-330 mature individuals. However, because these estimates did not encompass the entire range, the population is assumed to have been stable in size since the mid-1990s (Crampton <em>et al. </em>2017).",Stable,"<em>Myadestes palmeri</em> is endemic to Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>USA</strong>), where recent records are all from the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve. It was lost from the Waiau and possibly the Halekua drainages (T. Snetsinger <em>per</em> P. Donaldson <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, but after Hurricane Iniki appeared to slightly expand its population range in the Mohihi and other drainages (Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. It formerly occurred in lowland habitats, but probably only locally, and was extirpated from these areas by the end of the 19th century (J. Lepson <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1999, <strong></strong>Burney <em>et al</em>. 2001).&#160;Few birds were detected after two hurricanes in the 1990s, but the population size is thought to have recovered to pre-hurricane numbers (Pratt 1994,&#160;<strong></strong>Conant&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998,&#160;<strong></strong>Snetsinger&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999)<strong></strong>. A captive breeding programme that began in 1996 led to the release of 237 captive bred birds, although a few captive-bred birds successfully bred in the wild, survival and recruitment of captive bred birds was generally poor and the programme has been discontinued (Switzer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013; VanderWerf&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; The Garden Island 2016).

Rat poison bait stations were placed near a few nests with moderate success (Snetsinger <em>et al.</em> 1999), and currently approximately 200 Goodnature A24 traps control rodents in the Halehaha area, which is currently being fenced with an ungulate proof fence to be completed in 2016 (Else 2016; Crampton 2016). Several types of rodent-resistant nest boxes have been installed in nesting habitat in Mohihi and Kawaikoi, and one pair was documented to nest successfully in one box. A captive population was established in 1996, and 14 birds were released into the wild in 1999 (Lieberman and Kuehler 1998, Conrow 1999,&#160;USGS News Release 1999, T. Snetsinger<em> in litt. </em>2000). Releases continued subsequently until 2012, with a total of 222 birds released (Switzer <em>et al.</em> 2013). The captive-bred birds bred with each other and with wild birds (Switzer <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Birds released in 1999-2001 survived and reproduced better than birds released from 2002-2006, with roughly only half of the birds released from 2002-2007 surviving for one month or longer. From 2005-2011, long-term survival of 123 captive-bred birds was very low and it was concluded that the release of captive-bred birds has had little effect on the wild population in recent years (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2014). Furthermore, the captive flock was suffering from inbreeding depression (B. Masuda <em>pers. comm</em>). Thus the captive breeding programme has been discontinued and all healthy captive-bred Puaiohi were released into the wild in 2016 (The Garden Island, 2016). Research on the factors limiting the species and the potential of management actions is ongoing.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">A species-specific survey method to survey the entire population was developed in 2011, and used and to predict areas of suitable habitat from 2011-2013 (Crampton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).

Funding to use song meters and field teams to survey these areas will be conducted in 2017 (L. Crampton <em>pers. comms.</em>). Studies of disease prevalence and factors promoting transmission of avian pox and malaria, and disease management options are ongoing (Puaiohi Working Group and Hawaiian Forest Bird Recovery Team 2010, Crampton 2016). Research suggests that reducing nest predation by controlling rats may be the best available management option (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2014); an experimental rat trapping programme with self-resetting GoodNature A24 traps was initiated in 2015, expanded in 2016 and will continue through 2017 (Crampton 2016). This study combines assessment of the efficacy of the traps in reducing rodents and impacts on nest success. Continue to conduct research to determine the impacts of predation and habitat degradation by alien species. Ungulate-proof fencing (completed, ongoing and proposed) will facilitate this research.

Due to high levels of poaching, infectious diseases, and loss of habitat and habitat quality caused by expanding human activities, this species is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in the past 20–30 years and it is suspected that this reduction will continue for the next 30–40 years. Due to their slow life history and a generation time estimated to be 25 years, Chimpanzee populations cannot sustain high levels of mortality, whether disease-induced or caused by poaching. The maximum population reduction over a three-generation (75 year) period from 1975 to 2050 is suspected to exceed 50%, hence qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A. Although conservation efforts directed at Chimpanzees and other wildlife have increased significantly in recent years, the assumption that population reductions will continue is a precautionary approach based on the rapid growth of human populations in sub-Saharan Africa, continuing poaching for bushmeat, the commercial bushmeat trade, the arrival of industrial agriculture (which requires clearcutting of forest), corruption and lack of law enforcement, lack of capacity and resources, and political instability in some range states. At the same time, zoonosis and disease outbreaks present significant risks; there is, for example, evidence that <em>Ebolavirus</em> will continue to spread&#160;in some parts of the Chimpanzee's geographic range&#160;(Walsh <em>et al.</em> 2005).</p><p>For more information, see the four <em>Pan troglodytes</em> subspecies accounts.</p>","<p>Chimpanzees are found discontinuously across the forest belt of Africa, occupying primary and secondary moist lowland forest, swamp forest, submontane and montane forest, dry forest, forest galleries in savanna woodland, and farmland (Oates 2011). In West Africa, Chimpanzees are also found in fallow-agricultural matrixes dominated by wild or feral oil palm (Leciak <em>et al.</em> 2005, Brncic <em>et al.</em> 2010, Sousa <em>et al</em>. 2011). They live in multimale-multifemale, fission-fusion communities averaging 35 members. The largest known community has c.150 members (Mitani and Watts 2005). Annual home ranges are smaller in mixed forest than in woodland forest mosaics: one of the smallest known is 6 km² at Budongo in Uganda (Newton-Fisher 2003), while one of the largest is 72 km² at Semliki, also in Uganda (Samson and Hunt 2012). Chimpanzees are omnivorous and opportunistic feeders. Fruit forms about half the diet, typically supplemented with terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, leaves, stems, seeds, flowers, bark, pith, honey, mushrooms, resin, eggs, and animal prey such as insects and medium-sized mammals. They are the most carnivorous of the great apes. Chimpanzees are also proficient tool users. Tools made from plant parts are used to extract bees, ants and termites from their nests (e.g., Fowler and Sommer 2007), and stone and wooden hammers are used to crack nuts (e.g., Boesch and Boesch 1984, Matsuzawa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p>Life History (as summarised in Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013): Male and female Chimpanzees reach puberty at 7–8 years of age. Females have a 35-day reproductive cycle. The first parturition is generally at 13–14 years of age, but as early as 9–10 years in one population of western Chimpanzees. Chimpanzees reproduce throughout the year. Gestation is c.230 days. The norm is a single infant, but occasionally twins are born. Offspring are&#160;typically&#160;weaned at 4–5 years of age. The interbirth interval averages 4.6–7.2 years when the preceding infant survives. Females can remain reproductive into their late forties. Maximum life span is unknown, but thought to be <em>ca</em> 50 years. Female Chimpanzees may give birth to as many as nine offspring during their lifetime, but only one third of them survive beyond infancy. Generation time is estimated to be 25 years (Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>","<p>The four Chimpanzee subspecies face similar threats, but to varying degrees in different regions. The major threats to <em>Pan troglodytes </em>are:</p><p><strong>1. Poaching</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, poaching is the greatest threat to most Chimpanzees. Due to their low population densities and slow reproductive rates, hunting often leads to the local extirpation of Chimpanzee populations. Increases in human populations, the ease of obtaining guns and ammunition, transport system efficiency, and high financial incentives for supplying urban markets with bushmeat and other forest commodities have resulted in swathes of land in the forest zone of Africa being cleared of wildlife. Chimpanzees are generally hunted opportunistically, but are sometimes targeted because they provide more meat than smaller mammals, such as duikers. Throughout the African moist forest region, poaching is intense around resources extraction camps – especially industrial and artisanal mining sites and logging camps – where bushmeat is usually the main source of protein available. Hunting with guns (targeting individuals) and snaring (an indiscriminate method of trapping) are the most common ways that Chimpanzees are killed. The widespread use of wire snares across Africa means that Chimpanzees can be caught and killed (or maimed) in snares set for other terrestrial mammals (e.g., Quiatt <em>et al</em>. 2002).</p><p>When Chimpanzees are killed for meat, their infants sometimes become pets, and some are trafficked (e.g., Hicks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Although all trade in Chimpanzees and their body parts is illegal, a small but pernicious and clandestine trade persists is some parts of Africa (e.g., CITES Secretariat 2014). Chimpanzees are sometimes killed intentionally–even poisoned–by people protecting their crops or as retribution for crop raiding (e.g., Brncic <em>et al.</em> 2010). Such trends are likely to increase as more natural habitat is converted to agricultural fields or plantations. Instances of crop foraging and encounters between people and Chimpanzees are becoming more frequent, especially in West Africa. This exacerbates negative perceptions and aggravates people’s attitudes towards Chimpanzees, thus potentially intensifying rates of killing, and subsequently fuelling the live trade with orphaned infants. Close to one thousand confiscated chimpanzees are now housed in sanctuaries in their range countries.</p><p>Until the mid-1990s, much of Central Africa was a series of vast, roadless forest blocks, to which access was extremely difficult and where human population density was very low. In the last quarter of a century, however, almost all <em>terra firma</em> forest in the non-protected areas of the central Chimpanzee’s range has been assigned as logging concessions (Global Forest Watch 2016). This means that most of the once-remote, previously inaccessible forests are now covered by a network of logging roads (Laporte <em>et al.</em> 2007), which provides rapid access to hunters entering the forest and to traffickers taking consignments of bushmeat out of the forest to distant destinations – often towns and cities where bushmeat fetches the highest prices. In recent years, extractive industries have stimulated very high rates of human immigration and the creation of yet more access roads, which are also used for poaching (e.g., Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p><strong>2. Habitat loss and degradation</strong></p><p>(a) Subsistence/slash-and-burn agriculture: the conversion of forest to farmland across Africa has severely reduced the availability of Chimpanzee habitat. Such habitat loss is especially acute in West Africa, where it is estimated that more than 80% of the region’s original forest cover had been lost by the early 2000s (Kormos <em>et al</em>. 2003). Extensive land conversion in eastern DRC, western Rwanda and western Uganda has destroyed much of the sub-montane forest used by Chimpanzees. In Central Africa, annual rates of loss are lower, averaging about 0.14% (2000–2010 data; Desclée <em>et al</em>. 2014). Ongoing rapid growth in human populations is expected to lead to further widespread conversion of forest and woodland to agricultural land. Along the northern border of the forest-savanna boundary at about 6°N, forests are also being lost to fires and grazing of livestock.</p><p>(b) Extractive industries – logging, mining and oil: logging generally has a negative impact on Chimpanzee densities due to habitat alteration (principally removal of important food trees) and disturbance (Morgan <em>et al. </em>2007). As timber concessions undergo repeated cycles of logging, degradation over time will lead to profound changes in forest composition (Zimmerman and Kormos 2012), as the mature trees of certain species–some of high importance to Chimpanzees for food–are logged out. Mining of precious metals and mineral ores, and drilling for oil not only devastate wildlife habitat, but typically also lead to human inmigration and the building of roads, railways and other infrastructure. As with logging, the resulting increased accessibility to remote areas exacerbates risks to Chimpanzees through habitat degradation and fragmentation in areas not previously impacted by such anthropogenic pressures. The creation of open-pit mines leads to irretrievable loss of forest (Lanjouw 2014).</p><p>(c) Industrial agriculture – as tropical Asia nears its capacity for oil-palm plantations, Africa has become the new frontier for this crop, which offers excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperature conditions (Rival and Lavang 2014). Unfortunately, these areas coincide with good great ape habitat: 42.3% of the African apes’ range is suitable for oil palm (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2014), so the spread of plantations is likely to hit Chimpanzee populations hard in coming years. This situation is of special concern for Chimpanzees living outside protected areas. Changes caused by the rapid transformation of their habitat can have profound impacts on their diet, activity patterns, dispersal and ranging patterns, as well as introducing new pathogens and other risks linked to close proximity with people (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>(d) Major transportation infrastructure – huge road projects, which can be several kilometres wide, are currently underway across Africa and these will substantially fragment great ape habitat and add further to the area of “lost forest” (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). This phenomenon is not confined to the African continent (Laurance <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p><p><strong>3. Disease</strong></p><p>The second major driver of decline in central Chimpanzee populations is infectious disease, especially Ebola virus disease (EVD). Surveys carried out from the 1980s to the present day indicate that EVD caused a series of massive great ape die-offs in a large, mostly-intact forested area straddling the border between northeastern Gabon and northwestern Congo, which includes several national parks and logging concessions (Walsh <em>et al.</em> 2003, Maisels <em>et al.</em> 2004, 2013). Since the early 1990s, about 14% of their total area of distribution has been affected by Ebola virus (<em>Ebolavirus</em>). The virus is still present in the region’s forests: thus, as large areas can be affected by each outbreak, and transmission between individuals is rapid (Walsh et al 2007, 2009), large numbers of central Chimpanzees could succumb to this deadly virus within a span of weeks or months. Although both the Sangha and the Ngoko rivers are barriers to great ape movements (Anthony <em>et al.</em> 2007, Fünfstück <em>et al.</em> 2014), <em>Ebolavirus</em> can cross rivers and has already been detected to the east of the major river barrier between Odzala-Kokoua National Park and the Sangha River (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2014), thus a future outbreak in this region is a strong possibility. There is no evidence to date that the recent dramatic Ebola epidemic in West Africa has affected Chimpanzees, although Ebola killed Chimpanzees in Côte d’Ivoire in the mid-1990s (Formenty<em> et al</em>. 1999).</p><p>Because Chimpanzees and humans are so similar, Chimpanzees succumb to many diseases that afflict humans. Infectious diseases, including outbreaks of respiratory disease and anthrax, are the main cause of death in several Chimpanzee populations that have been habituated to human presence (e.g., Goodall 1986, Nishida <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hanamura <em>et al</em>. 2006, Leendertz <em>et al.</em> 2006, Köndgen <em>et al. </em>2008, Humle 2011). If not properly managed, research and tourism present opportunities for disease transmission between humans and Chimpanzees (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>For information on threats specific to each taxon, including climate change impacts, see the four <em>Pan troglodytes</em> subspecies accounts.</p>","<p>Great ape population estimates are made using a standard index of abundance: night nest abundance and distribution, sometimes combined with predictive modelling. In 2003, the total Chimpanzee population size was estimated to be 172,700–299,700 (Butynski 2003). Current estimates for each subspecies are:&#160;</p>  <ul>  <li>probably fewer than 6,000–9,000 <em>P. t. </em><em>ellioti</em> (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2011, J.

One of the largest and probably most secure subpopulations is in Gashaka-Gumti National Park, Nigeria, estimated at 900–1,000 individuals (Ogunjemite <em>et al</em>. 2010, Adanu <em>et al.</em> 2011). Other major subpopulations are found in Cameroon in Banyang-Mbo Wildlife Sanctuary (estimated at 500–900 or 800–1,450 individuals, depending on nest-decay parameters used; Greengrass and Maisels 2007), in the proposed Ebo National Park (estimated at 626–1,480 individuals, M. Ndimbe and B. Morgan pers. comm. 2015), and in Mbam and Djerem National Park (at least 500 individuals, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>  <p>The vast majority of <em>P. t. schweinfurthii</em> are found in DRC (173,000–248,000, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2010a,&#160;2015). Outside the DRC, there are roughly 5,000 in Uganda (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2003a), just over 400 in Rwanda (WCS Rwanda unpubl. data), fewer than 400 in Burundi (Hakizimana and Huynen 2013), and fewer than 2,500 in Tanzania (A. Piel and F. Stewart, pers. comm.). Almost all Chimpanzees in Tanzania are found in the Greater Mahale Ecosystem, and their populations appear to be stable (Piel <em>et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, Chimpanzee numbers in Rwanda’s Nyungwe National Park are relatively stable (Sop <em>et al</em>. 2015). In western Uganda, forest is being lost at many Chimpanzee sites; however, data from the protected areas (Budongo and Bugoma forest reserves, Kibale National Park) indicate that Chimpanzee populations there are relatively stable (Wanyama <em>et al.</em> 2009, Plumptre <em>et al.</em> 2010b).</p>  <p>The forests of central Africa where <em>Pan t. troglodytes</em> occurs are by far the least disturbed in the species’ range. About one third of the subspecies population resides in Gabon and around 40% in Congo, followed by Cameroon (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The area of forest in these countries is very roughly representative of the proportion of Chimpanzees that it holds. A few thousand individuals remain in Equatorial Guinea, and a few hundred in CAR; the size of the populations in Angola (Cabinda) and DRC is unknown.</p>  <p>The <em>P. </em><em>t. verus</em> strongholds are Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (Ham 1998, Kormos, Humle <em>et al</em>. 2003, Brncic <em>et al.</em> 2010, Tweh <em>et al.</em> 2015).

The four subspecies recognised here are distributed as follows:</p>  <ul><li><em>Pan t. </em><em>ellioti</em> (Gray 1862) is found only in Nigeria and Cameroon, north of the Sanaga River, and has the smallest geographical range the four Chimpanzee subspecies.</li><li><em>Pan t. schweinfurthii</em> (Giglioli 1872) ranges from the Ubangi River/Congo River in southeast Central African Republic (CAR) and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), to Burundi, Rwanda, western Uganda and western Tanzania, with a small, relict population in South Sudan. The Albertine Rift escarpment is a stronghold for this subspecies (Plumptre <em>et al.</em> 2010a).</li><li><em>Pan t. troglodytes</em> (Blumenbach 1799) ranges from Cameroon, south of the Sanaga River, to the Congo River/Ubangi River (DRC).</li><li><em>Pan t. verus</em> (Schwarz 1934) is found in West Africa from Senegal to Ghana, but has almost certainly been extirpated from Benin, Burkina Faso and Togo. More research is needed to determine whether the Chimpanzee population in western Nigeria is allied to <em>P. t. verus</em> or to <em>P. t. ellioti</em>.</li></ul><p>The maximum elevation at which each subspecies has been confirmed is <em>ca</em> 2,000&#160;m asl for <em>P</em>. <em>t</em>. <em>ellioti</em>, 2,790 m for <em>P</em>. <em>t</em>. <em>schweinfurthii</em>, 742 m for <em>P</em>. <em>t</em>. <em>troglodytes</em>, and 1,607&#160;m for <em>P</em>. <em>t</em>. <em>verus</em> (Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>","<p>Chimpanzees are completely protected by national and international laws in all countries of their range, and it is, therefore, illegal to kill, capture or trade in live Chimpanzees or their body parts.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Pan troglodytes</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES and as Class A under the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Chimpanzees are protected by national and international laws throughout their range, but enforcement is generally weak. All four subspecies occur in numerous national parks; however, the majority occur outside protected areas (IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). Even within protected areas, safe haven is not guaranteed: many protected areas in tropical Africa lack adequate management and suffer from poorly-controlled poaching. Stricter enforcement of wildlife laws and more effective management of what may become the last refuges for many great ape populations are needed urgently.</p><p>Conservation needs for Chimpanzees across Africa fall into several broad areas:</p>  <p></p><ol><li>Effective law enforcement, not only in protected areas, but also in logging, mining and agricultural concessions. Chimpanzees are protected by legislation even where the land is not protected.</li><li>Effective, coordinated land-use planning across the geographic range of the species to avoid the clearing of large areas of Chimpanzee habitat to establish large-scale agriculture, especially oil-palm plantations (IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014, Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ruysschaert and Rainer 2015). Industrial extraction of other natural resources, namely timber and minerals, should be incorporated into a holistic, spatially-explicit approach. Such planning needs to be done at both national and regional levels. Several of the most important areas for Chimpanzee conservation are transboundary, and thus fall within the remit of national agencies from two or three countries.</li><li>Long-term standardised monitoring of law enforcement efforts and effectiveness, of Chimpanzee abundance throughout their range, and of chimpanzee health. A standardised tool for law enforcement monitoring (SMART: <a href=""http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org"">www.smartconservationsoftware.org</a>) is already in use across much of the range; standard methods for surveying and monitoring great ape populations that facilitate more accurate and precise monitoring of changes in abundance have been recommended for almost a decade (Kühl <em>et al</em>. 2008 <a href=""http://www.primate-sg.org/best_practice_surveys"">www.primate-sg.org/best_practice_surveys</a>); and non-invasive diagnosis of a range of pathogens is now possible, for example, detection of <em>Ebolavirus</em> in faeces (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2014).</li><li>Outreach to and awareness-raising among all sectors that deal with land and the protection of natural resources: law enforcement and judiciary; protected area authorities; mining, logging, and agricultural industries; local communities and tour operators. This effort should include information on minimising human impacts, such as avoidance of disease transmission to great apes.

Introduced plants such as Kahili Ginger (<em>Hedychium gardnerianum</em>), Blackberry (<em>Rubus argutus</em>), Strawberry Guava (<em>Psidium cattleianum</em>), Australian Tree Fern (<em>Cyathea cooperi</em>) and Firetree (<em>Myrica faya</em>) have degraded much native forest in Koke'e, and threaten the remaining habitat. <br/><br/>Hurricanes have had major impacts on population size in the past; in 1992 Hurricane Iniki devastated forests throughout Kaua`i, and all bird populations on the island appeared to have been drastically reduced (Pratt 1993, 1994)<strong></strong>, although some have since recovered. Hurricanes are now thought to displace birds from the small area of suitable habitat at higher elevations and push them into the lowlands where avian malaria is prevalent (Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. A growing concern is that rising temperatures could allow mosquitoes to survive at higher altitudes and further transmit avian malaria and avian pox (Anon. 2007) as evidenced by a recent study; over the past two decades there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of avian malaria across the altitudinal range of the Alaka’i Plateau, which coincides with increasing air temperatures and changing patterns of precipitation and streamflow which support increased transmission of the disease (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 2014) and having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpublished data)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The most recent population estimate from 2012 is 468 individuals (231-916, 95% CI) (L.

Avian pox and malaria probably cause mortality because introduced mosquitoes (vectors for these diseases) are now common at 900 m, and may breed at 1,200 -1, 400 m (Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997, Lepson 1997, Lepson and Pratt 1997, Glad and Crampton 2015). There is concern that rising average temperatures could allow mosquitoes to survive at higher elevations and increase the exposure of birds to disease (Holmer 2007). A small increase in temperature is predicted to eliminate much of the mosquito-free zone on Kaua`i (U.S. Geological Survey <em>per </em>Holmer 2007) and a recent study has found evidence of this. Over the past two decades there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of avian malaria across the altitudinal range of the Alaka’i Plateau, which coincides&#160;with&#160; increasing&#160; air temperatures and changing patterns of precipitation and streamflow, &#160;which in turn support increased transmission of the disease (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 2014). During this time period, prevalence of malaria remained very low in the few ‘Akeke’e &#160;individuals sampled, which may indicate high susceptibility to this disease (Atkinson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It is predicted that by 2100, there will be no “climatically-suitable” habitat left for this species on Kauai (Fortini <em>et al. </em>2015). Food resources may be limited by alien wasps and ants which greatly reduce populations of native arthropods (Lepson and Pratt 1997). Introduced birds may also be competitors and introduced predators (particularly rats) probably cause some mortality (Lepson and Pratt 1997). &#160;However, Hammond <em>et al</em>. (2015) observed no predation by rats on the eight nests they monitored, although two nests failed due to failure of the eggs to hatch. Adverse weather may be a significant limiting factor, e.g. prolonged, heavy rains which can result in nesting failure and cause massive mortality among fledglings and juveniles (Lepson and Pratt 1997). Two recent hurricanes resulted in serious damage to Kaua`i's forests (Pratt 1994). ‘Akeke’e appear to avoid, to some extent, areas that have suffered more hurricane damage, and thus have few, large trees; and areas that have been heavily invaded by weeds (Behnke <em>et al. </em>2016).</p><p></p>","The most recent population estimate is from 2012 when the number of individuals was estimated at 945 (460-1,547, 95% CI) (Paxton <em>et al</em>. 2016).

The accidental introduction of mammalian predators, non-native pest plants, insects or an avian disease, or a stochastic event such as a hurricane could rapidly bring about its extinction. <p></p>","It occurs in low shrubs and grasses and is evenly distributed across the island (Morin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2016). It feeds on seeds, invertebrates, other plant parts and eggs (Berger 1972, Morin and Conant 2002)<strong></strong>. It nests in cavities in cliffs, rock crevices or in piles of loose rock (Berger 1972, Morin and Conant 2002)<strong></strong>.

There is no information on adult survival or movements (VanderWerf 2012).<br/><p></p>","It is thought that the presence of the introduced grasshopper <em>Schistocerca nitens</em> on Nihoa, and its periodic irruptions which lead to the virtual defoliation of the island, may be a significant threat to the species. Other potential threats include the introduction of detrimental non-native species and diseases, as well as stochastic events (Berger 1972, James and Olson 1991, Morin <em>et al.</em> 1997, H. Baker and P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, such as droughts, storms and hurricanes. Black rats caused the extirpation of translocated Laysan Finches <em>T. ultima </em>when they arrived on Midway in 1944 (VanderWerf 2012). Fire is a past and potential threat (Morin <em>et al.</em> 1997, J. Lepson <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. A few individuals of the invasive weed <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cenchrus echinatus </span>were discovered on Nihoa in 2011 and removed (VanderWerf <em>et al.</em> 2011), and little regrowth was observed in 2012 (VanderWerf 2012). This plant reduces habitat quality and so is a potential threat to the species. <em>T. cantans</em> is known to be highly susceptible to mosquito-borne avian poxvirus (<em>Poxvirus avium</em>) and avian malaria (<em>Plasmodium relictum</em>), and considering its close relationship <em>T. ultima </em>is presumably similarly susceptible. Mosquitoes are not known to occur on Nihoa or Laysan, but are present on Midway and all the larger Hawaiian islands and thus are relevant to selecting sites for translocations (VanderWerf 2012).<br/><p></p>","VanderWerf (2012) estimated 4,475 ±909 birds, which very roughly equates to 3,000 (2,400-3,600) mature individuals.

Numbers on Nihoa have ranged from 6,686 in 1968 to 946 in 1987 (James and Olson 1991, Morin and Conant 2002). The most recent population estimate based on surveys in 2012 is 4,475 (±909, 95% CI) individuals (VanderWerf 2012), which very roughly equates to 3,000 (2,400-3,600) mature individuals.<br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>It is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

Habitat loss and alteration are also thought to be contributing to declines.<p></p>,"When breeding, it is almost always associated with its main food source, flowering Tasmanian blue gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eucalyptus globulus</span>. Flowering may be sufficient to support breeding in only three years out of every 10. In poor years, swamp (black) Gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. ovata</span> is used as food source (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). Overall, the availability and flowering of the feed trees can severely affect the availability of breeding habitat (Tzaros <em>et al</em>. 2009). Most breeding birds are found in remnant forest patches of less than 0.01 km<sup>2</sup>. They nest in hollows of both live and dead eucalypt trees (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2007). The most common tree species used for nesting are stringybark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. obliqua</span>, white peppermint <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. pulchella </span>and Tasmanian blue gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span>, white gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. viminalis</span>, gum-topped stringybark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. delegatensis</span> and dead stags (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Several pairs often nest in close proximity, in the same or neighbouring trees<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>. On the mainland, it occurs in eucalypt forest and woodlands, mainly box-ironbark habitats on the inland slopes of the Great Dividing Range and in coastal forests. Critical food resources occur within this habitat, principally nectar from prolific flowering species such as red ironbark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. tricarpa</span>, grey box <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. microcarpa</span>, yellow gum <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. leucoxylon</span> and mugga ironbark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. sideroxylon </span>on the western slopes, and Swamp Mahogany<span style=""font-style: italic;""> E. robusta</span> and spotted gum<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Corymbia maculata</span> in coastal areas.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>Lerp (sugary secretions from sap sucking insects on leaves; D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2007) is also a favoured food source and is occasionally preffered over blossom, even when abundant blossom is available where birds are present (M. Roderick, D. Ingwersen pers. obs.). During the winter the birds are semi-nomadic and visit a network of traditional sites in reaction to flowering events and lerp availability (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005). Their wintering distribution varies greatly between years, depending on climatic conditions and the resulting food availability (Saunders and Heinsohn 2008). However it will also repeatedly use the same sites between years and often remain in winter foraging habitats for extended periods within a season (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). In some years, urban landscapes containing indigenous or non-local flowering eucalypts are also readily used (C. Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2003). The importance of larger trees as a food source has been shown in this species's breeding range (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004) and wintering range (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005), as such trees tend to offer a more reliable and abundant source of nectar. Individuals can travel up to 5,000 kilometres between their mainland wintering grounds and their Tasmanian breeding sites, making theirs the longest migration undertaken by any parrot in the world (Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><p></p>","Nest predation by Sugar Gliders&#160;<em>Petaurus breviceps</em> introduced to Tasmania&#160;poses a severe threat (Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and is estimated to cause severe declines over the next three generations (Heinsohn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Surveys revealed that&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;predated nests and the probability of a nest surviving the 60-day nesting period when&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;were present was 0.17&#160;(Stojanovic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). On mainland Tasmania almost 79% nests were predated and 65% of adult females were killed by Sugar Gliders. Predation was most severe in locations with low forest cover. Owing to the fact that Swift Parrot breeding distribution varies widely between years the extent of nest predation is also expected to vary annually depending on the distribution of&#160;Sugar Gliders&#160;and forest cover. Sugar Gliders have not been reported from Bruny Island, a Swift Parrot breeding site.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and alteration within breeding and drought refuge habitats remains a key threat. In Tasmania, breeding habitat is significantly reduced and fragmented through clearance of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> for agriculture, residential development, plantation timber, sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips. In 2017, a large area of key nesting habitat has been logged for timber extraction (D. Stojanovic <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Over 50% of the original grassy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">E. globulus</span> forest in Tasmania has been cleared (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Selective logging has resulted in the removal of larger trees from the remaining forest patches. Such patches are typically unfenced and exhibit poor regeneration (Brereton <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). Competition for remaining nest-sites with Common Starlings <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sturnus vulgaris</span> could be a problem along forest edges. Even with protection of remaining habitat (80% private land), maintenance and recovery may be limited by the dependence of breeding on an irregular nectar supply. It also suffers high mortality through collision with windows, vehicles and fences. On the mainland, clearance and degradation of habitat for agriculture, forestry and residential and commercial development has had the biggest impact (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2007). Much of the preferred lowland habitat on the most fertile and productive sites has been cleared or substantially modified (C. Tzaros <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2003). Drought refuge habitats continue to be cleared and fragmented for coastal developments (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Remnants, including much of what currently exists in the conservation reserve system, have been heavily cut-over and degraded, and this practice is continuing in many areas, including hardwood production forests. This practice is considered to result in poor and unreliable nectar-sources through the reduction of large mature trees. Competition from large nectarivores honeyeaters and the introduced Bumblebee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bombus terrestris </span>may be exacerbated by forest fragmentation. In winter, the species relies heavily on public land that has been exploited for timber, honey and minerals (Kennedy and Tzaros 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Global warming threatens to alter habitat phenology and climatic conditions such that habitat availability may be significantly reduced (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;in litt.</span>&#160;2007). The species is also threatened by disturbance, Psittacine beak and feather disease and illegal bird capture and trade (D. Saunders&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Furthermore, the species seems to be very susceptible to Allee effects, where survival and reproductive success decline with decreasing population density, which might even accelerate the population decline (Crates <em>et al</em>. 2017).","Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011) estimate that the current population probably contains around 2,000 mature individuals and is declining. It is placed in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;breeds in Tasmania, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>, mostly along the south-eastern coast from St Helen's to Southport with a small breeding population in the north near Deloraine. After breeding, birds disperse throughout Tasmania before migrating north to mainland Australia. In most years, a large portion of the population winters in central Victoria, with a smaller number of birds wintering further afield (D. Saunders<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2007). However during periods of extreme drought in central Victoria, Swift Parrots undertake large-scale movements (up to 1,000 km) to drought refuge habitats in wetter coastal areas of New South Wales (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Small flocks are recorded in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory on a regular basis (D. Saunders <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). The range in South Australia appears to have contracted, with only irregular recent records of small flocks or individual birds from the south-east of the state. Population size and trends are poorly known.<br/><br/>In 1987-1988, the breeding population was estimated at 5,000 birds, including 1,320 breeding pairs, and in 1995-1996, at 940 breeding pairs (Brereton 1996). Annual surveys across the non-breeding range fluctuate depending on the distribution of the birds across the landscape and flock sizes (Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). In 2010 mainland surveys recorded 2,158 birds, including immatures, the highest count for many years (C. Tzaros and D. Ingwersen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2010). Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011) estimate that the population probably contains around 2,000 mature individuals and is declining, however a population viability analysis model predicted that the population will decline by an average of 87% (79-95%) over three generations (12-18 years) (Heinsohn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II.<strong> </strong>Management actions completed or underway include regular population surveys in Tasmania and throughout the mainland range, utilising a large network of volunteers (Saunders<em> et al</em>. 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong> (coordinated by the Swift Parrot Recovery Team and the Threatened Bird Network), addition of areas of critical habitat to the conservation reserve system in Victoria, development and refinement of guidelines for forestry in <em>E. globulus</em> and box-ironbark forests (at identified priority sites), development of community awareness programmes and revegetation and habitat rehabilitation.

On Maud Island it uses areas with a high canopy cover and low understory and ground cover (Ortiz-Catedral 2012). It requires mature trees with natural hollows or cavities for nesting. Monitoring has revealed that 80% of nests are in mature living trees, with the remaining 20% in dead trees (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2012)<strong></strong>. Of those nests found in mature trees, 68% are in red beech <em>Nothofagus fusca</em>.<em> </em>Breeding is linked with the irregular seeding of <em>Nothofagus</em> when numbers can increase substantially, and it seems that populations may fluctuate significantly in line with breeding/seeding events (T. Greene <em>in litt. </em>2016). In mast years, many pairs will lay a second clutch, and some may lay a third clutch, with breeding continuing through the austral winter. First clutches may average more than eight eggs, with second clutches averaging over seven in 2011. A study on Maud Island has shown that birds form pairs at around seven years of age, and nest in a variety of natural cavities where beech is unavailable (J. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011, 2012)<strong></strong>. It feeds on seeds, fruits, leaves, flowers, buds and invertebrates (Kearvell 1999, Kearvell 2013)<strong></strong>.","The impact of introduced predators, principally stoats <em>Mustela erminea</em> and rats <em>Rattus</em> spp., is likely to be the primary cause of decline (Higgins 1999)<strong></strong>, with recent population crashes being due to rat irruptions. The species's hole-nesting behaviour leads to a reduced ratio of females in the population due to predation of birds on the nest (Elliott <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Silviculture of beech forests aims to harvest trees at an age when few will be mature enough to develop suitable cavities, so sufficient nest holes are unlikely in managed beech forest (Kearwell 2002)<strong></strong>. The species forages in low-growing shrubs and such lower forest levels have been subject to heavy browsing by cattle, deer and possums, altering the forest structure (Duncan and van Hal 2004)<strong></strong>. The population on Chalky Island may suffer competition from&#160;Yellow-crowned Parakeet&#160;<em>C. auriceps </em>(J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011) and in time, this problem may affect other island populations. Population growth in island populations, especially on Maud Island, may also be limited through predation by falcons (Falconidae), and displacement of two nesting pairs by introduced Common Starlings <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sturnus vulgaris</span> has now been documented; the overall impact of this recently-identified threat is uncertain, but may be minimal (J. C. Kearvell<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012, 2013). <br/><br/>In 2008, it was confirmed that native Red-crowned Parakeets <em>C. novaezelandiae</em> on Little Barrier Island were suffering from psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The virus has been sequenced and appears very similar to the strain found in Crimson Rosella <em>Platycercus elegans</em>, in which the disease is known to be endemic within the captive population. In 2009, some individuals of <em>C. malherbi</em> on Maud Island were showing some symptoms consistent with PBFD. In reaction, testing of the entire captive population has been undertaken, as well as more limited sampling of individuals in all three island populations, as well as other parrot species. Results indicate that antibodies for PBFD were detected in <em>C. malherbi</em> from both Maud Island and the captive-rearing unit; notably in the latter case antibodies were found in the <em>C. novaezelandiae</em> foster parents (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt</em>. 2011), and the disease has now been found in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. auriceps</span> in the Eglington Valley, Fiordland (J. C.

Successful translocations on four islands have boosted the population of this species, but decreases may have continued on the mainland. Overall, the global population was estimated at&#160;<span lang=""EN-NZ"">290-690  individuals in early 2013, with the mainland populations estimated to  total 130-270 individuals and the island populations totaling 160-420  individuals&#160;(J.

Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2016). The population has a skewed sex ratio of males to females, probably due to higher predation on incubating females (Kearvell and Farley 2016).",Stable,"Formerly occurring throughout <strong>New Zealand, </strong>the species&#160;is now known from only three beech (<em>Nothofagus </em>spp.) forest valleys in the South Island: the Hawdon and Poulter valleys in Arthur’s Pass National Park and the South Branch of the Hurunui valley in Lake Sumner Forest Park.&#160;They are patchily distributed within these valleys; absent in many parts but in some places can be quite common (Kearvell 2013). In 1999-2000, the population crashed from perhaps 500-700 birds to a  rough estimate of 100-200 as a result of ship rat irruptions in two  successive summers (<strong></strong>J. van Hal <em>in litt. </em>2008, 2009)<strong></strong>. <br/>Translocations to islands began in 2005, with 68 individuals now released on Maud and 61 individuals on Blumine Islands in the Marlborough Sounds, 46 individuals on Chalky Island in Fiordland, and 95 individuals on Tuhua/Mayor Island in the Bay of Plenty (J.C Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2013, A. Grant <em>in litt. </em>2016). These releases all appeared highly successful at first with positive  signs of breeding and population establishment - however, population  growth has now slowed on all islands and the persistence of these  populations appears to still be tenuous (A. Grant <em>in litt. </em>2016). Releases of&#160;captive-raised birds to the South Branch of the Hurunui to augment the population in 2015 and 2016 appear to have been successful with released birds having successfully paired and 9-10 nests located in 2016 (J. Kearvell <em>in litt. </em>2016,&#160;A. Grant <em>in litt. </em>2016). Overall, the population appears to stabilize at low levels, and it is likely that the mainland populations remains at an extremely low level of around 100 birds in total (J.

Hawdon and Poulter valleys are located within Arthur's Pass National Park and the Hurunui South Branch is in Lake Sumner Conservation Park (<strong></strong>J. van Hal <em>in litt. </em>2008, 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Monitoring and conservation of this species is problematic given the difficulty in separating it from <em>C. auriceps</em>. The Hurunui population is contained within a ""mainland island"" which aims to protect and restore two river valleys through integrated pest management, including minimising numbers of <em>Mustela erminea </em>and <em>Rattus rattus</em>. Monitoring of nests will verify whether this is allowing numbers to stabilise and expand. The Hawdon population received <em>M. erminea</em> control only during plague years, which occur, on average, every four years (J. C. Kearvell <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. However, following the dramatic decline in the parakeet population after failure to effectively control predators, rat poisoning and stoat trapping are more extensive within the Hurunui ""mainland island"" (Keey 2004)<strong></strong>. All three valleys are now part of the ""Battle for our Birds"" initiative targeting rats and stoats in South Island beech forest sites. The control of <em>M. erminea </em>is now continuous, whereas control measures against rats are implemented when populations reach trigger points (J. C.

Every nest found is also individually protected with tin tree wraps (to prevent access by predators), ground predator traps and possum traps (<strong></strong>J. van Hal <em>in litt. </em>2008, 2009), and since 2003 only one nest out of 153 has been lost to invasive predators (J.

Since 2005, individuals have been translocated to Chalky Island in Fiordland, which is free from predators (Duncan and van Hal 2004)<strong></strong>. The reintroduction of birds to Maud Island has been underway since 2007, and wild-bred birds are now nesting on the island. Translocations to Tuhua Island have been taking place since December 2009, and in early 2011 it was expected that all birds produced in the next captive breeding season would be released there to provide a sufficient founder population (J.

Reasons for this recent decline are unclear, though the species has suffered from previous loss, fragmentation and degradation of winter habitat, and changes to fire regime in the breeding habitat. Likely causes of the recent decline are an outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease in 2014 and the effects of a ten-year drought on productivity of saltmarsh plants in the winter habitat that reduced the breeding condition of females. It is also likely that the lack of habitat burns in the preferred breeding habitat has reduced the availability and quality of preferred food plants. The species is therefore classified as Critically Endangered.<p></p>","The Orange-bellied Parrot breeds in a mosaic of eucalypt forest and rainforest bordering extensive moorland plains. Nesting occurs in tree hollows and the species feeds on the seeds of a range of grasses and sedges in moorlands. There is some evidence that early in the breeding season birds prefer to forage in areas burnt seven to 15 years earlier, whilst later in the breeding season they prefer areas burnt three to five years earlier (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011). After breeding, Orange-bellied Parrots migrate to saltmarshes, dunes, beaches, pastures and shrublands close to the coast (&lt;5 km), where there they feed on the ground or in low vegetation, almost exclusively on seeds, mainly of salt-tolerant coastal and saltmarsh plants (Loyn<em> et al</em>. 1986, Garnett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011).<br/><p></p>","The primary reason for the species's rarity is thought to be its specialist habitat requirements, and fragmentation and degradation of winter habitat by grazing, agriculture and urban and industrial development. Changes have also occurred in the breeding habitat, where there has been reduction of fire, which would normally produce favourable habitat structure for the species. Up until the 1990s, fire was regularly used by small-scale tin miners to reduce vegetation cover to aid mining and protect assets, coincidentally producing high quality foraging habitat for the species. Management of the area is now subject to stricter use of fire by the land manager and due to a combination of lack of resources and risk aversion, habitat management burns have rarely been implemented. This has resulted in a gradual decline in the habitat quality for the species. Disease is an important threat to the tiny population. An outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in 2015 infected 19 out of 26 wild Orange-bellied Parrot nestlings tested (Anon. 2015). One adult also tested positive for the disease. This contributed to a decline in the wild population from 35 to 23 mature individuals in 2016. Competition with introduced seed-eating finches may have affected winter food availability, while some former breeding habitat may have been vacated because of a change in the fire regime and competition with introduced Common Starlings <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>, which fill nest-hollows with nesting material, rendering them unsuitable. The introduced Sugar Glider <em>Petaurus breviceps</em> is also implicated as a predator of incubating females, eggs and nestlings during the Birch's Inlet release and is a known threat to other species including the Swift Parrot (Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2014). Sugar Gliders are absent from Melaleuca and therefore may have had an influence on the contraction of the breeding range. Deaths from random events, such as predation by foxes and cats, or disease, are significant threats to such a tiny population. Ongoing degradation of remaining saltmarsh habitat on the mainland is a significant threat (C. Tzaros and M.A. Weston <em>in litt. </em>2003). A ten-year drought reduced productivity of saltmarsh plants in the winter habitat, reducing the breeding condition of females.&#160;Windfarm developments may kill about one bird per year (Smales <em>et al. </em>2005). Due to the low population size, the species is highly susceptible to genetic Allee effects, which might lead to further population reductions (Crates <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><p></p>","Surveys in early 2010 found fewer than 50 birds at Melaleuca and found no birds at any other historical breeding areas. The wild population was therefore estimated to contain fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals in 2010.&#160;The total wild population at the end of the 2015/16 season was only 35 (M. Holdsworth <em>in litt. </em>2016) and has decreased to 14 in 2017. The sex ratio is highly skewed (12 males and 2 females) (D. Stojanovic <em>in litt.</em> 2017). Captive breeding programmes have been carried out since 1986 to restock the wild population, with more than 300 individuals in different breeding centres in Australia and Tasmania (BirdLife Australia <em>in litt</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"This species breeds only in south-western Tasmania, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Australia</span>. The current known breeding population is only found at one small site, at Melaleuca, but the historical distribution was more extensive and unsuccessful attempts were made to re-establish&#160;a population at Birch’s Inlet.&#160;Birds migrate to the mainland after breeding, sometimes stopping over on King Island, and overwintering at coastal sites in south-eastern South Australia and Victoria. Annual winter counts in Victoria, South Australia and Bass Strait from 1979 to 1990 varied between 67 and 122, with no significant change in numbers (Starks <em>et al.</em> 1992). Numbers recorded in mainland surveys have since declined, for example 48 birds recorded from 19 sites in 2007 (Saunders 2008). The overall population, which was estimated to number around 150 individuals in 2005 (M. Holdsworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2005), has since undergone a rapid decline (confirmed by data from both breeding and wintering sites): surveys in early 2010 found fewer than 50 birds at Melaleuca and no birds at any other historical breeding areas (Sims 2010). The wild population was therefore estimated to contain fewer than 50 individuals in 2010, and extinction in the wild has been predicted to take place within 3-5 years (Sims 2010). More recently, the total post-breeding wild population at Melaleuca was only 35, including 18 juveniles (M. Holdsworth <em>in litt. </em>2016). Based on mean annual survival estimates (Holdsworth <em>et al.</em> 2011) the return of mature individuals in 2016/17 was predicted to be 20-25. Low breeding participation of females appears to be a limiting factor in some years, with some females not breeding every year (Sims 2010).&#160;Only 12 and 13 young are known to have fledged at Melaleuca in 2008/09 and 2009/10 respectively, and urgent action was taken in 2010/11 to secure the captive population by the collection of 21 of 27 young as founders in that year (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 2011). In recent years the output of fledglings has recovered somewhat with an average of 25/year (14-39/year). The captive insurance population has expanded in recent years and by April 2016 consisted of about 325 individuals held at ten facilities under a cooperative breeding programme and is considered to be secure (A. Everaardt <em>in litt. 2</em>016). Re-establishment of the Orange-bellied Parrot at Birch's Inlet was attempted during the period 1999-2009 with a total of 410 captive-bred birds being released, which produced 71 wild-bred fledglings. However, the reintroduction attempt failed because mean annual adult survival of released birds was 0.30 - half that of wild birds (0.65) - and the low fertility rate of 0.55 mimics the low fertility of the captive population (0.57), which is significantly less than in wild birds (0.86). Breeding output at this site was further limited by nest competition and depredation.&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. A recovery team was established in 1980, a wide range of research projects are ongoing, and awareness-raising and education programmes are conducted. Much feeding habitat in Tasmania (including King Island), Victoria and South Australia has been reserved or is managed. Breeding, migration and winter counts are made annually, and almost 100% of the wild population is colour-banded. A captive breeding programme has been established and the population of about 350 birds is held at 10 institutions under a cooperative captive breeding effort. The captive population is predominantly derived from six founders collected in the 1980s (perhaps leading to low egg fertility as a result of inbreeding depression) but more recently has been bolstered by the inclusion of 21 new founders collected in 2010. Captive-bred birds that have been released have apparently migrated successfully between their breeding and wintering grounds (Loyn <em>et al. </em>2005, Anon. 2014), but few birds released on the breeding grounds return in the following breeding season (Troy and Gales&#160;2016), suggesting that most released birds fail to migrate or survive to the following year. As the population is severely male biased (six males per one female), a higher proportion of females is released in spring to correct the sex ratio  imbalance (Stojanovic et al. 2017). The survival rate and reproductive success of captive-reared birds are far lower&#160;than for wild birds (Holdsworth 2006, Holdsworth <em>et al.</em> 2011, Stojanovic <em>et al</em>. 2017). Moreover, the plumage of captive-bred birds is in poorer condition, which might prove to be energetically costly, especially during migration (Stojanovic<em> et al</em>. 2017). Of &#160;53 captive birds released in 2014 and 2015, just six survived to return to Melaleuca. An additional 27 captive bred individuals were released at Melaleuca in 2015.

Between 2000 and 2009, wetland loss in the western (Daurian) part of the range has been greatly exacerbated by prolonged drought conditions. This drought is part of a climatic cycle, and is predicted to persist until 2015 (O. Gorosko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Breeding birds are also threatened by steppe fires, whilst livestock grazing may cause disturbance and reduce the availability of suitable nesting habitat (Bradter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). In its China wintering grounds, the main threats are from development and increasing human disturbance of wetlands in the Yangtze basin, the effects of the Three Gorges Dam on wetlands in the Yangtze basin, the proposed construction of a dam at the outlet to Poyang Lake&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">(Harris and Zhuang 2010);&#160;and in Korea, the potential development of wetlands in the Demilitarised Zone.

On-going declines are inferred to be taking place in the population as a  result of habitat loss, introduced predators (e.g. on New Caledonia and  Stewart Island [G. Harper <em>in litt.</em> 2005, 2012; Harper 2009]), and potentially owing to Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (Ortiz-Catedral <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The nominate subspecies is adversely affected by forestry operations: clear-felling and burning have drastically reduced available habitat, and selective logging may reduce the number of trees with suitable nesting holes and foraging opportunities. Irruptions in the 19th century may have been caused by increased cultivation of crops by European settlers. It was hunted for food by Maori, and was formerly persecuted because birds damaged crops and gardens. It may suffer through competition for food or breeding sites with introduced species (such as the Common Myna <em>Acridotheres tristis</em>, Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>, Eastern Rosella <em>Platycercus eximius</em>, Crimson Rosella <em>P. elegans</em>, common brushtail possums <em>Trichosurus vulpecula </em>and honey bees <em>Apis mellifera</em>). Introduced predators such as cats, rats and stoats may also impact the species. An outbreak of beak-and-feather disease has been confirmed in the population on Little Barrier Island.

Since then, increasing weed invasion  has dramatically altered the structure and composition of remaining  native vegetation. The degradation of native plant communities has been  linked with a reduction in the nutrient input to the island, caused by  the decimation of formerly large populations of burrow-nesting seabirds  by introduced mammalian predators (Holdaway in prep.). Though forest  clearance has stopped, recovery requires new habitat to become  available. Nest-site availability has been further reduced by  competition with introduced Crimson Rosella <em>Platycercus elegans</em> and, to a lesser extent, Common Starling <em>Sturnus vulgaris </em>and feral honey bees. Most known nest failures have resulted from predation by introduced black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em>.  Feral cats are also thought to be significant predators and, although  the level of predation is unquantified, anecdotal reports have been  alarming (M. Christian<em> in litt.</em> 2007).

Populations currently exist on the Kermadec islands, Three Kings, some Hauraki Gulf islands, Kapiti Island, Stewart Island and surrounding islands, Chatham Islands, Snares, Antipodes Islands, and as a hybrid swarm (with Yellow-crowned Parakeet <em>C. auriceps</em>) on Auckland Islands. The subspecies from Lord Howe Island (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">subflavescens</span>) and Macquarie Island (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">erythrotis</span>) went extinct at the end of the 19th century (Hindwood 1940, Taylor 1979). Past population estimates suggest the total population was in excess of 20,000 individuals, but historically the island populations were part of an effectively panmictic population. When the mainland linking populations became extinct, the island populations became isolated, and their effective population sizes are now much reduced. Declines are likely to be taking place on Stewart Island (by inference from measured declines of other species, owing to rat and cat predation), although any decline has been minimal (G.

It was once found throughout the island, and estimated to number at  least 190 pairs. It is now confined to the Norfolk Island National Park  and adjacent forested areas and orchards (Hill 2002). In 1994, the  declining population consisted of only four breeding females and 28-33  males. Conservation management measures have allowed the population to  grow, and numbers were estimated at a possible 200-300 individuals in  2004, and 150-200 birds in 2008. However, recent observations of  disappearance from places where it was once common, and evi­dence of cat  predation (M. Christian, R. Ward and J.

A recent study found that the nectar and pollen of <em>Opuntia megasperma</em> is an important food source and nestlings were principally fed Lepidopteran caterpillars (Ortiz-Catedral 2014).<br/><p></p>","Extinction on Floreana was probably caused by the depredations of introduced Black Rats (<em>Rattus rattus)</em>, feral<strong></strong> cats and feral dogs, with introduced goats causing habitat loss<em> </em>(Harris 1973, Curry 1986, Grant <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2000). Higher adult mortality occurs in the unusually dry La Niña years (Grant <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>; dry years are increasing in frequency, and this is thought to be driving fluctuations in the population size (as seen in 2007 and 2008) which leave the species prone to extinction (D. Wiedenfeld <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. The Smooth-billed Ani (<em>Crotophaga ani</em>)<em> </em>is known to predate other bird species on the archipelago and has been seen on Champion and Gardner-by-Floreana (G. Jiménez-Uzcátegui <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Increased mortality on Champion during the 1982-1983 El Niño event is thought to have been the result of avian pox virus (Grant <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>, and the invasive parasite (<em>Philornis downsi</em>)<em> </em>has been recorded (Wiedenfeld and Jimenez-Uzcategui 2008)<strong></strong>. Transmission of diseases from domestic chickens could also pose a threat (Deem <em>et al.</em> 2012). There are black rats present on nearby islets whose accidental introduction to either of the breeding islands poses an ever present threat (G. Jiménez-Uzcátegui <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. The loss of immigration from the now extinct Floreana population has raised concerns for the long-term survival of the two remaining populations, as they are believed to have lost a significant amount of genetic diversity (Grant <em>et al.</em> 2000, <strong></strong>Hoeck <em>et al. </em>2009) although there appears to be no link between inbreeding and immunocompetence within the species (Hoeck and Keller 2012).<br/><p></p>","Between 2003 and 2008, the population on Champion Island numbered 20-52 individuals, with 65-179 on Gardner-by-Floreana. Both populations reached lows in 2007 following very bad weather conditions in 2006, with a total population of just 46 mature individuals remaining. Numbers then recovered in 2008 due to good, wet weather conditions (D. Wiedenfeld <em>in litt.</em> 2010) and in 2012, 142 birds were counted (Ortis-Catedral 2012c). The total population was estimated to be 756, based on bird counts in 2012 (Charles Darwin Foundation 2013), with the population having been &gt;50 mature individuals since 2008. Therefore, the population size is placed here in the range 250-999 mature individuals.",Stable,"This species survives in low numbers on Champion (0.1 km<sup>2</sup>) and Gardner-by-Floreana (0.8 km<sup>2</sup>) islets in the Galápagos Islands, <strong>Ecuador </strong>(Grant <em>et al.</em> 2000). It became extinct on the much larger Floreana (173 km<sup>2</sup>) between 1868 and 1880<em> </em>(Curry 1986, Steadman 1986)<strong></strong>. In 1966, the population was estimated to be no more than 150 birds (Harris 1968)<strong></strong>. Between 1980 and 1991, annual counts showed that there were 8-12 (average 10) territories on Champion, with 24-53 birds in total (Grant <em>et al.</em> 2000). On the same island between 2003 and 2008, numbers of birds varied from 20-52, but overall there was a downward population trend with 12 adults left in 2006 (Charles Darwin Foundation 2007b, Jiménez-Uzcátegui <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). A similar trend was noted on Gardner-by-Floreana during the same period, with the number of birds on that island varying between 65 and 179, and the number of adults in 2007 falling to 29 (Charles Darwin Foundation 2007b, Jiménez-Uzcátegui 2007,  Jiménez-Uzcátegui <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011)<strong></strong>. The population recovered in 2008 due to good weather conditions and may have reached record numbers for the last decade, however such population highs are likely only to be temporary as the islands cannot support such numbers and the populations are still extremely prone to climate-induced fluctuations (Hoeck 2009, Charles Darwin Foundation <em>in litt. </em>2009, D. Wiedenfeld <em>in litt.</em> 2010<strong></strong>). A population viability analysis of the Champion population suggested that there is less than a 50% chance of the bird persisting on the island for another 100 years. <p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>A 10-year action plan was developed in 2007, with plans to take active measures to safeguard existing populations, and to create suitable conditions for reintroduction to Floreana (Charles Darwin Foundation 2007b,&#160;G. Jiménez-Uzcátegui <em>in litt. </em>2007, Anon. 2008a)<strong></strong>. The reintroduction plan is supported by an emergency plan, to enable rapid response to critical downward population trends (Anon. 2008b)<strong></strong>, the Introduced Rodent Eradication Program initiated in 2007 and the initiation of Project Floreana, aimed at the restoration of the island (Anon. 2008a)<strong></strong>. The Galápagos National Park was gazetted in 1959, and includes almost all the land area of the islands. In 1979, the islands were declared a World Heritage Site (Jackson 1985)<strong></strong>. Unauthorised access to both the islands where the species is present is not permitted and there are stringent quarantine measures in place for field gear and researchers (Charles Darwin Foundation 2013). A ringing study is on-going to determine survival rates of the species; another study aims to assess the impacts of the parasite <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Philornis downsi</span> on the mockingbird population (Ortis-Catedral 2012). &#160;<br/><br/>The Charles Darwin Foundation plans to reintroduce the species to Floreana, however no translocation occurred in 2010 as an El Niño event was expected which would have made rat and cat control on the island very difficult (P. Hoeck <em>in litt. </em>2010, G. Jiménez-Uzcátegui <em>in litt. </em>2012)<strong></strong>. In 2012 plans were made to establish a rat- and cat-proof perimeter around Punta Cormorant, a 51 ha peninsula with lowland vegetation on the east side of Floreana Island, either through natural recolonisation from Champion (c.4 km away) or through translocations (Ortis-Catedral 2012b,c,d).&#160;However due to the likely impacts of poisoned bait on the mockingbirds it has been decided that a translocation should only take place once Floreana has been fully eradicated of rats and cats (Ortiz-Catedral 2013). Plans have been developed to remove rats from the island and was scheduled for 2014 (Nicholls 2013). Modelling work has been conducted to investigate the best strategy for reintroductions (Bozzuto&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). A week-long education campaign took place on Floreana in July 2012 and  included events focused on the species (Ortis-Catedral 2012c). In addition, in 2014, children at a local school performed a play about the daily lives of mockingbirds and the importance of keeping Champion and Gardner free of invasive species (Ortiz-Catedral <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Monitor populations and environmental conditions on both islands, preferably annually (Grant <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Minimise the risk of chance introductions of predators and disease. Support the establishment of captive-breeding populations and reintroduce to Floreana if eradication of rats, cats, anis, pigs, goats and donkeys is successful. Investigate possibility of reintroduction to other islets, or areas of Floreana, where black rat<em>s </em>and cats<em> </em>are absent (G. Jiménez-Uzcátegui <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). As <em>Opuntia megasperma</em> appears to be an important food source during the breeding season, it is important to both establish if it is key for breeding and consider a supplementary feeding programme for future reintroductions (Ortiz-Catedral 2014). In addition improved biosecurity measures should be implemented and mockingbirds should only be reintroduced in areas far from poultry and humans (Deem <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

It arrives on its breeding grounds between late-April and May and breeds from late-May onwards<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988) in highly dispersed<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) solitary pairs<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). After mating (from June onwards) males migrate long distances prior to their flightless moult, most travelling in small groups to inshore or offshore coastal waters<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988). Females and juveniles leave the breeding grounds in September<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious when not breeding<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988) with males forming large congregations during the flightless moulting period<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) and large flocks of several hundred to a thousand<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998) or occasionally over 100,000 individuals occurring during winter<strong></strong> (Scott and Rose 1996). Non-breeders often oversummer on the wintering grounds<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on Arctic dwarf heath<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005) or boggy tundra on pools, small lakes, streams<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and slow-flowing rivers<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for freshwater habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) with low banks<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), small islets<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys<strong><sup> </sup></strong>or among mossy bogs<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover<strong></strong> (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). It generally avoids areas with steep slopes or wetlands enclosed by forest<strong></strong> (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) the majority moult and overwinter at sea<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) on shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) (optimally 5-15 m) (Scott and Rose 1996) with abundant benthic fauna<strong></strong> (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. barnacles and shrimps)<strong></strong> (Johnsgard 1978), worms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), echinoderms, isopods, amphidods<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) and insects<strong></strong> (e.g. midges and caddisflies <strong></strong>[del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992])<strong></strong> as well as small fish<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and fish eggs<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as seeds, roots and tubers<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) close to water<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) or placed further away in dwarf heath<strong></strong> (Kear 2005).  <p></p>","<p>Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten this species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while development associated with oil drilling sites can cause additional, low-level impacts through human disturbance and the degradation of food resources (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). Some large populations border oil fields and proximity to drilling and transport puts the population at high risk of oil pollution (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, one study found that although the 1996 Sea Empress oil spill in Carmarthen Bay resulted in a rapid and drastic reduction in Common Scoter numbers in the area, complete recovery occurred after three winters with no observable long-term effects (Banks <em>et al</em>. 2008).  </p><p>Climate change is thought to negatively impact the species at present and in the future through habitat loss and ecosystem degradation. Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for this species, and remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in Siberia (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher <em>et al</em>. 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Eutrophication in the Baltic Sea resulting from agricultural run-off, could also cause the loss of key prey items, e.g. bivalves (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>  The risk of bycatch is thought to affect a majority of the population, as reported in the Gulf of Gdańsk (Stempniewicz 1994), and the commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat, through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Further threats to food resources include the loss of benthic habitats caused by sand and gravel extraction, although Skov <em>et al.</em> (2011) suggest that in the present-day Baltic region, this is occurring at insufficient levels to be responsible for declines in waterbirds. Hunting is contributing to mortality in some parts of the species’ range, but not thought to drive significant population decline. In Denmark, c.2,800-5,200 Common Scoters are harvested per year (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006) but no data is available for other countries, although hunting of Common Scoters is legal in some EU countries (HELCOM 2013b). Interaction with wind farms could pose a potential threat to the species. While Stewart <em>et al</em>. (2007) showed that duck densities were more adversely affected by wind farms than other groups of species, Dürr (2013) found the opposite, stating that collision rates between ducks and wind turbines are low compared to other species groups. Avian influenza is present in the population, but as yet there is no evidence that it has caused significant mortality events (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gudmundsson <em>et al.</em> 2010). High-speed ferries have been suggested as a major cause of Common Scoter disturbance by a study in the Kattegat Sea, Denmark (Larsen and Laubek 2005).<p></p>  <p></p>","The total population has been estimated to number 1,600,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006), which probably includes c.1,070,000 mature individuals, assuming that they account for around 2/3 of the population.&#160;The European population is estimated at 107,000-131,000 pairs, which equates to 214,000-263,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species breeds in <strong>Iceland</strong>, eastern Greenland (<strong>Denmark</strong>) and northern <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, across Scandinavia and northern parts of western and central <strong>Russia</strong> (e.g. Collinson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006).

In the U.K. the species is listed as Red on the national Red List and is a U.K. Priority Species and Biodiversity Action Plan species. It is also listed as Endangered on the Red List of Baltic Wintering Birds (HELCOM 2013a). Research and monitoring has been initiated by several organisations to identify the driving factors behind its decline and better understand the species's movements (Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The following information refers to the species's range within Europe: Management actions at non-breeding sites are essential to maintain the health of this species. Measures should be taken to minimise bycatch in fisheries, regulate shipping traffic, implement and enforce hunting regulations (Bellebaum <em>et al</em>. 2012, HELCOM 2013b), prevent accidental and chronic oil pollution and preserve feeding grounds (HELCOM 2013b).

It has an extremely large range and six subpopulations across which trends are variable. The population trend of the largest subpopulation, <em>islandica</em>, is unclear as is the trend of <em>roselaari</em>. The <em>rufa</em> and <em>canutus</em>&#160;subpopulations have both experienced population declines. Two subpopulations use the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and have experienced significant declines owing to loss of habitat in the Yellow Sea. Should new research resolve uncertainties in the trends of several of these subpopulations the species may warrant uplisting or downlisting.","The species breeds in the high Arctic (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996) on dry upland tundra including weathered sandstone ridges, upland areas with scattered willows&#160;<em>Salix</em>&#160;spp.,&#160;<em>Dryas</em>&#160;spp. and poppy, moist marshy slopes and flats in foothills, well-drained slopes hummocked with&#160;<em>Dryas</em>&#160;spp. (Johnsgard 1981) and upland glacial gravel close to streams or ponds (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;The nest is an open shallow depression (Flint&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984) either positioned on hummocks surrounded by mud and water or on stony or gravelly ground or even coastal spits (Johnsgard 1981, Lappo <em>et al. </em>2012) on open vegetated tundra or stone ridges (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species is strictly coastal, frequenting tidal mudflats or sandflats, sandy beaches of sheltered coasts, rocky shelves, bays, lagoons and harbours, occasionally also oceanic beaches and saltmarshes (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).<br/><br/>During the breeding season it feeds predominantly on insects (mainly adult and larval Diptera, Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and bees) as well as spiders, small crustaceans, snails and worms (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). When it first arrives on the breeding grounds, however, the species is dependent upon vegetation (including the seeds of sedges, horsetails&#160;<em>Equisetum</em>&#160;spp. and grass shoots) owing to the initial lack of insect prey (Johnsgard 1981).&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species takes intertidal invertebrates such as bivalve and gastropod molluscs, crustaceans (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>1996) (e.g. horseshoe crab&#160;<em>Limulus</em>&#160;spp. eggs) (Karpanty&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), annelid worms and insects, rarely also taking fish and seeds (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996). It is a full long-distance migrant that utilises few stopover sites or staging areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The species is vulnerable to extensive land reclamation projects that encroach upon important habitat across its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Kraan <em>et al. </em>2010, Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Loss of intertidal stopover habitats due to reclamation activities in the Yellow Sea region of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is thought to be driving declines in shorebird populations (Amano&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Yang&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Leyrer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Melville <em>et al. </em>2016, Piersma <em>et al. </em>2016). It is estimated that up to 65% of tidal flats in the Yellow Sea region have been lost over the past five decades, with an annual loss of 1.2% per year since the 1980s (Murray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;These losses are attributed to urban, industrial and agricultural expansion within the region with the populations of&#160;<em>C. c. piersmai</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. c. rogersi</em>&#160;both being threatened by development at key staging sites in Bohai Bay, China (Rogers <em>et al. </em>2010, Yang <em>et al. </em>2011, Leyrer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It is threatened by the over-exploitation of shellfish (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Goldfeder and Blanco 2006) which leads directly and indirectly to reductions in prey availability (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;Damming of rivers, dredging (which reduces food availability), pollution, aquaculture operations, renewable energy developments, oil exploration and invasion of mudflats by <em>Spartina</em> grasses pose additional threats to key habitats (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006, Niles <em>et al. </em>2010, Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014, Melville <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;<br/><br/>The species also suffers from disturbance in the non-breeding season as a result of tourism (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006), residential development (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014) foot-traffic on beaches (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002, Niles <em>et al. </em>2010, Lilleyman <em>et al. </em>2016), recreational activities and over-flying aircraft, which together reduce the size of available foraging areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). In the past, increased harvesting of Horseshoe Crab <em>Limulus polyphemus</em> in Delaware Bay, U.S.A. resulted in reduced prey availability (McGowan <em>et al. </em>2011, Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is hunted illegally for example in New Zealand (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996) and northern Brazil (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014), and potentially in China (Melville <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;<em>C. c. islandica</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>C. c. canutus</em>&#160;are both huntable in France and hunting of other species can cause disturbance and accidental mortality. The species can also suffer mortality by incidentally being caught in fish traps (Melville <em>et al. </em>2016). It has been susceptible to avian influenza in the past so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), although testing since 1992 in northwest Australia has not found any evidence for this disease in the species there (Curran <em>et al. </em>2014). Climate change induced sea level rise and thawing of permafrost pose threats to intertidal staging areas, non-breeding sites and Arctic breeding areas (Leyrer <em>et al</em>. 2014, Wauchope <em>et al. </em>2016).","The global   population is estimated to number 891,000-979,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 15,000-30,000 pairs, which equates to 30,000-60,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015), and the population overwintering in Australia and the Americas have been estimated at 110,000 individuals (Hansen <em>et al. </em>2016) and 44,763 individuals (Niles <em>et al. </em>2010) respectively.",Decreasing,"The species has an extremely large range, breeding from Alaska (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>) across the Arctic to Greenland (<strong>Denmark</strong>) and northern <strong>Russia</strong>.

There are six subspecies: <em>C. c. canutus</em> breeds in central and northern Siberia, the Taymyr Peninsula and possibly Yakutia, wintering in western and southern Africa and south Asia; <em>C. c. piersmai</em> breeds in the New Siberian Islands (Russia) and winters in north-west <strong>Australia</strong>; <em>C. c. rogersi</em> breeds on the Chukotskiy Peninsula and possibly further west, and winters in Australasia (Van Gils <em>et al. </em>2017); <em>C. c. roselaari</em> breeds on Wrangel Island (off north-east Siberia) and north-west Alaska, wintering primarily in western <strong>Mexico</strong>, as well as the coast of south-east U.S.A., southern <strong>Panama</strong> and northern <strong>Venezuela</strong>; <em>C. c. rufa</em> breeds in the Canadian low Arctic and winters on the coasts of south Florida, Texas, northern <strong>Brazil</strong>&#160;(15,400 individuals [R.I.G.

Include requirements for this species during planning for coastal development, and advocate the restoration of this species's habitat (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2016). Shellfish fishing at wintering and stop-over habitats needs to be sustainably managed. Continue to aid in the recovery of horsehoe crab populations in Delaware Bay (Niles <em>et al. </em>2010).

Within Europe, it has experienced moderate declines&#160;which have not been compensated for by increases elsewhere in the species' range. Declines are thought to be driven by a range of threats including overharvesting of aquatic resources, pollution, disturbance and hunting. Should the declines be found to be more severe, or new information reveal declines in the <em>S. m. sedentaria</em> and <em>S. m. borealis</em> populations, then the species would warrant uplisting; it almost meets the requirements for listing as threatened under criterion A4abcde.","<p>The Common Eider always nests on the ground, and usually in areas free of mammalian predators (Waltho and Coulson 2015), including coastal islands and islets along low-lying rocky coasts, on coastal shores and spits, on islets in brackish and freshwater lagoons, coastal lakes and rivers or on tundra pools close to the coast (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Kear 2005). They use a wide range of nesting habitats, including bare ground, shingle, grassland, scrub, under trees and in derelict buildings (Waltho and Coulson 2015). The nest is a slight hollow in the ground that is usually positioned in the shelter of rocks or vegetation but may also be in the open (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Large nesting aggregations form where safe nesting sites are at a premium (Waltho and Coulson 2015).</p><p>These species typically moults on shallow marine or sheltered coastal waters free from disturbance (Kear 2005; Waltho and Coulson 2015). It winters on shallow coasts (usually &lt;10m depth), bays and estuaries (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Waltho and Coulson 2015), especially where there are high abundances of benthic molluscs,&#160;particularly <em>Mytilus edulis</em> (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015). It may also occur inland on freshwater lakes when on passage and during the winter (rarely) (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Its diet consists predominantly of benthic molluscs,&#160;especially <em>Mytilus edulis</em>, although a wide range of crustaceans (e.g. amphipods and isopods), echinoderms, other marine invertebrates and fish may also be taken (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992, Waltho and Coulson 2015). During the breeding season incubating females in the Arctic &#160;are reported to feed on &#160;algae, berries and the seeds and leaves of surrounding tundra plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), while in temperate regions they do not&#160;feed, which leads to the temporary breakdown of their digestive system (Waltho and Coulson 2015, Laursen and Møller 2016), Northern populations of this species are migratory (&gt;1000km), but southern populations are largely sedentary (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Migratory nature is largely a response to coastal sea ice (Waltho and Coulson 2015).<br/></p><p></p>","<p>The critical factor for the long-term survival of the species appears to be the survival rate of young ducklings (Waltho and Coulson 2015), but it is not clear which factors are causing the low duckling survival. Past mass mortality in ducklings has been caused by viral infections (1996, 1999) (Hollmén 2002), and the impact of this is likely aggravated by low availability and low nutritional quality of food supplies which is associated with poor body condition in females at the onset of the breeding season (Desholm <em>et al</em>. 2003). Avian cholera appears to be a potentially significant threat with mass mortality events noted at several colonies in Denmark and in Canada (Kats 2007, Descamps <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tjørnløv <em>et al.</em> 2013), and according to Descamps <em>et al.</em>’s (2012) model, only a few recurrent outbreaks would be sufficient to cause colony extinction within a relatively short time. Other diseases may also impact populations, e.g. Wellfleet Bay Virus has caused heavy mortality in Massachusetts, US (Ballard <em>et al.</em> 2012) but high parasite loads are considered to be a symptom of other detrimental impacts rather than a primary driver of decline (Kats 2007).</p>  <p>Conflict with the shellfish aquaculture industry can have detrimental effects on certain populations (Kear 2005, Ens 2006). Over-harvesting of benthic molluscs has led to mass starvation events in the past, particularly where secondary prey resources are targeted, as with intensive fishing of <em>Spisula</em> clams during a period of low mussel stocks prior to a mass mortality event in 1999-2000 in the Dutch Wadden Sea and southern North Sea (Camphuysen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Ens 2006, Kats 2007). The species is also impacted by the extensive use of gillnets, and commonly becomes entangled and drowned in monofilament nets, and significant mortality may occur where fishing effort overlaps with Eider aggregations (Kear 2005, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Levels of hunting are high within several countries within the range, and have been considered unsustainable in Russia (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006), Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006) and Greenland (where annual bags exceeded 80,000 in the late 1990s) (Merkel 2004). New restrictions introduced in 2004 appear to have enabled populations to recover considerably (Merkel 2010). In North America, the harvest may still exceed sustainable levels in certain areas (Kear 2005).&#160; Populations in the high Arctic are subject to shooting by indigenous peoples for food, especially in spring (Byers and Dickson 2001, Kear 2005), but this subsistence hunting is likely to be sustainable at current levels (Byers and Dickson 2001). An associated threat is that of lethal and sub-lethal lead exposure through ingestion of lead shot by adult birds, with 23% of females dying of emancipation after incubation were diagnosed with severe or sub-clinical lead poisoning (Hollmén 2002), and 22% of birds collected through hunting in Greenland over three years carried embedded shot pellets (Falk <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>The species is vulnerable to chronic coastal oil pollution and to major oil spills especially in areas where large moulting and wintering concentrations occur (Kear 2005, Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015, Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2017). While one major incident has the potential to be disastrous, levels of chronic oil-related mortality appears relatively stable in the southern North Sea and Wadden Sea, at between 4-12% of estimated winter mortality (Camphuysen <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>  <p>Disturbance from the development of mineral resources along the coast (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006) and from local shore-based activities such as angling and dog walking increases the likelihood of predation on young (Keller 1991). Other recreational activities such as boat tours (Burnham <em>et al.</em> 2012), as well as scientific research (Bolduc and Guillemette 2003) are also likely to reduce productivity at certain locations (Keller 1991). In winter, unregulated tourism and shipping also cause disturbance to the species, and may prevent access to favoured feeding grounds (Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>Additional threats include predation of breeding females in Europe by the increased population of White-tailed Eagle <em>Haliaeetus albicilla</em> and nest predation by introduced mink <em>Mustela vison</em> (Kats 2007, Ekroos <em>et al.</em> 2012) and in the Americas by introduced foxes <em>Vulpes</em> spp. (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2015). Increasing incidence of nesting in tight association with gull colonies and in less exposed sites, may reflect antipredator responses.</p>  <p>The species may also be sensitive to the effects of climate change, though assessing the impacts on population dynamics is problematic as negative effects (e.g. lower growth in prey leading to reduced food availability [Carboneras <em>et al.</em> 2012]) are confounded by potential positive impacts deriving from earlier arrival on breeding grounds improving breeding success in some areas (D’Alba <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>  Mussel quality, and subsequent eider breeding condition, increases with higher nutrient content of coastal waters (Laursen and Møller 2014) so recent reductions in the level of eutrophication of near-shore waters may have contributed to lower food availability.&#160; Thiamine deficiency has been linked to a lethal paralytic syndrome that has caused mass mortality of Eider ducklings. Unlike Herring Gulls <em>Larus argentatus</em>, Common Eider females will lay eggs even below the critical threshold of thiamine, with resultant rapid mortality in hatchlings (Balk <em>et al.</em> 2009). The extent to which this impacts the population is unknown, and is unlikely to account for the strongly skewed sex ratio observed in the species (Lehikoinen <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, the causes of lethal thiamine deficiency need further investigation as there may be a widespread pollutant present that is currently unidentified. Sand and gravel extraction destroys habitats of benthic organisms, with potential reverberations up the trophic chain. In the Baltic, the impact is thought to be sufficiently low to not cause declines (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011).<p></p>","<p>The global population is estimated to number c. 3,300,000-4,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2012), which equates to 1,580,000-1,910,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;The European population is estimated at 791,000-955,000 pairs.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The breeding range of this species is widely distributed around the mid- to high-latitude coasts of the northern hemisphere, particularly at the higher latitudes. It has a Holarctic distribution, being present in both Eurasia and North America. However, its distribution is not continuous across the Holarctic. There are distinct and persistent gaps in both the central parts of the Russian Arctic and the Canadian Arctic. The distributional gap in Russia (54° longitude) is considerably wider than that in Canada (6° longitude). These gaps can be attributed to the presence of ice all year round at these locations, especially landfast sea ice. At the highest latitudes, the presence of breeding birds is largely limited by the distribution of ice-free conditions during June.</p><p>In winter, the range is more compressed, with migratory northern populations largely wintering within the range of the southerly sedentary populations (Waltho and Coulson 2015). The southern limits of regular wintering ranges are southern Alaska (USA) at 51°N, New Jersey (USA) at 41°N, W France at 44°N and Kuril Islands (Russia) at 50°N (Waltho and Coulson 2015).</p><p>Globally there are six widely recognised subspecies (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Waltho and Coulson 2015), with four in Eurasia: European (<em>S. mollissima mollissima</em>), Faroes (<em>S. m. faeroeensis</em>), Northern (<em>S. m. borealis</em>) and Pacific (<em>S. mollissima v-nigrum</em>). There are four subspecies in North America: Pacific (<em>S. mollissima v-nigra</em>), American (<em>S. m. dresseri</em>), Hudson Bay (<em>S. m. sedentaria</em>), and Northern (<em>S. m. borealis</em>) (Bowman <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>EU Birds Directive Annex II and III.

However the hunting regulations have recently changed and the effect on the population is not yet known.

This rate of decline implies that the global population will undergo at least a ≥30 decline over three generations (1993-2020), even when factoring-in uncertainty regarding the sizes and trends of other populations. Improved knowledge regarding populations outside the Baltic Sea might lead to the species being uplisted to Endangered if the overall rate of decline can be confidently shown to be very rapid.<p></p>","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory although its movements are poorly understood (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. It breeds from late-May onward<strong></strong> in single pairs or loose groups (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, the males leaving the females soon after the start of incubation <strong></strong> (between late-June and early-September) to gather in small flocks for a flightless moulting period (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. Some populations undergo extensive moult migrations of up to 1,000 km, while others moult on waters near the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Females moult between early-August and early-October on the breeding grounds (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, often abandoning their young at the start of the moult which then gather into large parentless groups (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. The southward autumn migration occurs from September to October after the post-breeding moult (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> and non-breeders may oversummer in the wintering areas (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Outside of the breeding season the species is highly gregarious<strong></strong>, in winter gathering into large aggregations of perhaps several tens of thousands of individuals to roost or to feed in inshore and offshore waters (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. The species is diurnal and regularly dives to depths of 3-10 m when foraging, with a maximum dive depth of 50-60 m (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on marshy grass tundra in the high Arctic<strong></strong>, especially where habitat mosaics are formed by hummocks and ridges together with moist depressions<strong></strong>, freshwater lakes<strong></strong>, bogs<strong></strong>, slow rivers<strong></strong> or pools of standing water, it is common among willows or dwarf birch in the arctic-alpine zone (Scandinavia) (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. It generally avoids wooded tundra (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The species also breeds on small rocky islands off mainland Arctic coasts and on larger offshore islands,  using promontories, deltas<strong></strong>, coastal inlets<strong></strong> and islets in fjords (Greenland) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998<em></em>)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>The species winters at sea, generally far offshore<strong></strong> in waters 10-35 m deep<strong></strong>, as well as in saline, brackish or fresh estuarine waters, brackish lagoons <strong></strong>, and inland (very rarely) on large, deep freshwater lakes (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The species shows a preference for marine foods during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>, its diet consisting predominantly of animal matter such as crustaceans (e.g. amphipods and cladocerans<strong></strong>), molluscs, other marine invertebrates (e.g. echinoderms, worms) and fish (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The species also takes freshwater insects and insect larvae ands well as plant material such as algae, grasses, and the seeds and fruits of tundra plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a natural depression on dry ground positioned in the open, amongst vegetation<strong></strong>, partially hidden by overhanging boulders<strong></strong> or under low shrubs (e.g. willows or dwarf birch) usually close to water (Johnsgard 1978, Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Although it is not a colonial species some pairs may nest in loose groups, and the species may also nest in association with Arctic Terns (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","<p>A major decline observed in the wintering population of the Long-tailed Duck in the Baltic Sea coincides with heavy bycatch mortality in gillnet fisheries, with an estimate of at least 90,000 birds (of different species) killed annually (Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2009). This species is highly susceptible to gillnet mortality and is the most frequently recorded victim in the eastern and south eastern Baltic Sea (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011), with annual mortality estimates ranging from 1 to 5% for the total Baltic Sea population (Bellebaum <em>et al.</em> 2013). Age ratios of gillnet victims in the southern Baltic suggest a decline in breeding success of c.75% over the 20th century (J. Bellebaum <em>in litt</em>. 2012). </p>  <p>The effects of chronic oil pollution from small-scale oil discharges in non-breeding areas is a significant threat as Long-tailed Ducks form large aggregations that overlap with major shipping and oil transportation routes. Further expansion of such activity in the northern part of the range is likely to increase the scope of this threat (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Large, catastrophic oil spills still occur, although the frequency of incidence has reduced (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Industrial activity within the breeding range poses a threat through direct mortality from oil pollution (Gorski <em>et al</em>. 1977, Kirby <em>et al.</em> 1993, Y. and O. Mineev <em>in litt.</em> 2012, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017) as well as the degradation and loss of wetland habitat due to petroleum pollution, drainage and peat-extraction (Grishanov 2006). Sand and gravel extraction destroys habitats of benthic organisms, which are key prey items. In the Baltic, these activities are currently occurring at insufficient levels to be responsible for declines in waterbirds (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011). A mortality event in 2006-2007 ascribed to pollution resulted in ‘several thousand’ dead Long-tailed Ducks being washed up along the Hatpudirskaya bay coast (Y. and O. Mineev <em>in litt</em>. 2012). Development of large offshore wind farms could have negative effects on the species, through restricting access to foraging areas and by altering the suitability of benthic habitat.</p>  <p>The species has previously suffered heavy losses from avian cholera outbreaks (Friend 2006) and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Future outbreaks of disease may be expected and may compound observed declines in parts of the range. The introduced Round Goby <em>Neogobius melanostomus</em> has become established in the Baltic where it feeds on benthic invertebrates and could affect food supplies for Long-tailed Ducks, with unknown severity of impact (Almquist <em>et al</em>. 2010, Dagys 2017). The Round Goby appear to considerably reduce mussel density in shallow water (less than 20 m) in the Baltic Sea, and the numbers of Long-tailed Duck in these areas have decreased correspondingly (Hearn <em>et a</em>l. 2015).</p>  <p>The species is still hunted across the majority of its range (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The mortality from hunting has fallen considerably in line with the recorded decline in the species, partly due to reduced numbers of birds available but also as a result of tighter regulation and fewer active hunters (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2015). However, bag size has recently increased in Finland (19,400 birds in 2013), which may reflect greater numbers present during winter (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015). The sustainability of present-day hunting levels is unclear, but these populations are already subject to significant mortality from other threats so require close monitoring. Previous hunting levels cannot be assumed to have been sustainable, and better quantification of additive mortality from all threats is needed to be confident in the size of any harvestable surplus (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  The results of autumn migration monitoring at various Baltic sites show that juveniles now represent a very low proportion of the population (Hario <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ellermaa <em>et al.</em> 2010), indicating that insufficient young are being raised to compensate for adult mortality (low recruitment). This low breeding success has been linked to the collapse of the formerly distinctive 3-4 year cycle of Arctic rodent abundance since the mid-1990s as a consequence of climate change, which may lead to greater rates of predation on alternative prey (Hario 2009, Iles <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, breeding success also appears to have declined in locations where rodents are absent, with poor female condition leading to bypassed breeding (A. Kondratyev <em>in litt.</em> 2012). In addition, ocean acidification may impact mollusc density and quality, further reducing prey availability (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009). More information about the effects of climate change on lower trophic levels is required, but prey density and size is likely to be impacted by changes in sea temperature, and key foraging ecologies may be altered, but there is uncertainty over whether resources are lost or have shifted their distribution.<br/><br/><p></p>","The global population is estimated to number 3,200,000 to 3,750,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2017).",Decreasing,"This species has a circumpolar range, breeding on the Arctic coasts of North America (<strong>Canada</strong>, Alaska, <strong>U.S.A.</strong> and <strong>Greenland</strong>), Europe (<strong>Iceland</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>), and Asia (<strong>Russia</strong>). It winters at sea further south, as far as the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, South Carolina and Washington in the United States, <strong>Korea</strong> on the Asian Pacific coast, and other areas including the Black Sea and Caspian Sea (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). According to monitoring data from the Baltic Sea, where the western Siberian and northern European populations winter, the population there has declined significantly since the early 1990s at least (Hario <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ellermaa <em>et al.</em> 2010, Nilsson and Månsson 2010, Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011). An estimated total of c.4,272,000 individuals was counted there in 1992-1993, falling to c.1,486,000 individuals in 2007-2009, which suggests that a decline of c.65% has occurred over a period of 16 years (Skov <em>et al</em>. 2011). Research on the tundra of eastern European Russia since 1973 suggests that a steep decline may have occurred there (Y. and O. Mineev&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012). There is no evidence to suggest that the geographical distribution of this population has shifted sufficiently to account for this decline (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011, L. Nilsson <em>in litt</em>. 2011, J. Bellebaum i<em>n litt.</em> 2012, M. Ellermaa <em>in litt.</em> 2012), though small increases in wintering numbers have been recorded in Finland. The estimation of a real and severe decline is supported by data from migration bottlenecks in the Gulf of Finland where the numbers observed on migration have fallen dramatically since the early 1990s at least (A. Lehikoinen <em>et al. in litt.</em> 2012).&#160;North America holds the second largest population (c.1 million birds [Wetlands International 2017]). The Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey (WBPHS) indicates large declines from the early 1950s but a relatively stable population since 1989 (Flint 2013); on a shorter time-scale, the population appears to have declined from 1980 to 2002 and then increased from 2007 to 2012 (Bowman <em>et al. </em>2015). Population trends vary among regional surveys; breeding numbers on the Arctic Coastal Plain were stable during 1986-2012 but increasing 2003-2012; on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding numbers were stable during 1988-2012 but decreased during 2003-2012; on western Victoria Island, Northwest Territories, breeding numbers probably decreased from 1992-94 to 2004-05; and on Kodiak Island, Alaska, wintering numbers were stable during 1991-2005 (Raven and Dickson 2006; Zwiefelhofer <em>et al. </em>2008; Stehn <em>et al.</em> 2013; Bowman <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;However, this species is especially poorly monitored because its breeding distribution is largely outside the area covered by breeding waterfowl surveys, and because of its offshore distribution during winter and the lack of comprehensive winter surveys (T. Bowman <em>in litt.</em> 2012).&#160;No trend data are available for the third largest population (c.1,600,000 birds [Wetlands International 2017]), which breeds in western Siberia and winters off eastern Asia. The fourth and smallest population (c.36,000–99,000 birds [Wetlands International 2017]), which breeds in Greenland and Iceland and winters in the north Atlantic, is poorly monitored and trends are uncertain, although it may have been stable until the 1990s (Wetlands International 2017).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Conservation Actions Underway</span><br/>CMS Appendix II.

Chicks fledge between late December and early January. Some pairs skip breeding in certain years (Jahncke 2007, Street 2013).

The estimated bycatch rate of 0.11 birds per 1,000 hooks is sufficient to drive significant declines. Males seem more likely to be killed in longline operations, resulting in a female-skewed sex ratio (1.188 females per male; Awkerman <em>et al.</em> 2007) and indicating that bycatch is likely to be a significant source of adult mortality (Street 2013) and reduced effective population size.</p>  <p>Avian pox was recorded in chicks on Española, which subsequently displayed higher mortality than unaffected chicks, although the outbreak was small and population impacts at present unlikely to be significant (Tompkins <em>et al.</em> 2017).

It breeds primarily along the southern coast of Española Island in the Galápagos Islands, and, perhaps, a few pairs breed on La Plata Island off of Manabí province, Ecuador (Harris 1973). Breeding adults travel to the Peruvian upwelling region to feed (Anderson and Cruz 1998, H. Vargas and F. Cruz <em>in litt.</em> 2000, Awkerman <em>et al</em>. 2014), and in the non-breeding season birds move mainly east and south-east into the waters of the Ecuadorian and Peruvian continental shelf to the extreme north of Chile (Tickell 1996, Anderson and Cruz 1998, BirdLife International 2004, K. Huyvaert <em>pers. comm</em>. 2016). Rarely seen north of the equator, they are occasionally sighted off the coasts of Colombia (at least from El Choco) and Panama (Granizo 2002, Jahncke 2007).&#160;</p><p>On Española, the overall breeding population was considered to have been stable during the 20th Century. It was estimated at c.12,000 pairs in 1970-1971 (Harris 1973), 15,600-18,200 pairs in 1994 (Croxall and Gales 1998, Douglas 1998), and at least 34,694 adults in 2001 (Anderson <em>et al. </em>2002). Although there has not been a global population estimate since 2001, surveys at two principal breeding sites on Española in 2007 demonstrated a decrease in the number of breeding birds since 2001, and an overall population decrease (including non-breeders) at these sites since 1994 (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2008). The breeding distribution has changed owing in part to vegetation regrowth following the eradication of goats (Anderson <em>et al. </em>2002). Breeding no longer occurs at two inland sites, perhaps through redistribution to the coast (Anderson and Cruz 1998, Douglas 1998). On La Plata Island, there are probably fewer than 10-20 pairs (Anderson and Cruz 1998), and long-term data are too limited to assess population trends (Croxall and Gales 1998). In 2001, three adults were seen there with no evidence of breeding and a further 11 non-breeding adults were found on Isla Genovesa (Anderson <em>et al. </em>2002).&#160;</p><p>Recent evidence has shown a 2-3% reduction in annual adult survival compared with that in the 1960s, which is thought to have driven recent dramatic declines in the breeding population (Awkerman <em>et al.</em> 2006, J. Croxall <em>in litt.</em> 2006, Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2008). Analysis of birds caught as intentional and incidental take in inshore fisheries has revealed that a disproportionate number of males are taken, which will result in further decreases to the effective population size given that this species has obligate bi-parental care (Awkerman <em>et al.</em> 2006). Even if immediate action was taken to curb adult mortality the population will continue to decline for a decade or so until the current cohort of juveniles reach breeding age (J. Croxall <em>in litt.</em> 2006). Breeding sites may be constrained by the extent and location of take-off points, which are in turn limited by dense vegetation (Gibbs and Woltz 2010).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong></p><p> Española is part of the Galápagos National Park and Marine Reserve. Industrial, but not artisanal, longlining is prohibited in the Galápagos Marine Reserve (Anderson <em>et al. </em>2003). In 1979, the islands were declared a World Heritage Site. Española is well protected and has no alien fauna (goats having been eradicated in 1978; Anderson and Cruz 1998, Jiménez-Uzcátegui <em>et al.</em> 2007), and tourism is well-regulated (Carboneras 1992). A tortoise breeding programme has led to the release of over 2,000 tortoises on the island in the last 30 years; as the only native herbivore these animals may play a key role in vegetation control and maintaining suitable habitat for breeding albatrosses (Jahncke 2007). La Plata Island is part of Machalilla National Park, but is insufficiently protected (Carboneras 1992). The Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) organised workshops in Peru and Ecuador in 2007 and 2008 to develop an Action Plan for Waved Albatross.

Non-breeding birds spend the breeding season in flocks on open water<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). After breeding (from June onwards [Scott and Rose 1996]) the adults migrate to moulting sites<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(males travelling and moulting before the females)<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988), <strong></strong>where they become flightless for 3-4 weeks<strong></strong>  (Scott and Rose 1996). When moulting and overwintering the species is  highly sociable and can occur in large flocks (Madge and Burn 1988,  Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> of several thousands of individuals<strong></strong> (Scott and Rose 1996), although it is more common in small scattered groups of c.100 individuals<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species mainly forages by diving and may feed at depths of 30-40 m during the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on wooded<strong><sup> </sup></strong>coastlines (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, small freshwater lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, pools and rivers<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998) in northern coniferous forests (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, wooded Arctic tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong> and alpine zones (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>,  especially where there are boulder-covered or small rocky islands  available for nesting with extensive herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and  low trees <strong></strong>(Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> The majority winter at sea on shallow inshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>, especially in estuaries or inlets where there are large mussel-beds<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also occur on freshwater lakes and estuaries during migration<strong> </strong>(Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, as well as crustaceans, worms, echinoderms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), amphipods, isopods<strong></strong> (Kear 2005), small fish, and (in freshwater habitats) adult and larval insects<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species may also consume plant material on its breeding grounds<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. leaves and shoots)<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression positioned on the ground<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in tall grass, among hummocks or under bushes<strong> </strong>(Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), usually within 100 m of open water (occasionally up to 2-3 km away)<strong></strong> (Kear 2005). The species usually nests in solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005),<strong></strong> but it may form loose congregations (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong> (e.g. on islands [Kear 2005]) with neighbouring nests as close as 3 m apart <strong></strong>(Snow and Perrins 1998), and will also nest in association with gull or tern colonies<strong></strong> (Kear 2005).<strong></strong> <p></p>","<p>The species is highly susceptible to bycatch in fishing nets and is likely to be also caught in derelict fishing gear as observed for other scoter species (e.g. Good <em>et al.</em> 2009). The species may also suffer from resource competition with commercial fisheries exploiting marine benthic organisms and shellfish (Kear 2005).  </p><p>Climate change is expected to impact this species in a number of ways. Remote sensing has shown the shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in Siberia which provide important breeding grounds for this species (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration has been linked to declining Scoter populations in North America and this is likely due to trophic mismatch, so may also affect Siberian populations (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Siberian Scoter diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>During moulting and winter aggregations, the species is highly susceptible to oil spills and other marine pollutants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005) and one catastrophic oil spill could potentially destroy a large proportion of the global population if it occurred in a key moulting or wintering area (Madge and Burn 1988). Oil and gas exploration is a pervasive threat in the Arctic and is likely to increase in the future (Poland <em>et al</em>. 2003, Henderson and Loe 2014), with human exploitation of natural resources in the taiga and lower tundra regions of its breeding range causing habitat degradation (Kear 2005). </p>  <p>The footprint of large offshore wind farms may exclude Siberian Scoter from some foraging areas and through disturbance, as it does reduce duck densities more than other seabird groups (Garthe and Hüppop 2004, Stewart <em>et al. </em>2007), however the impact on other scoter species appears minor and the majority of the Siberian Scoter's range does not have any current plans for large-scale wind farms. Collision mortality is also likely to be a minor threat as collisions rates between ducks and wind turbines are low compared with other species groups, which is consistent with their high avoidance rates at offshore wind farms (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). </p>  <p>There is a small risk that future outbreaks of H5N1 (avian influenza) could pose a risk to the species (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is mostly asymptomatic in wild birds and there is no record of significant mortality in this species. </p>  <p></p><strong></strong><p></p>","The global population has been estimated at 600,000-1,000,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006), probably including c.400,000-700,000 mature individuals, on the basis that they account for around 2/3 of the population.",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,,Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It may be susceptible to stochastic events and human activities, although one nesting site is moderately widely separated from the other two. For this reason it is treated as Near Threatened.  <p></p> <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>Shy Albatross breeds annually in colonies. Eggs are mostly laid in the second half of September (Brooke 2004)<strong></strong>. They hatch in December and chicks fledge mostly in April. Immature birds return to their breeding colony at least 3 years after fledging, mostly beginning breeding when at least 5 to 6 years old, nearly always in their natal colonies. <em>Thalassarche cauta</em> usually forage singly and have been observed taking prey from the surface or occasionally making surface plunges or shallow dives. However, a study using time-depth recorders revealed <em>T. cauta</em> commonly plunge-dive within 3 m of the surface and can swim down to over 7 metres (ACAP 2009)<strong></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> Nests are a mound of soil, grass and roots, and are located on rock islands.<em> </em><strong>Diet </strong>The main foods are fish and cephalopods (Hedd and Gales 2001)<strong></strong>, with crustaceans and tunicates also forming a part of the diet. It is a ship-follower and fish discharge comprises a significant proportion of its diet. <p></p>","<p>Incidental mortality in fishing gear is thought to pose the greatest threat to this species. Morphological similarity to White-capped Albatross <em>Thalassarche steadi</em> confounds accurate quantification of bycatch. Yet, the Shy Albatross is considered vulnerable to mortality associated with commercial longlining and trawling (e.g. Baker <em>et al.</em> 2007, Alderman <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2010), even if overlap with White-capped Albatross is accounted for (Abbott <em>et al</em>. 2006, AFMA 2007, Brothers <em>et al</em>. 2010). 'Shy-type' albatrosses, (thought largely to be <em>T. cauta</em>) comprised over 12% of seabirds caught by Japanese tuna longliners in Australian waters during 1989-1995 (up to 900 birds per year) (Gales <em>et al.</em> 1998), Japanese fishing effort ceased in 1997 and the current domestic effort is concentrated in northern waters where the likelihood of encountering albatrosses is much lower (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2007). Juvenile birds from the Mewstone population are known to traverse the Indian Ocean and forage in waters off South Africa, which brings them into contact with several fisheries that pose a greater bycatch threat (Baker <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p>  <p>Threats due to climate change are becoming evident and local environmental conditions (rainfall, air temperature, and sea-surface height) during the chick-rearing stage, have been shown to be significantly correlated with breeding success (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2015). The Pedra Branca colony may be exposed to significant wave action from storms, potentially impacting the species (ACAP 2009) and increased rainfall events have led to reduced reproductive success at Albatross Island and is a suspected cause for decline at the Mewstone colony (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2015). While recent climate models predict little change in future local average rainfall, increases are forecast in both temperature and upwelling, with detrimental and beneficial effects respectively on breeding success (Thompson <em>et al</em>. 2015). An estimated 50% reduction in bycatch would be required to offset the negative impact of temperature increases, even in the scenario of increased upwelling (Thompson <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>Poor competitive abilities for nesting space against Australasian Gannet <em>Morus serrator</em> appears to be reducing reproductive success on Pedra Branca by approximately 9% per year between 1993 and 2007 (ACAP 2009). This is thought to be the primary cause of the observed local rapid declines in the number of chicks produced each year and likely contributed to the number of breeding pairs on Pedra Branca declining from about 350 in 2005 to about 140 in 2015 (ACAP 2016 unpublished data). Australian Gannets appear to be increasing in abundance and extent (Alderman <em>et al.</em> 2011) and may pose an increasing threat.</p>  <p>Avian pox virus has been recorded in chicks on Albatross Island and has the potential to impact population trends through negative impacts to breeding success (R. Woods and R. Gales <em>in litt</em>. 2008).</p>  <strong><sup> </sup></strong> <p></p>","The global population of Shy Albatross was estimated to be 12,000 to 19,000 pairs in 2009 (Alderman <em>et al</em>. 2011). Data submitted to ACAP estimated a total population of 15,350 pairs, made up of 5,200 pairs on Albatross Island (in 2010) (Alderman <em>et al.</em> 2011), 7,600-12,400 pairs on Mewstone (in 2005) (Alderman <em>et al.</em> 2011), and 130-170 pairs on Pedra Branca (in 2009) (Alderman <em>et al.</em> 2011). The number of mature individuals is therefore estimated at c.30,700.

Data submitted to ACAP estimated the total breeding population to be approximately 15,350 breeding pairs, with the largest colonies being Albatross Island (5,200 pairs), Pedra Branca (130-170 pairs) and the Mewstone (7,600-12,400 pairs). <em>T</em>. <em>cauta</em> was historically killed for the feather trade and the Albatross Island population was reduced to c.300 pairs in 1909  (Johnstone <em>et al.</em> 1975, Brooke 2004)<strong></strong>. Since then, the population on Albatross Island has been slowly recovering (Brooke 2004)<strong></strong>, reaching approximately 25% of the pre-exploited population in 2004 (ACAP Species Assessment draft)<strong></strong>. The historical population size and trend of Mewstone and Pedra Branca are unknown. The population on Pedra Branca may have always been small but it appears competition for nesting space with Australasian Gannets <em>Morus serrator</em> may steadily be reducing the number of fledglings produced on the island each year. Chick production on Pedra Branca dropped from over 100 to 31 between 1993 and 2007, representing a decrease of approximately 9% a year (ACAP 2009)<strong></strong>. Understanding the at-sea distribution of <em>T. cauta</em> is confounded by its similar appearance to other 'shy-type' albatrosses, particularly <em>T. steadi </em>(Double <em>et al. </em>2003, ACAP 2011)<strong></strong><em>.</em> During the breeding season, adults are relatively sedentary and are concentrated around Tasmania and southern Australia (Garnett and Crowley 2000, <strong></strong>Hedd <em>et al. </em>2001, BirdLife International 2004, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>.

The effects of climate change and more frequent and/or severe ENSO events could have potentially catastrophic impacts on the species in the future (Vargas 2006, Wiedenfeld and Jiménez-Uzcátegui 2008, J.

Dogs <em>Canis familiaris&#160;</em>were eradicated in 1981-82 (Calvopiña 1982 <em>in </em>Valle 1986). However, the likelihood of permanently eliminating all dogs from Isabela is considered to be low, because they are still present on the volcanoes Cerro Azul and Sierra Negra as well as on farms outside the national park boundaries. The risk of future invasions into nesting areas is high because of easy access along the coast (Valle 1986). Other introduced predators (rats <em>Rattus</em> spp., cats <em>Felis catus</em>) remain on several islands and pose a current threat to the species. Negative serologic findings suggest that the species is immunologically naive and may have a reduced capacity to cope with the introduction of novel pathogens (Travis <em>et al.</em> 2006), yet no severe disease outbreaks have been reported in the species as yet. The protozoan parasite <em>Toxoplasma</em> has been considered a threat, but although antibodies were found in birds sampled on both Fernandina and Isabela Island, no direct negative impacts have been noted (Deem <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p>Previous fishing activity on the Galápagos Islands was modest, but has now become an illegal industry, serving markets worldwide, evinced by the occasional uncovering of large illegal harvests (Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2005). The increase in illegal fishing activities around Fernandina and Isabela (H. Vargas and F. Cruz <em>in litt</em>. 2000, Wiedenfeld and Jiménez-Uzcátegui 2008) is likely to have detrimental side-effects (bycatch and injury from entanglement, competition for prey, disturbance) on resident seabird populations.</p>  <p>Human disturbance from tourism to the Galápagos Islands is regulated (capped at 120,000 visitors per annum) but annual visits of about 100,000 tourists may still be a contributory factor to other threats (Boersma <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>Oil spills could have potentially catastrophic effects on the species as its foraging behaviour includes repeated diving and surfacing, which makes it particularly vulnerable to oiling. Oil spills have occurred in the vicinity of the population in the past (e.g. Jessica oil spill) and pose a severe future threat.</p>  <p>Although the species has proven capable of recovering from disastrous events in the past, further environmental changes and fluctuations will continue to be a threat, and may also be increasing in intensity.</p><p></p>","In 1971-1972, the population was estimated at 800 breeding pairs (Harris 1973).  Between 1977 and 1985, it remained stable at around 650 to  850 mature individuals (Harris 1973, Valle 1986, Valle and Coulter 1987). However,  during the severe El Niño event in 1983, the population declined drastically to 400 individuals, but recovered within a season (Valle and Coulter 1987). In 1986, the population was estimated at 1,000 mature individuals (Rosenberg <em>et al.</em> 1990).

136250858,9404,Gorilla gorilla,Critically Endangered,A4bcde,2018,2016-04-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Gorilla gorilla</em> has a large geographic range, covering over 700,000 km². The size of the population in 2013 was estimated to be almost 362,000 individuals&#160; (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). Only a very small number of Western Gorillas are the <em>G. g. diehli</em> subspecies, therefore this rationale focuses on the <em>G. g. gorilla</em> subspecies. The country of Gabon lost over half its Gorilla population between 1983 and 2000 (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2003). More recent population declines have been estimated using a predictive model that incorporated survey data collected between 2003 and 2013 across the entire range of Western Lowland Gorillas. The results reveal an 19.4% decline between 2005 and 2013, corresponding to an annual loss of ~2.7% (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). These population decreases were driven by poaching and disease (<em>Ebolavirus</em>) outbreaks.<br/><br/>Despite their abundance and wide geographic range, Western Gorillas qualify as Critically Endangered under criterion A: a population reduction of more than 80% over three generations (one generation is ~22 years). This listing is based on ongoing population losses due to illegal hunting, disease and habitat loss: poaching is intensifying with the expansion of access routes into forests and Zaire <em>Ebolavirus</em> remains a highly significant threat. At a conservative rate of reduction (2.7% per year rather than 4%, calculated from Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2003), the reduction in the Western Gorilla population is predicted to exceed 80% over three generations (i.e., 66 years, 2005–2071). Illegal hunting has not ceased despite intense anti-poaching efforts, and the threat of <em>Ebolavirus</em> has not been removed. In addition, the scale of habitat conversion to industrial agriculture will increase, and the effects of climate change will become more evident. <em>Gorilla gorilla</em> thus qualifies as Critically Endangered (A4bcde).","Western Gorillas are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. They build nests to sleep in every night, usually on the ground but sometimes in trees. They are social and live in stable, cohesive groups composed of one “silverback” adult male, several adult females and their offspring. Gorillas are not territorial and group ranges overlap extensively.<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. diehli</em></strong><br/>Cross River Gorillas inhabit forests largely restricted to rough terrain in remote areas, although they occasionally use lowland areas between hills (Oates <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bergl and Vigilant 2007). This distribution appears to be directly related to greater levels of human activity (especially poaching) in lowland areas, rather than selection of areas that provide preferred foods (Imong <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sawyer and Brashares 2013). Group sizes range from 2 to 20 individuals and home ranges may be as large as 30 km² (McFarland 2007, Sunderland-Groves <em>et al</em>. 2009). The highly-seasonal nature of the Cross River Gorillas’ habitat (more markedly seasonal than that of other Gorilla populations) likely contributes to grouping and ranging patterns. Their diet reflects this seasonality, with terrestrial herbs and bark eaten as staples throughout the year, and fruit consumed during periods of seasonal abundance (McFarland 2007, De Vere <em>et al</em>. 2011, Etiendem and Tagg 2013, Sawyer and Brashares 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. gorilla</em></strong><br/>Western Lowland Gorillas occur in both swamp and <em>terra firma</em> lowland forests throughout Western Equatorial Africa. They are especially common where ground vegetation is dominated by monocotyledonous plants such as <em>Haumania liebrechtsiana</em> and <em>Megaphrynium macrostachyum</em> (Rainey <em>et al</em>. 2009). Staple and fallback foods are pith of <em>Aframomum</em> spp. and leaves and shoots of the Marantaceae family, whereas fruit consumption varies greatly between seasons (Rogers <em>et al</em>. 2004). Some populations spend hours feeding on aquatic herbs in baïs and swamps. Social ants and termites are the only animal matter deliberately ingested. Group size averages 10, but is occasionally over 20 individuals, and annual home ranges are usually 10–25 km² (Williamson and Butynski 2013).<br/><br/>Life History (as summarised in Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013): Male Western Gorillas take 18 years to reach full maturity, and females take <em>ca</em>10 years. Length of the reproductive cycle is unknown. There is no birth season. Mean length of gestation is 256 days in captive Gorillas. Infant mortality up to three years of age is 22–65%. Infants suckle for 4–5 years, causing lactational amenorrhea in the mother. Interbirth intervals are 4–6 years. Western Gorillas appear to reproduce more slowly than Eastern Gorillas (<em>G. beringei</em>). Maximum life span is unknown, but likely to be <em>ca</em> 40 years. Generation time is estimated to be 22 years (see Appendix I in the supplementary material).","The two subspecies of Western Gorilla face similar threats, but to varying degrees in different regions.<br/><br/><ol><li><strong><u>Poaching</u></strong> - Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, hunting for bushmeat is the primary driver of Western Gorilla decline. Current offtake levels are unsustainable – even legally-protected areas suffer high levels of poaching. The remaining population of Cross River Gorillas is small and fragmented, which puts each subpopulation at particular risk from poaching. While Gorillas do not generally appear to be targeted by hunters, it is estimated that opportunistic hunting removes at least 1–3 Cross River Gorillas from the population each year. Additionally, snares targeting other species may trap Gorillas, causing injury or death. Until the mid-1990s, much of the Western Lowland Gorilla’s range included vast, roadless blocks of forest that were extremely difficult to access, where human population densities were very low and Gorilla densities high. In the last quarter century, however, almost all unprotected terra firma forest in this region has been allocated as logging concessions (Global Forest Watch 2016). This means that much of the once-remote, inaccessible forest is now covered by a network of logging roads (Laporte <em>et al</em>. 2007), which gives easy access to both hunters entering the forest and traffickers taking consignments of bushmeat (and ivory) out of the forest to distant destinations – often towns and cities where meat fetches high prices. Throughout Central Africa, mining permits for prospecting or resource extraction are being issued over an increasingly large surface area. As well as direct removal of Gorilla habitat, depending on the type of extraction, mining leads to very high rates of human immigration and the creation of yet more access roads, which are used for poaching (e.g., Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014). The region’s governance is typically poor (Transparency International 2016); the weak law enforcement and corruption that enable poaching are evident in ivory trafficking (Bennett 2014), but also widespread elsewhere (Bour <em>et al</em>. 2013). In addition, huge road projects that will substantially fragment Gorilla habitat are currently underway (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). The ease and speed of transport is now orders of magnitude higher than before the creation of such access roads, and hunting pressures are much higher. Across their range, Gorilla densities are lowest near roads, except where forest guards operate control points or roadblocks (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). In addition, human populations in these once remote areas have grown, as people migrate to the employment opportunities offered by logging companies (Wilkie <em>et al</em>. 2000, Poulsen <em>et al</em>. 2009).</li><li><u><strong>Disease</strong></u> - The second major driver of Western Lowland Gorilla decline is infectious disease, specifically Ebola virus disease (EVD). Surveys carried out from the 1980s to the present day show that there were a series of massive great ape die-offs in a large, mostly-intact forested area straddling the border between northeastern Gabon and northwestern Congo, which includes several national parks and logging concessions (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2003; Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2013). Walsh <em>et al</em>. (2008) estimated that three quarters of Western Lowland Gorillas in six protected areas affected by <em>Ebolavirus</em> were lost between 1995 and 2000. Typical mortality rate during the worst disease outbreaks was 95% (Bermejo <em>et al</em>. 2006, Caillaud <em>et al</em>. 2006). In protected areas, populations hit by disease began to recover within a decade (e.g., Genton <em>et al</em>. 2012); however, total recovery would take 75–131 years in the absence of poaching, which is an unlikely scenario (Ryan and Walsh 2011). Ebola virus has already been detected to the east of the Mambili River, a major river barrier between Odzala-Kokoua National Park and the Sangha River (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2014). Although rivers and forest fragmentation seem to present a partial barrier to the spread of Ebola, large numbers of Gorillas could be wiped out in a short space of time, as transmission between individuals is rapid and large areas can be affected by a single outbreak (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2009). The small size of the Cross River population means it is also highly vulnerable to infectious disease. <em>Ebolavirus</em> has not been reported in the Cross River Gorillas, but their close proximity to dense human populations and livestock heightens the risks of disease transmission (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2014).</li><li><strong><u>Habitat degradation and destruction</u></strong> - Habitat loss is emerging as a major threat to Western Gorillas. As oil-palm plantations in Asia reach capacity, Africa is becoming the new frontier for this crop, offering excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperatures (Rival and Lavang 2014). Unfortunately, such areas coincide with good Gorilla habitat: 73.8% of the Western Lowland Gorilla’s range is considered suitable for oil palm (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014). The recent expansion of industrial-scale mineral extraction and the creation of open-pit mines are of great concern (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lanjouw 2014), and also lead to the establishment of development corridors, which can be several kilometres wide and add to areas of “lost forest” (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). There is a disconnect between the various bodies responsible for land-use planning in the realms of conservation, mining and agriculture in all Western Gorilla range states except Gabon. Consequently, there is increasing competition for land between long-term conservation needs and immediate financial gain as governments explore the potential of clearing natural habitat in favour of economic development. Without careful and immediate land-use planning that involves cooperation between the government bodies responsible for protected areas and wildlife on one hand, and economic and agricultural development on the other, large areas of Western Lowland Gorilla habitat could be cleared within a few decades. The lack of effective protected area management throughout much of the Cross River Gorilla’s range combined with the lack of protected status for much of the Gorillas’ habitat in Cameroon, threatens the future availability of habitat suitable for the population. Conversion of forest for agriculture and grazing is occurring rapidly in many parts of the Gorillas’ range and the largest protected areas in which Cross River Gorillas occur contain enclaves of human settlements whose farmlands have spread beyond their legal boundaries. Expansion of these settlements and associated development of access routes in the form of roads and bridges inside the protected areas exacerbate subdivision of the Cross River Gorilla population. In both Cameroon and Nigeria, the construction and improvement of roads outside protected areas also threatens to increase subdivision of Gorilla populations through habitat disturbance and intensification of forest resource extraction. Increasing access will also exacerbate poaching pressure. While most habitat loss in the region is the result of small-scale agriculture, commercial logging and industrial agriculture (e.g., for oil palm) are also impending threats.</li><li><strong><u>Climate change</u></strong> - Climate change will affect both subspecies of Western Gorilla, as it is already thought to be affecting the Central African tropical moist forests (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although the likely impacts of global climate change are not yet known, some predictions suggest a drying of this region with potentially negative consequences for forest ecology, such as changes in fruit and flower phenology, forest productivity and increased vulnerability to fire, and even forest retreat (James et al. 2013). Seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature, and weather extremes are likely ongoing and set to continue (Lovett 2015). Negative impacts on great apes have already been predicted (Lehmann <em>et al</em>. 2010), particularly along the coast (Korstjens <em>et al</em>. 2010). Climate change is the least likely factor for which effective action for great apes and for African tropical forests in general can be taken in a timely manner. Climate talks in 2015 resulted in international cooperative agreement between most of the world’s nations regarding the need for action; however, the task of reversing, or even flattening current temperature trends will be extremely challenging.</li><li>For more details, see the two <em>Gorilla gorilla</em> subspecies assessments.</li></ol>","Estimates of Gorilla population size are usually made using a standard index of abundance: night nest abundance and distribution, sometimes combined with predictive modelling.<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. diehli<br/></em></strong>Intensive surveys carried out in 1990–2005 suggested that approximately 250–300 Cross River Gorillas persist in a forested area of roughly 12,000 km² (Bergl 2006, Oates <em>et al</em>. 2007). Monitoring of the Gorillas at multiple sites and genetic analysis at select locations (Arandjelovic <em>et al</em>. 2015) has confirmed the small size of the subspecies population, while also documenting a larger geographic range than previously recorded (Bergl <em>et al</em>. 2012, Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2014). Cross River Gorillas occur in at least geographically distinct 11 localities (<em>ibid</em>.) Genetic evidence suggests that these subpopulations have had reproductive contact in the recent past (Bergl and Vigilant 2007); however, field surveys paired with remote sensing analysis reveal that forest corridors connecting subpopulations may no longer be functional as routes for dispersal (Imong <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>G. g. gorilla</em></strong><br/>Western Lowland Gorillas are found in almost all protected areas and many of the logging concessions in their range; they can persist at high densities in well-managed logging concessions (Morgan <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160; Strindberg <em>et al</em>. (2018) produced the first range-wide estimate for the subspecies, giving a total population in 2013 of 361,919 (302,973-460,093). Their numbers declined by 19.4% between 2005 and 2013, corresponding to an annual loss of approximately 2.7% (<em>ibid</em>.). By the end of 2018, numbers will decline by a further 13.5% to roughly 316,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gorilla gorilla</em> is found in Angola (Cabinda enclave), Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni), Gabon, Nigeria and Republic of Congo. Until recently, the core population had an almost continuous distribution from southern CAR to the Congo River and west to the coast. Rivers are the primary geographic barrier for this taxon, followed by habitat fragmentation: the two subspecies are separated by a major river (the Sanaga), and Western Lowland Gorillas are divided into subpopulations by other major rivers in the region (Anthony <em>et al</em>. 2007, Fünfstück <em>et al</em>. 2014, Fünfstück and Vigilant 2015).<br/><br/>The northwestern limit of the western lowland subspecies distribution is the Sanaga River in Cameroon; the northern limit is the forest-savanna boundary to a maximum of roughly 6°N; the eastern limit is the Ubangi River; the Congo River south of its confluence with the Ubangi then becomes the southeastern and southern limits all the way to the coast. Small outlying populations of the Cross River subspecies remain on the Nigeria-Cameroon border at the headwaters of the Cross River and in the proposed Ebo National Park in Cameroon. Most Western Gorillas are found below 500 m asl, but those living on mountains occasionally reach elevations of 1,900 m asl.","<p>Gorillas are completely protected by national and international laws in all countries of their range, and it is, therefore, illegal to kill, capture or trade in live Gorillas or their body parts.<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"National and international laws controlling hunting or capture of Gorillas exist in all habitat countries, but enforcement of protective legislation is inconsistent or lacking throughout much of the species’ range. <em>Gorilla gorilla</em> is listed under Appendix I of CITES and in Class A of the African Convention.<br/><br/>Only ~22% of Western Lowland Gorillas live inside protected areas, which cover ~14% of their geographic range (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). A further 20% are found in FSC-certified logging concessions, adding up to 8% of the range (Strindberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although forest guards work in many protected areas and in the well-managed logging concessions, 58% of Western Lowland Gorillas and 77% of their range are unprotected and highly vulnerable to poachers.<br/><br/>The Cross River Gorilla population is small and fragmented and their habitat is surrounded by some of the most densely populated human settlements in Africa. Approximately 30% of Cross River Gorillas occur outside of protected areas and many important habitat corridors between subpopulations exist as ungazetted land. The recent creation of new protected areas in Cameroon combined with existing protected areas in Nigeria, provides the legal framework for habitat protection and the control of hunting. However, effective management of these reserves remains a challenge. Illegal activities, including poaching, occur in all the region’s protected areas. Resources, equipment and training, in addition to proper oversight are needed for these areas to operate effectively.<br/><br/>Targeted conservation action plans have been produced for both Cross River Gorillas (Oates <em>et al</em>. 2007, Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Western Lowland Gorillas (Tutin <em>et al</em>. 2005, IUCN 2014). A series of recommendations have been outlined, which can be broadly encapsulated as:<br/><ol><li>An increase in effective law enforcement throughout the region, not only in protected areas, but also in logging concessions and unprotected forests. Law enforcement needs to be supported by updated regulations and sanctions.</li><li>Effective, coordinated land-use planning to avoid the clearing of intact Gorilla habitat to establish industrial plantations, for oil palm in particular (IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014). Industrial extraction of other natural resources, namely timber and minerals, should be included in a holistic, spatially-explicit approach. Such planning needs to be done at both national and regional levels. Several of the most important areas for Gorilla conservation are transboundary, and thus fall within the remit of national agencies from two or three countries.</li><li>Awareness raising among all sectors that deal with land and the protection of natural resources: law enforcement and judiciary; protected area authorities; mining, logging and agricultural industries; local communities and tour operators. This outreach effort should include specific information on minimising human impacts, such as preventing transmission of human diseases to great apes.

A standardised tool for law enforcement monitoring (SMART: <a href=""http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org"">http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org</a>) is already in use at many sites; standard methods for surveying and monitoring great ape populations that facilitate more accurate and precise monitoring of changes in abundance have been in use for about a decade (Kühl <em>et al</em>. 2008 <a href=""http://www.primate-sg.org/best_practice_surveys"">http://www.primate-sg.org/best_practice_surveys</a>); and non-invasive diagnosis of a range of pathogens is now possible, for example, detection of <em>Ebolavirus</em> in faeces (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2014).</li><li>Specifically for Cross River Gorillas, the key conservation need for their long-term survival is allowing the population to expand. Since significant areas of unoccupied Gorilla habitat remain across the landscape, population growth is feasible if levels of hunting and other human activities can be reduced. Maintenance (or re-establishment) of habitat connectivity between areas currently occupied by Gorillas is essential for future population expansion.</li></ol>Maintaining well-protected areas of forest will be key to maintaining Gorilla populations in the long term, and this can only be done through the conservation strategies detailed in the action plans.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is a full migrant, migrating on a broad front overland across the full width of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Adults leave their young in July before they are fully fledged and migrate south to the wintering grounds; juveniles then leave the breeding grounds in early-August (Snow and Perrins 1998). Some individuals also winter in Europe as far north as Britain, breeding between late-May and early-July on returning to the breeding range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).  The species feeds singly or in groups of up to 30 individuals and migrates singly or in small parties, although between 100 and 250 individuals have been encountered at some European staging sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> This species breeds in arctic tundra, shrub tundra and forest tundra along flood-plains, although it avoids extremely cold conditions and exposed coasts (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is mainly found near coastal inlets, fjords, deltas, rivers or streams from sea level to 250 m, but also occurs up to 1,200 m inland on flat, clear ground with little vegetation, areas covered with short grass and interspersed with patches of scrub, areas with grasses, sedges or <em>Empetrum</em>, and scrub willow or birch thickets with sandy or gravelly stretches (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Both dry and wet areas are used, but habitats with elevated locations such as boulders or buildings are preferred because of their use as song perches (Johnsgard 1981). In Scandinavia the species also breeds near fishing huts and houses, and in industrial workings (Ronka 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species inhabits inland freshwater wetlands such as flood-lands, irrigated fields, sewage farms, densely vegetated wetlands, ditches, muddy marshes and lake edges, and on the coast shows a strong preference for mudflats in sheltered inlets, estuaries and saltmarshes, whilst tending to avoid open and sandy beaches (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> On the breeding grounds and in inland habitats the diet of this species consists primarily of insects and their larvae (especially beetles and Diptera such as craneflies and midges), as well as the occasional plant matter (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). On the coasts the species takes annelids, crustaceans (such as sand fleas) and small molluscs (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow cup on the ground in the open or amongst low vegetation, often at the base of small willows, junipers or other shrubs (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).","This species is threatened by nest predation (Koivula and Ronka 1998, Ronka <em>et al.</em> 2006) from Common Gull <em>Larus canus</em> and Ruddy Turnstone <em>Arenaria interpres</em> (Ronka <em>et al.</em> 2006), as well as from Hooded Crow <em>Corvus corone cornix</em>, weasel <em>Mustela nivalis</em>, American mink <em>Mustela vison</em> and fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> in Finland (Ronka 1996). It is also threatened in its Scandinavian breeding range by shrinkage and deterioration of suitable habitats (due to eutrophication and the overgrazing of shore meadows), and by increased human recreational disturbance due to the building up of breeding sites (trampling and disturbance often lead to increased hatchling predation and abandonment of nests) (Ronka 1996). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza and may therefore be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global population is estimated to number c.165,000-1,255,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). This roughly equates to 110,000-850,000 mature individuals.

It arrives on the breeding grounds from March<strong><sup> </sup></strong>where it breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups<strong></strong> in the northern spring (chiefly from mid-April to June) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Males undergo a post-breeding moult migration from early-May to early-June (females moulting one month later) during which they are flightless for 3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The autumn migration chiefly occurs between September and October (western Europe), during which the species is likely to travel on a broad front (e.g. across Arabia and into Africa) (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The species is usually found in pairs or small parties, although it often congregates when feeding (flocks of  20 or 30 to several hundred individuals occur in favoured areas in Africa <strong></strong>and large concentrations form at stop-over sites on migration) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The species forages diurnally and roosts communally at night (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits permanent<strong></strong> shallow freshwater wetlands<strong></strong> from sea level up to 2,900 m (Ethiopia)<strong></strong>, preferred sites being those surrounded by dense stands of reeds or other emergent vegetation whilst being free of overhanging trees or fringing forest (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. Copious submerged aquatic vegetation sheltering abundant planktonic invertebrates is a valuable habitat characteristic (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. Suitable habitats include well-vegetated lakes and marshes and with muddy shores and substrates in open country (e.g. grasslands), as well as oxbow lakes, channels and swamps (former U.S.S.R.) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. It also frequents artificial waters bordered by lush grassland such as sewage farms, rice-fields and fish ponds (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005, Musil 2006)<strong></strong>. In the winter it can be found on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal muflats<strong></strong><strong></strong>, estuaries, coastal shorelines, fresh and brackish estuarine marshes, inland seas and brackish or saline inland waters<strong></strong>, occasionally occurring (briefly) on marine waters during migration (although it generally avoids very saline habitats) (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists of small aquatic invertebrates such as adult and larval insects (e.g. caddisfly larvae, damselfly and dragonfly nymphs, adult beetles, bugs <strong></strong>and flies), molluscs, planktonic crustaceans<strong></strong>, the seeds of emergent and aquatic plants (e.g. bulrushes and waterweeds)<strong></strong>, annelids, amphibian spawn, tadpoles, spiders, fish and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (e.g. duckweeds) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a scrape<strong></strong> or depression on the ground in tall grass, among hummocks, in the open<strong></strong> or (rarely) in bulrush marshes (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. Usually the species nests close to water but if grass cover is unavailable in the wetland site it may also nest far away from water under bushes<strong></strong>, in hayfields or in meadows<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Kear 2005). Although it is not a colonial species, several pairs may nest in close proximity (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Management information </strong>A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg/ha, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp), and systems that include ponds with fish fry (to provide areas with low fish competition and high invertebrate availability) are more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006)<strong></strong>.

It is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet <em>et al.</em> 2007) and avian botulism (Forrester <em>et al.</em> 1980),<strong></strong> so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. The species may suffer from reproductive impairment as a result of selenium accumulation in liver tissues (selenium contained in sub-surface agricultural drain-water used for wetland management in California led to bioaccumulation of the element in the food chain) (Paveglio <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>.

It is reported that the total population on Mauritius contains around 450 mature individuals. The Echo Parakeet is therefore listed as Vulnerable under Criterion D1.<p></p>","This species now survives in forest and upland scrub (Marshall 1997)<strong></strong>, with lowland, intermediate and scrub forests being very important feeding areas (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>. It appears to be a strictly arboreal forager, feeding mainly on native plants and taking a wide range of parts including buds, young shoots, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, twigs and even bark and sap (Jones 1987, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. They return to favoured food trees, some of which have been used for generations (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Birds forage singly or in small groups in different areas at different seasons and are known to travel several kilometers to and from feeding areas in search of food, although the dwarf forest and scrublands of the south-west plateau are an important foraging area throughout the year (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>. Nesting takes place in natural cavities in native trees (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. It is monogamous, but breeding units in the 1970s and 1980s often comprised a group of one female with up to three males, one of which was dominant and mated with and fed the female (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The presence of extra males was probably the result of a formerly skewed sex ratio; pairs are usually hostile to extra males, who seem to have no positive effect on fledging success, which is probably related to the experience of the dominant male (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is 1-4 (but normally 2-3) eggs, which are laid from September-December (Thorsen and Jones 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span><strong></strong> Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>, and incubation, by the female, lasts 21-25 days (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The population currently experiences high rates of egg fertility (84%), high hatchability of fertile eggs (82%) and fledging success of hatched young (76%) (Jones<em> et al</em>. 2013). One to two chicks are usually fledged, though up to four have been recorded (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998, 2013)<strong></strong> from the end of October to the beginning of February or later, and fledgling parakeets are reputed to stay with their parents, being fed by them for at least 2-3 months after leaving the nest (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>.&#160;<p></p>","This species's earlier decline and contracting distribution corresponds to the severe destruction and degradation of its native habitat (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The population crashed from a likely total of several thousand following forest destruction and the replacement of its favoured feeding habitat, upland dwarf forest, with plantations (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. In 1996, only 5% of the island was covered with native vegetation (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The areas of upland native forest that remain continue to be highly degraded by cyclones, the influences of past forestry practices, the spread of introduced plants such as guava <em>Psidium cattleianum</em>, privet <em>Ligustrum robustum</em> and jamrosa <em>Syzygium jambos</em> and the effect of introduced feral mammals such as pigs <em>Sus scrofa</em> and rusa deer <em>Rusa timorensis</em> (Greenwood 1996<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span> Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The production of native fruit, on which the parakeet feeds, and regeneration of potential nest trees is thus poor (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. Recent research suggests that food shortage due to deterioration of the native forest is the major cause of nest failure; although exotics can provide an abundant food source it is not available year-round or even throughout the breeding season (Thorsen and Jones 1998)<strong></strong>. Crab-eating macaques <em>Macaca fascicularis</em> and black rats <em>Rattus rattus</em> are amongst a number of introduced arboreal species which pose a threat to parakeets by raiding nests and competing for native fruits (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong>. Bees <em>Apis mellifera</em>, yellow wasps <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Polistes hebraeus</span>, paper wasps, termites,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>White-tailed Tropicbirds <em>Phaethon lepturus</em>, introduced Common Mynas <em>Acridotheres tristis</em> and Ring-necked Parakeets <em>Psittacula krameri</em> are all nest site competitors and can displace active breeding pairs (Thorsen and Jones 1998<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span><strong></strong> C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000, V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. The decline in the number of old native trees, which are lost to storm damage and senescence, has intensified competition for nesting cavities, with 14-19% of <em>P. eques</em> cavities lost to competitors each year (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Infestations of nest fly larvae can be severe in some years and, without intervention, would kill many young (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Despite the rapid outbreak of a novel genotype of the virus that causes Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) in the 2004/2005 season (Kundu&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), the impact of the disease on the population appears to have been thus far negligible, limited to a brief reduction in hatching success (Tollington&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).<p></p>","At the end of the 2016/2017 breeding season, the population was estimated at c.756 birds. The number of mature individuals in the 2018/2019 breeding season was estimated as approximately 450 individuals (S. Henshaw and V.

Tatayah and S. Henshaw <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The species’s decline and contracting distribution was likely caused by the severe and large-scale destruction and degradation of its forest habitat for conversion into plantations (Jones 1987, Greenwood 1996, Jones<em> et al.</em> 1998).&#160;<br/><br/>Since then, intense conservation efforts have aided the continuous recovery of the species (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013). By now, the largest part of the population is confined to restricted areas of the Black River Gorges National Park (6,800 ha) in southwestern Mauritius. Reintroductions of captive-bred birds there ceased in 2005/2006 (C. Jones <em>in litt</em>. 2019), following the outbreak of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD). Currently, two additional populations are being established in other parts of Mauritius: between 2015 and 2017, wild-born individuals were translocated to the Bambous Mountains on the East Coast of the island, where breeding could be confirmed in 2018, and this population is deemed self-sustaining (V. Tatayah, S. Henshaw and C. Jones <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Another translocation programme started in early 2018 to establish a population in Chamarel in the south-west; however this population has not been breeding yet (V. Tatayah and S. Henshaw <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Translocations to both Bambous and Chamarel are planned to continue in the next few years to reinforce the population (V. Tatayah <em>in litt</em>. 2019).<strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">&#160;</strong><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>The species has been the subject of a conservation programme since 1973 (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. The dramatic increase in the species's population in recent years is undoubtedly due to an intensive programme to manage the wild population combined with a highly successful captive breeding programme since the 1993/1994 breeding season (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong> - a collaborative effort of  the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, the World Parrot Trust, the Mauritian Government and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust Society (Greenwood 1996)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Between 1997 and 2004, when reintroductions were completed, a total of 139 captive reared birds were released (Jones 2010). Clutch and brood manipulations of wild nests were carried out between 1994 and 2005 to increase productivity and obtain individuals for captive breeding (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2013). The intensity of conservation management was reduced in 2005 to reduce the risk of the spread of Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2013). Current conservation management measures are more hands-off and directed towards maximising wild survival and recruitment (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Nest cavity improvement is carried out to address a shortage in the availability of quality natural breeding sites. This involves modifications to protect against weather, competitors, and predators (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Nest parasites (nest flies and mites) are controlled via the addition of pesticide-treated substrate. Artificial nest boxes were first used for breeding in 2000, with uptake steadily increasing since. The majority of breeding pairs nested in artificial nest boxes in the 2010/2011 breeding season, and productivity was higher at these sites compared with natural cavities (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). Supplementary feeding in the form of commercially produced parrot pellets was provided consistently since 1997, and as of the 2010/2011 season was consumed by over 50% of the population. Consumption of supplementary food is associated with the production of larger clutches, more eggs hatched per clutch, and more individuals fledged per brood (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Habitat management has been directed at increasing the productivity of native forest and has included the foundation in 1993 of the Black River National Park in 6,574 ha of native forest (Jones and Hartley 1995, Greenwood 1996), including most of the species's remaining habitat (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. There are 14 Conservation Management Areas (CMAs), ranging from 0.2 to 24 ha, in which native forest is manually cleared of weeds (Jones <em>et al. </em>1998)<strong></strong>. Some of these CMAs are heavily utilised by the species as their trees produce bumper crops (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>.&#160;Research has occurred on present and historic genetic variation of the species so that the effects of the population bottleneck can be quantified and current populations managed to preserve maximum genetic diversity (Tollington <em>et al. </em>2013)<strong></strong>. Research into the impact of PBFD is likely to be ongoing for several years (Malham 2007), and has involved intensive screening of birds since 2005 (Richards 2010, V. Tatayah <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012)<strong></strong>. Despite the rapid outbreak of a novel genotype of the causative virus in the 2004/2005 season (Kundu <em>et al</em>. 2012), the impact of the disease on the population appears to have been thus far negligible, limited to a brief reduction in hatching success (Tollington <em>et al</em>. 2015). Strict biosecurity protocols are deployed by conservation managers to restrict transmission of disease. An experiment testing the effectiveness of these protocols&#160; has suggested that while they reduced the probability of nestling infection, they were in fact associated with a slight reduction in fledging success (Fogell <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;Recently, wild-born individuals were translocated to the Bambous Mountains on the east coast of Mauritius to establish a new population. Breeding was confirmed there in the 2018/2019 season (S. Henshaw <em>in litt. </em>2019).&#160;Another translocation programme was started in early 2018 to establish a population in Chamarel in the south-west; no breeding has yet been recorded there (V.

Current management practices such as of the provision of artificial nest boxes and supplementary food are likely to be long-term requirements of the population while remaining native forest is rehabilitated (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013, Jones <em>in litt </em>2019).

Habitats include eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes, pools, ponds, reservoirs, barrages, gravel-pits, canals, drainage ditches, dykes, oxbow lakes, fish ponds, creeks, rivers and river deltas, as well as open marshes, freshwater meadows, flood-lands, freshwater and saline lagoons, salt-pans, clay-pans and sewage ponds (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Taylor and van Perlo 1998, Musil 2006). It frequently exploits temporary pools and seasonally inundated marshes when breeding (Africa), and may extend to quiet estuaries or inshore waters in the winter (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It generally avoids closely overgrown, narrowly confined and very shallow waters, and those overshadowed by trees or cliffs (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). If solitary, the species roosts at sunset on small islets, mudbanks, sandbanks, rocks in water, floating mats of vegetation, floating logs, or branches of trees over water, preferring to roost on open water, in shore vegetation or in meadows adjacent to water if in flocks (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>This species is omnivorous, although its diet consists primarily of vegetable matter such as algae (e.g. <em>Chara</em>, C<em>ladophora</em>, <em>Spirogyra</em>), the vegetative pasts of aquatic and terrestrial plants (e.g. waterweeds, bulrushes, reeds and grasses), the seeds of waterweeds, sedges, water-lilies, grasses and cereal crops, clubmoss <em>Selaginella</em> and aquatic fungi (e.g. <em>Leptomitus</em>) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Animal matter in its diet includes molluscs, adult and larval insects (especially flies, caddisflies, Odonata, Lepidoptera, beetles and bugs), worms, leeches, shrimps, spiders, small fish, fish eggs, frogs, birds and bird eggs, and small mammals (Urban <em>et al</em>. 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a platform of vegetation that may be resting on the bottom of shallow water, floating or on a foundation of trampled plant matter in emergent vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species may also nest on artificial platforms, islands, rafts, tree stumps, tree forks or in bushes up to 3 m above the water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Management information </strong>A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg/ha, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp), and systems that include ponds with fish fry (to provide areas with low fish competition and high invertebrate availability) are more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006). The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK (leaving small fish for piscivorous birds) resulted in increased winter use of the habitat by the species as result of an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).","This species suffers disturbance and mortality (Azerbaijan) from hunting (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Evans and Day 2002), and is poisoned by ingesting lead shot (France) (Mondain-Monval <em>et al.</em> 2002). It is also threatened by oil and petroleum pollution (Azerbaijan (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and the Kaliningrad region, Russia (Grishanov 2006)), and by habitat degradation and loss due to agricultural drainage schemes (Pakistan) (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006). The species is often drowned in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm (China) (Quan <em>et al.</em> 2002), and suffers predation from American mink <em>Neovison vison</em> (Slonsk Reserve, Poland (Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003) and UK (Ferreras and MacDonald 1999)). It is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted for sport in the Mediterranean (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), Denmark (Bregnballe 2006), Northern Ireland (Evans and Day 2002) and Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006), and for food in the Mediterranean (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006), India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and neighbouring countries (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), especially when it is flightless during the post-breeding moult (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).","The global population is estimated to number c.7,950,000-9,750,000&#160;individuals (Wetlands International 2016).

The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Most Palearctic populations of this species are fully migratory, dispersing widely in September-October after the breeding season and returning to breeding grounds in February (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Further south, populations tend to be sedentary or only partially migratory. Most migratory movements occur nocturnally, with birds moving in small parties or larger flocks of 200-250 (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species breeds January-May in the Palearctic Region, and in spring and summer in temperate areas, but mainly during the rains in Africa and the tropics<strong></strong> (although here it may also breed in any month of the year) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It breeds in mixed colonies of hundreds or thousands of pairs (the largest colony in Europe is 800-1,300 pairs), although it may also nest solitarily or in small groups of 2-10 nests (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is typically a solitary feeder but at abundant temporary food sources, or where available feeding areas are restricted, large congregations may occur (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It feeds at any time day or night, but is most active at dawn or dusk, typically roosting communally or solitary during the middle of the day and at night in trees and on cliffs, low rocks, islets or along shores (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> This species is a generalist in its habitat use, although shallow water, relatively large prey, and four or five months of ice-free breeding season are among the essential characteristics of its habitat (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to 500 or even 1,000 m, occasionally breeding much higher (Snow and Perrins 1998) (2,000 m in Armenia, 3,500-4,000 m in Ladakh, north-west India), inhabits any kind of shallow water, either fresh, brackish or saline, both standing or flowing, and shows a preference for areas with trees as it is commonly an arboreal rooster and nester. Some degree of isolation and protection are also typical of places chosen for roosting and nesting (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is found inland on broad rivers, narrow streams, lake shores, ornamental ponds, fish-ponds, marshes, flood-plains, reeds swamps, rice-fields and other irrigated areas, river oxbows, reservoirs, ditches, canals, sewage farms, inland deltas, and on islets and emerging rocks (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). On the coast the species also frequents deltas, salt-marshes, mangroves, estuaries, tidal mudflats, muddy and sandy shores, and sand-spits (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish and eels 10-25 cm long, as well as amphibians, crabs, molluscs, crustaceans, aquatic insects, snakes, small rodents, small birds and plant matter (although this may be incidental,&#160;<strong></strong>or only to aid in pellet formation) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a stick platform that is often re-used over successive years, usually positioned high in a tall tree up to 50 m, but also on the ground or on cliff edges, in reedbeds or in bushes. In reed-beds nests may be built of reeds, and ground nests may be reduced to a slight scrape, ringed with small stones and debris (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species commonly nests in colonies, and nesting sites are typically situated 2-38 km (convenient flying distance) from preferred feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).<strong></strong>","In Europe, the species was heavily persecuted in the nineteenth century due to its consumption of fish, which resulted in competition with fishermen and fish farmers (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Although killing at aquaculture farms has not reduced the global population so far (possibly because it is young birds that are mostly killed), 800 individuals are estimated to have died per year at Scottish fish-farms between 1984 and 1987 by being shot, drowned or poisoned by fish farmers (Carss 1994, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Renewed hunting poses a threat to populations in Bavaria (Germany) by decreasing numbers to levels that inhibit recovery following severe winters (severe winters increase mortality rates for juveniles) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is vulnerable in Madagascar owing to its restricted range, exceedingly high levels of habitat alteration (from siltation and the need for agricultural land for rice and grazing), hunting, and predation at nesting colonies (Kushlan and Hafner 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Timber harvesting is a threat throughout much of the species's range by removing trees used by nesting colonies and/or disturbing nearby colonies (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and avian botulism (van Heerden 1974), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted and traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).","The global   population is estimated to number c.790,000-3,700,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).

It breeds from May to early-August in solitary pairs, although several pairs may nest close together in optimal habitats along coasts or on islands (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species migrates in large flocks and is gregarious and sociable when feeding or roosting in winter, often foraging in close flocks of 10-100 or more individuals, especially in tidal areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds near the coast or up to several kilometres inland in the high Arctic, nesting on coastal plains, marshes and tundra and showing a preference for mosaics of bare rock, clay or shingle and vegetation near water or in areas that remain damp until late summer (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species is mainly coastal, although on migration it may occur inland along dykes or on lake shores (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). During the winter it frequents productive rocky and shingle shores, breakwaters, sandy beaches with storm-wracked seaweed, short-grass saltmarshes, sheltered inlets, estuaries, mangroves swamps, exposed reefs and mudflats with beds of molluscs (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> On its Arctic breeding grounds the species takes Diptera <strong></strong>(especially adult and larval midges) as well as larval Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and spiders, occasionally also taking vegetable matter early in the season (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season its diet consists of insects, crustaceans, molluscs (especially mussels or cockles), annelids, echinoderms, small fish, carrion and birds eggs (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression in mud, peat or on dry ground with dense vegetation, often positioned on a slight ridge, hummock or tussock, or in cleft or shallow fissure (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).

The recent decline may be part of a longer-term fluctuation and the population should be monitored carefully to ascertain whether it shows signs of stabilising.,"The species breeds on coastal saltmarshes, sand and shingle beaches, dunes, cliff-tops with short grass and occasionally rocky shores, as well as inland along the shores of lakes, reservoirs and rivers or on agricultural grass and cereal fields, often some distance from water (Hayman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species is chiefly coastal, frequenting estuarine mudflats, saltmarshes and sandy and rocky shores (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground often on raised surfaces (e.g. earth banks) in the open or in short vegetation on cultivated or uncultivated land, cliff-tops, rocky outcrops or clearings in taller vegetation including woods and moorland (Hayman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996,&#160;Snow &amp;&#160;Perrins 1998).<br/><br/>Most populations of this species are fully migratory, inland breeders moving to the coast for the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds from April to July (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986) in solitary pairs or small groups (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), during the winter foraging singly or in small groups of up to 10 individuals (Snow &amp; Perrins 1998) and with larger flocks often forming in major bays and estuaries and at roosting sites (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow &amp; Perrins 1998). When foraging on soft intertidal substrates bivalves and gastropods are the most important food items for this species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Polychaetes and crustaceans are more important in estuaries however, and molluscs (e.g. mussels, limpets and whelks) are most important on rocky shores (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). When inland, prey such as earthworms and insect larvae (e.g. caterpillars and cranefly larvae) are also taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The main threat to the species is the over-fishing of benthic shellfish and the resulting disappearance of intertidal mussel and cockle beds (Atkinson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Verhulst <em>et al.</em> 2004, Ens 2006, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Bait digging has also been identified as a threat through loss of prey species and disturbance to the benthic fauna (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is also threatened by habitat degradation on its wintering grounds due to land reclamation (for example in the Yellow Sea [Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014]), pollution, human disturbance (Kelin &amp; Qiang 2006) (e.g. from construction work or recreational activities [Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014]), coastal barrage construction (Burton 2006), industrial development including development of ports and oil extraction, oil spills, wind farms (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014) and reduced river flows (Kelin &amp; Qiang 2006). Rapid and extensive land reclamation is reported from staging and wintering grounds for the <em>osculans</em> population in South Korea and China and large-scale planting of <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> on the coast of eastern China may cause loss of foraging and nesting habitats (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014). Intensive agriculture including frequent mowing of grasslands and high densities of grazing livestock threatens chicks, eggs and nests and high levels of fertilizers and pesticides can reduce soil invertebrate biomass (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). A reduction in eutrophication is likely to have contributed to declines in some areas, owing to a loss of food resources (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014, H. Meltofte <em>in litt</em>. 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Sea level rise leading to increased coastal erosion and flooding is contributing to habitat loss in some areas (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Climate change has advanced the average egg-laying date of the species and is likely to reduce recruitment of bivalves, however warmer winters are expected to benefit the species leading to lower winter mortality (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Droughts in some inland areas are likely to lead to a loss of suitable habitat (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sarychev &amp; Mischenko 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is hunted in France but the effects of hunting at the population level are not known (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). It may be subject to subsistence egg collection in China (Melville <em>et al</em>, 2014) and illegal hunting elsewhere (Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014). Eggs and chicks are known to be predated by Corvidae, gulls, American Mink&#160;<em>Neovison vison</em>, dogs and foxes&#160;<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>&#160;(Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014).&#160;The invasive Pacific Oyster <em>Crassostrea gigas</em> has become abundant in the Oosterschelde (Netherlands) and is increasing in the Dutch Wadden Sea (van de Pol et al. 2014). Eurasian Oystercatcher generally does not eat this species of oyster which is reported to be invading mussel beds and may compete with cockles and mussels thus reducing food availability. However Pacific Oyster beds could also provide an area for mussel beds to re-establish. The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville &amp;&#160;Shortridge 2006).<br/><br/>In the northern part of the <em>longipes</em> population breeding range, cessation of grazing in coastal areas leading to development of shrubby vegetation threatens breeding habitats (Sarychev and Mischenko 2014). Conversely, intensive grazing in some areas may pose a threat to this population. Pollution from sewage, heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides have been identified as potential threats for the&#160;<em>osculans&#160;</em>population (Melville&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).","The global   population is estimated to number c. 925,000-1,030,000 individuals, based on expert opinion (Wetlands   International 2019), and comprising the three separate subspecies of <em>H. o. ostralegus</em>&#160;(820,000),&#160;<em>H. o.&#160;longpipes</em>&#160;(100,000-200,000) and <em>H. o. osculans</em>&#160;(5,000-10,000; Wetlands International 2019). This is roughly equivalent to 616,667-686,667 mature individuals, here placed in the band 500,000-999,999 mature individuals. Population estimates are lower than those of recent assessments due to the recent taxonomic split, whereby <em>Haematopus finschi</em>&#160;(South Island Oystercatcher), previously considered a subspecies of <em>Haematopus ostralegus</em>&#160;(del Hoyo <em>et. al.</em> 2014), was designated a separate species.",Decreasing,"The species has a wide range comprising three flyway populations. <em>H. o. ostralegus</em> breeds from <strong>Iceland</strong> and <strong>Scandinavia</strong> east to north-west&#160;<strong>Russia</strong>, south through <strong>U.K.</strong> to north-west <strong>France</strong>, with isolated populations in the Mediterranean, and winters on coasts south to West Africa. <em>H. o. longipes</em> breeds from west and central Russia south to the Black, Caspian and Aral Seas, and east to western Siberia, and winters on coasts from East Africa through Arabia to <strong>India</strong>; <em>H. o. osculans</em> breeds from coastal north-east Russia through Manchuria to the west and south coasts of the Korean Peninsula south to Fujian province, <strong>China</strong>, and winters in eastern China and along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula (more than 50% of the population is thought to winter at just one site, Yubu Island, <strong>South Korea </strong>and a further 25% are thought to winter at Lianyunggang, Jiangsu, China; Melville&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>H. o. ostralegus</em>&#160;is not significantly exploited by human populations.

There is also evidence that the creation of large marine protected areas (MPAs) to protect this species from the threat of anthropogenic shellfish over-fishing may not be an effective management or conservation technique on a global scale, especially if over-fishing continues to occur in adjacent areas (Verhulst&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).

Since then, at least two additional populations and areas have been identified in Western Australia. Population size, trends, and geographic range are still very poorly understood. The population size has been placed in the band of 50-249 mature individuals, and for this reason it is classified as Endangered.","<p>In an attempt to explain widespread but scattered records, the species was previously thought to be nomadic or to have very large home ranges (Higgins 1999). However, limited radio- and GPS-tracking carried out by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2017b) implies that the species is more sedentary than these speculations suggest. Movement of two tracked birds remained within an area of approximately 70 km<sup>2</sup>. Individuals moved approximately 30 km per night within a radius of less than 10 km from roosting locations.<br/>Tracked birds moved from their roosts in <em>Triodia</em>&#160;(spinifex) hummocks to feeding sites in more diverse habitats marked by large-seeded grass and forb species. Physiological modelling suggests that the species may need to visit standing water, especially during summer (Kearney <em>et al. </em>2016). The bird GPS-tracked by Murphy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2017b) only visited a permanent water source once. However, a considerable amount of rain fell during the tracking period, and so ephemeral water sources were likely to be available. During winter, Night Parrots may satisfy water requirements from their diet, which may include succulent plants, such as <em>Sclerolaena </em>spp (Kearney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/>Most habitat records are of <em>Triodia </em>grasslands and/or chenopod shrublands (Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2011) in the arid and semi-arid zones, and Higgins (1999) listed <em>Astrebla </em>spp. (Mitchell grass), shrubby samphire and chenopod associations, scattered trees and shrubs, <em>Acacia aneura</em> (Mulga) woodland, treeless areas and bare gibber as associated with sightings of the species. S. Murphy (pers. comm. in TSSC 2016) recorded a similar range of habitats used or traversed by individuals in southwestern Queensland: Cretaceous sandstone, claystone, and siltstone residuals; either dominated by <em>Triodia longiceps</em> on slopes and margins of duricrust plateaus or with <em>Sclerolaena </em>spp., <em>Maireana </em>spp. (Saltbush spp.), <em>Ptilotus </em>spp. (Mulla Mulla spp.), and small areas of <em>T. longiceps</em>; with occasional watercourses with <em>Acacia cambagei </em>(stinking gidgee).&#160;The habitat of the southwestern Queensland population is naturally fragmented, and is unlikely to promote fire behaviour that results in most habitat in this area being burned by one fire event (Murphy 2015, S. Murphy pers. comm. 2016 in TSSC 2016).<br/>Recent and historical accounts of nests describe a slight depression in a cavity at the end of a tunnel built into a&#160;<em>Triodia</em>&#160;hummock (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2017, Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017a). Clutch size is reported as 2-4 eggs (Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017a, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>  <p></p>","The causes of the assumed decline of the species are “essentially guesswork” (Garnett <em>et al. </em>2011). Blyth (1996) proposed a list of threats considered realistic in the absence of direct evidence. Threats to the species are likely to vary across its range and might include predation by feral cats and foxes; soil disturbance, erosion and loss caused by herbivores (including livestock and over-abundant native and feral herbivores);&#160;degradation of habitat around water points by herbivores; competition for food by herbivores; fire;&#160;psittacine beak and feather disease, avian pox, and other diseases;&#160;illegal collection of birds or eggs;&#160;disturbance from bird-watching activities; fences; and reduction in water availability through over-use of waterholes by camels and&#160;reduced waterhole maintenance (TSSC 2016). Biophysical modelling suggests that predicted temperature increases under various climate change scenarios would increase the species's dependence on free-standing water dramatically (Kearney&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). Thus, climate change, interacting with the spatial configuration of water points and habitats, and the concentration of feral predators at water points, may become a serious future threat.<p></p>","The size of the currently known population has not been estimated, but it is assumed that the number of mature individuals is in the band 50-249 (<em>per </em>Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2011), but may prove to be larger.",Decreasing,"<p>This nocturnal parrot is endemic to <strong>Australia</strong>. Though cryptic, it was frequently seen and collected in the late nineteenth century (Murphy <em>et al. </em>2017). However, after an individual was collected in Western Australia in 1912, there was no confirmed sighting for 78 years. Then, in 1990, a dead body of the night parrot was discovered on a roadside in western Queensland (Boles 1994). Another body was found less than 200 km away in 2006, suggesting the existence of a population in the region (McDougall <em>et al. </em>2009). A population was discovered in 2013, and photographs and sound recordings were produced (Dooley 2013). This population, located in Pullen Pullen Reserve in the Goneaway Tableland subregion in western Queensland, has become the focus of research into the breeding, movements, and ecology of the species. Additional populations have been confirmed in the East Murchison and Great Sandy Desert areas of Western Australia (Jackett <em>et al. </em>2017, Kimberley Land Council 2019). <br/>Reports of feathers and calls in Kalamurina Wildlife Sanctuary in South Australia have been retracted, so the existence and extent of a population there remains unconfirmed (Australian Wildlife Conservancy 2019).

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is a fully migratory circumpolar breeder with several sub-populations that employ a number of migration strategies, from short coastal flights to long, non-stop flights overland on a broad front (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The sub-population that breeds in north-east Greenland migrates through Iceland, Britain and western France to arrive in its West African wintering grounds (specifically Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania) from late-July, returning again between March and early-April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). European birds may gather in large congregations from the beginning of July in areas such as the Wadden Sea or the Wash to moult (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and some juveniles may remain in the non-breeding range all year (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds dispersed or aggregated in loose colonies, and travels in group sizes of up to 1,500 on passage, remaining in large groups (up to hundreds of thousands of birds) throughout the non-breeding season (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).<strong> </strong>The species is active both diurnally and nocturnally (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Shepherd and Lank 2004). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> In the breeding season this species frequents moist boggy ground interspersed with surface water, such as tussock tundra and peat-hummock tundra in the arctic, as well as wet coastal grasslands, salt marshes and wet upland moorland (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> In the non-breeding season this species mainly prefer estuarine mudflats, but also frequent a wide variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), both coastal and inland, including lagoons, muddy freshwater shores, tidal rivers, flooded fields, sewage farms, salt-works, sandy coasts (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), lakes and dams (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). For roosting during high tides and at night this species prefers large fields of naturally fertilised short pasture or soil-based crops with few vertical structures that could be used by predators (Shepherd and Lank 2004). <strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> This species is omnivorous during the breeding season, consuming mostly adult and larval insects (dipteran flies, beetles, caddisflies, wasps, sawflies and mayflies), and also spiders, mites, earthworms, snails, slugs and plant matter (usually seeds) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> It is also omnivorous during the non-breeding season, consuming mostly polychaete worms and small gastropods, as well as insects (dipteran flies and beetles), crustaceans, bivalves, plant matter and occasionally small fish (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Its nest is a scrape or shallow depression in the ground, concealed in vegetation and sometimes in a tuft or tussock (and thus raised slightly off the ground) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Management information</strong> The provision of well-surfaced paths in breeding areas that recieve &gt; 30 visitors a day has been shown to reduce the impact of human disturbance on this species' reproductive performance (Pearce-Higgins <em>et al.</em> 2007). It is also known to show increased hatching successes when ground predators have been excluded by erecting protective fences around nesting areas (Jackson 2001).","<em>Breeding</em> This species is significantly threatened by the loss of its breeding habitat though afforestation of moorland (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Lavers and Haines-Young 1997). It may also suffer from nest predation by introduced mammals (e.g. European hedgehog <em>Erinaceus europeaus</em>) on some islands (Jackson 2001). <em>Non-breeding</em> In the winter this species is restricted to a small number of estuaries, so it is vulnerable to any changes in this habitat for example through land reclamation (drainage) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and the invasion of alien plant species (such as the grass <em>Spartina anglica</em> which has spread on British mudflats, resulting in the reduction in size of feeding areas available) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (UK) (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002b). Important migratory stop-over habitats on the Baltic Sea coastline adjacent to the Kaliningrad region of Russia are threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for irrigation, peat-extraction, reedbed mowing and burning, and abandonment and changing land management practices leading to scrub and reed overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1 in particular) and is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global   population is estimated to number c.4,295,000-6,800,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015).

For these reasons it is evaluated as Vulnerable.<p></p>,"<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is migratory and disperses after breeding from coastal areas to the open ocean (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It returns to its breeding grounds from January, where it breeds from mid-May to mid-June in huge single- or mixed-species colonies that often exceed 100,000 pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding may occur later after periods of cold weather and many individuals do not remain on the breeding grounds during such conditions (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species begins to disperse from the breeding colonies between July and August, often moulting in large flocks of several thousand individuals on beaches between the breeding grounds and the open sea (Olsen and Larsson 2003). Non-breeders may also remain at sea during the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season, the species often occurs singly or in pairs, but may also occur in small flocks or as dispersed aggregations (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Snow and Perrins 1998). <br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> It nests on high, steep coastal cliffs with narrow ledges in areas with easy access to freshwater (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> The species moults on sandy beaches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). On passage, it may concentrate at sea on continental shelves, areas of upwelling and at rich fish banks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Olsen and Larsson 2003). During the winter the species is highly pelagic, usually remaining on the wing out of sight of land (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of marine invertebrates (e.g. squid and shrimps) and fish, although during the breeding season it may also take intertidal molluscs, crustaceans (e.g. crayfish), earthworms, small mammals and plant matter (e.g. aquatic plants, potato tubers and grain) (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). At sea during the winter, it will also take planktonic invertebrates and often exploits sewage outfalls and fishing vessels (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a compacted mass of mud, grass and feathers, usually built on a narrow ledge on high, steep coastal cliffs (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Occasionally the species may also nest on glaciers or snow banks (where these have covered traditional cliff nesting sites), on buildings and piers, or on flat, rocky or sandy sites up to 20 km inland (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It breeds in very large colonies with neighbouring nests spaced evenly 30-60 cm apart (where site availability allows) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and generally feeds within 50 km of the breeding colony (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","Trophic shifts in the Atlantic appear to have removed the prey base for a large proportion of the population over a relatively short timeframe, and these appear largely to be due to climate change. Both large spills and ongoing chronic oil pollution are impacting populations of this species (Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006), and may be contributing to reduced prey abundance and poor adult condition resulting in lowered reproductive output. Certain fisheries may also have contributed to depleted food resources for the species (Frederiksen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Nikolaeva <em>et al</em>. 2006), exacerbating population declines due to increased foraging effort and nutritional stress leading to greater adult mortality or breeding desertion (Paredes <em>et al.</em> 2014). Black-legged Kittiwakes also suffer a level of bycatch in longline fisheries, especially the Spanish Gran Sol longline fishery (BirdLife International 2015), for which there is virtually no monitoring of bycatch and none of the vessels operating in the fishery are currently MSC-certified (E. Dunn <em>in litt. </em>2018).&#160;However, there is virtually no bycatch of kittiwakes in the northern Atlantic, with the species noted to be adept at removing prey without capture at least where the hooks are large (Løkkeborg 1990, Dunn and Steel 2001, E. Dunn&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2018). Avian flu has been recorded in the species, but to date only in very few individuals and without any indication of impacts at the population level (Melville and Shortridge 2006). There is a possibility that a future outbreak could lead to significant mortality within a breeding colony.","The global population is estimated to number c. 14,600,000-15,700,000 (Wetlands International 2016). The European population is estimated at 1,730,000-2,200,000 pairs, which equates to 3,460,000-4,410,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species breeds in the North Atlantic, from northern central <strong>Canada </strong>and northeastern <strong>U.S.A.</strong> east through <strong>Greenland </strong>to western and northern Europe, and on to the Taymyr Peninsula and Severnaya Zemlya (<strong>Russia</strong>), wintering south to the Sargasso Sea and West Africa; and in the North Pacific, from northeastern Siberia, Kamchatka, Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands through the Bering Sea to Alaska, wintering south to the East <strong>China </strong>Sea and northwestern <strong>Mexico </strong>(Burger <em>et al.</em> 2016).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is listed under the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement, but is not listed on the Bern Convention, the Convention of Migratory Species or on the EU Birds Directive Annexes.

164576728,7750,Enhydra lutris,Endangered,A2abe,2021,2020-01-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Sea Otter population suffered a large-scale decline historically and  contemporarily. The species is believed to have undergone a decline  exceeding 50% in the western part of its range over the past 30 years  (approximately four generations). The world-wide population of Sea Otters decreased to  approximately 2,000 animals by the end of the commercial fur trade in  1911 (Kenyon 1969). The population recovered from 11 remnant populations  located in Russia (Bering Island, Kamchatka Peninsula, and Kuril  Islands) and in the United States (in Alaska [Aleutian Islands, Alaska  Peninsula, Kodiak archipelago, and Prince William Sound] and California)  (Kenyon 1969, Lensink, 1960). The remnant populations were small and  widely dispersed, resulting in low genetic diversity compared to  pre-exploitation levels and as measured by both nuclear and  mitochondrial genetic markers (Larson <em>et al.</em> 2002a,b, and 2012).  However, both theoretical models and empirical data suggest populations  have retained approximately 70% of pre-exploitation diversity (Ralls <em>et al.</em> 1983, Larson <em>et al.</em> 2012). Population estimates and counts made between 2000–2018 give a generalised worldwide estimate of 128,902 Sea Otters. However, many populations have not been surveyed regularly or recently; there is a pressing need for these surveys to be able to update the global population size estimate and to monitor future population trends more accurately<br/><br/>Since  the mid-1900s, there has been population recovery for the species  (Kenyon 1969). However, in the United States, two subspecies of Sea Otters are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (1973),  a significant population segment in the SW Alaska genetic stock (<em>E. l.  kenyoni</em>) in Alaska (USFWS 2013a, USFWS 2013b) and<em> E. l. nereis</em> in  California (USFWS 2003). In Russia, significant Sea Otter (<em>E. l. lutris</em>)  population declines are thought to have occurred for the Kamchatka  Peninsula and northern Kuril Islands in the past decade (Kornev 2007,  Kornev 2010, Bodkin 2015). In Alaska, precipitous population declines  occurred in the Aleutian Islands beginning in the late 1980s–2005. By  2000, counts of Sea Otters had decreased by 90% with a declining trend  through 2005 and an estimated loss to the population of 62,000–90,000 Sea Otters (Doroff <em>et al.</em> 2003, Estes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Burn and Burn <em>et al.</em> 2003, Burn and Doroff 2005). The probable cause of the decline was increased predation by killer whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Estes <em>et al.</em>  1998). Population counts also remain low for the Alaska Peninsula (Burn  and Doroff 2005, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Stock Assessment  Reports). In the listed population, the Kodiak archipelago and lower  Cook Inlet appeared stable or increasing during the same period that  population declines were documented in the Aleutian chain west of the  Alaska Peninsula. In total, five of the six remnant population centres  have experienced significant population reductions in the SW Sea Otter  population stock.<br/><br/>The other threatened subspecies, the southern Sea Otter in California is recovering to near its threshold for delisting under  the Endangered Species Act (1973), however, the present range  distribution is only a fraction of the historic distribution (Tinker <em>et al.</em>  2019). Population range expansion has been greatly impacted by  shark-bite mortality in the northern end of the subspecies range  (Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2018). In addition, the habitat north of the  central California sea otter range, northern California and Oregon in  the Pacific Northwest has had major reductions in canopy-forming kelp in  the past decade due to the loss of sea stars from sea star wasting  disease resulting in an abundance of sea urchins that graze intensively  on kelp (Roger-Bennett and Catton 2019). The giant kelp canopy likely  afforded Sea Otters protection from shark predation, and it has been  hypothesized that the loss of this habitat has been a factor in intensifying the predation. Central and southern California thus remains  the only location for this subspecies to date, and it is one of the  extant 11 historical remnant populations.<br/><br/>In the western parts of  the range the northern Kuril Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula have  declined from approximately 22,000 Sea Otters to approximately 10,600  since the early 2000s (Kornev 2007, Kornev 2010, Bodkin 2015). This is a  long-established region for Sea Otters, and there are no documented  reasons for this decline. The Commander Islands population is believed to be stable  and had one of the longest time-series for population surveys for the  species, however this region has not been surveyed since the late 1990s.<br/><br/>Unquantified environmental stressors to all the subspecies  populations will include future ocean conditions becoming warmer,  acidifying, and deoxygenating (IPCC 2019). Warmer oceans favour range  expansion and prevalence of dinoflagellate phytoplankton species, many  of which are toxin producing (IPCC 2019) and will impact Sea Otter prey  in ways that are not yet understood. In California, effects of harmful  algal and cyanobaterial blooms may be acute or chronic on sea otters and  have resulted in individual health declines and deaths (Kreuder <em>et al.</em> 2003, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2010, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2017). Recent studies have shown saxitoxins increase in toxicity through biochemical changes associated with lower pH (Roggatz <em>et al.</em>  2019), this has the potential to decrease available prey in future  scenarios for Sea Otters. In addition, calcium carbonate shell forming  bivalves are thought to decrease with increasing ocean acidification  (Waldbusser <em>et al.</em> 2015). The effect of changing and decreasing  bivalve abundance on sea otter populations is unknown, but it will  likely be negative.<br/><br/>Within the last two decades, large-scale population declines in Sea Otters have been recorded in the North and Western Pacific (regions that contain the majority of the global population of Sea Otter). Based on these declines, the global population is suspected to have undergone a more than 50% reduction over the past 21 years (three generations based on Gagne <em>et al</em>. 2018). Population surveys are urgently needed across large parts of the Sea Otter's distribution. The prevalence of diseases (<em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>in California and <em>Streptococcus </em>Syndrome in parts of Alaska) are indicated to have slowed down the growth rate of Sea Otter populations (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2019). Moreover, oil spills, entanglement in fishing gear and increased predation by killer whales (in the Aleutian Islands) and white sharks (in California) (Tinker <em>et al</em>. 2016) are posing continuous threat to the species. Increase in the extent of these threats have limited sea otter populations to refugia, leading to decreased use of suitable habitats, increased competition and slower population growth rates. In view of these ongoing threats, the species is listed as Endangered under the criteria A2abe.<br/><p></p><p></p>","Throughout their range, Sea Otters use a variety of near shore marine environments and 84% of foraging occurs in water ≤30 m in depth (Bodkin <em>et al.</em> 2004) and most of their foraging occurs within a kilometre of the shore. Their classic association is with mixed rocky intertidal substrates supporting kelp beds, but also frequent soft-sediment dominated areas where kelp is absent (Riedman and Estes 1990, DeMaster<em> et al.</em> 1996, Burn and Doroff 2005). Kelp canopy is thought to be an important habitat component, used for foraging and resting (Riedman and Estes 1990). They are found most often in areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds and swells, such as rocky coastlines, thick kelp forests, barrier reefs and refuges such as inlets, bays and estuaries. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky substrates, Sea Otters can also live in areas where the sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Individuals generally occupy a relatively small home range a few to tens of kilometres long and have high site fidelity, remaining there year-round, however, some individuals, primarily males, do make long distance (more than hundreds of kilometers) movements and migrations (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 2000; Tinker <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2019). Sea Otters forage in rocky and soft-sediment communities on or near the ocean floor. The maximum confirmed depth of dive was 97 m (Newby 1975); however, recent studies using time-depth recorders implanted in Sea Otters indicate average maximum forage depths of 54 m for female and 82 m for male Sea Otters (Bodkin <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/> <br/> Sea Otters are weakly territorial (Kenyon 1969) with fighting and aggression rare (Loughlin 1980). Only adult male Sea Otters establish territories. Males patrol territorial boundaries and attempt to exclude other adult males from the area. Females move freely between and among male territories. Groups of male and female Sea Otters generally rest separately. Sea Otter annual home ranges can occupy up to 0.8 km² (80 ha) and extend along 16 km of coastline (Kenyon 1969, Loughlin 1980). Typically, female sea otter home ranges are about 1.5–2 times larger than resident adult males during the breeding season; however, females have smaller annual or lifetime home ranges than males (Riedman and Estes 1990). Jameson (1989) found that territorial adult males occupied a mean home range of 40.3 ha during the summer-fall period (when home range size was considered equal to territory size); and mean coastline length was 1.1 km. Winter-spring mean home range size of territorial adult males that remained in female areas was 78.0 ha, with a mean coastline length of 2.16 km.<br/> <br/> Sea Otter diet consists almost exclusively of marine invertebrates, including sea urchins, a variety of bivalves such as clams and mussels, abalone, other molluscs, crustaceans, and snails. Its prey ranges in size from tiny limpets and snails, to kelp and cancer crabs, to giant Pacific octopuses (Estes 1980). Sea urchins, abalones and rock crabs are the principal prey of Sea Otters in newly reoccupied habitats of central California (Vandevere, 1969), whereas, clams and crab make up the majority of the diet in soft-sediment habitats (Kvitek <em>et al</em>. 1992, Doroff and DeGange 1994). Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and abalone are present in a range of sizes, Sea Otters tend to select larger prey over smaller ones of similar type (Kvitek <em>et al</em>. 1992). In California, it has been noted that Sea Otters ignore Pismo clams smaller than 3 inches (7 cm) across. One exception is in the Aleutian archipelago were Sea Otters were observed to regularly eat fish, which could comprise up to 50% of their diet in some seasons. The fish species eaten were usually bottom dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as the Red Irish Lord and Globefish (Estes 1980). They also consume crab, clam, mussels, turban snails, sea cucumbers, squid, octopus, chitons, tubeworms, large barnacles, scallops, and sea stars (Wild and Ames 1974, Riedman and Estes 1990). Burrowing bivalve molluscs such as clams are excavated by digging in sand or mud bottoms and are the most common prey in soft-sediment communities (Calkins 1978, Kvitek <em>et al</em>. 1992, Doroff and DeGange 1994).<br/> <br/> Male Sea Otters reach sexual maturity around age five or six, but probably do not become territorial or reproductively successful for two or three subsequent years (Riedman and Estes 1990). Most female Sea Otters are sexually mature at age four or five, though some are mature as early as 2.5 years (Kenyon 1969, Jameson and Johnson 1993, Monson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Monson and DeGange 1995, von Biela 2007). Thus, it is thought that Sea Otter generation length is approximately seven years (Gagne <em>et al.</em> 2018). Sea Otters apparently are polygynous, although the exact nature of the mating system may vary. Females normally give birth to a single pup that weighs 1.4 to 2.3 kg at birth (Riedman and Estes 1990). Gestation has been documented to be approximately six months with an obligatory two to three-month delayed implantation phase and a four-month implanted phase when fetal growth occurs (Riedman and Estes 1990). Twinning has been documented in Sea Otters (Williams <em>et al</em>. 1980); however, litters larger than one are rare, and when they occur, neither pup is likely to survive (Jameson and Bodkin 1986). Pups are precocial and remain dependent upon their mothers for about six months (Jameson and Johnson 1993). Longevity in Sea Otters is estimated to be 15 to 20 years for females and 10 to 15 years for males (Riedman and Estes 1990).","<p>Oil spills are the greatest anthropogenic threat to Sea Otters (Geraci and Williams 1990). Sea Otters become hypothermic when oiled because oiled Sea Otter fur loses its insulation property and Sea Otters have no blubber layer. Oil can be ingested while grooming, leading to gastrointestinal disorders, other ailments and death. Thevolatile components of oil inhaled by sea otters can cause lung damage. Estimates of sea otter mortality following the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound ranged from 2,650 (Garrott <em>et al.</em> 1993) to 3,905 (DeGange <em>et al</em>. 1994). <br/> <br/> Significant numbers of Sea Otters drowned in gill and trammel nets in California from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s (Estes 1990). Population declines in California’s sea otters may be incidental to summer commercial fisheries. Estes <em>et al</em>. (2003) found that Sea Otter mortality was elevated in the summer months and that commercial fin fish landings in the coastal live trap fishery increased. <br/> <br/>An ongoing and long-term study of sea otter health, body condition, and  causes of death for the southern Sea Otter indicate that shark bite  mortality is the most common primary cause of death followed by  acanthocephalan peritonitis, probable domoic acid intoxication,  cardomyopathy, end-of-lactation-syndrome, and primary bacterial  infection (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2017, Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2019). In  Alaska, Streptococcal endocarditis, encephalitis and/or septicemia,  referred to as Strep. syndrome has been identified in northern Sea Otters, as well as trauma from boat strikes. Goldstein <em>et al.</em> (2009) found northern Sea Otters from the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak and Kachemak Bay area infected with phocine distemper.<br/><br/>Killer  Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>), Great White Sharks (<em>Carcharodon carcharias</em>),  Bald Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em>), Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), wolves  (<em>Canis lupus</em>), and Brown Bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) have been documented as  predators of Sea Otters (Riedman and Estes 1990). Predation by Killer  Whales is one factor believed to have caused Sea Otter population  declines across the Western Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (Doroff <em>et al.</em> 2003, Estes <em>et al.</em> 1998, Hatfield <em>et al.</em>  1998). Significant declines in preferred prey species populations—Northern Fur Seals (<em>Callorhinus ursinus</em>), Harbour Seals (<em>Phoca  vitulina</em>), and Steller Sea Lions (<em>Eumetopias jubatus</em>) are believed to  have caused Killer Whales to prey switch and consume Sea Otters, a less  preferred prey because of their lack of blubber layer (Estes <em>et al.</em> 1998).<br/><br/>Unquantified  environmental stressors to all the subspecies populations may  include future ocean conditions becoming warmer, acidifying, and  deoxygenating (IPCC 2019). Warmer oceans favour the range expansion and  prevalence of dinoflagellate phytoplankton, many of which are toxin  producing and will impact Sea Otter prey in ways that are not yet  understood. In California, effects of harmful algal and cyanobacterial  blooms may be acute or chronic on Sea Otters (Kreuder <em>et al.</em> 2003, Miller <em>et al.</em> 2010, Miller <em>et al.</em>  2017). Ongoing studies are looking at the living population and data  from necropsies to elucidate the complex relationship between  cardiomyopathy and domoic acid exposure (Moriarty <em>et al.</em> 2019).  Work in Alaska suggests that Sea Otters can detect and avoid consuming  clams with low levels of saxitoxin or paralytic shellfish poisoning  (PSP) that is accumulated in Butter Clams (<em>Saxidomus gigantea; </em>Kvitek <em>et al.</em>  1991, Kvitek and Bretz 2004). Recent studies have shown saxitoxins  increase in toxicity through biochemical changes associated with lower  pH (Roggatz <em>et al.</em> 2019), this has the potential to decrease  available prey in future scenarios for Sea Otters. Bivalves are an  important prey species for Sea Otters living in soft-sediment habitat  regions, like the Kodiak archipelago, where Butter Clams constitute  &gt;50% of the Sea Otter diet. In addition, calcium carbonate shell  forming bivalves are thought to decrease with increasing ocean  acidification (Waldbusser <em>et al.</em> 2015). The effect that changing  and decreasing bivalve abundance will have on Sea Otter populations is  unprecedented, is likely to be negative.<br/><br/>Studies in Alaska, and  Washington have shown that Sea Otter predation on sea urchins may  indirectly enhance the growth of kelp and kelp-associated marine  communities. Shellfish are important to commercial, recreational, and  tribal fisheries throughout the species range, and predation by sea  otters can be significant and result in localized depletion of  commercial and subsistence shell fisheries. Emerging studies are looking  at the benefits of kelp-dominated ecosystems such as increasing fin  fish populations and ecosystem stability in the face of climate change  (Markel and Shurin 2015).<br/><br/>Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by<em>  Toxoplasma gondii</em>, is a major cause of mortality and contributor to the  slow rate of population recovery for southern Sea Otters in California  (Conrad <em>et al.</em> 2005). Thomas and Cole (1996) reported that  mortality from infectious diseases, such as peritonitis, protozoal  encephalitis, toxoplasmosis, etc. were occurring at a high rate,  wherein, some diseases appeared to be on the rise while others were  newly reported. Several of the diseases were predominately affecting  prime age, breeding adults.</p>","<p>In the early 1700s, the worldwide population was estimated to be between 150,000 (Kenyon 1969) and 300,000 individuals (Johnson 1982), occurring along the North Pacific from northern Japan to the central Baja Peninsula in Mexico. Its abundance was greatly reduced by human exploitation. Although it appears that First Nations harvests periodically led to local reductions of Sea Otters (Simenstad <em>et al.</em> 1978, Jones <em>et al.</em> 2011), the species remained abundant throughout its range until the mid-1700s. Following the arrival in Alaska of Russian explorers in 1741, extensive commercial harvest of Sea Otters over the next 150 years resulted in the near extirpation of the species. When sea otters were afforded protection by the International Fur Seal Treaty in 1911, probably fewer than 2,000 animals remained in 13 remnant colonies (Kenyon 1969): two in the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka; one in the Commander Islands; a total of 10 in the following areas: Aleutian Islands (2) and along the Alaska Peninsula (3); Kodiak Archipelago (1), Prince William Sound (1), the Queen Charlotte Islands (1), central California (1), and San Benito Islands (1). However, the Queen Charlotte, Canada and San Benito Island, Mexico remnant Sea Otter populations became extinct and likely did not contribute to the recolonization of the species following near extirpation (Kenyon 1969).<br/> <br/>Sea Otters currently have established populations in parts of the Kuril  Islands, the Russian east coast, throughout coastal Alaska, British  Columbia, Washington, and California, and there have been reports of  single-animal observations in Mexico and Japan (a recent maximum of 20 in  the latter). Population estimates and counts made between 2000–2018 give  a generalised worldwide estimate of 128,902 Sea Otters. However, many populations have not been surveyed regularly or recently. The biggest  change during this time being the decrease in the northern Kuril Islands  and the Kamchatka Peninsula which have declined from approximately  22,000 Sea Otters to approximately 12,100 since the early 2000s (Kornev  2007, Kornev 2010), representing a decline of approximately 55% for this subpopulation within the last 21 years (three generations). This is a long-established region for Sea Otters (holding approximately 9–10% of the global population) and  there are no documented reasons for this decline. The population in the Commander Islands is believed to be stable and had one of the longest time-series for  population surveys for the species—however, this region has not been  surveyed since the late 1990s. It is thought that budget restrictions  have prevented any current population assessments for the species in  this region.<br/><br/>In Alaska, precipitous population declines occurred  in the Aleutian Islands beginning in the late 1980s–2005. In the 1980s, around 90,000 Sea Otters were thought to occur in the Aleutian Islands. By 2000,this population had decreased by 90% (to around 9,000), with a declining trend continuing through  to 2005 and an estimated loss to the population of 62,000–90,000 Sea Otters (Burn <em>et al.</em> 2003, Doroff <em>et al.</em> 2003, Estes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Burn and Doroff 2005). The probable cause of the decline was increased predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Estes <em>et al.</em>  1998). To date, there is no indication of further declines in counts  and no real indication that the population is showing signs of  significant recovery. Population counts also remain low for the Alaska  Peninsula (Burn and Doroff 2005, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Stock  Assessment Reports). In this listed population, the Kodiak archipelago  and lower Cook Inlet appeared stable or increasing during the same  period that population declines were documented in the Aleutian chain. A generalised estimate of Sea Otter numbers in Alaska is 98,780 (representing around 77% of the global population); in addition to ~9,000 in the Aleutian Islands, there are ~16,340 on the Alaskan Peninsula, ~46,700 in the Gulf of Alaska, and 25,700 in Southeast Alaska, however, many of these areas have not been surveyed thoroughly for over a decade (S. Larson pers. comm. 2021).<br/><br/>Between  1969 and 1972, 89 Sea Otters were translocated from Alaska (66% from  Prince William Sound and 33% from Amchitka Island in the Aleutians) to  the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where they  established a healthy population. Sea Otter range expansion has  continued and in 2008 it was documented that they have left Vancouver  Island and moved into northern Queen Charlotte Strait and the adjacent  British Columbia mainland coast and in some portions of the central  British Columbia mainland coast. The most recent population estimate is  6,754 (Nichol <em>et al.</em> 2015), representing around 7–8% of the global population. <br/><br/>During 1969 and 1970, 59 Sea Otters were translocated from the remnant population of Amchitka Island  to Washington State. The most recent surveys in 2019 indicate the  population is approximately 2,785 (around 2% of the global population) with an estimated average annual growth  rate of 9.8% and continued range expansion is expected (Jefferies <em>et al.</em> 2019). <br/><br/>California's Sea Otters are the descendants of a single colony of about 50 southern Sea Otters discovered near Big Sur in 1938. The southern Sea Otter  population in California is recovering to near its threshold for delisting under  the Endangered Species Act (1973), however, the present distribution is  only a fraction of the historic distribution (Tinker <em>et al.</em>  2019). The latest survey results report a three-year average of 2,962 Sea Otters (around 2% of the global population), including the mainland and the San Nicolas Island population,  which represents a &lt;1% growth rate per year (Hatfield <em>et al.</em>  2019). Population range expansion has been greatly impacted by  shark-bite mortality in the northern end of the subspecies’ range  (Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2019). The Pacific Northwest has had major  reductions in canopy-forming kelp in the past decade due to the loss of  sea stars through a wasting disease and now an abundance of urchins that  graze intensively on kelp (Roger-Bennett and Catton 2019). The giant  kelp likely afforded Sea Otters protection from shark predation, and the  loss of this habitat has been a factor intensifying the predation. On  the southern end of the range, at San Nicolas Island, the reintroduced  population originally established in the mid-1980s from the Central  California population is now well established, numbering over 100  animals, and has an estimated annual growth rate of 10.5% for the past five  years (Hatfield <em>et al.</em> 2019). Schramm <em>et al.</em> 2014, based  on reports of sea otters in Baja California, Mexico, suggested that a  higher frequency of Sea Otters than in the past.<br/><br/>In Japan, small  numbers of Sea Otters (<em>E. l. lutris</em>) have been observed regularly on the  eastern side of Hokkaido Islands since the 1970s (Hattori <em>et al.</em> 2005). The most recent estimate is 20 individuals, but at present this is not believed to be an established population.</p>",Decreasing,"Historically, Sea Otters occurred across the North Pacific Rim, ranging  from Hokkaido, Japan, through the Kuril Islands, the Kamchatka  Peninsula, and the Commander Islands, the Aleutian Islands, peninsular  and south coastal Alaska and south to Baja California, Mexico (Kenyon  1969). In the early 1700s, the worldwide population was estimated to be  between 150,000 (Kenyon 1969) and 300,000 individuals (Johnson 1982).  Although it appears that First Nations’ harvests periodically led to  significant local reductions of Sea Otters (Simenstad <em>et al.</em> 1978, Jones <em>et al.</em>  2011), the species remained abundant throughout its range until the  mid-1700s. Following the arrival in Alaska of Russian explorers in 1741,  extensive commercial harvest of Sea Otters over the next 150 years  resulted in the near extirpation of the species throughout the range.  When Sea Otters were afforded protection by the International Fur Seal  Treaty in 1911, it is thought that fewer than 2,000 animals remained in  13 remnant colonies (Kenyon 1969). Remnant populations were located in  Russia (Kuril Islands, Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Commander Islands)  in Alaska (Southwestern Alaska population stock (the Aleutian Islands (two  remnant colonies), Alaska Peninsula (three remnant colonies), and Kodiak  Island (one remnant colony), the South-central population stock (Prince  William Sound), in Canada (Queen Charlotte Islands), in central  California, and in Mexico (San Benito Islands) (Kenyon 1969, Estes  1980). However, the Queen Charlotte, Canada and San Benito Island,  Mexico remnant Sea Otter populations have presumably died out and likely  did not contribute to the recolonization of the species following near  extirpation (Kenyon 1969).<br/><br/>In North America, the current Sea Otter’s range is fairly continuous from the Aleutian Islands to Prince  William Sound with population gaps along the Gulf of Alaska until  Yakutat (which was a translocated population) then another gap in the  population’s distribution until the outer islands of Southeast Alaska  (also a translocated population with Sea Otters from the Aleutian  Islands and Prince William Sound). The next gap in the Sea Otter  population distribution is between Southeast Alaska and British  Columbia, Canada. Translocation efforts were successful in Washington  State but not in Oregon, thus there is a large population gap between  the small sea otter population in Washington and that of central  California.<p></p><p>  </p>","Europeans and Americans first ventured to the North Pacific coast of  America in the late eighteenth century in pursuit of Sea Otter skins. As  the Pacific counterpart to the Atlantic beaver trade, the Sea Otter  trade led trappers into the North Pacific, where they established bases  from the Aleutian Islands to Baja California. In China, Sea Otter furs  were exchanged at good profit for prized oriental goods.<br/><br/>Russia  and Spain were the pioneer nations to engage in the sea otter trade.  After Vitus Bering's expeditions in the early eighteenth century,  promyshlenniki (fur traders) pushed eastward, and in 1784 they  established the first permanent Russian settlement in America, on Kodiak  Island. In the same year, Spain organized a Sea Otter trade between  California and China. At the opening of the nineteenth century, American  and Russian traders entered the California Sea Otter fields, where in  the face of strong opposition they poached throughout the Spanish  period. After 1821, the liberal commercial policy of independent Mexico  stimulated the California Sea Otter trade, and many Americans became  Mexican citizens to participate in the business. Between 1804 and 1807  it is estimated that almost 60,000 pelts were taken by American vessels,  while the period 1808–1812 yielded nearly 50,000.<br/><br/>The Sea Otter  trade ended once commercial hunting was no longer viable and nearly  exterminated the species. In general, the fur trade areas were exhausted  in the order they were opened. Kamchatka and the Aleutians were  depleted by 1790, Kodiak by 1805, Sitka to Nootka Sound by 1820, and  California by 1840. A treaty signed in 1911 by the United States, Great  Britain, Russia, and Japan banned the hunting of Sea Otters. However, Sea Otter trade still exists. Sea Otter pelts are also being sold in  Russia, with at least 300 skins being sold in the black market in Moscow  in summer 2005. Most of these were obtained illegally from the  Commander Islands Biosphere Nature Reserve. Since then we have been  informed that a further 300 Sea Otter skins were being sold openly in  the black market at Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, with 200 of them from the  Commander Islands. Most of these skins will be sold on to the markets  in China (IOSF 2006).

With the exception  of Prince Edward Island, Canada, populations of North American river  otters are now stable or expanding among conservation jurisdictions,  although diligence is needed to ensure that historical problems  encountered by the species do not reoccur. Therefore, the species is  listed as Least Concern, based on significant population recovery after  undergoing past population declines, which is currently justified and  defensible.<br/></p>","<p>Adult North American river otters weigh from about 5 to 15 kg (Melquist <em>et al.</em>  2003). Size varies among geographic areas, with males typically larger  than females. River otters display delayed implantation, resulting in a  period of almost one year from time of breeding until giving birth.  Young generally are born in February and March, and breeding occurs  shortly thereafter, well before the young are independent (Liers 1951,  Hamilton and Eadie 1964). Males and females are sexually mature at two  years of age, but variation in the reproductive age has been reported  (Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Docktor <em>et al.</em> 1987). Litters typically are comprised of 1 to 3 young (Hamilton and Eadie 1964, Tabor and Wight 1977, Docktor <em>et al.</em>  1987). Maximum life expectancy is typically about 10 years of age in  the wild and up to 20 years of age in captivity (Stephenson 1977,  Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003). <br/><br/>The North American river otter is  an aquatic-habitat generalist, capable of exploiting virtually all  freshwater systems, estuaries, and some coastal and marine areas  depending on the availability of adequate prey and riparian cover  (Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003). The diet of the river otter is comprised  mostly of fish, but amphibians (mostly frogs), crustaceans (mainly  crayfish), and birds may also be eaten depending on the region and  season (Sheldon and Toll 1964, Knudsen and Hale 1968, Stenson <em>et al.</em> 1984, Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1990, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1994, Stearns <em>et al.</em>  2011). Typically, the slowest moving and most abundant fish (e.g.,  members of the sucker and minnow families) species are preyed upon most  (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1990, Stearns <em>et al.</em> 2011). Depending on availability, crayfish in some areas exceed the importance of fish in the river otter diet (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1990). River otters prefer undisturbed riparian with adequate cover to serve as denning and resting sites (Swimley <em>et al.</em> 1998, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2011). Both diet and riparian habitat use vary based on regional differences in aquatic systems and associated conditions. <br/><br/>Ultimately,  river otter populations are limited by the distribution of suitable  aquatic and riparian habitats. Consequently, any factors that reduce the  quantity or degrade the quality of aquatic environments will adversely  affect populations. River otters are often associated with aquatic  habitats modified by the construction of dams and lodges by the American  beaver (<em>Castor canadensis</em>) (Reid <em>et al.</em> 1994; Swimley <em>et al.</em>  1998, 1999). River otters are otherwise most active during nocturnal  and crepuscular periods (Melquist and Hornocker 1983, Stevens and  Serfass 2008). The extent of travel is influenced by sex, age class,  region, season, and habitat conditions (Spinola <em>et al.</em> 2008). Males occupy larger home ranges than females (Melquist and Hornocker 1983, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1994, Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003, Spinola <em>et al.</em>2008). Home ranges for river otters occupying riverine habitats in Idaho ranged from 8 to 78 km<sup>2</sup>  (Melquist and Hornocker 1983). River otters generally maintain low  population densities (e.g., about 1 otter per 3.58 km of riparian  habitat in Idaho; Melquist and Hornocker 1983), apparently without the  need for overt (aggressive) displays of territoriality. Although  considered to be territorial, home ranges of adjacent individuals may  overlap to varying degrees based on gender and season (Melquist and  Hornocker 1983, Spinola <em>et al.</em> 2008). River otters likely avoid  aggressive interactions by practicing mutual avoidance through olfactory  communication facilitated by scent marking at latrines. Predation on  river otters has been reported, but is generally considered rare. River  otters are presumably most vulnerable to being attacked and killed by  larger predators when travelling overland or visiting latrine sites  (e.g., gray wolves [<em>Canis lupus</em>], bobcats [<em>Lynx rufus</em>], coyotes [<em>Canis  latrans</em>], domestic dogs [<em>Canis familiaris</em>] (Gable <em>et al.</em> (2017), and mountain lions [<em>Puma concolor</em>]; see Melquist <em>et al.</em>  [2003] for a review of these and other reported examples of predation).  However, there are isolated reports of river otters being preyed on in  water (e.g., by the American alligator (<em>Alligator mississippiensis</em>);  (<em>Crocodylus acutus</em>) (see Lariviere and Walton 1998). Trapping river  otters for fur is an important human-induced mortality factor in many  conservation jurisdictions in the USA and Canada (Bricker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>","Threats to otter populations in North America vary among regions and are  influenced by type, distribution, and density of aquatic habitats and  characteristics of human activities. Prior to settlement of North  America by Europeans, otters were widespread among aquatic habitats  throughout most of the continent (Hall 1981, Melquist <em>et al.</em>  2003). The synergy of unregulated trapping and loss or degradation of  aquatic habitats through filling of wetlands and development of coal,  oil, gas, tanning, timber, and other industries resulted in extirpations  or declines in otter populations in many areas (Toweill and Tabor 1982,  Melquist and Dronkert 1987). River otter declines were particularly  severe in the USA, where, by 1980, populations were considered  completely extirpated from 11 states and had experienced severe declines  in nine other states (Nilsson (1980). The most severe population  declines occurred in interior regions where fewer aquatic habitats  supported smaller otter populations. Over the last 40 years  reintroduction projects and factors that control trapping intensity have  facilitated the recovery of extirpated river otter populations in many  areas of North America (Raesly 2001, Bricker <em>et al.</em> 2016).  Improvements in the conservation status of river otter populations in  North America, particularly the USA, constitutes a substantial  conservation success story, but efforts are still needed to guard  against complacency in conserving the species and in addressing ongoing  and potential threats that may be overlooked by failing to understand  ecological aspects of the species throughout its range.  <br/><br/><em>Fur  trapping </em>- The River otter has transitioned from a species of  conservation concern in many areas of North America to one that is now  widely legally trapped for fur, including states where the species was  reintroduced (Bricker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). This trapping of river  otters is generally considered by management authorities in the USA and  Canada to be sustainable. However, increases in river otter harvest have  furthered the need for implementing reliable approaches for monitoring  the long-term status of populations, which is currently lacking  throughout most of North America, especially where river otters are  trapped for fur. Bricker <em>et al.</em> (2016) showed that relatively  few USA states or Canadian provinces and territories that harvest river  otters have formal monitoring protocols for assessing either the  density or the distribution of populations, except for recording annual  trapper-kill levels and sometimes deriving demographic data from those  killed otters. <br/><br/>An important issue that has not been meaningful,  relates to levels of trapping that may enable perpetuation of local  populations at levels below biological carrying capacity, but inhibits  natural expansion. Interestingly, reintroduced river otter populations  appear to have expanded rapidly with protection from legal trapping  (Becker <em>et al.</em>&#160;in press). Such outcomes necessitate an  introspective review of why legally trapped, native populations  seemingly did not expand at rates comparable to reintroduced  populations. This outcome suggests that trapping native populations of  river otters, even if sustainable at local levels may, have diminished  natural expansion by some of these populations. A better understanding  of the dynamics of sustainable trapping in relation to natural expansion  of river otter populations is in need of additional research attention.  Expansion of river otter populations is undoubtedly associated with the  combination of better trapping regulations, downward trends in the  number of trappers, and periods of lower fur prices, which further  diminishes levels of trapping intensity. Understanding the interaction  between trapping and expansion of populations will be particularly  important in areas where there is relatively high levels of river otter  trapping (and the trapping of species that often result in the  unintended capture of river otter, e.g., American beavers) or if there  is a general increase in number of trappers and intensity of trapping  pressure. However, particularly lacking is an integrated approach that  can be applied overtime and conservation jurisdictions to meaningful  assess population trends.  <br/><br/><em>Monitoring </em>- Trapping river otters  for fur is regulated, but population-level effects need better  monitoring. The influence of water quality and riparian disturbance need  better evaluation based on categories of pollutants and disturbances.  Formalized monitoring is important for examining expansions and  contractions of river otter populations in relation to various  management schemes (e.g., reintroductions and trapping) or environmental  conditions (e.g., presumed habitat quality). Science-based trapping  management is based on the premise that wildlife populations can be  harvested sustainably. To ensure that this criterion is met, some level  of monitoring to understand changes in the size, age and gender  structure, as well as the distribution of trapped populations is  necessary. The Appendix II listing of the river otter by CITES mandates  the tagging of all river otter pelts intended for export outside of the  U.S. and Canada (USFWS 2014). Records kept as part of the pelt tagging  process ensure that wildlife agencies in jurisdictions where river otter  are legally trapped will document the number of individuals harvested  annually. Most conservation jurisdictions do not have population  estimates for river otter populations. Instead, trapping data where  river otters are legally trapped or accidental captures of otters (where  otters are protected, but caught in traps intended for legally trapped  species) is often used to assess population trends (e.g., Chilelli <em>et al.</em>  1996). Unfortunately, in contrast to the grid-based monitoring protocol  followed for the Eurasian otter (<em>Lutra lutra</em>) in portions of Europe, no  standardized landscape-level approaches are in place to serve as a  basis for meaningful landscape-level assessments to levels of population  declines or recoveries of the North American river otter – past of  present. Erb <em>et al.</em> (2018) provided rationale to justify adequacy  of current techniques used to monitor river otter populations in North  America, and presented a map depicting the extensive, range-wide  recovery of river otters. However, this depiction does not portray the  overall paucity of uniform and consistently applied approaches for  monitoring river otter populations at various scales and among  conservation jurisdictions.  The map presented by Erb <em>et al.</em>  (2018) highly overestimates the actual occurrence of river otter in the  landscape by not portraying the species in relation to the availability  and abundance of suitable aquatic habitats, and serves to demonstrate  the inadequacy of current approaches to monitor river otter populations  (see Hubbard and Serfass (2005) for an example of limitations in  depicting the distribution of river otters at various landscape scales,  and as an example of the standardized, large-scale, and integrative  approach used to monitor population Eurasian otters). Development of  formal monitoring techniques, standardized (and thus comparable) across  conservation jurisdictions and regimes (e.g., trapped versus non-trapped  populations), should be regarded as a priority for assessing and  mitigating long-term threats to river otter populations.<br/><br/><em>Limited  research on native populations</em> - Understandably, a large portion of  research with river otters over the last 40 years has focused on  evaluating aspects of reintroduced populations. However, comparable  focus on native populations has lagged, with the notable exception of  basic information derived largely from examination of carcasses obtained  in areas where river otters are trapped, including carcass tagging  associated with CITES requirements associated with the river otter’s  Appendix II listing. Basic natural history information is lacking for  river otters inhabiting coastal environments, particularly along the  Atlantic coast of North America, and northern portions of Canada.   <br/><br/><em>Sub-optimal  habitat use and oil spills -</em>&#160;Water pollution and other degradation of  aquatic and riparian habitats may limit distribution of otters and pose  long-term threats if enforcement of water quality standards is not  maintained and enforced. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent  source of water pollution in some areas that eliminates prey base for  otters and thereby inhibits recolonization or expansion of otter  populations. Expansion of reintroduced and, in some cases, native river  otter populations has resulted in the species now sometimes inhabiting  areas formerly considered sub-optional habitats (i.e., areas with  degraded water quality and riparian conditions). Consequently, there is  potential for the paradigm to develop that river otters are tolerant of  perturbations to aquatic environments, in lieu of long-term supporting  evidence. Current optimism about river otters being able to tolerate a  wider range of aquatic habitat disturbances may be misleading and  unfounded in that such disturbed areas could represent sink habitats,  where populations are sustained by dispersing individuals and not  through adequate levels of reproduction and survival by individuals  occupying the area. Assessments of source-sink dynamics is needed for  river otter populations inhabiting aquatic system with various types and  levels of pollutants, and riparian perturbations. The threat of oil  spills to river otters has been well studied and documented in Alaska  Oil spills (e.g., Bower <em>et al.</em> 2003). Additional research is  needed to clearly delineate the impact of possible threats to  populations that various forms of water pollution, agricultural and  other development along riparian habitats, industrial and housing  development in coastal areas, cumulative impacts related to loss or  alterations of wetlands, large flood control structures, and  interactions that these and other factors have on otter populations.<br/><br/><em>River  otter-human conflicts</em> - The reintroduction of river otters in many  states has in some cases been negatively depicted in the media because  of the species’ predatory (i.e., fish eating) habits. The successful  reintroduction of river otters in the states of Missouri, Ohio,  Kentucky, and Illinois was followed by strikingly similar patterns of  negative media messages suggesting that river otter predation was having  widespread negative impacts on commercially-reared fish and game fish  important to anglers (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 2014). Management actions,  including opening trapping seasons, subsequently were implemented in  these states purportedly to alleviate the public concern and animosity  portrayed in the media about river otters. Wildlife agencies responsible  for managing trapping of river otters in some cases appear to have been  complicit in fostering negative portrayals about river otter predation  to gain public support for trapping seasons. Such negative portrayals  have the potential to contribute long-term deleterious consequences  regarding public attitudes towards river otters, thereby liming the  value of this species in serving as a flagship to promote conservation  of aquatic ecosystem (Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2011). In contrast, the  Eurasian otter has been used extensively and successfully as a flagship  to promote clean-water initiatives in Europe. <br/><br/><em>River otter  genetics</em> - River otters from Louisiana have most commonly been used as a  source for reintroduction projects in the US—about 64% of river otters  reintroduced in the US were obtained from this state. Serfass <em>et al.</em> (1998) and Brandt <em>et al.</em>  (2014) discussed genetic implications for river otter reintroductions  in North America. Ultimately, how genetic introgression associated with  expansion of reintroduced populations will influence the genetic  structure and subspecies delineations of river otter populations in  North America is unknown and should be the focus of future  investigations as a basis for developing strategies to that best ensure  maintenance of the species’ historic levels of genetic variability.   <br/><br/><em>Disease</em> - Diseases in wild otter populations is poorly understood and has received relatively little study (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1995).<em> Lontra canadensis </em>may be affected by canine distemper (Harris 1968, Park 1971), rabies (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1995), respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection (Hoover <em>et al.</em>  1984, Route and Peterson 1991). In addition, North American Otters can  contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia  (Harris 1968). North American Otters host numerous endoparasites such as  nematodes (Hoberg <em>et al.</em> 1997), cestodes (Greer 1955), trematodes (Hoover <em>et al.</em> 1984), the sporozoan <em>Isopora </em>(Hoover <em>et al.</em> 1984), and acanthocephalans (Hoberg <em>et al.</em> 1997, Hoover <em>et al.</em> 1984). Ectoparasites include ticks (Eley 1977, Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1992), sucking lice <em>Latagophthirus rauschi </em>(Kim and Emerson 1974), and the flea <em>Oropsylla arctomys</em> (Serfass <em>et al.</em> 1992).<p></p>","By the early to mid-1900s North American river otter populations had  experienced extensive declines caused by various human perturbations  (e.g., unregulated trapping and water pollution). However, the combined  implementation of 22 successful reintroduction projects in the USA,  reduced trapping pressure, and implementation of environmental  regulations that improved water quality resulted in the recovery and  expansion of river otter populations in many areas (Raesly 2001, Bricker  <em>et al.</em> 2016). <br/><br/>Although, historically and currently  dispersed over a large geographic area in the USA and Canada, the  occurrence and abundance of the river otter ultimately is determined by  differences in the availability and productivity of aquatic habitats,  with largest populations occurring in coastal habitats (e.g., highly  productive coastal marshes associated with the Gulf of Mexico) and  populations largely excluded from regions where permanent water was  limited (e.g., permafrost regions of Canada and arid portions of the  southwestern United States). Population densities for the species are  poorly understood for most regions and habitat conditions in North  America.  Examples of estimates that have been derived show densities of  1 river otter per 1.25-3.60 km of coastline in Alaska (Testa <em>et al.</em>  1994) to 1 river otter per 3.9 km of riverine habitat in Idaho  (Melquist and Hornocker 1983). Population estimates are expensive and  difficult to calculate for species that are elusive, highly dispersed,  and often occur at low population densities, like the river otter (Kohn <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). Instead, field-sign surveys (e.g. detecting scats at latrines,  but also other signs such as tracks in the snow) have been used in many  areas of North America to reliably determine the presence or absence of  river otters (e.g. Reid <em>et al.</em>&#160;1987, Shackelford and Whitaker 1997, Swimley <em>et al.</em>&#160;1998, Melquist <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Gallant <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Ben-David 2010, Stevens <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Just <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). These types of evaluations should be incorporated with studies  intended to determine population densities through extracting DNA from  scats as a means of enhancing approaches used to monitor overall size  and distribution of populations (Fike <em>et al.</em> 2004). More recently, Mowry <em>et al.</em>  (2011) applied the use of genetic technology for a mark-recapture  approach in estimating river otter densities along several riverine  systems in Missouri, USA. However, the application of this technique  must consider natural history aspects of the river otter to account for  differences in spraint-marking by individuals based on sex and  seasonality (e.g. Olson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, 2009; Stevens and Serfass 2008; Serfass <em>et al.</em> 2019), so as not to violate various assumptions associated with mark-recapture studies.&#160;<br/>Trapping  for fur constitutes a substantial human-induced form of mortality on  river otter populations. Trapping river otters continued during periods  of population declines in regions where viable populations persisted  (Nilsson 1980, Toweill and Tabor 1982, Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003). The  recovery of river otter populations has coincided with an overall  expansion in areas were the species is legally trapped for fur. From  2006–2012, 170,894 (x̅ = 24,413; SD = 6,642; range: 17,055–35,128) and  82,698 river otters (x̅ = 11,814; SD = 1,283; range: 9,604–13,934) were  respectively trapped in the USA and Canada (Bricker <em>et al.</em> 2016).<p></p>",Stable,"At the time of the America’s first European colonization, the North  American river otter was one of the most widely distributed mammalian  species in North America, occurring in an area roughly bounded within  25° 08’–68° 20’ N latitude and 55° 30’–162° 49’ W longitude  (Anderson 1977, Melquist <em>et al.</em> 2003).  The species’ historic  range included a variety of coastal and inland aquatic habitats  throughout much of the North American continent, from arctic Alaska and  northern Canada to the southern USA (Hall 1981, Melquist <em>et al.</em>  2003). By the mid-1950s the North American river otter had undergone  severe population declines including local and regional extirpations  throughout extensive portions of its historic range, especially in many  non-coastal areas of the USA and southern Canada. However, river otters  have recovered in many areas and now occupy aquatic habitats in at least  portions of its historic range in each USA state (except Hawaii, where  the species never occurred), Canadian province or territory, (except  Canada’s Prince Edward Island where the populations are extirpated,  although there is some evidence of individuals recolonizing the  province). Recently, there is evidence of a population of North American  river otters occupying an area of northern Mexico (Gallo-Reynoso 2019).",For Use and Trade information see under Threats.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The North American river otter is included in CITES Appendix II. This  listing is in place to assure that the ongoing legal trade does not  contribute to illegal trade of similar species of otters with a higher  level of conservation concern (i.e., what is referred to as “look-alike”  species, which could be illegally integrated with the legal trade of  species with a similar appearance. See USFWS, 2014). Although trapped  for fur, the overall trade in the fur of North American river otter  generally should be regarded as sustainable. Considering that the river  otters had experienced substantial declines caused by unregulated fur  harvest in the 1800s and degradation of aquatic habitats through the  mid-1900s, the current status of the species should be regarded as a  substantial conservation success story. These declines were particularly  severe in the USA, where, by 1980, populations were considered  completely extirpated from 11 states and endangered in 9 others (Bricker  <em>et al.</em> 2016). However, populations have since expanded to  occupy at least portions of the river otter’s historic range in all USA  states and Canadian Provinces, except Prince Edwards Island (where there  is recent evidence that some individuals may be pioneering the  Province). The overall increase in the distribution and abundance of  river otters was facilitated by a combination of reintroduction projects  implemented in 22 states, improvements in aquatic habitat quality, and  the natural expansion of native populations range (Bricker <em>et al.</em>  2016). The conservation status of river otter populations in North  America has improved considerably through progressive conservation  efforts, including implementation of clean water regulations (e.g., the  federal Clean Water Act, EPA undated).   <br/><br/>Camp (2017) provides a  comprehensive literature review for the North American river otter,  which will be extremely useful in developing conservation planning and  developing conservatin0related research projects.<p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Their population is currently estimated at approximately 6,600 adults in 39 subpopulations, of which only 1,400 are mature individuals. Population size is continuing to decline as a result of ongoing habitat fragmentation, conflict with human activities, and infectious disease. Given uncertainty surrounding population estimates, and the species’ tendency to population fluctuations, the largest subpopulations might well number &lt;250 mature individuals, thereby warranting listing as Endangered under criterion C2a(i).","African Wild Dogs are generalist predators, occupying a range of habitats including short-grass plains, semi-desert, bushy savannas and upland forest. While early studies in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, led to a belief that African Wild Dogs were primarily an open plains species, more recent data indicate that they reach their highest densities in thicker bush (e.g., Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania; Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe; and northern Botswana). Several relict populations occupy dense upland forest (e.g., Harenna Forest, Ethiopia; Malcolm and Sillero-Zubiri 2001). African Wild Dogs have been recorded in desert (Lhotse 1946) (although most desert populations are now extirpated), but not in lowland forest. It appears that their current distribution is limited primarily by human activities and the availability of prey, rather than by the loss of a specific habitat type.<br/><br/>African Wild Dogs mostly hunt medium-sized antelope. Whereas they weigh 20–30 kg, their prey average around 50 kg, and may be as large as 200 kg. In most areas their principal prey are Impala (<em>Aepyceros melampus</em>), Greater Kudu (<em>Tragelaphus strepsiceros</em>), Thomson's Gazelle (<em>Eudorcas thomsonii</em>) and Common Wildebeest (<em>Connochaetes taurinus</em>). They will give chase of larger species, such as Common Eland (<em>Tragelaphus oryx</em>) and African Buffalo (<em>Syncerus caffer</em>), but rarely kill such prey. Small antelope, such as Dik-dik (<em>Madoqua</em> spp.), Steenbok (<em>Raphicerus campestris</em>) and Duiker (tribe Cephalophini) are important in some areas, and warthogs (<em>Phacochoerus </em>spp.) are also taken in some populations. African Wild Dogs also take very small prey such as hares, lizards and even eggs, but these make a very small contribution to their diet.<br/><br/><strong>Generation length</strong><br/>Data on lifetime reproductive success of 19 alpha (breeding) females in western Zimbabwe indicate that 50% of reproductive output was achieved by age 5.5 years (SD 1.35, range 3–8; G.S.A. Rasmussen, unpubl. data). An alternative method, considers the average age of mothers of known litters, without the need for data on lifetime reproductive success. This method gives good agreement with the IUCN recommendations on calculating generation length, indicating a mean female breeding age of 5.7 years from the Zimbabwe dataset. Using this method, data from 18 litters born in Kenya to known-age mothers suggest a mean generation length of 5.0 years (R. Woodroffe, unpubl. data). Both studies suggest a minimum age at first breeding of approximately three years. Based on these data, for convenience we have estimated changes in African Wild Dog populations using a generation time of five years.","The principal threat to African Wild Dogs is habitat fragmentation, which increases their contact with people and domestic animals, resulting in human-wildlife conflict and transmission of infectious disease. The important role played by human-induced mortality has two long-term implications. First, it makes it likely that, outside protected areas, African Wild Dogs may be unable to coexist with increasing human populations unless land use plans and other conservation actions are implemented. Second, African Wild Dog ranging behaviour leads to a very substantial ""edge effect"", even in large reserves. Simple geometry dictates that a reserve of 5,000 km² contains no point more than 40 km from its borders – a distance well within the range of distances travelled by a pack of African Wild Dogs in their usual ranging behaviour. Thus, from an African Wild Dog's perspective, a reserve of this size (fairly large by most standards) would be all edge. As human populations rise around reserve borders, the risks to African Wild Dogs venturing outside are also likely to increase. Under these conditions, only the very largest unfenced reserves will be able to provide any level of protection for African Wild Dogs. In South Africa, “predator proof” fencing around small reserves has proved reasonably effective at keeping dogs confined to the reserve, but such fencing is not 100% effective (Davies-Mostert <em>et al</em>. 2009) and is unlikely to be long-term beneficial for wildlife communities.<br/><br/>Even in large, well-protected reserves, or in stable populations remaining largely independent of protected areas (as in northern Botswana), African Wild Dogs live at low population densities. Predation by Lions, and perhaps competition with Spotted Hyaenas, contribute to keeping African Wild Dog numbers below the level that their prey base could support. Such low population density brings its own problems. The largest areas contain only relatively small wild dog populations; for example, the Selous Game Reserve, with an area of 43,000 km² (about the size of Switzerland), is estimated to contain about 800 African Wild Dogs. Most reserves, and probably most African Wild Dog populations, are smaller. For example, the population in Niokolo-Koba National Park and buffer zones (about 25,000 km²) is likely to be not more than 50–100 dogs. Such small populations are vulnerable to extinction. ""Catastrophic"" events such as outbreaks of epidemic disease may drive them to extinction when larger populations have a greater probability of recovery – such an event seems to have led to the local extinction of the small African Wild Dog population in the Serengeti ecosystem on the Kenya-Tanzania border. Problems of small population size will be exacerbated if, as seems likely, small populations occur in small reserves or habitat patches. As discussed above, animals inhabiting such areas suffer a strong ""edge effect"". Thus, small populations might be expected to suffer disproportionately high mortality as a result of their contact with humans and human activity.","<strong>Background</strong><br/>African Wild Dogs are rarely seen, even where they are relatively common, and it appears that populations have always existed at very low densities. Table 2 in the supplementary material (see below) presents estimates of the sizes of African Wild Dog subpopulations occupying all discrete areas of resident range identified by participants in the range-wide conservation planning process (IUCN SSC 2008, 2009, in prep.). These comprise a total of 39 distinct subpopulations estimated to range in size from two to 276 mature individuals.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the number of “mature individuals” is challenging, because African Wild Dogs are obligate cooperative breeders: within a pack, the alpha male and female are the parents of the majority of surviving pups (Girman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1997). The IUCN Red List User Guidelines (IUCN 2010) define mature individuals as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction”, but do not specify the time period within which reproduction is considered possible. The User Guidelines go on to state “in many taxa there is a pool of non-reproductive (e.g., suppressed) individuals that will quickly become reproductive if a mature individual dies. These individuals can be considered to be capable of reproduction”.<br/><br/>In African Wild Dogs, a high proportion of individuals are indeed reproductively suppressed, but these animals do not always become reproductive “quickly” if an alpha individual dies. In a mature pack, most pack members are offspring of the alpha pair; for these animals, death of an alpha would usually not open up a breeding opportunity because no unrelated mates would be available within the pack. In our experience, death of an alpha often leads to disintegration of the pack, with no breeding until new packs are formed. Given these complexities, and in keeping with the spirit of capturing a “snapshot” of current conditions, we have chosen to define mature individuals as those considered capable of reproduction within the current breeding season. The number of mature individuals thus comprises the number of alpha males and females, and the number of sub-dominant (i.e. non-alpha) animals which breed successfully.<br/><br/>Table 1 in the supplementary material (see below) provides demographic data to allow the estimation of numbers of mature individuals (Nm) from the census population of adults and yearlings (Nc). Using these data, the number of alpha males (NaM) and females (NaF) would be estimated thus:<br/><br/>NaM = Nc x 0.55 x 0.176<br/>NaF &#160;= Nc x 0.45 x 0.215<br/><br/>Reassuringly, these equations return approximately equal estimates of the numbers of alpha males and alpha females.<br/><br/>No published estimate is available of the proportion of adults and yearlings which breed successfully as sub-dominants. However, Girman et al. (1997) report the proportions of surviving pups with sub-dominant mothers and/or fathers. Using a simple assumption that litter size was unrelated to social status, we therefore estimate the number of sub-dominant breeders (Nsub) as:<br/><br/>Nsub = (NaM x 0.10) + (NaF x 0.08)<br/><br/>The number of mature individuals is then calculated as&#160;<br/><br/>Nm = NaM + NaF + Nsub<br/><br/>We made exploratory calculations to investigate the effect of including the probability of currently-suppressed individuals surviving and breeding in subsequent years. These calculations became highly complex, and risked double-counting animals which might breed as sub-dominants in the current year and then attain alpha (dominant) status in later years. It is also important to note that, in the previous listing, the number of mature individuals was estimated simply as the number of alpha animals (i.e., NaM + NaF). These alternative ways of calculating numbers of mature individuals contribute to considerable uncertainty about African Wild Dog numbers.<br/><br/><strong>Current population size</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong></strong>Table 2 in the supplementary material (see below) presents estimates of the sizes of African Wild Dog subpopulations occupying all discrete areas of resident range identified by participants in the range-wide conservation planning process (IUCN SSC 2008, 2009, in prep.). These comprise a total of 39 distinct sub-populations estimated to range in size from two to 276 mature individuals. Few wild dog subpopulations have been systematically monitored, and these estimates are subject to considerable imprecision. This imprecision, combined with uncertainty about the calculation of mature individuals, and the species’ propensity for substantial population fluctuations, means that these population estimates should be viewed with great caution. Lack of precision has important consequences for Red List assessment; the two largest sub-populations (estimated at 268 and 276 mature individuals) are only slightly larger than one of the threshold sub-population sizes used by the Red List criteria (250 mature individuals: EN C2(i)). Had only alpha animals been considered mature individuals (as in the previous assessment), the sizes of these two largest sub-populations fall to 246 and 253 respectively. This uncertainty needs to be taken into account in comparing estimates of African Wild Dogs’ population sizes with IUCN Red List criteria.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Change in population size</strong><br/>Data on African Wild Dogs’ past global population size are taken from Ginsberg and Woodroffe (1997). It is important to note, once again, that few of these population estimates are based on systematic monitoring, and all should be viewed with caution. Assessing changes in population size is complicated by the fact that a less complete dataset was available in 1997 than in 2012. As a result of these improved data, the global estimate of African Wild Dog population size is in fact higher for 2012 than for 1997. However, this difference reflects the greater area surveyed in 2012.<br/><br/>To try to overcome this problem, Table 3 in the supplementary material (see below) compares estimates of subpopulation size in 1997 (taken from Ginsberg and Woodroffe 1997) with estimates of African Wild Dog subpopulations from the same areas in 2012. Subpopulations known in 2012 but not known in 1997 are excluded. However, sub-populations known to be absent in 1997 (e.g. the managed metapopulation in South Africa, and the sub-population in Laikipia District, Kenya) are included in Table 3 . Hence, Table 3 represents our best assessment of a like-with-like comparison of African Wild Dog numbers in 1997 and 2012<br/><br/><strong>Causes of decline</strong><br/>The causes of African Wild Dogs’ decline are reasonably well understood and include extreme sensitivity to habitat fragmentation as a consequence of wide-ranging behaviour, conflict with livestock and game farmers, accidental killing by people in snares and road accidents, and infectious disease. All of these causes are associated with human encroachment on African Wild Dog habitat and, as such, have not ceased and are unlikely to be reversible across the majority of the species’ historical range.<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Fluctuations in population size</strong><br/>Populations of African Wild Dogs are prone to marked fluctuations at a variety of temporal and geographical scales which are likely to both increase extinction risks and undermine the precision of population estimates. At the local scale, a combination of high mortality, high fecundity, and dispersal by both sexes means that pack size fluctuates substantially over short periods (Figure 1 in the supplementary material), although fluctuation in numbers of mature individuals would be less dramatic. Because African Wild Dogs are seasonal breeders across most of their remaining geographic range, fluctuations may be synchronised across packs (see Figure 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>The same demographic characteristics – high mortality, high fecundity, and long-distance dispersal – likewise lead to fluctuations at the population scale. This pattern is further exaggerated by the species’ susceptibility to infectious disease which can cause rapid die-offs. Local extinctions are not uncommon, and are often both rapid and unanticipated. Figure 2 in the supplementary material presents data from three relatively well-documented cases of local extinction involving small wild dog subpopulations affected by rabies.<br/><br/>Similar die-offs have been documented in larger African Wild Dog populations. For example, five of 12 study packs in Botswana (Alexander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and three of eight study packs in Kenya (Woodroffe 2011) have been reported as having died within short time periods during disease outbreaks. Although these relatively large study populations recovered, the majority of African Wild Dog sub-populations are estimated to comprise ≤20 mature individuals and could be severely compromised by outbreaks of this size.<br/><br/>For comparison, under good conditions African Wild Dog populations are also able to grow relatively quickly. African Wild dogs’ capacity for very long-range dispersal means that sub-populations sometimes reappear unexpectedly and grow rapidly; examples include natural recoveries in Samburu and Laikipia Districts, Kenya (Woodroffe 2011), Savé Valley Conservancy in Zimbabwe (Pole 2000), and the Serengeti ecosystem of Tanzania (Marsden<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2011). As an example of the speed of recovery, the subpopulation in Laikipia District, Kenya, grew from 0 in 1999 to 17 adults and yearlings in two packs by 2000, and by 2006 had increased 10-fold to 170 adults and yearlings (Woodroffe 2011).<br/><br/>On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that African Wild Dogs show substantial population fluctuations, but may not experience extreme fluctuations in sub-population size as outlined in the Red List guidelines. Nevertheless, the substantial fluctuations which do occur contribute to further uncertainty about sub-population sizes.",Decreasing,"Historical data indicate that African Wild Dogs were formerly distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, from desert (Lhotse 1946) to mountain summits (Thesiger 1970), and probably were absent only from lowland rainforest and the driest desert (Schaller 1972). They have disappeared from much of their former range. The species is virtually eradicated from North and West Africa, and greatly reduced in Central Africa and North-east Africa. The largest populations remain in southern Africa (especially northern Botswana, western Zimbabwe, eastern Namibia, and western Zambia) and the southern part of East Africa (especially Tanzania and northern Mozambique).<br/><br/>The current geographic distribution of African Wild Dogs was estimated using data compiled by the IUCN SSC range-wide conservation planning process for Cheetahs and African Wild Dogs, including regional strategies (IUCN SSC 2008, in prep.) and subsequent associated national action plans (<a href=""http://www.cheetahandwilddog.org"">www.cheetahandwilddog.org</a>). Current African Wild Dog range was considered to comprise only the “resident range” identified by participants in the IUCN SSC process: this represents land where participants were confident that African Wild Dogs had been confirmed to be resident within the previous 10 years. Land where residence was not confirmed (e.g., possible range, unknown range) was excluded.","Across most of its geographical range, there is minimal utilization of this species. There is evidence of localized traditional use in Zimbabwe (Davies and Du Toit 2004), but this is unlikely to threaten the species’ persistence. There are also some reports of trade in captive and wild-caught animals from southern Africa; the possible impact of such trade is currently being assessed.",Terrestrial,"Conservation strategies have been developed for the species in all regions of Africa&#160;Sillero-Zubiri&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Woodroffe&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997, (IUCN SSC 2008, 2009, in prep.), and many range states have used these strategies as templates for their own national action plans (Department of Wildlife and National Parks 2008, Wildlife Service 2010). Although each regional strategy was developed independently through a separate participatory process, the three strategies have a similar structure, comprising objectives aimed at improving coexistence between people and African Wild Dogs, encouraging land use planning to maintain and expand wild dog populations, building capacity for wild dog conservation within range states, outreach to improve public perceptions of wild dogs at all levels of society, ensuring a policy framework compatible with wild dog conservation. These strategies are accessible at <a href=""http://www.cheetahandwilddog.org"">www.cheetahandwilddog.org</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Gaps in knowledge<br/></strong>Several pieces of information are needed to enable more effective conservation of African wild dogs. These include: 1) development of cost-effective methods for surveying wild dogs across large geographical scales; 2) surveys of wild dog distribution and status, particularly in Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan; 3) development of locally-appropriate and effective means to reduce conflict between wild dogs and farmers; 4) establishing which techniques will be most effective and sustainable for protecting wild dogs from disease; and 5) determining the landscape features which facilitate (or prevent), wild dog movement over long distances and hence promote (or block) landscape connectivity.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is therefore evaluated as Near Threatened.,"The species uses a variety of &#160;habitats and elevations, especially montane evergreen forest (Jaramillo <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is most common in humid zones of <em>Scalesia </em>evergreen forest (dominated by treelike <em>Scalesia pedunculata</em>), where it can reach densities ten times higher than in arid or agricultural zones (Dvorak <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2019). It feeds on arthropods, including wood-boring beetle larvae (Jaramillo <em>et al</em>. 2020). Ecologically, it fills the role of a woodpecker or nuthatch and uses tools, such as sticks, to extract larvae from timber.","Habitat loss owing to human activities is thought to be a major threat. Endemic <em>Scalesia </em>forest on Santa Cruz had decreased to 1-2% of its original size by 2009 and has been invaded by introduced tree species (Dvorak&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). Spraying with herbicides to control these invasive plants may have reduced invertebrate abundance.&#160;Introduced herbivores are also thought to have had a negative impact on the species, causing significant damage to native vegetation.&#160;The species is known to be susceptible to the parasitic fly <em>Philornis downsi</em>&#160;and highly susceptible to avian pox (Dvorak <em>et al</em>. 2012; Bulgarella <em>et al</em>. 2019). Droughts may have a negative impact on the species (Dvorak <em>et al</em>. 2012).","The species is locally common and widespread (Jaramillo <em>et al</em>. 2020). In recent surveys, the population was estimated at 2,693 pairs (1,583-5,091) on Santiago, at 31,500 pairs (26,783-64,432) on Isabela, at 28,914 pairs (18,350-46,807) on Santa Cruz and at 10,121 pairs (8,237-16,781) on San Cristóbal (Galápagos Landbird Project unpubl. data <em>per </em>M. Dvorak and B. Fessl <em>in litt</em>. 2021). The population on Fernandina is likely below 1,000 pairs (Galápagos Landbird Project unpubl. data <em>per </em>M. Dvorak and B.

The total population is therefore estimated at roughly 75,000 pairs, equating to 150,000 mature individuals, with a minimum of roughly 55,000 pairs (110,000 mature individuals) and a maximum of roughly 135,000 pairs (270,000 mature individuals).<br/>The species is thought to form three subspecies (Jaramillo <em>et al</em>. 2020): Subspecies <em>striatipecta </em>occurs in San Cristóbal (10,121 pairs, equating to 20,242 mature individuals), subspecies <em>producta </em>in Fernandina and Isabela (32,500 pairs or 65,000 mature individuals) and subspecies <em>pallida </em>on Santiago, Santa Cruz and potentially Santa Fé and Pinzón (31,607 pairs or 63,214 mature individuals).",Decreasing,"This species is found only in the Galápagos Islands (<strong>Ecuador</strong>), where it occurs on the islands of Fernandina, Isabela, Santiago,<em> </em>Santa Cruz and San Cristóbal.

The species's range is extremely small, within which habitat quality is thought to be declining as a result of the invasive Little Fire Ant, and the species's entire range could quickly be affected by a threat such as predation by Black Rats, should rat control cease. For these reasons, the species is listed as Critically Endangered.<p></p>","It is only found in dense forest between 80 m and 400 m in altitude at the bottom of valleys, close to permanent or temporary streams (Thibault&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Portier 2010)<strong></strong>. Nowadays, its forest habitat is dominated by the introduced African Tulip tree&#160;<em>Spathodae campanulata&#160;</em>(Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), and the tree ""mara"" <em>Neonauclea forsteri</em> is the last native common feature of the valleys where it survives (Thibault <em>et al.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. It is highly territorial, foraging both in the canopy and the undergrowth for insects (Pratt <em>et al.</em> 1987)<strong></strong>. Its nest is constructed in a fork of mara or Tulip Tree (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). It lays eggs year-round, with more laying occurring between August and January, peaking in November (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It has a low reproductive productivity (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).","Predation by the Black Rat (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) is thought to have been the main cause of the monarch's historical decline, and still poses a significant threat (Thibault <em>et al</em>. 2002). The monarch population in the upper Maruapo valley declined from 33 to 12 individuals over 2002-2009 in the absence of rat control (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, 2020). Rat control measures have been effective in substantially reducing the level of predation by rats (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).<br/><br/>The introduced Red-vented Bulbul (<em>Pycnonotus cafer</em>) and Common Myna (<em>Acridotheres tristis</em>)&#160;have also been identified as serious ongoing threats (Thibault <em>et al.</em> 2002, Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Ghestemme 2011). Colonisation by Red-ventel Bulbul was implicated in a recent decline of the monarch population (Thibault <em>et al.</em>, 1999, 2002). A three-year study showed that significantly more Red-vented Bulbul and Common Myna&#160;were present in territories that experienced nest failure or early fledgling death (<strong></strong>Blanvillain <em>et al. </em>2003). Common Myna has been implicated in the predation of eggs and chicks while in the nest and probably following fledging, and may cause injuries to adults (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, C. Blanvillain <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2018). Red-vented Bulbul has been implicated in reducing chick survival by disrupting the reproduction of paired Monarchs and competing for food and territories (Thibault&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Ghestemme 2011). Following extensive control measures, in 2018 it was noted that the Common Myna had disappeared from the range of the monarch, and the Red-vented Bulbul had become less common for the third consecutive year (SOP-Manu 2018). Control of invasive birds was shown to have resulted in increased reproductive success for the monarch (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>A more recent threat is the spread of Little Fire Ants (<em>Wasmannia auropunctata</em><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv"">) (M. O'Brien and C. Blanvillain&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2015). This invasive species is able to advance&#160;50 to 100 metres per year in colonies covering tens of hectares of land (Blanvillain 2019). It predates bird nests and competes with native species for food, and Tahiti monarchs have been observed to have deserted several territories following their invasion by Little Fire Ants (Bousseyroux <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). From 2012, three supercolonies eventually covering a total of 70 ha became established at the entrances of the valleys where the monarch is found (SOP-Manu 2018). Following control measures, the area of the colonies was reduced by 85% by the end of 2018 (SOP-Manu 2018, Blanvillain 2019, Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), but treatments have ceased and the Little Fire Ant has once again continued to expand its range (C. Blanvillain <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>Other potential predators include cats and Swamp Harrier (<em>Circus approximans</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Ghestemme 2009)<strong></strong>. Tahiti Kingfisher (<em>Todiramphus veneratus</em>)<em> </em>is an aggressive native competitor which has been observed driving several monarchs off their territory (Ghestemme 2009)<strong></strong> and preventing colonisation of suitable sites by young monarchs (Ghestemme 2011).&#160;<br/><br/><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv""><span class=""_Xbe kno-fv"">Invasive plants are a further likely threat, as forest on Tahiti is now largely composed of introduced invasive species such as&#160;<em>Miconia calvescens&#160;</em>and&#160;the African tulip tree (<em>Spathodea campanulata</em>), which have substantially modified the forest structure and ecology (Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013)<strong></strong>.

In 2015, 53 adults (but only 13 breeding pairs) fledged 14 young (Blanvillain<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018). The population size has continued to rise, and in 2018 the population size was estimated at 79 adults (Blanvillain 2019, Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), followed by an estimated 91 adults in 2019 (C. Blanvillain&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). The species has a low reproductive rate; a study found that only 56% of pairs attempt to lay an egg in any year. (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Between 2015 and 2019, the number of breeding individuals was 26, 28, 28, 34 and 48 (C. Blanvillain <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Therefore, the number of mature individuals is placed in the band 25-100 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The distances between the range valleys are small, and an individual transferred from Maruapo to Tiapa in 2009 was found to have moved back to its original Maruapo territory in 2012 (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). However, differences have been observed between the calls of individuals in each valley, and ringed individuals have not been confirmed to move between the valleys spontaneously (C. Blanvillain <em>in litt. </em>2020). The species is therefore thought to have 1-3 subpopulations.",Increasing,"<em>Pomarea nigra</em> is endemic to Tahiti in the Society Islands, <strong>French Polynesia</strong>. It was previously common throughout the island, but was apparently rare throughout the 20th century and, during the period 1986-1991, was noted in only four valleys out of 39 visited (Monnet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993)<strong></strong>. By 1998, the species had disappeared from two of the valleys where it had been recorded during 1986-91, but it was found in two additional valleys, and was then known to occur in Papehua, Orofero, Tiapa and Maruapo valleys, in the Paea and Punaauia districts in the south-west of the mainland (Gaze and Blanvillain 1998, Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). In 2001, a further population was discovered upstream in the Maruapo valley,&#160;beyond several waterfalls (Blanvillain&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). By 2010, the population in the Orofero valley had disappeared (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, 2018). In 2015, the total area used as territories by the species was estimated at 0.5 km<sup>2</sup> (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway<br/></strong>An action plan was produced in 2013 (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013) and renewed in 2018 (C.

Rat control was subsequently scaled up, and was more successful when conducted throughout the year and over the entire valley (Gouni 2006). When control was confined to monarch territories only, re-invasions occurred on a regular basis (Blanvillain <em>et al. </em>2002)<strong></strong>.&#160;An extensive trapping programme of Common Myna and Red-vented Bulbul has been performed since 2000. This has involved shooting, poisoning and trapping within monarch territories and at the entrances to the range valleys (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, SOP-Manu 2018). This has led to the removal of thousands of birds, the elimination of the Common Myna and an increased nesting success of the Tahiti Monarch (Blanvillain <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). In 2009-2011, 13 Tahiti Kingfishers were captured in the Papehue valley and moved to areas away from monarch populations, with the aim of reducing competition. Following removal of the kingfishers, new colonisation of these areas by young monarchs was observed (T.

174111773,12520,Lynx pardinus,Endangered,D,2015,2014-04-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p>  </p><p></p>  <p></p><p>After six decades of decline and pronounced range contraction, between 2002 and 2012 population size of the Iberian Lynx has continuously increased to 156 mature individuals in the two remaining wild subpopulations (Simón et al. 2012). Likewise, the area of occupancy experienced a three-fold increase to reach 1,040 km². One subpopulation contains 68% of all mature individuals. Twelve mature individuals survive in two additional localities where reintroductions are currently under way (Simón et al. 2012). As a result of the increasing population size, the Iberian Lynx no longer qualifies for Critically Endangered status and is therefore listed as Endangered under criterion D. The improved status of this species is all due to intensive ongoing conservation actions.<br/><br/>Detailed demographic projections suggest that future range expansion and population increase depend upon continued reintroductions. In the absence of reintroductions, a marked decline would quickly re-occur and extinction is predicted to occur within 35 years (Fordham <em>et al</em>. 2013). Major future threats include uncertainty about the identity and intensity of environmental drivers on lynx prey in regions where conservation efforts are currently concentrated, and uncertainty about the suitability of these regions for lynx under future climate change (Fordham <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/></p>  <p></p>","<p>The Iberian Lynx is a strict feeding specialist; the European Rabbit (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) accounts for 80-99% of its diet (Ferreras <em>et al.</em> 2010). The Iberian Lynx is also a habitat specialist that breeds only in Mediterranean shrubland containing dense rabbit populations (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2000, Palomares 2001). Threshold rabbit densities for lynx reproduction are 4.5 ind./ha during the annual population peak and 1.0 ind./ha during the annual trough (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2001). Productive breeding territories also contain a high density of scrub-pasture ecotones which favour both ecological conditions for rabbits and a structure suitable for lynx hunting (Palomares 2001, Fernández <em>et al. </em>2003). Other essential habitat elements include natural cavities that are used as natal dens (Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2006). On the other hand, forestry landscapes, farmland or other open land devoid of native shrubs are rarely used by resident lynx (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 1991) but occasionally used by subadults during natal dispersal (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2000).</p>","During the 20th century hunting and trapping were major sources of mortality associated with predator control and exploitation of wild rabbits (Rodríguez and Delibes 2004). Whereas the importance of this factor as a threat for Iberian Lynx has decreased (Ferreras <em>et al</em>. 2010), during the last years some lynx have been shot or caught with illegal traps (Iberlince LIFE Project 2014). Road casualties typically produce several losses each year (Simón <em>et al</em>. 2012, Iberlince LIFE Project 2014), as the length of paved or widened roads, as well as average traffic loads, have significantly increased in and around lynx areas (Ferreras <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Homogenization of mosaic cultural landscapes due to agricultural and silvicultural intensification during the 20th century conceivably contributed to lynx decline (Rodríguez and Delibes 2002, Ferreras <em>et al</em>. 2010). Continued trends of abandonment of marginal livestock farming and loss of small game, sometimes followed by afforestation, further reduce the amount of potentially suitable habitat for reintroduction. Without viable land uses, maintaining suitable mosaic landscapes for the Iberian Lynx would require enduring and expensive intensive management (Rodríguez 2013). Even in landscapes with suitable structure and subject to intensive conservation management, rabbit abundance exhibits large temporal variability closely tracked by the probability of lynx breeding (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2001, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2007, Iberlince LIFE project undated).<br/><br/>Effective population size does not exceed 25 for each isolated subpopulation (Casas-Marcé <em>et al</em>. 2013), announcing further losses of genetic diversity and accumulation of inbreeding through genetic drift. Indeed, persistent small population size over lynx generations, especially in the lowlands of the Doñana region, have produced signs of both demographic and genetic deterioration, including biased sex-ratios, decreased age of territory acquisition and litter size, and increased mortality due to disease and other natural causes (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2012). Lowered demographic and genetic performance could positively interact in the form of an extinction vortex (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>As a manifestation of global change, human-assisted spread of virulent diseases affecting European Rabbits had catastrophic effects on Iberian Lynx populations in the past (Ferreras <em>et al</em>. 2010). Although rabbits could eventually develop resistance, viral diseases remain a recurrent threat as the arrival of new strains may cause again a lasting depression of food availability for the Iberian Lynx. Moreover, the prevalent rabbit lineage in southwestern Iberia, where rabbit restocking and other conservation measures take place, might be more vulnerable to rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) than the northeastern lineage (Real <em>et al.</em> 2009). For example, a new RHD strain has been blamed for an annual 62% decrease in productivity (average number of kittens per territorial female) in Andújar-Cardeña subpopulation (Iberlince LIFE project, undated). Likewise, diseases affecting felids also spread, sometimes with the help of uncontrolled pets that become feral or visit lynx areas from nearby towns. For example, in 2007 a feline leukaemia outbreak killed a substantial fraction of lynx in Doñana (López <em>et al</em>. 2009, Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2011a). Finally, detailed models combining ecological niche and metapopulation dynamics show that, without intensive intervention, climate change will rapidly decrease lynx populations and would probably lead to Iberian Lynx to extinction within 35 years (Fordham <em>et al.</em> 2013).","The extensive survey by Guzmán <em>et al. </em>(2004), carried out primarily during 2001, yielded an estimate of 26-31 breeding territories which could correspond to a maximum of 62 mature individuals. According to estimates produced in the framework of successive European Union LIFE Nature conservation projects, population size tripled from 52 mature individuals in 2002 to 156 in 2012 (Simón <em>et al. </em>2012, Simón 2013).",Increasing,"The Iberian Lynx is restricted to two separate regions of southwestern Spain, namely eastern Sierra Morena and the coastal plains west of the lower Guadalquivir. These isolated subpopulations have been named by Simón <em>et al</em>. (2012) as Andújar-Cardeña and Doñana-Aljarafe, respectively. Two new nuclei are being founded though reintroduction 30 km southwest (Guadalmellato) and northeast (Guarrizas), respectively, of the existing Sierra Morena subpopulation, and contained a few breeding females in 2012 (Simón 2013). Five additional sites in four Spanish regions (Andalusia, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, Murcia) and Portugal are being prepared for reintroduction; the first release in Portugal happened in late 2014 (Iberlince LIFE project 2014).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation actions undertaken during the last decade have been reviewed by Ferreras <em>et al</em>. (2010), Palomares <em>et al</em>. (2011b) and especially Simón <em>et al</em>. (2012).<br/><br/>The main goal of habitat management is increasing prey density. Food management includes supplementation of rabbits within enclosures and boosting wild rabbit populations. Attempts to augment rabbit numbers are carried out basically through restocking in or out predator-proof enclosures, but also acquiring rabbit hunting rights or enhancing pastures and refuge for wild rabbits. Other important resources for lynx that may be in short supply in some localities, such as cavities usable as breeding dens or artificial water spots, are provided. Management is applied to sites where suboptimal habitat quality may preclude settlement of subadults born nearby.<br/><br/>Although hunting or trapping might not be as important a mortality factor as it was in the past, lynx areas are regularly monitored for illegal traps. Measures for traffic calming and some crossing facilities have been implemented especially in road black spots. Awareness campaigns systematically performed in and around lynx areas as well as in reintroduction sites warn about the drastic effects of poaching on small populations, and informs on the conservation benefits and ecosystems services associated with Iberian Lynx preservation. Parallel education programmes target schools and the general public, which may be also engaged as volunteers.<br/><br/>Several NGOs and public administrations acquire rights on specific land uses, or help landowners to maintain their properties compatible with the conservation of the Iberian Lynx by compensating economic losses in which owners incur as a result of conservation action.<br/><br/>Some adult lynx have been translocated in order to alleviate the effects of inbreeding in the Doñana subpopulation. Additional wild individuals have been translocated some 30 km away as founders of two ongoing reintroduction attempts in Sierra Morena. A few captive-born individuals have also been used in reintroductions, after the first births of the captive-breeding programme took place in 2005 (Vargas <em>et al</em>. 2009). To date the <em>ex situ</em> conservation programme for the Iberian Lynx have produced over 270 individuals, and as the captive population has been built, captive-born animals are expected to be regularly used for reintroduction (Iberian Lynx Ex-situ Conservation Programme 2014). Recent models show that, to be effective, reintroductions should take into account the joint effects of climate change, prey abundance and habitat connectivity (Fordham <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The Iberian Lynx is fully protected in Spain and Portugal, listed on CITES Appendix I, and on Appendix II of the Bern Convention, and Annexes II* and IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive.<br/><br/><u>Future actions</u><br/><br/>Two main avenues can be envisaged for lynx conservation, namely consolidation of existing populations and recolonization, either natural or assisted.<br/><br/>Continued intensive management, mainly in the form of habitat enhancement and increased prey density (Ferreras <em>et al</em>. 2010, Simón <em>et al</em>. 2012), has been suggested to resist the progressive effects of an extinction vortex whose symptoms can be noted at least in the Doñana population (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2012). Other components of intensive management include reduction of mortality rates from road casualties or game management (Rodríguez and Delibes 2004), and prevention of disease outbreaks transmitted by domestic animals or wildlife reservoirs (Millán <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Natural recolonization requires increasing the chances for floaters to survive and establish in large areas surrounding occupied nuclei (Rodríguez and Delibes 2003, Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2011b, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2012). These areas may be too large for intensive species-based management to be an option, but a shift to area-based, softer management could be considered. Such management could include tax incentives for small game management, reduced transportation, industrial or urban developments, enforcement of regulations on predator control, and awareness campaigns directed to local people.<br/><br/>Regarding assisted recolonization, so far wild lynx made the bulk of founders for reintroduced populations. Continued extraction of wild lynx might not be sustainable in the long term if consolidation of existing nuclei is aimed and if extractions reduce the chances of natural colonization by surplus dispersing lynx. Individuals produced by the captive breeding programme may progressively increase their proportion in the groups of founders. This may be accompanied by an improvement of the performance (survival and eventually reproduction) of released captive-bred individuals, perhaps by raising them in semi-natural conditions. Design of the genetic composition of founders should alleviate the markedly low genetic diversity of wild populations (Casas-Marcé <em>et al</em>. 2013). Adaptive selection of new reintroduction sites should also consider both present and forecast ecological suitability (Fordham <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/>  <p></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,"Global, Europe & Mediterranean"

It arrives on its breeding grounds between late-April and May and breeds from late-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in highly dispersed (Kear 2005) solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). After mating (from June onwards), males migrate long distances prior to their flightless moult, most travelling in small groups to inshore or offshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988). Females and juveniles leave the breeding grounds in September (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious when not breeding (Madge and Burn 1988) with males forming large congregations during the flightless moulting period (Kear 2005). Large flocks of several hundred to a thousand (Snow and Perrins 1998) or occasionally over 100,000 individuals can be observed during winter (Scott and Rose 1996). Non-breeders often oversummer on the wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on Arctic dwarf heath (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005) or boggy tundra on pools, small lakes, streams (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and slow-flowing rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for freshwater habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) with low banks (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), small islets (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys<strong><sup> </sup></strong>or among mossy bogs (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). It generally avoids areas with steep slopes or wetlands enclosed by forest (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) the majority moult and overwinter at sea (Kear 2005) or shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep (Kear 2005) (optimally 5-15 m [Scott and Rose 1996]) with abundant benthic fauna (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. barnacles and shrimps [Johnsgard 1978]), worms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), echinoderms, isopods, amphidods (Kear 2005) and insects&#160;(e.g. midges and caddisflies [del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992]) as well as small fish<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and fish eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as seeds, roots and tubers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) close to water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) or placed further away in dwarf heath (Kear 2005).</p>    <p></p>","<p>Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions have been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011), and future ocean acidification may lead to sustained declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten the species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while oil drilling sites could also cause low-level impacts through human disturbance and degradation of food resources (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). In parts of the range, avoidance of busy shipping areas by flocks of the species could displace flocks from preferred feeding areas. Hunting represents another threat to the species, with an average of 9,500 birds reported to be shot annually in the US and an additional 7,000 per year in Canada through the 1980s and 1990s. However, the actual number killed may have been much higher with maximum estimates exceeding 24,000 in the US in 1974 and 23,000 annually in Canada between 1974 and 1982 (Bordage and Savard 2011). Since this period, numbers of hunters have decreased considerably and the annual harvest has fallen concomitantly. The species is susceptible to avian influenza and may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is unlikely to affect the majority of the population at once and only small numbers of birds tested in various countries have developed the disease despite evident exposure to the virus. High-speed ferries can cause disturbance to this species (Larsen and Laubek 2005). In some areas, the breeding habitat is threatened by eutrophication from agricultural nutrient loads (Kear 2005).<span class=""pageassessmentclassschemecontent""></p>  <p></p>","The total population is estimated to number c.530,000-830,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006), probably including c.350,000-560,000 mature individuals, on the basis that they account for around 2/3 of the population.

The newly-introduced tree disease known as Rapid 'Öhi'a&#160;Death may also cause declines. Overall, a population reduction of 30-49% is suspected to occur over the next ten years and so the species is listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It occurs primarily in mesic and wet forests dominated by&#160;‘öhi‘a and koa (Scott&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986). It&#160;was formerly found in forests at any elevation, and still occurs in a variety of native, disturbed and unnatural habitats from 300 to 2,900 m (Berger 1972, Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The greatest densities (and approximately 90% of the population) are found at 1,300-1,900 m, with much lower densities below 1,000 m, except in dry areas of Kona, Hawai‘i, where moderate densities have been recorded down to 300 m&#160;(Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986, Paxton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). It is nectarivorous, with nectar from 'öhi'a&#160;(<em>Metrosideros polymorpha</em>) and mämane (<em>Sophora chrysophylla</em>) forming a major part of the diet, and also feeds on foliage insects and spiders (Ralph &amp; Fancy 1995, 2020). It makes long flights to locate nectar sources and makes seasonal movements to lower altitudes in response to 'öhi'a and mämane flowering events (Ralph and Fancy 1995, Guillaumet <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Evidence for hybrization with another honey creeper, the 'Apapane <em>Himatione sanguinea </em>has been documented (Knowlton <em>et al.</em> 2014).<p></p>","The species is very susceptible to avian malaria (<em>Plasmodium relictum</em>)&#160;(Scott <em>et al.&#160;</em>1986, Jacobi and Atikinson 1995). Malaria is transmitted by the introduced southern house mosquito&#160;<em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em>. Nine of ten individuals bitten by a single mosquito infected with avian malaria died within 37 days (Atkinson <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). Research on the Alaka‘i&#160;Plateau&#160;found the species to have very low malaria prevalence, with just one infected individual detected in 1994 and none in the period 2007-2013, whilst research at Hakalau found an increase in malaria prevalence from 0% in 1988-1992 to 8% in 2001-2002 (VanderWerf 2012). A study on Hawai‘i&#160;island from&#160;1992–1998 and from 2001–2005 found an overall infection rate of 2.6%, with an infection rate of 2.2% at higher elevations, and an infection rate of 20% at mid elevations (Samuel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The annual risk of an adult individual becoming infected with malaria was estimated at 0.23, and the mortality rate for all infected individuals was estimated at 0.93 (Samuel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>Both the&#160;<em>Culex quinquefasciatus </em>mosquito and the <em>Plasmodium relictum</em>&#160;parasite develop more easily at higher temperatures, and the resultant prevalence of malaria at lower elevations is thought to explain the Iiwi's current concentration at higher elevations (LaPointe <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Increased temperatures associated with climate change may increase the prevalence of malaria at higher altitudes in the future (Freed <em>et al. </em>2005, Paxton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Research suggests that temperatures at higher elevations may now be high enough to allow mosquitoes and hence malaria to spread throughout the species's range (Atkinson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Paxton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The Iiwi's seasonal movements to lower altitudes to track floral resources also place them at increased risk from malaria (Guillaumet <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). A model of the impact of climate change predicted that the species will lose 59.9% of its range between 1990–2010 and 2080–2100 (Fortini&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Another model of the impact of malaria under climate change projected that the species may be close to extinction by 2100 (Guillaumet <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Recently introduced pathogens,&#160;<em>Ceratocystis</em><em>&#160;lukuohia and C. huliohia</em>, both of which cause Rapid 'Öhi'a&#160;Death (R.O.D.), or 'Öhi'a&#160;Wilt, have spread rapidly across the Hawaiian islands and caused extensive mortality of 'öhi'a&#160;(Keith&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), which is an important food and nesting plant for Iiwi. The effects of R.O.D.&#160;were noticed on Hawai‘i&#160;by 2012, the disease was first identified in 2014 (Keith&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and the <em>Ceratocystis</em> species involved were confirmed in 2018 (Barnes <em>et al.</em>).&#160;<em>Ceratocystis </em>sp. have now spread across much of the lowland forests on Hawai‘i&#160;island, as well as on Kauaʻi and&#160;Oʻahu (Mortenson <em>et al. </em>2016, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources 2020). In 2016, it was estimated that approximately 200 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of forest on Hawai‘i&#160;had been affected (Hughes 2016, in USFWS 2017a), including in some areas within the range of the Iiwi (Hughes 2016 and Keith 2016, in USFWS 2017b), and by 2019, more than 600 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of forest were affected (Fortini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Surveys of infected forest have found that an average of 25% of 'öhi'a&#160;trees were dead (Camp <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Surveys in an infected area of forest found that the density of another Hawaiian honeycreeper, the Hawaii Amakihi (<em>Chlorodrepanis virens</em>), declined by 79% between 2003-2004 and 2016, following the infection of the forest with R.O.D.&#160;(Camp <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). If R.O.D. spreads into forest at higher elevations, if could cause rapid declines in Iiwi populations (Camp <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Based on a model of the potential range of&#160;<em>C.</em><em>&#160;lukuohia </em>across Hawaii under current climatic conditions (Fortini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), it has a high chance of infecting up to around 40% of the Iiwi's range.&#160;<em>C.</em><em>&#160;lukuohia </em>appears to be associated with higher temperatures (Fortini <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), so climate change could facilitate its spread into higher elevations.<br/><br/>Feral ungulates, including cattle (<em>Bos taurus</em>), feral sheep (<em>Ovis aries</em>), mouflon sheep (<em>Ovis gmelini</em>), feral goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>), and Axis deer (<em>Axis</em><em>&#160;axis</em>) have degraded habitat quality by browsing, causing soil erosion, disrupting forest regeneration, spreading alien plant seeds, and facilitating the invasion of alien plants. Feral pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>) destroy understory vegetation and provide breeding sites for mosquitoes. Invasive plants including strawberry guava (<em>Psidium cattleianum</em>) degrade habitat (VanderWerf 2012), and their invasion is likely to be facilitated by climate change (Vorsino <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Introduced rats (<em>Rattus sp.</em>) may predate on the species, although there is little direct evidence for this. The species is affected by avian pox (<em>Avipoxvirus sp.</em>), but it is not known whether this impacts on the population size.&#160;<br/><br/>Forests have been cleared for agriculture, cattle-ranching and development (Fancy and Ralph 2020).

This included 277,055&#160;birds in the northeastern part of the island (at Hakalau), 71,524&#160;birds in the central eastern part of the island, 28,325&#160;birds in the southeastern part of the island, 3,489 birds in south Kona, western Hawai‘i,&#160;139,829 birds in central Kona, 22,787&#160;birds in north Kona, and 802 individuals in the Kohala Mountains (based on surveys in&#160;1976-1983; Scott <em>et al.</em> 1986). The 1976-1983 population in the Kohala Mountains was later re-estimated at&#160;690 (Burnett 2020). Following further surveys in 2017, the Kohala Mountains population was estimated at 4,928 (2,910 - 8,345) individuals (Burnett 2020), although differences in survey timing may have affected the comparability of the results.&#160;At Mauna Kea, the population was estimated to number 802 birds in 1979-1983 (Scott&#160;<em>et al.</em>1986).&#160;</span></p><p>During 1976-1983, the population on east Maui was estimated at 19,000&#160;± 2,000 individuals (Scott&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986).

The difference between the 2001 and 2011-12 estimates may be partly attributed to a decline, and partly attributed to survey error (Paxton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Following further surveys in 2017, the 2011-2012 population size was re-estimated at&#160;37,574 individuals, and the 2017 east Maui population size was estimated at 50,252 (43,908–57,146 95% C.

Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Its core breeding areas are located in endemic palm forest dominated by coco de mer <em>Lodoicea maldivica</em>. The species nests in tree cavities mainly in dead coco de mer palms, but they have also been recorded to nest in cavities in other palms and living broadleaf trees (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a), with breeding activity from October to March (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013; Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Deep cavities in hollow <em>L. maldivica</em> trunks with dense canopy cover over the entrance are preferred (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Breeding activity fluctuates widely between years (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016), with approximately one year in four showing minimal or no breeding activity.&#160;In one study, 53% of nests were found to be successful out of 36 nest attempts with 57% fledgling survival to one year (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014a). It is also found in cultivated areas and residential areas with gardens, which are suitable feeding habitats (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016). It feeds on a range of plant species, the majority of which are endemic and native (Reuleaux <em>et al. </em>2014b). It mainly feeds on the fruit pulp, followed by seeds and buds, with occasional observations of feeding on leaves, flowers, bark and scale insects (Reuleaux <em>et al.</em> 2014b).","The decline in this species prior to the 1960s is thought to have been driven mainly by predation by introduced rats and hunting by settlers and farmers (Rocamora and Laboudallon  2013). Other causes of increased mortality have included capture for pets and trade and incidental trapping when other species, namely fruit bats, are targeted. The most serious current threats to the species include ongoing nest predation from rats and cats, poaching of its main nesting tree (coco de mer), and habitat destruction caused by  fires, with potential threats including persecution, netting  of bat species and low genetic diversity (Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Forest fires may represent the most serious threat to the species, with records since the early 1980s showing that approximately every 10 years a large forest fire occurs (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>. 2014). The availability of nesting cavities may be a limiting factor in very active breeding years, with some females occupying sub-optimal cavities. The poaching of coco de mer nuts could reduce the area of palm forest over the long term, although recent anti-poaching measures appear to be successful.&#160;Rose-ringed Parakeets <em>Alexandrinus krameri, </em>which once posed a major threat, have been entirely eradicated from the Seychelles by the Seychelles Islands Foundation. <em>A. krameri </em>carried diseases such as Beak and Feather Disease Virus, which was a serious threat for <em>C. barklyi </em>(Fogell <em>et al.</em> 2018). The impacts of introduced species through nest predation and competition for nest-sites may not yet be serious enough to limit the population; however, mynahs are increasing on Praslin (Dueker 2018). Invasive yellow crazy ants are an emerging threat, with numbers having increased substantially in Praslin's palm forest habitat from 2015-2018. The ants have caused at least two <em>C. barklyi</em> nest failures. Yellow crazy ants are now being controlled with a baiting programme across the Vallée de Mai and other parts of Praslin's remaining palm forest (N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2020). Predation of fledglings by cats and dogs is probably limited and post-fledging mortality is not currently a major concern as most fledglings are seen again in the year after they fledge (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). Another risk factor for the species is the substantial and so-far unexplained fluctuations in its breeding activity, with minimal or no breeding occurring approximately every four breeding seasons (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data).","Point count surveys conducted on Praslin in 2010 and 2011 found a  density of 0.14-0.24 individuals/ha, resulting in a total population  estimate of 520-900 individuals (95% confidence intervals) obtained  through distance sampling methodology (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).  After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. The most recent point count survey in 2018 estimated a population of 1392 (1096-1742, 95% CI) individuals. On the basis of this new data, it is assumed that there are 730-1170 mature individuals in the population.",Stable,"<em>Coracopsis barklyi</em> is resident on Praslin, with occasional non-breeding records on Curieuse (c.1 km north of Praslin), <strong>Seychelles </strong>(Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). Point count surveys conducted on Praslin in 2010 and 2011 found a  density of 0.14-0.24 individuals/ha, resulting in a total population  estimate of 520-900 individuals (95% CI) obtained  through distance sampling methodology (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013).  No individuals were detected on Curieuse during point counts over four  days and during supplementary fieldwork, thus it is assumed that there  is no resident population there (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). Prior to the surveys by Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. (2013), the most recent  population estimate on Praslin was of 645 individuals (95% confidence  intervals: 404-1,034 individuals), using distance sampling at 39 random  points (Walford 2008). However, this study was deemed to have several  methodological and analytical constraints, which meant that assumptions  of the distance sampling method were not met (Walford 2008; Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013) and resulting in an estimate range that was considered too broad to serve as a basis for conservation planning (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013). After reviewing recent survey results, Rocamora and Laboudallon  (2013) estimate a total breeding population of fewer than 200 pairs,  suggesting that there could be fewer than 400 mature individuals. A review of previous survey results indicates that this species&#160;has recovered from a low point of c.30-50 individuals in one area of the island in the late 1960s,  increasing until the at least the turn of the century, with uncertainty  over the trend since then (Reuleaux <em>et al</em>. 2013; Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Surveys in 2018 produced a population estimate of 1382 (1096-1742, 95% CI) individuals on Praslin (Dueker 2018), however this cannot be directly compared to the 2011 population estimate due to differences in survey seasons, which affects the vocalisations (the main detection method) of this parrot.",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species has been protected by law since 1966 (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Endemic palms have been protected since 1991, and the restoration of native palm forest on Praslin and Curieuse is on-going. The species occurs in Praslin National Park, which was established in 1979, and the Vallée de Mai was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Fond Ferdinand and Curieuse island are managed as nature reserves, but they lack official protected status. Fond Peper, an area of mature palm forest of approximately 60 ha, adjacent to the Vallée de Mai, and another area of high quality black parrot breeding habitat, is now also under the management of Seychelles Islands Foundation and being prioritised for conservation. Artificial nest boxes were provided between 1983 and c.2005 (Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013; A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016), although these are now no longer in use, with no apparent ill effects to the population (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data).<br/>There is a firebreak around the core breeding area at Vallée de Mai,   but it is not guaranteed to work in the event of a large fire which   cannot be quickly contained (Seychelles Islands Foundation <em>in litt</em>.  2014). The firebreak proved to be only partially effective when a fire destroyed several hectares of high quality breeding habitat in the south of Praslin in 2010 (A. Reuleaux and N. Bunbury <em>in litt. </em>2016). The poaching of coco de mer nuts is being counteracted with  increased security and a regeneration programme, and awareness-raising  activities have been conducted to reduce persecution by farmers. Rose-ringed Parakeets <em>Alexandrinus krameri </em>were eradicated from Mahé&#160;in 2019 (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). An experimental trial to assess the effects of rat control on <em>C. barklyi</em> breeding success was carried out in 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. And intensive baiting programme to control yellow crazy ants began in 2019 (Seychelles Islands Foundation, unpublished data). <br/>A national action plan for the species was produced in 2009 and includes plans to introduce the species to Silhouette, along with captive breeding on Frégate Island and North Island if appropriate habitat restoration and management can be carried out (reviewed by Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Other conservation actions identified for this species include the control of introduced species, population monitoring and public awareness campaigns (reviewed by Rocamora and Laboudallon 2013). Analysis using statistical models is planned in 2014 after annual counts have been conducted for three years without interruption, and  conclusions regarding the species trend since 1982 will be published  (G.

Due to the ongoing conservation work, there is no longer believed to be a continuing decline in population size, or in the quality or area of the species's habitat. The species therefore no longer qualifies as Endangered. However, the population size remains small (&lt;1,000 mature individuals) and so the species qualifies as Vulnerable. Numbers fluctuate owing to predation and disease, and it seems doubtful that present populations could be maintained without the current intense management programme.<p></p>","The species inhabits native forest and has a diverse diet, including both native and exotic plants (Jones 1987)<strong></strong>. In the early 1990s, the entire wild population nested in a single grove of introduced Japanese red cedar <em>Cryptomeria japonica</em>. However, ongoing studies suggest that rat predation in <em>Cryptomeria</em> is higher than in native vegetation, thus the value of <em>Cryptomeria</em> is unclear (Carter 1998; Swinnerton 2001)<strong></strong>. When restored native vegetation is available for nesting, birds use this in preference over exotic species. The species is territorial and breeds during the dry season (Jones <em>et al. </em>2013). All subpopulations may have a skewed sex ratio, with males outnumbering females (Bunbury 2006); this may explain the occasional presence of male pairs in this species, which hold a territory and build a nest together (Jones <em>et al. </em>1992).<p></p>","Severe loss of habitat has been compounded by continued predation of nests and adults by introduced Crab-eating Macaque <em>Macaca fascicularis</em>, mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>, rats and feral cats (Reese Lind 1994; Swinnerton 2001)<strong></strong>. Invasive plant species reduce the quality of breeding and foraging habitat. Cyclones destroy nests and accelerate habitat degradation (C. Jones <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. Natural food shortages mean that birds must be provided with supplementary food, and these food shortages are exacerbated by competition over resource with rats, exotic birds and macaques&#160;(Jones and Owadally 1988). The disease trichomonosis was brought to Mauritius by alien pigeons (which now act as a reservoir for the disease), a<strong></strong>nd 359 (84.3%) of 429 individual birds screened between 2002-2004 tested positive for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Trichomonas gallinae</span> at least once; however, pathogenicity was found to be low, with active signs of the disease recorded in only 1.9% of birds which tested positive (Bunbury <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Nevertheless, the disease causes significant levels of mortality, especially in juveniles, and it is likely to be limiting population growth (<strong></strong>Swinnerton <em>et al. </em>2005; Bunbury <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). The blood parasite <em>Leucocytozoon marchouxi</em>&#160;may also cause mortality, especially in juveniles (Bunbury 2006).&#160;Inbreeding depression is an ongoing concern (Swinnerton <em>et al. </em>2004)<strong></strong>. This species also may treat calls of the invasive Madagascar Turtle-dove <em>Nesoenas picturata </em>as if they were conspecific; and while there is currently no evidence for hybridisation, males may put more effort into territory defence, which might have a negative impact on breeding success (Wolfenden <em>et al. </em>2015).<p></p>","Jones <em>et al. </em>(2013) estimated the population to number 370-380 individuals in total. The species does undergo fluctuations, and over recent years the&#160;<em>known&#160;</em>wild population has ranged from c.325 to c.410 individuals, while the&#160;<em>possible</em>&#160;wild population has ranged from c.375 to c.490 individuals (N. Zuel&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2017). The <em>known&#160;</em>population as of 2020 is estimated to be 308 individuals, while the <em>possible </em>population may be 488 individuals (S.

It is tentatively assessed that the&#160;population size numbers &gt;250 mature individuals, and so would fall in the range 250-999 mature individuals.",Stable,"<em>Nesoenas mayeri</em> survives in the Black River Gorges of south-west <strong>Mauritius</strong> and on Ile aux Aigrettes off the eastern coast. Although once common, it declined to just 10 wild individuals in 1990, and were it not for intervention, it would have rapidly gone extinct. Since then, intensive management has resulted in a spectacular increase, although the population is still dependent on ongoing intensive management. Since 2000, the population has remained above 300 individuals. Numbers have fluctuated, but in 2007 there were 380 birds (C. Jones <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>, in 2010 the population was estimated at 376-493 birds (V.

In 2020 the population was estimated at 308 known individuals (S. Henshaw 2020, pers. comm.).&#160;Releases have now occurred at an additional three sites, Petrin, Ferney Valley, and Ebony Forest (Tatayah 2013, C. Jones <em>in litt. </em>2017). In 2007, of the five (then) established subpopulations, two were in decline (Plaine Lievre c.110 birds and Bel Ombre c.48 birds), two were increasing (Pigeon Wood c.65 birds and Combo c.65 birds), and the subpopulation on Ile aux Aigrettes was believed to have reached carrying capacity and to be stable at 85 birds (<strong></strong>K.

It is therefore listed as Vulnerable.","It  occupies montane mist-belt evergreen <em>Podocarpus</em> forest in the temperate zone from 1,000-1,400 m (Downs 2015; Collar and Boesman 2017). Although primarily resident, the species undertakes three different types of excursion into lower areas: daily flights,  short visits with overnight stops, and more extensive periodic  wanderings, all largely prompted by the availability of <em>Podocarpus</em> fruits (Collar and Boesman 2017).","Human impacts on indigenous forests, most of which have little visible protection, may affect nest site and food availability. There is a long history of logging by settlers, with selective logging taking place more recently and continued illegal logging in some areas (Downs 2015). Removal of adults from the wild for illegal trade is a potential threat; the number of birds involved is uncertain but it does not currently appear to be having a population-level impact. There is a potential risk that recognition as a species, and CITES listing, could increase international demand for trade in the species in the future (Collar and Fishpool, 2017).

However, since it was stated that it was unknown what proportion of these individuals  were adults, this estimate is considered here to relate to total individuals rather than mature individuals. Treating the population estimate of Downs  (2015) as an estimate of the total number of individuals would also fit  with the estimates presented by Downs <em>et al. </em>(2014) and Downs  and Singh (2016). This estimate could be altered to take into account  the maximum record of 2009, so that the range is 1,100-1,786  individuals, which would roughly equate to 733-1,190 mature individuals, rounded here to 730-1,200 mature individuals. There are estimated to be 60-80 individuals in the isolated Limpopo subpopulation, 500-600 in the Amatole forests, and 400-500 each in the former Transkei and southern KwaZulu-Natal forests (Downs 2015).

Therefore, it is listed as Near Threatened.","This species occupies a variety of habitats generally associated with open areas and short vegetation (Yosef and International Shrike Working Group&#160;2017). This includes parkland, pastures, open woodland, orchards and agricultural land with hedgerows and perching sites (such as fences) and impaling sites for storing food (e.g. barbed wire or vegetation with thorns/spines) (Yosef 1996, Yosef and International Shrike Working Group 2017). Shrike habitat typically includes four 'common elements': 1) foraging areas, typically bare ground and exposed rock, 2) nesting sites, usually small trees and shrubs, 3) perching sites, and 4) impaling sites, often barbed wire, thorns of sharp branches (Pruitt 2000, A. Chabot <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species typically feeds on arthropods, amphibians, and small mammals, birds and reptiles, such as the&#160;<em>Thamnophis sirtalis infernalis</em> (Hughes 2019, Yosef 2020).","Several ideas have been presented that may account for declines in this species (see Lymn and Temple 1991), including pesticides (Anderson and Duzan 1978), fire ant presence in wintering habitats (Lymn and Temple 1991), West Nile Virus (Bertelsen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Smallwood and Nakomoto 2009) and habitat fragmentation and loss, particularly through conversion to agricultural land. The Loggerhead Shrike has been evidenced to be significantly more abundant in better connected areas of suitable habitat (Froehly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019) whilst occupancy significantly increases in areas with greater than 15-25% habitat suitability (A. Chabot <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Migratory connectivity is known to be greater in western <em>L. ludovicianus</em>&#160;populations where the impacts of habitat loss on populations are thought to be reduced, hence western populations may be at comparatively less risk than eastern populations (Chabot <em>et al</em>. 2018). Habitat loss and fragmentation are therefore thought to only be of regional significance, hence in other locations additional factors must be responsible for limiting Loggerhead Shrikes and driving the witnessed declines (Brooks and Temple 1990, Froehly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;The species may have also been persecuted and shot in the past, but this has likely reduced (Yosef 1996).&#160;While the use of certain pesticides is now prohibited in U.S.A. the potential effects of other threats may be likely to continue into the future (Pruitt 2000, COSEWIC 2014). Collisions with vehicles contribute to the species's decline as roads display a number of essential habitat features; 29% of all <em>L. ludovicianus</em>&#160;winter mortality in Virginia has been attributed to collisions on roads (Blumton 1989). Furthermore, intraspecific competition on wintering grounds between migrants and resident shrikes that occupy territories year round likely contributes to the decline of obligant migrant populations of Loggerhead Shrike in north-eastern North America (Brooks and Temple 1990; Cade and Woods 1997; Pruitt 2000; COSEWIC 2000). Loss of habitat in wintering areas may exacerbate competition (Lymn and Temple 1991).&#160;Extreme local weather conditions have been implicated in declines as a result of high nest failure rates (e.g., nest abandonment or loss of young birds during cold wet breeding seasons, especially with heavy rains [Pruitt 2000]) and such threats may increase as stormy conditions are exacerbated under a changing global climate (COSEWIC 2014, Environment Canada 2015a).&#160;Predation of shrikes by a variety of species, including cats, raccoons, crows, magpies, and several raptors has been observed (Blumton 1989; Wiggins 2004) but the significance has not been evaluated. Predation by feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) impacts the endemic subspecies <em>L. l. mearnsi</em>&#160;on San Clemente Island, California, U.S.A. (Gustafson <em>et al</em>. 2020).","Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population to total 7,000,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is a widespread breeder across much of the <strong>U.S.A. </strong>and <strong>Mexico</strong>, extending into southern <strong>Canada </strong>in the breeding season.

The species was incorporated into the Canadian Wildlife Service's Operation Grasslands Community (Yosef 1996) whilst a targeted recovery strategy was developed and implemented in 2015 for subspecies <em>migrans</em>&#160;in Canada, aimed at re-establishing a viable population of the subspecies in Canada where less than 100 wild individuals remain (Environment Canada 2015a). This species has been&#160;successfully reared in captivity with captive-reared juveniles released to augment populations in Ontario and Quebec (as well as San Clemente Island, California); over 400 juveniles released between 2001-2010 with ~76% of such individuals thought to survive from release to migration initiation (Imlay&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Nichols&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Lagios&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).

The North American Loggerhead Shrike Working Group was established in 2013 to undertake 'multi-jurisdictional research and conservation efforts for Loggerhead Shrike and their habitat', guided by the&#160;Loggerhead Shrike Conservation Action Plan&#160;(Loggerhead Shrike Working Group 2017). Accomplishments so far include a&#160;tri-national colour banding program, predictive occupancy and distribution modelling, developing standardised&#160;protocols for shrike surveys and monitoring, and broad-scale surveys and monitoring through the community science program, 'Shrike Force' (Loggerhead Shrike Working Group 2017, J.

Between 2003-2008, the species underwent a rapid population reduction owing to mortality caused by West Nile Virus and whilst declines have slowed, they are still occurring at a sufficient rate to meet the threshold for listing as Vulnerable.","This species inhabits oak savanna, with large trees scattered among broad expanses of open grassland and pasture (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Marzluff and Sharpe 2018). Over recent decades, it has been increasing in suburban settings, notably in the Sacramento Valley. It forages in cultivated fields and orchards. This omnivorous species feeds on a range of items, including invertebrates, small mammals, bird eggs and nestlings, carrion, food discarded by humans, grains, fruits, nuts and other seeds. Nest-building takes place from December through to March, with egg-laying from March to May (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Habitat loss through urban and agricultural developments, as well as  the impacts of Sudden Oak Death, summer droughts and poisons used to  kill ground squirrels were thought to be potential threats to the  species (see Marzluff and Sharpe 2018). These may have caused minor  local declines, but the species was still abundant in other areas  (Marzluff and Sharpe 2018), such that these threats were thought to have  no/negligible impacts on the species as a whole and the population was  deemed to be stable, although Airola <em>et al. </em>(2007) suggest the species may have even increased between 1980/81 and 2001/02. However, since the mid-2000s the population has been in very rapid  decline as West Nile Virus (WNV) sweeps through the population and it is thought to have suffered the largest, range-wide impact from WNV of any bird species (Kilpatrick and Wheeler 2019).

Ground cover is sparse with bare sand patches for foraging and acorn-caching. It rarely uses scrub with more than 15% pine cover. Habitat structure and composition are maintained by frequent fires, and optimal habitat occurs 5-15 years post-fire. Fire frequency for coastal scrub should be greater than that for inland scrub as open sandy areas do not persist in coastal areas for more than a few years (D. Breininger <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). It is permanently territorial, with habitat fragmentation decreasing territory size and resulting in increased predation and reduced reproductive success (USFWS 2019). Dispersal is inhibited by more than 8 km of open, non-scrub habitat or 1 km of forest. First brood eggs are laid from March-June, and true second brood attempts are rare. Some nests benefit from helpers, which increase reproductive success (Franzreb 2007)<strong></strong>. Nests typically occur 1-2 m above the ground in shrubby oaks, and contain clutch sizes of between 1-5 (typically 3-4) eggs (USFWS 2019). It feeds mainly on arthropods, acorns and small vertebrates (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden <em>in litt.</em> 1998, USFWS 2019)<strong></strong>.","Fire suppression in remaining habitat has been identified as a major continuing threat because it causes scrub to overgrow and pine density to increase, rendering habitat unsuitable. Declines on lands specifically protected for the species are largely the result of reduced habitat quality, caused by disrupted fire regimes (Breininger <em>et al.</em> 1999, 2006, 2009, 2010); suitable Florida Scrub-Jay habitat is thought to have declined by 22% between 1999-2012 (USFWS 2019). In addition, extensive habitat fragmentation has led to a high degree of genetic differentiation (Coulon <em>et al.</em> 2008) and additional land protection to increase connectivity within existing genetic units is likely necessary to prevent further fragmentation and loss of genetic diversity (Coulon <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2012).&#160;Reduced immigration into one of the largest remaining populations at Archbold Biological Station has resulted in increased levels of inbreeding and decreased fitness via inbreeding depression, emphasizing the importance of maintaining population connectivity (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2016 ). At Archbold, there is evidence of inbreeding depression at multiple life stages, including hatching failure, juvenile survival, and breeder lifespan (Chen&#160; <em>et al</em>. 2016). Housing developments and citrus-groves have replaced much suitable habitat (G. E. Woolfenden <em>in litt.</em> 1998). The rate of development in Florida has increased markedly since the 1960s as the human population almost doubled between 1960 and 1980 (Cox 1987). Direct human disturbance and feral cats affect the increasing number of territories adjacent to housing (Cox 1987), which can have the knock-on impact of reduced nesting success in suburban areas (see Niederhauser and Bowman 2014), and these individuals can also have reduced egg viability too (see Aldredge <em>et al.</em> 2012). Birds in roadside territories are frequently killed by vehicles (Dreschel <em>et al.</em> 1990, Mumme <em>et al.</em> 2000). Several species of snake, bird and mammal are native predators (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996). Nocturnal predators, including yellow rat snakes <em>Elaphe obsoleta</em>, are a particular threat since breeding birds do not appear to be vigilant to, or defend against, nocturnal predators and brooding females are also at risk from being killed (Carter <em>et al.</em> 2007). Hatching failure has been linked to below-average rainfall during the breeding season (Wilcoxen <em>et al.</em> 2011) and so droughts are likely to pose a threat to the species. The recent spread of West Nile virus to Florida may pose a threat to the species (Chu <em>et al.</em> 2003). An observation of nest-predation by invasive fire ants <em>Solenopsis invicta</em> was reported in south-central Florida in 2009 (Wilcoxen and Rensel 2009) and may be a threat to the reproductive success of the species. Climate change may pose a threat to the species through both increased drought and hurricane frequency and intensity, and sea level rise (USFWS 2019).","The breeding population was 4,000 pairs in 1993 (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 1998), but has declined by &gt;25% since then (Boughton and Bowman  2011) and is now estimated at c.3,000 family groups (R.

In many areas, average group size is below three, thus the global population is suspected to be 6,000-9,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 4,000-6,000 mature individuals. Partners in Flight (2019) however, currently estimate the population to total 7,500 mature individuals, therefore the population is placed here in the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Aphelocoma coerulescens</em> was known from scattered localities in 39 of 40 peninsula counties in Florida, <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, but has declined since the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century and most rapidly since 1950.

Thus the species is listed here as Near Threatened, but future surveys could show that the species is declining at an even greater rate.","This species breeds on small lakes, pools, bogs and streams of the tundra. It mainly feeds on molluscs but will also take crustaceans, with a more varied diet in summer including insects, arachnids, berries and seeds. It feeds by diving, and will pluck or dabble on the surface. Breeding begins in May or June in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1992)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","<p>Climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Warming and sea ice retreat poses an ongoing and future threat to the species’ habitat as sea ice provides an important resting platform when not foraging (Lovvorn <em>et al</em>. 2009). Reductions in ice habitat are predicted to result in large decreases in the area of viable habitat, even in the absence of other impacts such as shifts in food availability (Lovvorn <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; Such habitat shifts have been seen in almost one third of winters between 1998 and 2011, denying access to preferred foraging locations and forcing prey switching, resulting in adult body fat being one third lower than in winters with access to these resources (Lovvorn <em>et al.</em> 2014). A recent modelling study by Christie <em>et al</em>. (2018) reveals that under an RCP 8.5 scenario, the species's abundance will likely increase through to 2040 before declining rapidly through to near extirpation in the late 21st century as the Bering Sea becomes ice-free. There appears to be no difference in mean survival between widely separated breeding areas, indicating that survival is mainly a function of wintering conditions (Solovyeva <em>et al.</em> 2017). Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for the species, and remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith <em>et al. </em>2005, Riordan <em>et al. </em>2006), while the alteration of habitats through coastal erosion, inundation and salinization from storm surges, thawing permafrost, and sedimentation changes due to sea level rise and increased river discharge could change the suitability of current nesting areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, no link between wetland loss and population decline has been made for this species yet. Nevertheless, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region, with unknown impacts on the long-term survival of the species (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Climate change has also been held responsible for severely reducing the Eiders’ benthic prey, likely due to ocean acidification (e.g. molluscs which form a large part of Eider diet) (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017); <em>Macoma calcarea</em>,&#160;a key prey of the Spectacled Eider, is evidenced to be decreasing in abundance throughout sites in the Bering Sea, influencing the Eider's winter foraging (Goethel <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Direct persecution poses another major threat to the species, with 10s to 100s of individuals harvested in Alaska and 10,000-14,000 in Russia per annum (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). This represents around 5% annual mortality, based on a population of 330,000 (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Pollution also threatens this species with lethal and sub-lethal levels of lead poisoning from ingested lead shot found in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding population, with levels high enough to influence regional subpopulation dynamics (Flint <em>et al.</em> 2016, Sea Duck Joint Venture 2016). Exposure to lead reduced estimated survival from 0.78 to 0.44 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010), while the survival of females exposed to lead was 0.34 lower than that of those with blood lead levels at or below background levels (Grand <em>et al.</em> 1998). Lead levels exceeding typical exposure thresholds were found in 30.7% of females in the Chaun Delta, Russia between 2003-2010; however, only 8.8% exhibited levels above the critical threshold (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt</em>. 2012, 2020). Lead shot is likely not a serious threat to Siberian populations due to the low human density in the breeding range (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt</em>. 2020).</p>  <p>Oil spills occur in the species range, and although infrequent, represent a significant risk to the population (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). Oil and gas development on the central coast of Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain has altered nesting habitat, causing potential threats from oil contamination, off-road vehicle use, wetland filling as well as the indirect effects of human disturbance (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, the development related to the petroleum industry is not regarded a significant threat to the species as only a small proportion of the species’s range is within or near developed areas. The risk to eiders from collisions and disturbance resulting from industrial activities and interaction with shipping lanes linked to oil and gas development is thought to be low and is unlikely to have population-level effects (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, but at present, the disease appears not to have any significant effects on the population. Seroprevalence of avian influenza in Spectacled Eider is approximately 90% (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013), but less than 5% tested positive for the virus (Ip <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  Arctic Foxes <em>Vulpes lagopus</em> are present in the species’s range and may contribute to mortality through predation. Density of wolverine and now brown bear appear to have increased in low Arctic tundra as a result of climate change impacts (Solovyeva 2016). Modelling of breeding success indicates that predation is likely to be driving reductions in productivity, although factors operating over winter are likely to be the main drivers of observed declines across the range (Solovyeva <em>et al</em>. 2017a). Changes in the species community composition may be also having an effect, with a decline in Sabine’s Gull <em>Xema sabini</em> and Arctic Tern <em>Sterna paradise</em> (which provide nest protection) and an increase in mammalian predators and Vega Gull <em>Larus smithsonianus vegae</em> potentially leading to reduced breeding success (see Solovyeva and Zelenskaya 2016, Solovyeva <em>et al</em>. 2017b). It is possible that these community changes are a result of climate change (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt. </em>2018).","Wetlands International (2020) estimate the global population to number 360,000-400,000 individuals, in line with the 2010 estimate based on aerial surveys of winter flocks in the Bering Sea of 369,122 individuals, rounded here to 370,000 individuals (Larned&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012).

Nests are generally in trees within closed-canopy forest, (usually in cavities or on stick platforms constructed originally by raptors, wood rats or squirrels) on cliff-ledges in steep-walled canyons (and occasionally in caves (Wilk <em>et al</em>. 2018). Eggs are laid from March to May. Young birds are obligate dispersers, whilst unpaired birds or those that have failed to breed previously also disperse (Forsman <em>et al. </em>2002,&#160;Blakesley <em>et al</em>. 2006, Ganey <em>et al. </em>2014a);&#160;this may help to sustain some sink populations. It may make some movements in winter, including to recently burnt areas as these can have greater food availability (Ganey <em>et al. </em>2014b). It feeds principally on nocturnal mammals.<p></p>","The two principle threats to the Spotted Owl are currently considered to be competition with the Barred Owl (<em>Strix varia</em>) and logging of the species's habitat. Spotted Owl faces strong competition from Barred Owl which is gradually displacing Spotted Owls from much of the northern part of their range, outcompeting Spotted Owls for food and space, reducing Spotted Owl occupancy and breeding propensity, and occasionally hybridising (Kelly and Forsman 2004, Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Wiens <em>et al</em>. 2014, Dugger&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Long and Wolfe 2019, Mangan <em>et al</em>. 2019)<strong></strong>. While&#160;<em>S. varia&#160;</em>is not known to have affected the population trend in California yet, some hybrids have been noted there and it does appear to be spreading into the range of California Spotted Owl (Tempel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014a, Gutiérrez <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2017, Wood <em>et al</em>. 2019). Degradation and fragmentation of its habitat through clear felling and selective logging of large trees is a primary threat to the species (Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2018); with habitat fragmentation shown to correlate with decreased probability of survival (Schilling <em>et al. </em>2013); the rate of logging is however reported to have declined notably in the past 20-30 years (Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, J. Dunk <em>in litt</em>. 2020). This has been compounded by the removal of a legal requirement that the U. S. Forest Service assess the viability of wildlife on national forest lands (Noon and Blakesley 2006)<strong></strong>. Forest loss throughout the species's range is currently estimated at ~7.25% over three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). Populations in the&#160;southwest of its range, California, and dry inland forests of the Pacific Northwest&#160;are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation caused by high-severity fire (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2019) and drought associated with climate change  (see Peery <em>et al. </em>2011, Jones <em>et al. </em>2016, T. Supplee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al. </em>2017, Wan <em>et al</em>. 2019) although low- and moderate-severity fires are not thought to significantly affect the species (see Bond <em>et al</em>. 2002, Roberts <em>et al. </em>2011, Lee <em>et al. </em>2012, Willey and van Riper III 2014, Ganey <em>et al</em>. 2017) and may even create favourable foraging conditions (Eyes <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;Habitat loss to wildfire has been greater than expected in recent years, raising the economic value of remaining habitat (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Projected climate change may result in hotter and drier summers with longer fire seasons and larger more intense fires, as well as increased tree mortality from drought and insects, and uncertainty over the viability of habitat restoration. Further effects from climate change may affect different areas differently (see Peery <em>et al. </em>2011) and could include changes in the frequency and duration of inclement weather during the breeding season (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012); and in the Pacific Northwest it may lead to wetter and warmer winters (Glenn <em>et al. </em>2010). Timber harvesting on private land is a significant threat, as well as renewed pressure to eliminate protections for the species on federal land in Oregon, in order to allow increased logging (T. Supplee  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, R. Gutiérrez&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Unfavourable management includes intensive thinning of suitable habitat,  which is expected to result in declines over the short term (T. Supplee  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011), as well as logging and manipulation of canopy vegetation to reduce the risk of wildfire (B. Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The species may also face high levels of disturbance, especially in recreational areas where it occurs such as National Parks (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Energy development and associated habitat loss and mortalities from collisions with powerlines could also be affecting this species, but the degree of impact is essentially unknown (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Potentially serious threats include West Nile virus, which is fatal to the species (although it may be absent from some subpopulations [Hull <em>et al. </em>2010]), the potential loss of habitat to Sudden Oak Death Syndrome  (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), and avian malaria, which has been discovered in the species and found to weaken infected individuals, probably reducing reproductive success (Ishak<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008, D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Enhanced exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (AR), illegally utilised, in and widely contaminating the remote forests of California, USA, may also be adversely impacting the species (Gabriel <em>et al</em>. 2018, Wiens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019a). Other potential threats have been put forward, for instance it has been mooted that water management could possibly have an impact on the species through indirect effects, though these will require further study (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012, Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 2017).<p></p>","Its population size was estimated at c.15,000 mature individuals (Rich <em>et al</em>. 2004).

Mexican Spotted Owl may be considered to be declining (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012), although Mexican populations may be stable because forestry activities there typically modify rather than destroy habitat (Lammertink <em>et al.</em> 1996, J. M. Lammertink <em>in litt.</em> 1998) and at least locally in New Mexico some subpopualations may be increasing (Ganey <em>et al. </em>2014b). Most other populations are declining and, in some, the decline is accelerating because of clear-felling and selective logging (Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Noon and McKelvey 1996)<strong></strong>. Subspecies <em>caurina</em> is estimated to be in significant decline, at 3.8% per year range-wide and 8.4% per year in Washington State (1985-2013; Dugger&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016), and  is close to extinction in Canada.

Protected Activity Centres are advocated for as an effective mechanism of conserving the species in parts of its range (Verner <em>et al</em>. 1992, Willey and van Riper III 2007)<strong></strong>. In 2012 9.6 million acres of habitat was designated as critical habitat for the Northern Spotted Owl by U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Society for Conservation Biology&#160;2012, Dunk <em>et al</em>. 2019). A captive breeding programme was started at the Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre, British Columbia, with a second attempt in Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. Neither have so far had much success (Moore 2013). Experimental removal of Barred Owls is underway (Oregon Fish and Wildlife Service and U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2013, A.

Conduct research into broad areas of the species's biology such as interspecific interactions, population structure and habitat relationships (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Maintain and restore habitat; large reserves, encompassing suitable habitat and widely distributed are needed to retain the owl's current range and a halt to logging operations throughout parts of its range are required to prevent local extinctions. Use analyses to inform habitat management decisions, and ensure appropriate habitat management, which may involve habitat restoration and recovery (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011, 2012, Peery <em>et al</em>. 2017). Large-scale Barred Owl control efforts are likely to be needed, especially for the Northern Spotted Owl, but may also be required within the range of the California Spotted Owl to prevent local extinctions in parts of the species's range.

Population densities were found to be highest in dry habitats (Dvorak <em>et al</em>. 2019). It tends to avoid dense lowland forest, taller, wetter woodland, grassland and urban areas (Cody 2004)<strong></strong>. The species forages on the ground for arthropods, also taking fruit and berries and occasionally picking ticks (Acarina) off marine iguanas (<em>Amblyrhynchus</em> spp.).  It breeds in January to April, apparently not cooperatively, in contrast to other <em>Nesomimus</em> spp. (Cody 2004)<strong></strong>.<p></p>","The original vegetation on San Cristóbal is highly degraded and disturbed, mainly through overgrazing by goats, human settlements and the introduction of non-native plants (<em>Psidium guajava,&#160;</em><em>Syzygium jambos</em>, <em>Rubus niveus</em>)<em> </em>and animals (e.go. Black Rats <em>Rattus rattus </em>and&#160;feral cats <em>Felis catus</em>) (Curry 1989, Vargas 1996, Dvorak <em>et al</em>. 2019). Moreover, the nestling parasite <em>Philornis downsi</em> is present on the island (Wiedenfeld <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bulgarella <em>et al</em>. 2019).

However, the population in the wild remains dependent on intensive conservation management efforts. The population currently numbers 93 mature individuals, with 62 mature individuals in the largest subpopulation and as a result, it currently meets the threshold for listing as Endangered. However, the population only increased sufficiently above the threshold for listing as Critically Endangered in 2019, hence the species continues to be listed as Critically Endangered under the five-year rule. Should such population increases continue, it will warrant downlisting in 2024.<p></p> <p></p>","Its range includes rocky, open-country scrubland, coniferous forest and oak savanna<strong></strong>. Cavities in ledges on cliffs, rocky outcrops or in large trees are used as nest sites (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong>.  It scavenges on the carcasses of large mammals and also feeds on the carcasses of small mammals. California ground squirrels are a documented small mammal food source in California and a source of lead poisoning as they are routinely shot as nuisance animals on private ranges. Investigations into the amount of small mammal use as a food source in the Arizona/Utah population is ongoing (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Relative to foraging, released birds reach independence soon after release, and may range more than 400 km from release sites (Anon. 1998), though the distance an individual ranges can vary depending on season and individuals released at different sites have shown significantly different home range sizes (Rivers <em>et al. </em>2014), suggesting local ecological factors may play a role.<p></p>","The drastic population decline during the 20th century is principally attributed to persecution and accidental ingestion of fragments and residues from lead bullets and lead shot from carcasses (C. N. Parish <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), resulting in lead poisoning. Lead poisoning remains a key threat and the leading cause of death for released birds (Rideout <em>et al</em>. 2012, Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has caused many fatalities and resulted in the treatment of many more birds (Anon. 2001, Parish <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, Walters <em style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2010).&#160;As a result of their life history strategy, characterised by&#160;high adult survival, long life expectancy, and low reproductive rates, condor populations are particularly sensitive to lead poisoning, which severely impacts adult survival; lead can build up initially in the blood, but then in the bone and tissues to dangerous levels over longer periods having been ingested over a broad area (Hunt&#160;<em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.&#160;</span>2007, S. Kirkland&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020)<strong></strong>. Lead poisoning therefore continues to be the principal threat to condors and at current levels threaten the long-term sustainability of reintroduced populations (Cade 2007, Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2012, Rideout <em>et al</em>. 2012). It was reported in 2009 that over 90% of condors released in Arizona still test positive for lead (Toops 2009) whilst Rideout <em>et al</em>. (2012) determined that lead toxicosis was the leading, identifiable cause of death in juvenile (26% of deaths where the cause could be determined) and adult (67%) free-ranging California Condors since the inception of the reintroduction program in 1992. A study conducted in California, using samples collected in 2004-2009, suggests that around one third of condors have blood lead values associated with toxicological effects based on inhibition of the&#160;heme biosyntheticenzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2012). Sequential feather samples have been used to reconstruct a condor’s lead exposure history over the 3-4-month time frame of feather growth and this data demonstrates that condors are exposed to lead more frequently, and at higher levels than indicated by blood monitoring data (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;2012). A study using samples collected between 1997 and 2011 showed that blood lead concentrations increased as birds became less reliant on provisioned food, as they became older and as their home range size increased (Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and Bakker <em>et al</em>. (2017) found that condor survivorship was negatively related to time spent feeding on provisioned food. In 2017, 69 of the 78 birds in the Arizona/Utah population showed high levels of lead exposure; despite a treatment, two individuals died from severe lead-poisoning (Vulture Specialist Group 2017).<br/><br/>The population along the Central Pacific Californian coast also suffers from reduced eggshell thickness, consistent with the effects of DDE exposure, a breakdown compound of the pesticide DDT, compromising reproduction in the wild (Burnett <em>et al.</em> 2013). Apparently restricted to condors feeding on the coast, DDE exposure has been linked to feeding on the carcasses of California Sea Lions that had been exposed to the pesticide during their lifetimes (Kurle <em>et al</em>. 2016). The lack of additional DDT inputs suggests that these effects will decrease over time, though at present this is an impediment to sustainable wild reproduction in the coastal population. Ingested anthropogenic material has been responsible for the deaths of nestlings and strongly implicated in a number of other nestling deaths. The dead condors were found to have swallowed significant quantities of micro-trash (e.g. glass fragments, wire, plastic cartridge cases, etc.) and Rideout <em>et al</em>. (2012) observed this to be the leading cause of death in nestlings (76% of identifiable causes); micro-trash has however, recently been observed not to be&#160;significant source of lead poisoning and that the vast majority of lead micro-trash items were related to lead-ammunition (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2015). Shooting still occurs and is often identified in live birds that have been radiographed during lead testing or in relation to other injuries. Eleven birds have been killed as a result of being shot since 1998 (USFWS 2019, <em>unpublished data</em>).<br/><br/>Puppet-reared birds were initially thought to exhibit greater problematic human-oriented behaviour, such as tameness and vandalising property, than parent-reared birds (Meretsky&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000)<strong></strong>. However, there is no apparent difference in mortality between released birds that were puppet-reared and those which were parent-reared (Woods&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007)<strong></strong>.&#160;Clark <em>et al</em>. (2007) modified puppet rearing practices to try and address concerns with initial captive reared birds. Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2007) compared the post-release results of birds reared with modified puppet rearing techniques in an isolated population in Baja, Mexico, with those released in the United States and evidenced that changes in socialisation techniques of young captive reared birds largely alleviated early problems with captive reared birds. At present, condors in the current wild subpopulations are not entirely immune to some interactions with human structures (i.e. perching on communication towers, mountain homes, South rim of the Grand Canyon) and behavioural modifications including attempts to haze them when possible are still employed. Cade <em>et al</em>. (2004) identified three types of interactions with humans and human structures where Type 1 and 2 were acceptable, while Type 3 was considered unacceptable and associated with birds showing no fear of humans, approaching them with no escape route. These categories remain the general benchmarks for the Recovery Program in determining whether or not a condor is exhibiting problematic behaviour and few condors are now removed from the wild due to behavioural problems. In the early 1990s a number of captive-reared birds were lost owing to collisions with power-lines and a conditioning programme with mock power poles was initiated to address it (L. Kiff&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;This practice has since been adopted in the field to help avoid power pole electrocutions in wild-fledged condors. However, collisions and subsequent electrocution following mid-span collisions continue to periodically occur. Seventeen total cases of electrocution have been documented since 1993, including several in 2015, 2016 and 2019, with lead poisoning being identified as a cofactor in at least one of these deaths (USFWS 2019,&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>The spread of west Nile virus has not been a significant problem for the species as most birds are still vaccinated (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005) however, as the wild population continues to grow, it is anticipated that it will not remain feasible to vaccinate all wild nestlings. Therefore, efforts to understand the potential significance of west Nile virus on the recovery of the species are under way.&#160;Lead poisoning however, continues to represent the most significant known cause of mortality in the wild; approximately 50% of all deaths with a determined cause are lead poisoning (USFWS 2019,&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>). The&#160;effect of treating individual birds for lead poisoning is currently being studied to assess whether it has any effect on survivorship in the wild California population (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Currently, the population would not continue to grow without the continued release of captive-bred birds.","There are currently 201 adults in the wild that are old enough to breed (age 5 and older), and 93 have produced viable offspring.&#160;Twenty-three wild birds turned five years old in 2019 and 17 more will turn five years old in 2020.&#160; A total of 141 wild birds are 8 years old or older, the observed average age of productivity (i.e. producing young when greater than or equal to eight years of age). Since mature individuals (as defined by IUCN) only includes individuals in the wild that are currently capable of reproduction, and re-introduced individuals must have produced viable offspring before they are counted as mature individuals, the current global population <span style=""font-style: italic;"">sensu</span> IUCN is 93 mature individuals as of March 2020 (USFWS California Condor Recovery Program, <em>unpublished data</em>).",Increasing,"This species declined rapidly throughout its historic range from British Columbia to Baja California during the 19th century and reportedly disappeared from outside California, <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, in 1937 (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. The population had dropped to an all-time low of just 22 birds by 1981, and in 1983 eggs were first taken from wild nests for captive-rearing; in 1987 the species became extinct in the wild when the last of the six wild individuals was captured to join a captive-breeding recovery programme involving 27 birds (Wilbur and Kiff 1980,<em></em> Toops 2009)<strong></strong>. Due to intensive captive breeding and reintroduction efforts the population increased to 223 birds by August 2003, comprising 138 in captivity, and 85 reintroduced in California and northern Arizona (L. Kiff <em>in</em> <em>litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Breeding in the wild resumed in 2002 and now occurs in all wild subpopulations (California, Arizona/Utah and Baja, <strong>Mexico</strong>).<br/><br/>The sub-population in California comprises 200 wild individuals in two distinct but loosely intermixing flocks. The Southern Californian flock is managed by the USFWS Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Condor Recovery staff and the Central California flock is managed collectively by the Ventana Wildlife Society and Pinnacles National Park. Each of the&#160;California flocks includes approximately 100 free flying individuals as of December 31st 2019 (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;The Arizona sub-population includes 98 free-flying individuals and there are an additional 39 free-flying individuals in the Baja, Mexico subpopulation. The combined total wild population as of December 2019 stands at 337 with an additional 181 captive individuals, for a total world population of 518. The regular movements of the Arizona birds are mostly confined to Coconnino County (Arizona) and Kane County (Utah), although several individuals have been documented wandering in Wyoming, southwestern Colorado and New Mexico before returning to the Vermilion Cliffs release area (C. N. Parish <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The California birds occur regularly in Ventura, Kern, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterrey, San Benito, Tulare and Fresno Counties. Currently, range expansion has been documented as far north as Alameda County in the west and Madera County in the east along the foothills of the Central Sierra Nevada Mountains. The species's geographic range continues to expand as the population grows in size (Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The reintroduction programme continues and has expanded its geographic coverage, with six birds released into the Sierra de San Pedro Martir in Baja California, Mexico in 2002 (USFWS 2002)<strong></strong>. A release site in Baja was established in October 2003. The first chick hatched in Mexico for over 75 years hatched in April 2007. The Baja California birds are  largely confined to the Sierra de San Pedro Martir (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong>, where release efforts are ongoing to augment the wild population; these birds have continued to expand their range and have reached both the Pacific and Gulf of California coasts (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020). It is hoped these birds will range widely enough to be effectively connected with birds in the southern U.S.A., and a bird from the Baja population was seen in San Diego County in April 2007. Second generation birds have matured to breeding age and wild fledged pairs have now fledged their own chicks into the wild however, no population can be deemed sustainable, and without substantial reductions in the use of lead-based ammunition within the condor's range, none are likely to become so (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>. The recovery programme for the species continues to address threats to the wild population, but lead contamination remains the greatest of these threats (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2017); lead poisoning represents approximately 50 percent of all known causes of death in the total population (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I and II. A large-scale, integrated captive-breeding programme, managed by the Peregrine Fund (at the World Center for Birds of Prey), Los Angeles Zoo, Oregon Zoo, San Diego Wild Animal Park and Chapultepec Zoo, Mexico City, and reintroduction program, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,&#160;Ventana Wildlife Society, Peregrine Fund, Pinnacles National Park and Government of Mexico, is maintaining and growing the population in the wild (USFWS 2019).&#160;The success of the captive breeding program has seen an increase from one chick hatched in 1988 to approximately 30 birds produced for release to the wild annually. The genetic diversity of the population is maintained through careful distribution and representation of founder genotypes at each captive-breeding facility and reintroduction site. Consequently the current population retains 99.5% of the likely heterozygosity of a wild panmictic population (Ralls and Ballou 2004)<strong></strong>. 'Aversion training' to avoid power poles&#160;appears successful in preventing electrocution from perching on power poles and is ongoing (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Condors still periodically collide with powerlines during flight hence&#160;California power companies have buried and replaced some above ground power lines with insulated lines in areas with high levels of condor activity; insulated&#160;lines protect condors from electrocution following mid-span collision and anecdotally may be more visible to the birds since they are darker and slightly thicker (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>A total of 287 condors were released into the wild between 1992 and 2019 (USFWS 2019,&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>)<strong></strong>. Clean carcasses are provided for reintroduced birds to&#160;supplement the food they would otherwise receive from their parents in the wild, and to assist in trapping to replace transmitters, test for lead, and assess general health. Education programs aim to minimise persecution&#160;and educate the public about the conservation benefits of using non-lead ammunition for hunting and land management (Hunting with non-lead 2020, North American Non-lead Partnership 2020).&#160;However, as the recovery of the species has continued, individuals are now ranging further than when the population was younger and smaller, and are less likely to take the food provided for them after age two (Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2017). A huge step has been taken towards trying to eliminate the threat of lead-poisoning with the signing in 2007 of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, and Assembly Bill 711 which requires the use of non-lead ammunition for the taking of all wildlife species throughout the state of California; lead-based ammunition can however, still be used for the putting down of livestock, impacting condors that frequent livestock ranch lands for foraging (A. Brickey&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The effectiveness&#160;of these regulatory bans on the survivorship and recovery of the species remains to be seen. Meanwhile, there is a growing program to promote the use of non-lead ammunition in hunting and wildlife management. The Ventana Wildlife Society, Arizona Game and Fish Department and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources are distributing non-lead&#160;bullets free of charge to hunters within the foraging range of the condors. In 2008 an agreement was struck between the Tejon Ranch and five conservation organisations in California to preserve 240,000 acres of the 270,000 acre property as an open space in return for not opposing the development of the remaining land, providing a vast amount of foraging habitat for the condor (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>.&#160;This conservation program has certainly reduced the amount of lead available to condors, as larger and larger percentage of the Southern California flock continue to forage there, however this area only represents approximately 2.5 % of the 9,600,000 acre geographic range this flock occupies.&#160;The North American Non-lead Partnership is engaging State Wildlife Management Agencies, to promote the voluntary use of non-lead ammunition as a traditional wildlife management practice that benefits non-target trust wildlife resources by eliminating secondary poisoning from the ingestion of spent lead ammunition.&#160; A willing partnership between hunting and endangered species conservation that facilitates a cultural shift away from hunting with traditional lead ammunition, may be the most practical way a significant reduction in the use of lead ammunition is likely to occur.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to monitor population trends.&#160;Revise the recovery plan using updated population modeling (Bakker <em>et al.</em> 2017) and management information, to determine survivorship and demographic parameters for a self sustaining population of condors.

Recent surveys suggest that the number of locations and mature individuals are both declining significantly, and consequently it qualifies as Critically Endangered. <p></p>","It inhabits dense mangrove forests, where it feeds on insects, larvae, spiders and some vegetable matter (Dvorak <em>et al.</em> 1997, Vargas 1997, Dvorak <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2004, <strong></strong>Fessl <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Its breeding season coincides with the beginning of heavy rainfalls, normally in December and January, although in recent years (with a reduction in heavy rainfall events) as late as February, and generally lasts until the end of the rainy season, around May, although successful nesting has been recorded as late as September (Young <em>et al</em>. 2013). Nests are placed as high as 19 m in tall trees within patches of high mangroves that are flood at high tide, a habitat that is rare on the Galápagos (<strong></strong>Fessl <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011, Cunninghame <em>et al</em>. 2017). Mangroves used by the species in the north-west appear to be structurally different from areas where it is absent suggesting it has subtle habitat preferences and suffers from habitat degradation<strong></strong> (Dvorak <em>et al</em>. 2004,&#160;<strong></strong>Fessl <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011). It appears to favour mangroves with tall trees, relatively low canopy cover and abundant leaf litter and dead wood (Dvorak <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2004,&#160;<strong></strong>Fessl <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).  A separation of the mangroves from the sea seems to be crucial as this prevents the washing out of leaf litter etc., which represents the species's preferred feeding substrates (Dvorak <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2004,&#160;<strong></strong>Fessl <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011).<p></p>","This species is declining owing to predation and parasitism as a result of the presence of invasive species.Without control&#160;<em>Rattus rattus</em> abundance is high at both breeding sites and was believed to be the major reason for the high nesting failure due to predation (70% in 2007) and low fledgling success (Fessl <em>et al.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. Other possible introduced predators include feral cats (especially important during the post-fledging phase), Smooth-billed Ani <em>Crotophaga ani</em> and fire ants <em>Solenopsis</em> spp., although fire ants seemed to have been successfully exterminated in 1997 (Grant and Grant 1997, Vargas 1997, 1999, Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2019)<strong></strong>. The blood-sucking nest parasite <em>Philornis downsi</em>&#160;currently represents the most significant threat, as it is present in all nests and infestation is high (with a mean of 42 parasites per nest) and without management kills close to all chicks (Cunninghame <em>et al</em>. 2015). The first case of nesting mortality due to <em>Philornis </em>parasitisation was recorded in 2007 and has continued to be documented to present (2018), and this threat has become relatively more prominent as invasive rodents are now controlled (Young <em>et al</em>. 2013; Cunninghame <em>et al</em>. 2017)<strong></strong>. Avian pox will represent a significant threat to the species if this pathogen arrives at the site as mangrove finches have not been exposed to the disease and possess no resilience (F. Cunninghame <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Moreover, due to the low population size, the species is inherently susceptible to the effects of inbreeding (Fessl <em>et al.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>, loss of genetic diversity and hybridization with the congeneric Woodpecker Finch <em>Geospiza pallida</em> (Lawson <em>et al</em>. 2017). Research has shown that the species favours structurally distinct mangroves, and while the entirety of the habitat is fully protected as part of the Galapagos National Park, it may be especially susceptible to sea level rise driven by climate change (D. Wiedenfeld <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).<br/><br/>Observations in 2019 of widespread dieback in over 90% of mature black mangrove (<em>Avicennia germinans</em>) trees at Palaya Tortuga Negra is a further cause for concern (Cunninghame unpubl. data). While Mangrove Finches can survive in the absence of this tree species (there are none at Caleta Black), black mangrove is the species's preferred nest tree and its loss from the forest will further impact on the already vulnerable population; both the cause and the outcome of this situation are unknown and are currently being assessed (Cunninghame&#160;unpubl. data). Changes in rainfall are further negatively impacting the population as it results in fewer females attaining breeding condition, and while monitoring shows that adult birds have high year to year survival, females do not respond to males and do not form pairs and breed when dry conditions prevail (Cunninghame&#160;unpubl. data). It is presumed that these environmental pressures will only intensify with human induced climate change.<br/><p></p>","The population has not been recorded to number greater than 20 breeding pairs in any year since 2009, falling to a low of just 13 territorial pairs in 2019, of which just 10 bred. The population is therefore estimated to comprise between 20 and 40 mature individuals. <br/>A further 19-23 territorial males without female partners are typically recorded each year in addition to the breeding pairs detailed, a result of rainfall/climatic conditions (Cunninghame&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Cunninghame&#160;<em>unpubl. data</em>). In 2019, territory and nesting surveys revealed 13 territorial pairs (of which 10 bred), 19 lone territorial males, ~20 additional individuals and 5 newly fledged nestlings, but due to the cryptic nature of juvenile and non-breeding individuals, it is likely that a small percentage of the Mangrove Finch population remains undetected (Cunninghame&#160;<em>unpubl. data</em>). The overall population estimate is therefore thought to number 80-100 individuals (F. Cunninghame <em>in litt</em>. 2020).",Decreasing,"This species is restricted to the Galápagos Islands, <strong>Ecuador</strong>. Historically, it was known from at least six mangrove patches on east Fernandina and east, south and west Isabela (Vargas 1997). In 1974, the population was estimated to comprise 100-200 individuals (R. Naveen <em>in litt.</em> 1988)<strong></strong>. Recent surveys have failed to record the species on Fernandina, and it seems likely that it is now extinct as a breeding bird on the island - the last reported sighting may have been in 1971 (Grant and Grant 1997)<strong></strong>. No suitable mangrove habitat for breeding finches is thought to remain on Fernandina hence the species is unlikely to breed there again as a result (G. Young <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In 1997 and 1998, surveys on Isabela found breeding populations in only two areas, Playa Tortuga Negra and Caleta Black on the north-west coast of the island, with estimated populations of 37 and 21 pairs respectively (Grant and Grant 1997, Vargas 1997)<strong></strong>. Subsequent surveys have estimated the population at 36 and 16 pairs in 1999 (Vargas 1999)<strong></strong>, 24 and 14 pairs in 2007 (B. Fessl <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007)<strong></strong>, and thorough surveys recorded c. 40 pairs in 2009 (Fessl <em>et al.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>.

Surveys in the fairly extensive mangroves on the south-east coast of Isabela found three to five territories which probably contained breeding birds, but further areas of potentially suitable habitat remain unsurveyed (Dvorak <em>et al.</em> 1997, Dvorak <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2004)<strong></strong>. In 2008, several other historical sites were surveyed including Punta Espinoza (Fernandina), Bahia Elizabeth, Punta Moreno and Bahia Urbina, but the only site at which birds were located was Cartago Bay (Fessl <em>et al.</em> 2010, G. Young and B.

An action plan was published 2010 (in English and Spanish) following a workshop in 2008. A study of breeding biology commenced in 1999 (Vargas 1999)<strong></strong> and a follow up study started in 2006.&#160;Since 2006 the Mangrove Finch Project, led by the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) and the Galapagos National Park Directorate (GNPD) in collaboration with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT) has conducted in situ conservation management to reduce the extinction risk to the mangrove finch. Introduced rat control has been successful at reducing nest predation and is continued to date (Fessl <em>et al</em>. 2010, Cunninghame&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2017). Possible sites for reintroduction have been visited on Isabela and habitat suitability assessments were undertaken with remote mapping of mangrove habitat throughout Isabela used to locate suitable sites. The first trial translocation took place in May 2010 when nine wild-trapped birds were taken to Bahia Urbina (25 km south of Playa Tortuga Negra) following intense rat control at this site (Cunninghame&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2011). While the birds initially established, surveys beyond six months post-release confirmed that none remained and four were observed to have returned to the source site (Cunninghame&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2011). Concurrently nest monitoring revealed exceptionally high nestling mortality from <em>P. downsi</em> parasitism with pairs laying multiple clutches to rear at best one or two fledglings late in the season (Cunninghame&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015). Lack of a suitably sized source population to conduct more translocation trials, coupled with the urgency to protect nestlings from <em>P. downsi</em> parasitism, resulted in the Project conducting head-starting (collection of eggs/young nestlings, artificial incubation and captive rearing followed by soft release of juveniles back in their natural habitat). Head starting was conducted in collaboration with San Diego Zoo Global (SDZG) and Auckland Zoo (2017 only) for four consecutive years from 2014-2017 (Cunninghame&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2017). Although logistically and technically challenging, this method has proven to be successful, with a total of 39 juveniles having been released. Additionally, observations of several individuals surviving long term and recruitment of &lt;5 individuals to date into the breeding population, highlights the potential of this technique to increase population size. However, technical difficulties, coupled with the invasive nature of head starting for breeding pairs, the difficulty of obtaining accurate data on long term survival of captive reared birds and concurrent research into techniques to protect nestlings in situ (by Philornis Project Collaborators) has resulted in the adoption of intensive in situ mangrove finch nest management to increase nestling survival. Since 2017, during three breeding seasons, mangrove finch nests have been carefully injected with a pyrethrum based liquid (permacap) – this reduces the number of <em>P. downsi</em> larvae in each nest and enables nestlings to fledge successfully in the wild. Additional parasite removal and supplementary feeding of chicks has helped increase the effectiveness of nest injections. While still technically challenging (nest access), this less invasive management technique has ensured a minimum of 26 nestlings to fledge in their natural habitat (Cunninghame, internal report CDF) . Evaluation of conservation techniques is conducted by all project collaborators to ensure that the applied conservation management technique each season is the most effective (Cunninghame&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). Emerging environmental threats from climate change are predicted to place further pressure on the already fragile mangrove finch population. Planning is already underway with mangrove habitat specialists to enable base line monitoring to better understand the drivers of mangrove habitat die back at the key population sites and determine the potential impacts on the mangrove finch population and the required conservation management. Furthermore, blood samples continue to be collected and DNA analysis of the genetic structure of the remaining population has shown that hybridisation is occurring (Lawson&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2017). Additionally results appear to indicate that the species is highly inbred (Fessl&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2010, Lawson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017), however with only a few remaining breeding pairs, no management actions have been identified to remedy this. Additionally, a conservation education programme has engaged local schoolchildren, and produced a film highlighting the species's importance. A course has been run for local guides (G.

It is restricted to areas of old-growth forest with nesting holes, but highest numbers occur close to gardens with papaya. An average of 2.9 eggs are laid in one or two clutches per year, of which 1.7 chicks fledge, but only 0.75 fledglings survive to 30 days (<strong></strong>Robinet <em>et al.</em> 1995,<strong></strong> 1996<strong></strong>; Robinet and Salas 1999). <p></p>","While primary forest has previously declined in extent, a decline in the quality of forest on the island may not be affecting the species, as the population trend of this species is actually a relatively rapid increase and the highest numbers are found around gardens containing papaya (although only when adjacent to forest habitat). There has been an illicit pet trade (Primot 2000) which is thought to have increased through the second half of the 20th century (Robinet <em>et al. </em>1995).&#160;Nesting holes are cut open to extract the nestlings, rendering them unsuitable for future breeding attempts and a lack of nesting sites is believed to be a limiting factor. The continuous presence of local guides is believed to be effectively preventing nest poaching (Barré <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010), although it has been reported that some poaching effort appears to have resumed, including the illegal culling of birds in gardens (J. Theuerkauf <em>in litt. </em>2017, 2020). The invasion of the island in 1996 by bees, which compete for tree holes, is a significant threat, with 10-16% of known nests being occupied by bees in 2000-2002 (N. Barré <em>in litt. </em>2003). The native Brown Goshawk <em>Accipiter fasciatus,</em> and perhaps other predators, are believed to take many juveniles (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 1996; N. Barré <em>in litt.</em> 1999; P. Primot <em>in litt.</em> 1999; Robinet and Salas 1999)<strong></strong>. Suitable habitat is patchy and fragmented mainly as a result of coconut plantations, which do not afford protection from predation by <em>A. fasciatus</em> and so act as barriers to dispersal. Two Black Rats,&#160;<em>Rattus rattus,</em>&#160;have recently been trapped near the harbour, although there is no evidence that the species has yet become established on the island (J. Theuerkauf <em>in litt.</em> 2016, 2017). Previously, experiments showed that egg-predation rates were four times higher on the island of Lifou, where <em>R. rattus </em>was present, compared to Ouvea, where they were absent (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 1998). The introduced Rainbow Lorikeet&#160;<em>Trichoglossus</em>&#160;<em>haematodus </em>may pose a threat through competition (although it has different habitat and dietary requirements so competition is unlikely), or through transmission of Beak and Feather Disease virus (BFDV) (Jackson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","The population is estimated to number&#160;1,730 mature individuals in total (Legault <em>et al.</em> 2013), rounded here to 1,700 mature individuals.",Increasing,"<em>Eunymphicus uvaeensis</em> is restricted to Ouvea, <strong>New Caledonia (to France)</strong>, where most birds occur in c.20 km<sup>2</sup> of forest in the north, although c.60 km<sup>2</sup> of habitat remains (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. Earlier population estimates have been alarmingly low, but populations in the north and south of the island are regularly surveyed and data show a steady increase in both areas (L.

The population has steadily increased from an estimated c.600 birds in 1993 (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong> and 824 birds in 1999 (Primot 1999) until reaching a plateau with 2090 birds in 2009 (Barre <em>et al.</em> 2010), and 1730 in 2013 (Legault <em>et al.</em> 2013).

The ASPO initiated a long-term study of the biology and ecology of the species as a basis for two recovery plans (1997-2002 and 2003-2008). Forest loss is being addressed through community awareness programmes and trials to mitigate habitat degradation and improve forest quality, particularly with regard to nest-sites. Ten guides are employed, who, amongst other duties, locate nests. Illegal trade is being successfully tackled by increased awareness and law enforcement. A captive-breeding programme has been discussed but not yet started, with the species occuring only in small numbers in captivity with very limited breeding success (Robinet 1996). A translocation programme to restock the south of Ouvea was initiated in 1998, and the number of birds in the south stood at&#160;395&#160;individuals in 2011 (J.

The species may also occur on freshwater lakes and estuaries during migration<strong>&#160;</strong>(Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005).&#160;Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, as well as crustaceans, worms, echinoderms, amphipods, isopods, small fish, and (in freshwater habitats) adult and larval insects<strong>&#160;</strong>(del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Kear 2005).

Decreasing spring snow cover duration has been linked to declining Scoter populations in North America, likely due to trophic mismatch, and is likely to also affect Siberian populations (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Ocean acidification could lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of the Velvet Scoter diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Another major threat is bycatch in fishing gear, occurring particularly in wintering grounds (Dagys &amp; Hearn 2018). Population declines in the Baltic Sea have coincided with heavy bycatch mortality in gillnet fisheries and Velvet Scoters are amongst the most frequent victims as their foraging ecology puts them at high risk of entanglement (Dagys &amp; Žydelis 2002, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2013, Dagys 2017).</p>  <p>Invasive species pose a threat to Velvet Scoters in parts of the range, but the extent of impacts are largely unknown at present (Almquist <em>et al.</em> 2010, Dagys 2017). Predation from introduced American mink <em>Neovison vison</em> may impair populations on Scandinavian islands (Nordstrom <em>et al.</em> 2002), and the Round Goby <em>Neogobius melanostomus</em> feeds on benthic invertebrates and may impact the abundance and distribution of Scoter food supplies.</p>  During moulting and winter aggregations, the species is highly susceptible to oil spills and other marine pollutants (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005, UICN France 2011) and one catastrophic oil spill occurring in a key moulting or wintering area could affect a large proportion of the global population (Madge &amp; Burn 1988). Velvet Scoter have been found to be susceptible to avian influenza (Melville &amp; Shortridge 2006) and future outbreaks of disease may be expected and could compound observed declines in parts of its range. The species is also hunted in some areas however, this is generally considered to be sustainable, with annual bags estimated to be between 1,600 and 2,800 individuals in Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006). Habitat degradation caused by sand-dredging operations, bottom-trawling fisheries and the installation of wind farms causes the loss, degradation or avoidance of feeding areas (Garthe and Huppop 2004, Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011, Dierschke <em>et al.</em> 2016, Dagys &amp; Hearn 2018), while additional habitat degradation on breeding grounds has resulted from human exploitation of natural resources such as marine benthic organisms and shellfish in the taiga and lower tundra regions (Kear 2005).<p></p><p></p>","Population data supplied the&#160;to the European Commission (EC) in late 2019 by Member States under Article 12 of the EU Birds Directive totalled 202,000-384,000 individuals.

Subsequently, numbers in the main wintering areas appear largely stable (BirdLife International in prep., M. Ellermaa <em>in litt. </em>2020, N. Markones <em>in litt. </em>2020, S.

Whatever the locality, the breeding cycle is characterized by a high level of synchrony with a laying period protracted over a period of less than 2 weeks. Breeding areas usually have little or no vegetation due to erosion by birds.</p><p>Macaroni penguins are pelagic foragers, searching for prey at moderate depths, usually less than 50 m. &#160;They feed mainly on small krill (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Deagle <em>et al. </em>2008); at South Georgia they feed extensively on Antarctic krill (<em>Euphausia superba</em>), while at Crozet and Kerguelen they have a more diverse diet, feeding on small euphausiids, amphipods (<em>Themisto gaudichaudii</em>) and small amounts of myctophid fish. Their diets show a shift after incubation, with an increase in fish (myctophid). During their winter dispersal, they rely mostly on crustaceans (Bost <em>et al. </em>2009).</p><p>Macaroni penguins show extensive changes in their foraging range throughout their breeding cycle. For example, incubating birds from Crozet target the distant, turbulent waters of the sub-Antarctic Front (Bon <em>et al.</em> 2015) while South Georgia, Kerguelen and Prince Edward Islands birds target the waters of the Polar Front (Barlow and Croxall 2000, Bon <em>et al.</em> 2015, Whitehead&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Brooding birds forage closer to their colonies over the shelf and the shelf break, increasing their range during crèche (Trathan <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Barlow and Croxall 2002, Crossin <em>et al.</em> 2015, Bon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Whitehead <em>et al. </em>2016).</p><p>Patterns of movement are well known for adults during breeding&#160; (e.g. Trathan<em> et al.</em>&#160;2006, Barlow and Croxall 2002, Crossin <em>et al. </em>2015, Bon <em>et al</em>. 2015), but information for the non-breeding period (e.g. Bost&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009; Thiebot<em>&#160;et al. </em>2011 Ratcliffe<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2015) is less well known for several populations, and poorly known for juveniles.</p><p>At-sea habitats overlap with those of recovering populations of marine mammals; as such, recovering populations of Antarctic fur seals (<em>Arctocephalus gazella</em>) have been identified at South Georgia as potential resource competitors and a plausible cause of Macaroni Penguin population decrease (Barlow <em>et al.</em> 2002, Trathan <em>et al. </em>2012). At some locations fur seals are penguin predators, as they have been identified catching and preying on Macaroni Penguins.&#160;</p><p><br/></p><br/><p></p>","<p>Climate change is an important potential candidate for explaining recent declines. Large-scale environmental changes, particularly those related to sea temperatures could be contributing to habitat loss, indirect ecosystem effects, direct species mortality and reduced reproductive success, but the nature and level of impacts remain unclear as there may be divergent responses in different populations; climate was found to be have potentially positive effects in the short to medium term for the population studied at Bird Island, South Georgia, whereas changes to predation dynamics appear to be an important factor driving declines (Horswill <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016).<br/><br/>Historical and continuing prey competition with fur seals <em>Arctocephalus</em> spp. at South Georgia is considered to have substantially contributed to declines noted over the past several decades, with the fur seal population increasing from an estimated 30,000 to c. 3 million in the past few decades (Barlow <em>et al.</em> 2002, Trathan <em>et al. </em>2012). Recovery of fur seals at the Prince Edward Islands could increase competition for prey as well as causing increased predation pressure on penguins (Dyer and Crawford 2015). Increasing seal populations could also block access to breeding sites thereby inhibiting colony growth, as demonstrated on Bouvet Island (Isaksen <em>et al.</em> 1997). In the South Georgia population, predation appears to be of secondary concern with relatively few fur seals predating penguins and local penguin declines starting well in advance of increases in seal predation (J. Croxall in litt. 2017). Giant Petrels <em>Macronectes</em> spp. contribute to predation pressures on immature penguins, targeting them in the vulnerable fledgling phase (Horswill <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>    </p><p>Commercial fisheries could represent a potential threat through incidental capture and resource competition. Long-line fisheries at winter feeding grounds have inflicted limited bycatch mortality on Macaroni Penguins (Dyer and Crawford 2015) and harvesting of Antarctic krill could reduce food availability if management does not adequately take into account the dietary needs of the species. Invasive mammals including cats, mice and rabbits are present on a number of sub-Antarctic islands but their current impact on the species is thought to be negligible (Crossin <em>et al.</em> 2013). Breeding colonies on Marion Island have previously shown declines following outbreaks of avian cholera and other unknown diseases (Cooper <em>et al. </em>2009).

189780266,22679946,Branta bernicla,Least Concern,,2021,2020-11-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population trend is not known, but the population is not believed to be decreasing sufficiently rapidly to approach the thresholds under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory, the main routes of migration being along Arctic coastlines (Snow and Perrins 1998). It arrives on the breeding grounds in early-June where it may breed in small, loose colonies or dispersed in single pairs (especially in the high Arctic where the habitat is unsuitable for large groups) (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Snow and Perrins 1998; Kear 2005). There is a high degree of synchrony in egg laying and hatching, with the adults moulting c.10 days after the young hatch (mid-July to mid-August) during which they become flightless for c.21-30 days (Johnsgard 1978; Scott and Rose 1996). Most individuals moult near the breeding grounds although immatures, unsuccessful breeders and some more southerly breeding groups may undertake pre-moult migrations and form large moulting concentrations well-away from nesting areas (Johnsgard 1978; Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984; Scott and Rose 1996). After the post-breeding moult flocks leave the breeding grounds in early-September with some arriving in wintering areas as early as mid-September, others making stopovers on route and arriving later (Madge and Burn 1988). The species leaves its wintering quarters again from mid-March to mid-April (Madge and Burn 1988). During the non-breeding season the species remains gregarious, gathering in groups of only a few to several thousands of individuals, although it is rarely found in very large flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998; Kear 2005). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in coastal Arctic tundra in or close to wet coastal meadows with abundant grassy vegetation and on tundra-covered flats with tidal streams (only just above the high tide line) (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Kear 2005). In some parts of its range it shows a preference for nesting on small grassy islands in tundra lakes and rivers, especially if nesting Sabine's Gulls <em>Xema sabini</em>, Snowy Owls <em>Bubo scandiaca</em>, Peregrine Falcons <em>Falco peregrinus</em> or large raptors are present to deter predators (Johnsgard 1978; Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984; Madge and Burn 1988; Kear 2005). High Arctic nesters may also breed widely dispersed over icy tundra, well-away from water (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species becomes predominantly coastal, inhabiting estuaries, tidal mudlflats, sandy shores, coastal saltmarshes (especially in the spring) and shallow muddy bays (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005). In recent years the species has taken to grazing on coastal cultivated grasslands and winter cereal fields, but rarely occurs on freshwater wetlands except on passage (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996). <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The species is mainly herbivorous although it may take animal matter (e.g. fish eggs, worms, snails and amphipods) (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <em>Breeding</em> In its breeding habitat the diet of the species consists of mosses, lichens, aquatic plants, sedges, tundra grass <em>Dupontia</em> spp., arrowgrass <em>Triglochin</em> spp. and saltmarsh grass <em>Puccinellia</em> spp. (Alaska), although the young may also take insects and aquatic invertebrates (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species predominantly takes marine microscopic and macroscopic algae (e.g. seaweeds, <em>Ulva</em> spp.) and other aquatic plants linked with saline or brackish waters in the intertidal zone (e.g. especially eelgrass <em>Zostera</em> spp., as well as <em>Ruppia maritima</em>, <em>Spartina alterniflora</em>, <em>Salicornia </em>spp., and arrowgrass <em>Triglochin</em> spp.) (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Kear 2005). <br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a shallow depression on the ground (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Although the species often nests close to water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) typically within a few hundred metres of the tideline, high Arctic nesters may breed on icy tundra well away from water (some nearly up to 10 km inland) often near boulders where the snow clears first (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992; Snow and Perrins 1998; Kear 2005). <strong><br/></strong><strong>Management information </strong>An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on dry, improved grasslands that had high abundances of the grass <em>Lolium perenn</em>e, were between 5 and 6 ha in area, and were at a distance of up to 1.5 km inland or 4-5 km along the coast from coastal roosting sites (Vickery and Gill 1999). The species was found to show a preference for grasslands with short, dense swards c.5 cm in height, a characteristic that can be gained through summer management plans involving either mechanical cutting, livestock (sheep or cattle) grazing regimes, or cutting and then grazing (although over longer periods of time the selective grazing of sheep rather than cattle, and frequent rather than infrequent cutting may be more likely to enhance tillering and produce the short, dense sward favoured by this species) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Fertilising the grassland with nitrogen in the autumn at a rate of 50 kg N/ha was found to increase the overall species use of the habitat by 21% compared with unfertilised areas, and fertilising at a rate of 75 kg N/ha was found to increase the overall species use of the habitat by 9-29% and to remove any preference the geese showed for short sward heights (between 5 and 11 cm) (Vickery and Gill 1999). In other fertilising experiments grazing intensity of the species was found to increase linearly with increasing levels of fertiliser (from 0 kg N/ha to 150 kg N/ha), although responses in grazing intensity at fertiliser levels lower than 50 kg N/ha were found to be short-lived (c.2 months after fertiliser application) (Vickery and Gill 1999).","This species is threatened by hunting (Kear 2005). In its winter range the species may be persecuted by farmers, as in recent years it has increasingly taken to grazing on cultivated grasslands and winter cereal fields near the coast (Scott and Rose 1996). It is further susceptible to disturbance from vehicles, although it is  relatively tolerant of human disturbance, e.g. walkers, compared to  other species (Vickery and Gill 1999; Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002<em></em>). Habitat within the breeding range is degraded through the expansion of industrial developments (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/>The species may also be threatened in the future by reductions in food supplies following the return of a disease of the eelgrass <em>Zostera marina</em> (a staple food) (Scott and Rose 1996).&#160;It can use alternative feeding sources as demonstrated following the collapse of eelgrasses in the Netherlands (1930-1940), but these need to be highly nutritious and diverse.&#160;It has been shown that nest success is dependent on fat reserves that have been acquired in the staging areas (Ebbinge and Spaans 1995). <br/>The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of Arctic fox <em>Vulpes</em> <em>lagopus</em> predation (Madsen <em>et al</em>. 1992), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Inbreeding depression has also been identified as a threat to current population growth (Harrison <em>et al</em>. 2011). Nevertheless, these threats seem to have little or no impact on the overall population size. <br/>The species however appears susceptible to climate variability, with the probability of breeding being negatively correlated to the sea surface temperature (Sedinger <em>et al</em>. 2006); hence climate change may lead to a reduction in reproductive success in the future.","The global   population is inferred to number 490,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2020). The European population is estimated at 1,500-1,800 pairs, which equates to 3,000-3,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,,"The species is hunted in large parts of its range, mainly for recreation and sport (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sport hunting has declined however in recent decades from about 14% of the adult population in the 1950s to under 1% since 2000 (Lewis <em>et al.</em> 2020).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix II.

190414715,41545,Alouatta caraya,Near Threatened,A4cde,2021,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Despite its large range, occurrence in numerous nature reserves in several countries, and apparent adaptation to modified habitats, <em>Alouatta caraya</em> is considered Near Threatened due to a suspected population reduction of 25-30% over 36 years (three generations; 2004-2040) due to ongoing loss of suitable habitat, hunting pressure, and the susceptibility of this species to disease outbreaks (e.g. yellow fever).","<em>Alouatta caraya</em> is found in deciduous, seasonally deciduous, mixed evergreen, gallery, and xeric forests, as well as in forest patches in savanna habitats. Today, it occupies forest patches throughout a large part of the Cerrado of central Brazil, and the Pantanal of Mato Grosso. It occupies deciduous forest (<em>caatinga alta</em>) in some areas in southern Piaui, western Bahia and north-western Minas Gerais. In Rio Grande do Sul occurs in mixed evergreen forest (<em>Araucaria</em>), forest patches in savanna, seasonal deciduous forest (Codenotti <em>et al. </em>2002; Codenotti and Silva 2004) and gallery forest. In Argentina, it specializes in semi-dry deciduous forests and gallery forests as well as the typical island forests of the Chaco (Arditi and Placci 1990; Brown and Zunino 1994). In Bolivia, it is found in the Chaco and Chiquitano forests, and gallery forest and forest islands in the Beni. In Paraguay, Stallings (1985; Stallings <em>et al.</em> 1989) reported that <em>A. caraya</em> occurs throughout the eastern forests and gallery forests of the southern and western Chaco along the ríos Paraguai and Pilcomayo, and the numerous small rivers that drain the Chacoan plain. It can also be found in sporadic xeric forests, continuous with gallery forests.<br/><br/>Mean adult male weight ranges from 6.42 kg (n=58, Rumiz 1990) to 7.77 kg (n=9, Svoboda <em>et al.</em> 2006), while mean adult female weight ranges from 4.33 kg (n=117, Rumiz 1990) to 5.13 kg (n=12, Svoboda <em>et al.</em> 2006). Like the spider monkeys, they are prehensile-tailed, with a naked patch of skin on the under surface at the tip. Their most characteristic feature is the deep jaw that surrounds the hyoid apparatus, a resonating chamber, and enlarged larynx that produces their howls (grunts, roars and barks) (Kitchen <em>et al.</em> 2015). Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard particularly in the early morning and are audible at distances of 1-2 km (Drubbel and Gautier 1993; Cunha and Byrne 2006).<br/><br/>Howler monkeys have a folivorous-frugivorous diet (Crockett and Eisenberg 1987). The molar teeth are particularly adapted for their chewing leaves through shearing. Although they regularly include mature leaves in their diet, softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when they are available. Howlers spend up to 70% of their day lying and sitting in the canopy, while their enlarged caeca ferment the leaves. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the keys to their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. Mature fruit is the other important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>) in many regions, but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, moss, stems, twigs and bark. A few groups inhabiting orchards near human habitations were reported to eat bird eggs (Bicca-Marques <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Behavioral and ecological field studies have been carried out mostly in Argentina and Brazil (see reviews by Bicca-Marques 2003, Oklander <em>et al.</em> 2011, Arroyo-Rodríguez <em>et al.</em> 2015, Cristóbal-Azkarate<em> et al.</em> 2015, Dias and Rangel-Negrín 2015, Fortes <em>et al.</em> 2015, Martínez-Mota <em>et al.</em> 2015).","<em>Alouatta caraya</em> is threatened by habitat loss due to agricultural development and cattle ranching in the Brazilian cerrado, soya farming in the Bolivian Chiquitano, and small-scale farms and cattle ranching in Argentina. Studies in Brazilian Amazonia suggest a loss of suitable forest habitat approaching 40% by the year 2050 if current conditions remain unchanged (Soares-Filho <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; Subsistence hunting also occurs throughout much of this species' range.&#160; In studies of hunting impact in Amazonia, Peres and Palacios (2007) have shown that large-bodied primates such as <em>Alouatta</em> species may experience declines in population density upwards of 50% in areas of moderate to heavy hunting. In addition, significant population declines have been reported following outbreaks of sylvatic yellow fever in Brazil (Veiga <em>et al.</em> 2009; Bicca-Marques and Freitas 2010, Almeida <em>et al</em>. 2012, Freitas and Bicca-Marques 2013, Silva <em>et al.</em> 2013) and Argentina (Holzmann<em> et al.</em> 2010).","Although widespread, <em>Alouatta caraya</em> is patchily distributed, and densities vary widely. In Argentina, Brown and Zunino (1994) recorded high densities in a number of sites: Chaco forest, Formosa, 111 individuals/km²; Chaco forest, Corrientes, 90 individuals/km²; gallery forest, 63 individuals/km²; and inundated forest 283 individuals/km². Arditi and Placci (1990) carried out surveys in gallery forests of the Chaco in Argentina (Riacho Pilagá, Estancia Guaycolec) and found lower numbers than those reported by Brown and Zunino (1994) resulting from surveys in the 1980s: 11.7 individuals/km². Dvoskin <em>et al. </em>(2004) repeated the surveys there in 2001 and found that numbers had increased to 26 individuals/km².&#160; The highest densities (88–425 individuals/km²) occur in flooded forests and there have been numerous surveys of Alouatta caraya in this forest type of Argentina (Pope 1968; Rumiz 1990; Thorington Jr <em>et al.</em> 1994; Zunino <em>et al. </em>1996, 2001; Kowalewski and Zunino 2004). In the dry Bolivian Chaco, in the gallery forest of the Parapeti river, it was found at 15-18 individuals/km² (Ayala 2011). Codenotti <em>et al.</em> (2002; see also Codenotti and Silva 2004) located small and isolated populations, composed mostly of single groups, in forest fragments of up to 50 ha in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Densities in these small fragments ranged from 17 to 650 individuals/km². Similarly, Silva and Codenotti (2007) found densities ranging from 30 to 500 individuals/km² in small fragments in the municipality of Tupanciretã, Rio Grande do Sul. In the state of Paraná, Brazil, Aguiar<em> et al. </em>(2011) found densities of 40 to 260 individuals/km².<br/><br/>Overall, it is suspected that the population will suffer a reduction of 25-30% over 36 years (three generations; 2004-2040) due to loss of suitable habitat, subsistence hunting and population extirpations caused by disease (e.g. yellow fever).",Decreasing,"This is a wide-ranging species occurring throughout most of central-western Brazil (with range expanses to the north, northeast and south; Ludwig <em>et al.</em> in press), eastern Bolivia (Wallace <em>et al. </em>2013), eastern Paraguay (Stallings 1985), northeastern Argentina (Brown and Zunino 1994) and potentially reaching northwestern Uruguay (Villalba <em>et al.</em> 1995). It inhabits moist semi-deciduous, deciduous or higher altitude habitats within the Cerrado, Caatinga, Chaco, Pantanal, Pampa and Atlantic Forest biomes, mostly in gallery or floodplain forests and marginally in more humid forests of the Amazon.<br/><br/>The range of <em>Alouatta caraya</em> partly overlaps that of other howler species. It occurs in sympatry with <em>A. guariba</em> <em>clamitans</em> in the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul in south Brazil (Aguiar <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2014; Bicca-Marques <em>et al. </em>2008) and the Province of Misiones in Argentina (Agostini <em>et al.</em> 2008). Hybridization is suspected in these contact zones. In the state of Rondônia, Brazil, the species occurs in sympatry with <em>A. puruensis</em> (Alves 2006, 2013).

The area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) have been decreasing as the species has been extirpated in Germany (Germany 2018), Ukraine (Ukraine 2018) and Austria (Spitzenberger 2019). In Switzerland the species has declined since the 1960s. In Romania, half of the roosts have disappeared since the 1960s.","Roosts almost exclusively in underground sites. Summer breeding colonies  may comprise 500-10,000 individuals, with the most numerous aggregation  of 70.000 in a French cave (EUROBATS 2019). It usually hibernates in  clusters is spacious caves, amounting around 40,000 in three caves in  Serbia (Paunović 2004), Romania (Bücs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018) and  European Turkey (Paksuz, Özkan 2012). <em>Miniopterus schreibersii</em> forages mainly in  deciduous woodlands and mature orchards (including olive groves),  gardens, along hedgerows separating pastures and riverine forests and in  urban areas. In the Mediterranean area they can use grasslands, but  avoid arable land and maquis. However, in Portugal they use farmland  (olive and cereals), avoiding montado with denser tree cover and  favouring areas close to the roost. In some populations pregnant and  lactating females forage over white street-lamps. In France, feeding  areas are commonly located within 30 km of the main roost, while in  Portugal 82% of females forage within 10 km of the colony. In France,  each female foraged over an area of 18.5 ha in Franche-Comté, 7.5 ha in  the Rhône Valley. Females moved from one good feeding area to another  during the night: from 3 patches within a 500 m radius of a roost to up  to 6 patches 4 km away and demonstrated fidelity to feeding areas over  at least short periods, whereas juveniles changed their feeding areas  every night. Lactating females foraged farther from the roost than  pregnant females. Their home range was 22,318 ± 7,141 ha vs. 10,837 ±  5,399 ha in the Rhône Valley. The foraging area of maternity colonies  was <em>ca</em> 200,000 ha. Lepidoptera dominated in the diet in all seasons and  comprised 76–95 % of the volume. Diptera (mainly Tipulidae in late  summer) was the second main prey in France versus Neuroptera in  Slovenia. Prey also included larvae of Lepidoptera and Aranaeidea, as  well as taxa flying close to vegetation. According to a DNA barcoding  study, Geometridae and Noctuidae were the most represented families of  the lepidopterans. Dipterans were the second most consumed prey. Several  taxa of Coleoptera, Neuroptera, Orthoptera and Trichoptera were also  recorded. Prey also included many pest arthropod species (see Kyheröinen  <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018 for the literature review). Schreiber's bat is  a migrant species which changes its roosts several times during the  year, long-distance movements occur occasionally (the longest recorded  distance is 833 km: Hutterer <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). The maximum known age is 22 years (Gazaryan 2004).","The main threat to this bat is disturbance to colonies, both in winter and summer  roosts. Unsuitable physical protection of cave entrances (e.g. with  improperly designed grilles) may lead to abandonment or decline in  numbers. In 2002, mass mortality events were reported for populations in  France, Spain and Portugal, there are also historical records for such  mortality in Italy. Hundreds of individuals were found dead in spring.  Mortality up to 60% in one year was reported from France (Roué, Némoz  2002), and 40% mortality occurred in Spain during the same period  including 1,000 dead individuals out of 6,000 in one colony. A number of  sites were subsequently deserted. In 2013, a mass-mortality incident  occurred in a <em>Miniopterus schreibersii</em> bat colony, causing the death of ~500  individuals in Northeast Hungary (Bükk mountains). Mortality events in  Spain and Hungary were both associated with the Lloviu virus (Kemenesi <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2018). Another event with <em>ca</em> 200 casualties of uncertain origin was  reported in 2018 from Georgia (EUROBATS 2018). Mortality at wind  turbines was recorded from Spain, Portugal and France, but may occur  everywhere within the range (Rodrigues <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).","The global population of <em>Miniopterus schreibersiii </em>is estimated to have declined by at least 30% throughout much of its range.&#160;Extinction has occurred in Germany (Germany 2018), Ukraine (Ukraine  2018) and Austria (Spitzenberger 2019). In Switzerland the species has  declined since the 1960s. Migrating bats were sometimes recorded in  caves along the French border, but no colonies had been revealed  (Bohnenstenge <em>et al.</em> 2014). In Romania, half of the roosts have  disappeared since the 1960s. Population in Serbia estimated at 150,000  without any conspicuous trend (Pejić <em>et al.</em> 2018). A baseline survey of main colonies in Anatolia brought a total of 18,251 Schreiber's bats (Çoraman, Çelik 2012).",Decreasing,"Schreiber's Bent-winged Bat occurs from south-western Europe and north and west Africa through the Middle East to the Caucasus (Furman <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2010). It is known from records in North Africa (Morocco, Algeria,  Tunisia, Libya) where it occurs in sympatry with <em>Miniopterus maghrebensis  </em>(Puechmaille <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). In the Caucasus,  it has been found only in Russia and Georgia, whereas <em>M. pallidus</em> occurs  in Azerbaijan, Armenia and further eastwards (Bilgin <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2016). A single adult male was recently found in the Hranická Chasm,  south-eastern Czech Republic (Bartonička and Jedlička 2011), several  bats were also recorded in Slovakia near the Polish border (Ceľuch  2014).&#160;<br/>It's EOO and AOO are declining in extent and quality as habitat loss and disturbance, especially at critical hibernacula roosts, have resulted in significant declines of the species and even extirpation in Germany (Germany 2018), Ukraine (Ukraine 2018) and Austria (Spitzenberger 2019). In Switzerland the species has declined since the 1960s. In Romania, half of the roosts have disappeared since the 1960s.",,Terrestrial,"In Europe, it is protected by national legislation in most range states.

195863093,39255,Rupicapra rupicapra,Least Concern,,2021,2020-07-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Northern Chamois&#160;is widespread as a species and has a large population of just under 500,000 individuals (Corlatti <em>et al</em>. in press). Although it is declining in some parts of its distribution range, the bulk of the population (subspecies <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>) is found in the Alps and is currently secure. Consequently, it is assessed as Least Concern. However, most chamois subspecies qualify as threatened, and require urgent conservation action.</p>    <em>R. r. asiatica</em> – Recent data suggest that the subspecies has experienced catastrophic declines in population size in the last several decades due to intensive human impact. The overall population is less than 2,500 mature individuals (estimated between 500 and 750 individuals). There is an observed and projected decline by more than 20% in two generations based on recent, ongoing and planned development projects (roads and hydro-power plants in montane areas) affecting habitat and connectivity, and causing an increase in pressure by illegal hunting. Therefore, the subspecies <em>asiatica</em> should be listed as Endangered (EN) C1+2a(i).  <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> - Listed as Vulnerable (VU) D1+2. Confined to a single mountain, the population size was estimated at 1,500 individuals in 2017-2018 (Prévost 2018). Assuming that ca. 60% of the population are mature (IUCN definition), this would translate into a total of 900 adults. The past introduction of <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> to the Chartreuse to increase the small relict population (Rouland 1980) might jeopardize the long-term persistence of <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> due to the potential risk of crossbreeding (Apollonio&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) which could eventually lead to extinction by hybridization and introgression (Rhymer and Simberloff 1996).  <em>R. r. caucasica</em> – Previously no category assigned at subspecies level. The population size is approx. 6,000 mature individuals and there had been a decline by approx. 70% since the 1960-1970s, which is suspected to continue. The subspecies is therefore assessed as VU C1.<br/> <br/> <em>R. r. tatrica</em> - Listed as Endangered (EN) B1+2ab - has a restricted geographic range and small population of 1,350 individuals (1,000 in Slovakia and 350 in Poland (mean population size for 2014-2018, Ciach and Pęksa 2018; M. Ciach and Ł. Pęksa, unpublished). There are an additional ca. 100 individuals in the Low Tatra Mts (Slovakia) as a result of the introduction of a back-up population between 1969-1976 (Bačkor and Velič 2008), but these are presently hybridized with introduced <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> (<span class=""author"">Zemanová&#160;<em>et al</em>&#160;<span class=""pubyear"">2015) and cannot be accounted for the subspecies <em>tatrica </em>(J. Robovsky, pers. comm. 2020). There has been strong fluctuation in the number of mature individuals (decline of the population from ca. 1,100 individuals in the 1960’s to ca. 220 individuals by the turn of the century; Ciach and Pęksa 2018). The population increased rapidly between 2000 and 2018, with current numbers exceeding the population size prior to the decline (Ciach and Pęksa 2018, M. Ciach and Ł. Pęksa unpublished). Concerns are low genetic variation and a projected problem of hybridization with introduced <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> (<span class=""author"">Zemanová&#160;<em>et al</em>&#160;<span class=""pubyear"">2015).</span></span>","Northern Chamois&#160;inhabit steep, rocky areas mostly in the mountains, utilizing a variety of habitats including alpine meadows, open rocky areas, mixed broadleaf woodland, and coniferous woodland (Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). This species occupies rocky areas and alpine meadows, and feeds on grasses, herbs, leaves of trees, buds, shoots, and fungi (Sägesser and Krapp 1986). Females gestate for 170 days and usually have 1 offspring per pregnancy. Females are sexually mature at 2.5 years, while males mature 1-1.5 years later. They live 14-22 years. Females and young occur in flocks of 5-30 animals, while adult males remain solitary.","<p>Poaching and over-hunting are a problem for the species in parts of its range, especially where it occurs outside protected areas and private hunting reserves (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000; Markov et al. 2016). Many of the less numerous subspecies (e.g. <em>R. r. balcanica</em>, <em>R. r. cartusiana</em>, and <em>R. r. tatrica</em>) are threatened by the deliberate introduction of subspecies from other geographic areas (especially <em>R. r. rupicapra</em><em>; e.g. Rouland 1980</em>), leading to hybridisation and genetic swamping (Shackleton 1997; <span class=""author"">Zemanová et al. <span class=""pubyear"">2015; Šprem and Buzan 2016; Iacolina et al. 2019). Human disturbance, particularly as a result of increased tourism and leisure activities in mountain areas, is also a problem (Shackleton 1997, Jurdíková 2000; Pęksa &amp; Ciach 2015, Pęksa &amp; Ciach 2018). Competition with domestic livestock and introduced species such as the mouflon <em>Ovis aries</em><em> musimon</em> is a threat to the more vulnerable subspecies, although it is not considered to be a major problem for <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>. <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> does, however, suffer periodic outbreaks of sarcoptic mange, causing local population declines (Shackleton 1997). Habitat loss is a problem in some areas (e.g. for subspecies <em>balcanica </em>in Albania and <em>asiatica</em> in Turkey; Shackleton 1997; Ambarlı 2014). Because its population is very small indeed, subspecies <em>cartusiana </em>is susceptible to extinction as a result of stochastic demographic or environmental events (Shackleton 1997, S. Lovari pers. comm. 2006).<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra asiatica</em><br/> </span>The main threats are poaching, trophy hunting, habitat degradation and isolation due to the construction of new roads to alpine habitats for mass tourism (Ambarlı 2014). Additional threats include the construction of hydro-electric power plants above 2000 meters, increasing tourism activities, heli-skiing causing avalanches and disturbing the animals during pregnancy, and chasing individuals by using unmanned aerial vehicles in refuge areas. For many years, the main threat to the population was considered to be poaching only. However, hunting regulations were changed in 2010, and the ban on killing females during trophy hunting was lifted because hunters had complained about difficulties in correctly sexing individuals from a distance. Moreover, trophy hunters are sometimes more interested in killing females due to their longer horns compared to males. As a result of the new hunting regulations, and because trophy hunting mostly takes place during the rut and birth seasons, both reproductive success and birth rates have likely also decreased. Additionally, the number of quotas is not determined based on robust scientific data. Instead, most are given out over the desk or by relying on hunters’ observations without knowledge of actual population sizes in wildlife reserves. Alpine tourism and new road constructions in the Kaçkar Mountains for the “Green Belt Roads"" Project by the Ministry of Tourism has caused catastrophic destruction of the prime habitats of Anatolian chamois. Additionally, interspecific competition with wild goats and livestock has probably pushed chamois up to higher altitudes and restricted the subspecies’ range in the alpine zone to mostly above 2,000 m.<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica</em><br/> In Albania, habitat loss is a major threat in some regions due to land demands by the expanding human population. There appears to be no competition from domestic livestock. Poaching does occur, but the extent is not known. In both Bulgaria and Croatia, the major threats are poaching and hybridization with Alpine chamois (Iacolina et. al, 2019). In Rhodope, this is almost complete, and is also a potential danger at Rila. In Croatia, the hybridization zone between the Alpine and Balkan subspecies is in the Velebit mountains (Šprem and Buzan 2016). Outside protected areas, poaching remains a problem. Although there has been a decrease in poaching in Bulgaria in recent years, it still has negative effects on populations. As a result, the majority of suitable habitats in Bulgaria have not been recolonized by chamois. Poaching is wide-spread in the entire country both in national parks and hunting territories. The genetic purity of the subspecies needs to be clarified, especially in West Rodopi, where ten female and 1 male Alpine chamois were introduced from Switzerland in 1977. Their influence on the neighboring subpopulations requires clarification. The influence of disturbance of chamois due to drive-hunting of wild boar, as well as the presence of feral and guard dogs around livestock, also need to be assessed. The Balkan population, which has been isolated for about 100 years, is still small and vulnerable, and poaching has not yet been eliminated (Markov et al. 2016). In Serbia, the population at Tara mountain had declined from 500 to ca. 60 individuals between 1992 and 1996, mainly due to poaching. However, due to conservation measures in the last decade, the number has increased to ca. 120 individuals. The population from Stolovi mountain is extinct, and only isolated individuals are occasionally encountered in the area around the Lim river. Populations from Šar planina are also threatened by poaching and are declining (estimated to be about 100 individuals). At Đerdapska klisura and Zlot, populations are not threatened. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, numbers declined in the last three decades due to poaching (e.g. by more than 80% to 90 individuals at Zelengora mountain). At Prokletije mountain (belonging to both Serbia and Montenegro), the population is not threatened and numbers up to 150 individuals.&#160; In Greece, the main threat is also poaching. All Greek sub-populations suffer from regular poaching to a greater or lesser extent (Papaioannou 2010, 2015, 2016a,b,c, 2020; Bounas et al., 2017).&#160; Poaching is more intensive in the border zones with the neighbouring Balkan countries. Additional problems are: fragmentation due to geographic isolation in restricted areas and resulting very small population sizes, disturbance due to legal hunting of other game species and livestock presence, competition with livestock, increased road accessibility for timbering and livestock keeping close to or inside the species’ key habitats, as well as a lack of an effective state wildlife management system at a national level (Papaioannou 2010, 2015, 2016a,b, 2020; Papaioannou &amp; Kati 2016; EEA, 2019). Genetic effects on one of the northern Greek populations due to re-stocking with individuals of other subspecies from Bulgaria, as well as current road construction for installation of wind power stations, seem to be future threats, too (Papaioannou 2020). Both population size and geographic range are estimated to be less than 10-20% of the carrying capacity in Greece (Papaioannou 2020). This latter point is normally not accounted for in species assessments, which means that particularly in Greece with its extremely small and isolated populations, the Balkan chamois should be listed as higher conservation concern (i.e. vulnerable) than the assessment based on overall population size would suggest.</p>  <p><br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra carpatica</em><br/> Grazing by domestic sheep in summer leads to disturbance and thus to higher dispersal of animals. In some areas, high livestock densities create intense grazing pressure and lead to interspecific competition. Additional concerns are small, fragmented populations and poaching in some areas (Valdez 2011).<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra cartusiana</em><br/> Many factors threaten this subspecies, and the most important include: food and space competition with domestic livestock, red deer <em>Cervus elaphus</em> and introduced mouflon; potential hybridization with introduced <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> (Rouland 1980); over-harvesting and poaching; forestry; summer tourism and winter cross-country skiing. <br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra caucasica</em><br/> The main threat for the subspecies is poaching. In some areas, competition with domestic livestock is a problem, and competition with tur (<em>Capra caucasica</em> and <em>Capra cylindricornis</em>), red deer, and roe deer <em>Capreolus capreolus</em> is also possible.<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra</em><br/> <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> is not threatened overall. However, the ongoing increase in human land use and particularly increases in (winter) outdoor / tourism activities contribute to habitat degradation and disturbance (e.g. Ingold, 2005). In parts of its range, the subspecies was / has been subjected to increased hunting pressure at local scales, in order to prevent browsing damage to mountain forests (e.g. Baumann &amp; Imesch 2010; Wotschikowsky 2010) and to afforestations. In areas managed by the State Forestry Board in Bavaria chamois are managed on the basis of a spatio-temporally structured zonation system. Under legislative regulation, year-round hunting is exerted in small areas to support regeneration of forests with protective attributes (e.g. protection from avalanches and erosion), while in other areas hunting is restricted to few to no individuals. Debates regarding the management practices of chamois population units in some regions / countries have been ongoing, but compelling evidence is often limited. Over the majority of the subspecies’ range, however, harvest rates are generally considered sustainable. Regarding climatic factors, harsh winters (i.e. with a lot of snow) and warm summers may limit population growth in some areas (Vogt et al 2019, Willisch et al. 2013). Climate change seems to exert negative effects on body mass of young chamois (Rughetti &amp; Festa-Bianchet 2012, Mason et al. 2014), but its demographic effect in these populations is still unclear.&#160;Imperio et al. (2014) suggested that positive and negative effects of a changing climate may largely balance out, with an overall positive effect of lower winter snow depth on survival rates, but negative effects from higher spring-summer temperatures on population dynamics. Among the biotic factors that can negatively influence chamois populations are diseases such as infectious keratoconjunctivitis (Degiorgis et al. 2000, Mavrot et al. 2012) and sarcoptic mange (Rossi et al. 2007), competition with livestock (in this case also the danger of disease transmission) or other wild ungulates such as red deer, Alpine ibex <em>Capra ibex</em> or mouflon (e.g. Suter et al. 2005; Bertolino et al. 2009; Chirichella at al. 2012; Darmon et al. 2012; Vogt et al. 2019; Corlatti et al. 2019). Increased predation is expected due to the return of large carnivores such as the Eurasian lynx <em>Lynx lynx</em> (Vogt et al. 2019) and wolf <em>Canis lupus</em> (Gazzola et al. 2007). In 2015, a barbed wire border fence was constructed along the border between Croatia and Slovenia due to the European migrant crisis. This fence represents a major threat to the local chamois population, as it may cause mortality, obstruct seasonal dispersal, and reduce effective population size (Safner et al. 2019).<br/> <br/> <em>Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica</em><br/> In the past, major threats included poaching and domestic sheep grazing. However, the Tatras are now protected in their entirety in the form of national parks: the Tatranský Národný Park (TANAP) in Slovakia was established in 1949 and the Tatrzański Park Narodowy (TPN) in Poland in 1954. As a result of strict conservation measures, hunting is banned and incidents of poaching are rare (Jamrozy et al. 2007). Sheep grazing, once common all over the Tatras, gradually declined following the creation of the national parks, and since the 1980s has been restricted to mid-forest meadows, which lie at lower altitudes, below the range of occurrence of the Tatra chamois. Currently, disturbance and habitat loss caused by tourism is a major threat to the population. This includes the constant presence of large numbers of tourists in the high mountains and the development or maintenance of tourist infrastructures (ski resorts, hiking trails), which impact the spatial distribution, behaviour and physiology of the Tatra chamois (Zwijacz-Kozica et al. 2013, Pęksa &amp; Ciach 2015, Pęksa &amp; Ciach 2018). In Slovakia, interbreeding with animals from introduced populations of <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> has caused the loss of the back-up population of <em>R. r. tatrica </em><em>in the </em>Low Tatra Mountains (Slovakia; <span class=""author"">Zemanová et al. <span class=""pubyear"">2015<em>), and further gene flow between introduced Alpine and native Tatra chamois can become a serious threat to the population occuring in the Tatra </em></span>Mountains. Both populations (natural, inhabiting the Tatra Mountains and introduced and hybridized in the Low Tatra Mountains) are relatively small, and their effective population sizes may limit the maintenance of genetic diversity and adaptability over the long term. A potential problem is the danger of disease transmission from domestic livestock to the wild population of the Tatra chamois.</p>","<p>The Northern Chamois&#160;as a species is widespread and appears generally stable, especially the Alpine subspecies <em>R. r. rupicapra</em>. However, many of the other subspecies are rare and/or declining:&#160;</p><p><em>R. r. asiatica -&#160;</em>The total population size is estimated between 500 and 750, with a total extent of occurrence (EOO) over 9,000 km<sup>2</sup>, but a very low area of occupancy (AOO). Group sizes in the Kaçkar Mountains have decreased significantly from 40 to 50 individuals in the 1990s to a maximum of 25 individuals (but mostly only 3 to 7) between 2006 and 2012 during mating time observations (Ambarlı 2014). Along with the disappearance from former habitats and increasing habitat fragmentation, the population size of Anatolian Chamois has decreased sharply in the last three decades (by ca. 60-70%, with the greatest reductions in population, AOO and EOO probably occurring between 1980 and 2000; Ambarlı 2014).</p>    <p><em>R. r. balcanica -&#160;</em>The total population numbers less than ten thousand individuals: ca. 500 in Croatia (Šprem and Buzan 2016), less than 1,000 in Bosnia and Herzegovina (cf. Adamič&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Korjenić&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009), ca. 320 in Central Serbia (data from 2017), ca. 200-300 in Kosovo, ca. 1,400 in Montenegro (Đurović 2018), ca. 1,400 in North Macedonia (V. Maletić pers. comm.), ca. 450-600 in Albania (F. Bego pers. comm.), ca. 2,500-3,000 in Bulgaria (with the largest sub-populations in Rhodopes – ca. 1000 - and Rila – ca. 1000; S. Avramov, pers. comm.), and ca. 1,500 in Greece (i.e. 1330-1765, with 4 populations numbering more than 150, the largest 380 and the smallest no more than 5-15; Papaioannou 2015, 2016a,b, 2020; Papaioannou and Kati 2016). In Bulgaria, the population size increased from 1,000-1,100 individuals estimated in 1997-2000 to 1,600–1,800 in 2005 (200-220 in the Central Balkan range, 450-500 at Rila, 200 in Pirin, and 750-850 in the Western Rhodopes; Spiridonov&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). </p>  <p><em>R. r. carpatica -&#160;</em>Following some fluctuations in population size (Şelaru 1997), chamois numbers in Romania have shown a steady increase from ca. 6,800 in 2008 to ca. 8,150 individuals in 2019. This has been paralleled by an increase in the number of harvested animals from 195 in 2008 to 443 in 2018 (A. Farkas, pers. comm).<br/> <br/> <em>R. r. cartusiana -&#160;</em>The population is currently estimated at ca. 1,500 individuals, with ca. 200 animals harvested in 2017-2018 (Prévost 2018). The population history is as follows: ca. 50 individuals in 1945, 250 in 1972 (Prévost 2018), 35 in 1977, and 67 in 1979 in the north-western nucleus of the introduced population (Rouland 1980), 150 in 1986 (Prévost 2018) and ca. 120 in 1990 (Berducou 1990). Between 2005 and 2016, both the assigned hunting quota and number of harvested chamois increased: in 2005, about 110 chamois were harvested out of a quota of ca. 140, and in 2016, about 180 out of ca. 200 (Chantreau and Gaudry 2019). The genetic integrity of the current <em>R. r. cartusiana</em><em> population is unknown.</em></p><p><em>R. r. caucasica -&#160;</em>The total population estimate for the entire Greater Caucasus is just over 9,000 individuals, and in general, the subspecies is still declining. In Russia, the total is ca. 5,500, with ca. 3,500 in the Western Greater Caucasus, up to 1,000 in the central part, and up to 1,000 in Chechnya and Dagestan (Reports on status of nature conservation in respective regions; Lukarevsky 2018; Yarovenko and Yarovenko 2018). Chamois numbers in Chechnya (mainly on the limestone Rocky Ridge; Lukarevsky 2018) probably amount to at least 300 animals, possibly more. Of all animals in Russia, ca. 1,200 occur in the Kavkazsky Biosphere Reserve (Trepet, 2018), 300 in Sochi NP (Semyonov and Voronin, 2018), ca. 200 in the Teberdinsky Biosphere Reserve (J. Tekeev, pers. comm.), and ca. 250 in the North Ossetinsky Nature Reserve, Tseysky Managed Nature Reserve and Alania National Park (Weinberg, 2018). The population history is as follows: 9,000 chamois on the northern slope in 1972, almost 6,000 of which inhabited Krasnodar Kray, and 1,200 in the Stavropol region (Ravkin, 1975). The population declined, and by the beginning of the 2000s, there were 1,500 in the Western Greater Caucasus (without Kavkazsky reserve), up to 1,300 in the Central Greater Caucasus, and more than 400 animals in Dagestan (Danilkin, 2005). In addition, there were about 1,000 Chamois in the Kavkazsky Biosphere Reserve (Trepet, 2014). In Georgia, combined aerial counts and ground censuses conducted during 2012-2014 produced a maximum number of 3,267 animals in the Greater Caucasus and 500-600 Chamois in Adjara in the Lesser Caucasus (Gurielidze 2015). This also represents a decline from an estimated 5,000 animals at the end of the 1980’s (Arabuli 1989). In Azerbaijan, only 600-800 individuals were left by the end of the 1990s compared to an estimate of 2,000-2,500 animals in the 1950-60s (Guliyev 2000). 341 animals were counted in the Zagatala Nature Reserve in 2015, and 315 in 2018; in Ilisu Nature Reserve, 24 and 18 animals, respectively, in the same years (A. Muradov, pers. comm.). No data are available from Shahdag National Park, the largest protected area in the Azerbaijan part of the Eastern Greater Caucasus. Chamois numbers probably decrease eastwards.&#160;<span class=""tlid-translation"">See Table 1&#160;in supplementary material.</p><p><em>R. r. rupicapra -&#160;</em>This subspecies comprises the bulk of the global Northern Chamois&#160;population, and is widespread and abundant in the Alps. Recent population declines have been suggested for some countries (e.g. Austria, Switzerland and Italy), but this is controversial, as there are large regional differences in population trends in all cases. The situation in Switzerland may provide a good example for the difficulties in inferring population trends from different data sources: In Switzerland, the total population size was estimated at ca. 91,000 in 2018. Compared to 2008, when there was an estimated number of about 96,000 chamois (Eidgenössische Jagdstatistik 2019), this would represent a decline of about 5%. However, as there is no standardized method to infer population abundance or trends of chamois in Switzerland, abundance estimates are not validated, and suspected changes need to be interpreted with care. The number of chamois shot in Switzerland peaked in the 1990’s and has since declined steadily. In 2008, about 17,300 chamois were shot, in 2018 about 13,700, which would correspond to a decline of 21% in ten years (data: Eidgenössische Jagdstatistik, Nov. 2019). However, care must also be taken regarding the interpretation of these data, as hunting regulations and hunting pressure have changed over the years. Reductions in numbers of shot animals therefore do not necessarily reflect population declines (Vogt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). While in some sub-populations, chamois numbers have experienced steady declines in the past 20-30 years, others have been stable or increasing (e.g., Vogt <em>et al.</em> 2019, Willisch&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Willisch pers. comm). A similar situation applies to Austria, where trends in the number of animals shot has differed widely between provinces, while the overall population trend is still under debate (Reimoser&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Germany, a population numbering approximately 1,200 animals today occurs in the federal state of Baden Wuerttemberg (Wotschikowsky&#160;2010; MLR 2019). In the federal state of Saxony, few occasional sightings of individuals that belong to a border population in Czechia occur (Hertweck and Riebe 2009). The bulk of the German chamois populations occur in the federal state of Bavaria for which Wotschikowsky (2010) suggested an estimate of roughly 20,000 individuals in 2010. Current population size and trends have been debated amongst different stakeholder groups, which resulted in the initiation of several research projects to inform this debate, but results are pending to date. In Italy, the total population estimate is ca. 137,000 individuals, with ca. 124,800 outside (in 2014; Pellicioli 2019) and ca. 12,600 inside National Parks (Gran Paradiso 2019: ca. 7,000; Stelvio 2019: ca. 3,500; Val Grande 2013: ca. 800; Dolomiti Bellunesi: ca. 1,300; Italian National Park Authorities). Given annual population counts of 119,042 (2009), 120,400 (2010), 123,475 (2011), 123,666 (2012), 126,825 (2013), and 124,847 (2014) outside National Parks (Pelliccioli 2019), the number of chamois (including kids)&#160;in the Italian Alps appears relatively stable. Nevertheless, declines have been detected in some populations, particularly high density areas: for example, in the Trentino sector of the Stelvio National Park, the decline was over 60% between the mid-1990s and 2019. In France, chamois abundance and distribution range have shown an increase over most of the overall monitoring period, although the total abundance may have tended to stabilize during the last 15 years (1988: 31,680, 1994: 55,570, 2005: 98,715; 2010: 103,345; Corti 2012; Barboiron&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Although the population expansion still seems to be ongoing at intermediate and low altitudes (Barboiron&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), contrasting local trends have appeared in other areas, including some local population decreases even in national parks such as in the Ecrins National Park and the Vanoise National Park. Difficulties in inferring <em>R. r. rupicapra </em>population sizes and trends also include limited economic and human resources allocated to absolute abundance surveys, and changes in survey methodology including the promotion of relative abundance indices (Loison&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006; Michallet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Although this may fulfill the objective of making local surveys cheaper for the purpose of adjusting annual harvest rates, it may weaken the availability and accuracy of total population estimates (e.g. Jullien and Cornillon 2017; Barboiron&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In practice, such indices of relative abundance are only reliable when calculated over a sufficient number of surveys per year and over a sufficient number of years (Loison&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), which is often not fulfilled (e.g. Chantreau and Gaudry 2019). <span class=""tlid-translation"">Partial participation of stakeholders further compromises the reliability of population monitoring, and the corrections of underestimation biases (De Danieli and Sarasa 2015) also remain an open question.&#160;</span></p><em>    R. r. tatrica</em> - The total population size is currently estimated at 1,350 individuals (1000 in Slovakia and 350 in Poland, based on the mean population size for 2014-2018, Ciach and Pęksa 2018; M. Ciach and Ł. Pęksa , unpublished). Numbers of the Tatra Chamois had declined steadily since the 1960s (Jurdíková 2000) from ca. 1,100 individuals to ca. 220 individuals by the turn of the century (Ciach and Pęksa 2018). After the period of decline, the population increased rapidly between 2000 and 2018, with current numbers exceeding the population size prior to the decline (Ciach and Pęksa 2018; M. Ciach and Ł. Pęksa unpublished). There is an additional population of ca. 100 individuals in the Low Tatra Mts (Slovakia), which was established from 30 individuals from the Tatra population and introduced as a back-up population between 1969-1976. It increased subsequently and has persisted to date (Bačkor and Velič 2008, <span class=""author"">Zemanová&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;<span class=""pubyear"">2015), although nowadays, this population is displaying high levels of introgression of the <em>R. r. rupicapra </em>genome.</span>",Stable,"<p>The Northern Chamois is native to mountainous parts of central and southern Europe and Asia Minor, where it occurs as seven subspecies: <em>R. r.</em> <em>asiatica, balcanica</em>, <em>carpatica</em>, <em>cartusiana</em>, <em>caucasica, rupicapra</em> and <em>tatrica</em> (Shackleton 1997, Pedrotti and Lovari 1999). It occurs from 200 m to 3,500 m asl.&#160; It has been introduced to Czechia and New Zealand (not mapped), and possibly to Argentina (no information on its presence nowadays). <br/> <br/> The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>asiatica </em>only occurs in the northeastern mountains of the Black Sea, eastern parts of Anatolia (Turkey) and the southwestern regions of Georgia in three mostly isolated populations. The Kaçkar Mountain and the transboundary populations between Turkey and Georgia have not been connected since 2000 due to the large dam water reservoirs in the province of Artvin. The eastern Anatolian and Kaçkar Mountain populations have become almost isolated after increasing highway constructions and decreasing population sizes, and there is no evidence that they are connected any longer. Previous distribution maps by Turan (1984) and Lovari and Scala (1984) showed a wide coverage in eastern and northeastern Anatolia including Mount Ağrı, Cilo and Kaçkar, but recent studies have indicated that Anatolian Chamois have been disappearing from former habitats (Ambarlı 2014). </p>  <p>The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>balcanica</em> occurs in Croatia (Dinara and Biokovo Mts.), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria (four main massifs), and Greece. In Serbia, it inhabits the mountain Tara, the area around the Lim river, Đerdapska klisura and Zlot. In Kosovo, it occurs in the mountains of Prokletije, Mokra Gora, Koritnik and Šar Planina. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, it inhabits the mountains of Zelengora, Prenj, Čvrsnica, Čabulja, Veleža, Bjelašnica, Treskavica and Sušica. In Montenegro, it is found in the mountains of Durmitor, Prokletije and Orjen, and in the Tara river canyon. In Bulgaria, there are five distinct sub-populations: Western Rhodopes, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha and Central Balkan. The population in Vitosha was reintroduced after 2000 (Valchev&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). A reintroduction project has also started in the Western Stara Planina, but requires additional animals in order to be successful. In Greece, there are 30 distinct sub-populations forming six discrete population blocks in the following mountain ranges: Northern Pindus (12 sub-populations), Central and Southern Pindus (7), South mainland mts (5), N-NW mts (1), Olympus mt (1), Rhodope mts (4) (Papaioannou 2010, 2015, 2016a, 2016b, 2020; Papaioannou and Kati 2016). The first three, and possibly the fourth, seem to share a common genepool, whereas the rest diverge slightly (Papaioannou&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The area of occupancy at the national level is estimated between 1950 – 2475 km<sup>2</sup> (EEA 2019, Papaioannou 2020). <br/> <br/> The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>carpatica</em> occurs in many populations in Romania throughout the Transylvania alps and the Carpathian mountains. There have been a number of successful re-introductions (Shackleton 1997).<br/> <br/> The subspecies <em>cartusiana</em> is endemic to France, where it is restricted to a 350 km<sup>2 </sup>area of the Chartreuse limestone massif, centred around Grenoble, at the western edge of the French Alps. <br/> <br/> The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>caucasica</em> is restricted to the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Its distribution in the Lesser Caucasus is currently confined to the northern and western parts, Adjara-Imereti Mountain Range (Vereshchagin 1947, Gurielidze 2015). In the Greater Caucasus, the chamois sporadically inhabits all three highest ranges, and sometimes occurs at lower altitudes. The outer limits of its distribution in the Greater Caucasus have not changed much during the last 50 years, except for the westernmost part, where it is no longer present. </p>  <p>The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>rupicapra </em>is found in Austria, southern Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, eastern France, Slovenia and NW Croatia. While the range has remained similar to the previous assessment in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, it has increased in France as a result of natural and assisted recolonisations.The subspecies <em>R. r.</em> <em>tatrica </em>has a small island-like distribution range of some 300 km<sup>2</sup> and occurs in the open habitats above the tree line in the Tatra Mountains of Poland and Slovakia, including the ranges of Western, High and Belianske Tatra Mountains (Jamrozy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). In Slovakia, it had also been introduced to the Low Tatra Mountains (Shackleton 1997), but this population is now hybridized with introduced <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> (<span class=""author"">Zemanová&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;<span class=""pubyear"">2015).</span></p>",This species is widely hunted through its range.,Terrestrial,"<p>The species is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and in Annex V of the EU Habitats and Species Directive (higher protection applies to some subspecies). Chamois occur in many protected areas. In general, conservation recommendations that apply to all subspecies include ensuring that any harvest is sustainable (e.g. through research, monitoring, legislation, and international cooperation), reducing poaching (e.g. through legislation, enforcement, education and awareness-raising, and provision of alternative livelihoods where necessary), reducing the impacts of human disturbance (e.g. by providing refugia in areas with intense tourism and hunting pressure), preventing habitat degradation, and protecting the genetic integrity of populations (by avoiding translocations of 'foreign' subspecies that could hybridise with the local population). Monitoring of all subspecies is important, especially those that are rare and/or declining. Due to increasing evidence of negative effects on chamois through interspecific competition with red deer, red deer (re-)introductions should be avoided in areas with chamois presence, and due to the danger of disease transmission from domestic livestock to wild ungulates, prophylaxis of domestic animals against infectious keratoconjunctivitis should become routine. Particularly the uncertainties in population trends in central Europe highlight the importance of methodologically consistent long-term monitoring programmes.</p>    <em>R. r. asiatica -</em>&#160;The Anatolian Chamois has so far been the only subspecies categorized as DD. There is only a limited number of studies about the species in Turkey. It has been fully protected by the Land Hunting Law 4915 since 2003 (Official Gazette of Turkish Republic 2003). However, continued trophy hunting has been permitted by the Directory of Game Animals since 1989, and poaching still continues mainly on the population of the northeastern Black Sea Region and transboundary populations. To protect chamois and stop the population decline in the 1990s, five wildlife reserves were established, but they have no viable populations any longer. Both the number of game wardens and conservation efforts in high mountain areas are inadequate, and limited resources are allocated to monitoring efforts and law enforcement.   <em>R. r. balcanica</em> is listed in Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive. In Croatia, one of two Balkan chamois habitats – the Dinara Mountain - has been listed in the Natura 2000 sites in 2019. In Greece, the conservation status of the Balkan Chamois at the national level is U<sub>2</sub>-(i) (EEA, 2019), and it is included in the Greek National Red Data book as NT (Near Threatened, Legakis and Maragou 2009). It is a fully protected species, and hunting has been banned throughout the country since 1969 (Law 86/69). Most of the subspecies’ population ranges have been included in a no-hunting legislation status (Wildlife sanctuaries). In addition, several chamois ranges overlap - entirely or partly - with Natura 2000 sites, either SCIs or SPAs (Papaioannou 2016a, 2016c, 2020), and most of them are located within the boundaries of protected areas (e.g. extended National Parks, namely: Northern Pindos, Olympus, Oiti, Rodope, Tzoumerka-Peristeri-Aracthos gorge). The Greek Ministry of Environment has recently (2015) implemented monitoring projects for species listed on Annex 17 of the European directive 92/43 EU (EEA 2019) - including the Balkan Chamois - and the National Action Plan for this subspecies has just been accomplished (Papaioannou 2020). In Bulgaria, Balkan Chamois have been protected since 2007 (with poaching fines of 2500 euro and up to 5 years of emprisonment) and a National Action Plan was developed. The species is listed as Endangered in the National Red Book, but the status of U1 vs. U2 has been disputed. Although a small population growth at the national level was registered during the previous reporting period, the Balkan Chamois still inhabits less than half of its potential habitat in Bulgaria, and the present population size is several times lower than the potential number for the country. The distribution in Rila, Pirin and the Central Balkan is mostly within the borders of national parks where hunting is strictly prohibited, and almost all present Bulgarian populations and the majority of the potential chamois habitat are in Natura 2000 sites. The main tool to decrease poaching in Bulgaria is through community-based conservation, i.e. encouraging local hunters through a small number (35-55) of hunting permits, education of mountaineers and local communities. Under the National Action Plan, a National Chamois working group was established in order to coordinate the activities of the plan but it deals mainly with hunting derogations (Avramov at al. 2010). A few joint control actions against illegal trophies of chamois were carried out. More than fifteen trophies were confiscated and trials started against some of the most famous poachers. A large-scale media campaign was initiated against poaching. The Ministry of Environment organized the first National Chamois counting in 2009. The counts continue but their reliability has been compromised in the last years. The monitoring of chamois needs to be revised and improved.   <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> has been subject to intensive conservation management, including reintroductions. The subspecies was distinguished by Couturier (1938), while it was not distinguished from <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> during certain management actions and in many reports (Corti 1995). This uneven recognition has had substantial impacts on its conservation until nowadays. <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> was not assessed at the subspecific level in the Red List of Mammals of France in 2009 (IUCN France <em>et al.</em> 2009), while it was listed as vulnerable with unknown population trend in the Red List of Mammals of France in 2017 (IUCN France <em>et al.</em> 2017). It was considered as formerly abundant in Chartreuse, but overhunting and poaching probably put the population at risk of extinction from WWII to 1970 (Rouland 1980). Restocking and restauration programmes are cited in some references of grey literature (Corti 2006). During the 1974-76 period, 29 <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> individuals from the Bauges hunting reserve and the Markstein were translocated to the north-western part of the Chartreuse (Rouland 1980). During the 1990-92 period, 26 chamois assumed to be <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> were translocated from the south-western part of the Chartreuse to the south-eastern part (Michallet and Toïgo 2000). In practice, monitoring focused on estimating the relative abundance of chamois in Chartreuse is only partially fulfilled and suggests high interannual variability and an overall stability during the 2010-2016 period (e.g. Chantreau and Gaudry 2019). The conservation of <em>R. r. cartusiana</em> should incorporate improved monitoring and reporting of abundance, sustainable management of hunting pressure and active management of the risk of extinction by hybridization and introgression, beyond monitoring pressures from interspecific competition.  <em>R. r. caucasica </em>is listed in the Red Data Book of Azerbaijan as a “Species whose numbers declined in the past and are still low” (Guliyev 2013c). It is also listed in the Red List of Georgia as Endangered (EN/A2a) (Decree 2014). In both countries, these listings exclude any extractive use, but do not lead to restrictions on land use or development projects affecting the species and its habitat (S. Michel, pers. comm.). In the Soviet Union, the chamois was considered rare, but was not included in Red Data Books. Later, it was still not listed in the Red List of the Russian Federation. Now there are plans to include the species in the new version of the Red List of Russia. <em>R. r. tatrica</em> is listed in Annexes II* and IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive. It has been strictly protected by law since 1868 on the Polish side of the Tatra Mountains (the world's first parliamentary act on the protection of animal species). In spite of being strictly protected by law, numbers of Tatra Chamois continued to decline. In the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century, the whole Tatra massif became protected in the form of national parks: the Slovakian Tatranský Národný Park was formed in 1949 and the Polish Tatra National Park was formed in 1954. Moreover, the Tatras have been designated as an International Biosphere Reserve and are one of the areas protected by the Natura 2000 network in the frame of the Habitats Directive. Today, the entire population and its habitats are protected year-round in both the Polish and Slovakian national parks. The species is listed in the Polish Red Data Book as critically endangered. <em>R. r. rupicapra</em> introduced into Slovakia <em>should be managed for minimizing the threat of genetic introgression from dispersing males into the populations of </em><em>R. r. tatrica</em><em>. The population of </em><em>R. r. tatrica</em><em> in the Low Tatras, affected by introgression of </em><em>R. r. rupicapra</em><em>, should be maintained separately from the pure </em><em>R. r. tatrica</em><em> in the High Tatras</em><em> </em>(Zemanová <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><strong></strong>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Nevertheless, in 2010 illegal trading of two recently-poached wild juvenile Blue-throated Macaws was uncovered&#160;(Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). The juveniles were eventually released into the wild, however this demonstrates that illegal poaching does still occur.<br/> All known breeding sites are on private cattle-ranches, where burning and clearing for pasture and tree-felling for fuel and fence posts have reduced the number of suitable nest trees and inhibited palm regeneration<strong> </strong>(Duffield and Hesse 1997; Hesse 1998; J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. Cattle-rearing has occurred in the region since the 17th century (A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">. </span>1999); thus, the preferred food, the motacú palm <em>Attalea phalerata</em>, has been substantially reduced and is only regenerating slowly (B. Hennessey <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Nest-site competition from other macaws, toucans, bats and large woodpeckers is significant, and disturbance from mammals, birds and human activity may reduce the reproductive output of some pairs (J. Gilardi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Between 2007 and 2012, 30 nests were monitored. Of these nests, 57% failed, with most failures occurring during incubation (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). Reasons for nest failure were diverse but included disease, predation and abandonment. Botfly (<em>Philornis</em> spp.) infestations have been responsible for nest failures as have bees colonising nest sites, extreme weather events and parental neglect (Gould 2013a). Nestlings are vulnerable to predation from Toco Toucan <em>Ramphastos toco</em>, Crane Hawk <em>Geranospiza caerulescens</em>, Great-horned Owl <em>Bubo virginianus&#160;</em>and Southern-crested Caracara <em>Caracara plancus</em> (Gould 2013a). Hunting to provide feathers for indigenous headdresses probably has an important impact in some areas (I. Berkunsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). <br/>There are fears that inbreeding within an increasingly fragmented population is resulting in reduced fertility<strong></strong> (Loro Parque Fundación 2003). This is compounded by a lack of recruitment to the breeding population; during a five year study, no new breeding pairs were recruited (Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Disease also represents a significant threat, particularly in areas where the species shares water sources with other bird species (Gould 2013a). A Population Viability Analysis found that changes in adult mortality had the greatest impact on estimates of extinction probability and population growth rates and that habitat loss and poaching also affected these estimates (Strem and Bouzat 2012).<p></p>","Based on comprehensive surveys carried out during the dry season in 2015 across the entire range, and extrapolating the number of individuals detected over the area of suitable habitat, the global population was estimated to number 312-455 individuals (Herzog <em>et al</em>. 2020). This equates to 208-303 mature individuals. Among these, 156-222 individuals are breeding or attempting to breed (Herzog <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Based on current occurrence records, the species is assumed to form three disjunct subpopulations: The north-western subpopulation occurs west of the Marmoré river between Santa Rosa de Yacuma and Santa Ana de Yacuma; the north-eastern subpopulation occurs east of the Marmoré river and north of Trinidad; the southern subpopulation is found south of Trinidad, around and south of Loreto (Herzog <em>et al</em>. 2020). The sizes of each subpopulation have not been estimated in detail, but they are likely extremely small, numbering below 50 mature individuals each. Excluding repeat observations of the same individuals, count data report up to 25 individuals in the north-western subpopulation, up to 16 individuals in the north-eastern subpopulation and up to 21 individuals in the southern subpopulation (Herzog <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Stable,"<em>Ara glaucogularis</em> is known from the Llanos de Mojos in north <strong>Bolivia</strong>.

Officially considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Bolivia (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Agua 2009). Asociación Armonía/Loro Parque Fundación produced a Blue-throated Macaw Recovery Plan in 2003. It was listed as endangered under the U.S.A. Endangered Species Act in November 2013 (Gould 2013b). Live export from Bolivia was banned in 1984, although illegal export was still evident in 1997 (Duffield and Hesse 1997). The Asociación Armonía/Loro Parque Fundación parrot trade monitoring project has recorded reduced levels of trade in the species<strong> </strong>(B. Hennessey <em>in litt. </em>2008), but the large scale illegal trade infrastructure in Bolivia means there is the potential to start trapping again if there is the demand. Agreement has been reached with some landowners to control access and deter potential trappers, and negotiations with other landowners continue<strong> </strong>(Hesse 1998; A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 1999). Based on field surveys, recommendations have been made that the Paraparau region, Beni department, be given greater conservation priority (Tobias 2003).<br/><br/>Much of the remaining population occurs on private ranch-lands. Many landowners are sympathetic to conservation work on their lands and continued support will benefit the species's recovery. Local conservation work has involved planting trees that provide food for the species (Gould 2013a) and a&#160;nest box campaign which has been run since 2004 and has found that there is a great demand for suitable nesting cavities. The active management and monitoring of nest box use has helped to reduce the incidence of nest failure. A recent study found that birds more readily used nest boxes that were placed in the same tree, or very near to a nest site used in previous years (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/>Asociación Armonía, with the help of the American Bird Conservancy and World Land Trust, completed the purchase of a 3,555 ha private reserve protecting at least 20 Blue-throated Macaw in November 2008<strong>&#160;</strong>(BirdLife International 2008). The Barba Azul Nature Reserve protects important foraging and roosting sites for over 100 Blue-throated Macaw individuals from March to early November (Asociación Armonía <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). With additional land purchases, the Barba Azul Nature Reserve was expanded to almost 11,000 ha in 2014 (Anon. 2014b). The reserve is used for education, research and tourism. In 2018, the Laney Rickman Nature Reserve was created, covering an area of 680 ha (American Bird Conservancy 2018). Asociación Armonía started a nest-box programme in their reserves in 2005; since then a total of 93 chicks fledged successfully (Asociación Armonía 2020). The World Land Trust also carries out nest-box provision, as well as the feeding of nestlings and other manipulations. Nest guarding and monitoring has also been introduced at nests that are particularly vulnerable to predation (Gould 2013a). Other measures include on-going surveys of potential areas where populations may persist; a pet trade monitoring programme in two main Bolivian cities, land acquisition programmes conducted in order to protect key habitat and populations, as well as reforestation programmes for the Motacú palm. There has been a widespread education programme, including pamphlets, posters, T-shirts, presentations, short-wave radio spots, video programmes, TV interviews, travel to the most remote ranches giving presentations on laptops, and creation of interpretation centres in the bottle-neck towns of Trinidad, Santa Rosa and Santa Ana. Artificial feathers have been successfully produced and marketed to local people to replace authentic Blue-throated Macaw feathers used in traditional headdresses (Anon. 2014a). <br/><br/>The population in captivity (some of which is held in captive-breeding facilities) is many times larger than the wild population.&#160;In 2009 a formal agreement was signed between the Loro Parque Fundación, Asociación Armonía, the Zoo Fauna Sudamericana and the Noel Kempff Mercado Natural History Museum which formalises the initiation of a managed cooperative breeding programme in Bolivia (Anon. 2008). Modelling the effect of different management strategies on the population dynamics showed that the reintroduction of 50 adult individuals would double the wild population within 10 years (Maestri <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Monitor the population to quantify the current trend. Track movements during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Study the species's habitat requirements. Investigate post-breeding behaviour: a study from 2007 to 2012  suggested that successful pairs do not breed the following year and more  work is needed to ascertain how common this behaviour is (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014).

It is uncommon to scarce across its range. In general, the species is sedentary, with juveniles dispersing as far as 1000km in their first few years. Birds occupying the mostly northerly regions (&gt;65°N), such as Alaska, northern Canada, Fennoscandia and northern Russia, migrate south. In the Nearctic there are southwards movements to southern Alaska and southwest USA in September, via regular flyways, in particular through southwest Alberta. In the Palearctic, movements occur in a broad front to wintering areas in southeast Europe, the Russian steppes, Mongolia, northern China and Japan. Juveniles and immatures will go as far as North Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Habitat </strong>The species occupies a wide range of flat or mountainous, largely open habitats, often above the tree line, from sea level to 4000m. In the Himalayas it has been recorded as high as 6200m (Watson, 2010).<strong> Diet </strong>The species’s diet is very broad, taking mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and carrion variously, depending on the regional prey availability. Prey taken are usually 0.5-4.0 kg and the species can hunt in pairs or small groups (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Breeding Site </strong>Nesting occurs on cliff ledges and where these are not available, in large trees or similar artificial structures. In central and southeastern Mongolia, birds regularly nest on the ground (Ellis 2020). Nests are constructed from sticks and are added to in successive years, growing to 2m in diameter. The breeding season spans March – August throughout the majority of its range, and in southern areas begins as early as November; whilst in the most northerly regions it will start as late as April (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).</p>","The species was heavily persecuted in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, and although this threat has diminished significantly with populations now generally stable, the species is still deliberately poisoned, shot and trapped (for example in landscapes dominated by grouse moors in Scotland [RSPB 2017]). In the past the species was affected by the use of organochlorine pesticides although this is not a significant problem today. There are, however, recent reports of high exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in the USA (Niedringhaus <em>et al. </em>2021). The relationship between stock grazing and Golden Eagle populations is complex - both undergrazing as a result of grassland abandonment and overgrazing have been reported as threats by various European countries (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Electrocution from power lines has been reported as one of the primary causes of anthropogenic mortality in North America - Golden Eagles regularly perch on distribution poles supporting energised equipment (Dwyer <em>et al. </em>2020), and the USFWS (2016) estimated that 504 Golden Eagles are electrocuted annually. Wind energy developments are a source of direct mortality for the species, particularly in California where wandering sub-adults are mostly affected (Watson 2010).&#160; Future developments in flyways may affect migrating adult eagles, and locally may cause effective habitat loss and lead to collisions (Katzner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012b). In addition, afforestation, long term changes in food supply, including reduced livestock carrion through changing management practices, and climate change (for example drought [Smith <em>et al. </em>2020]) may threaten the species in future (Watson 2010). Within the Mediterranean region, declines in rabbit populations as a result of Viral Haemorrhagic Pneumonia may have a negative effect on productivity (Fernández 1993).","The Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020a) estimate the global population to be 130,000 individuals, which equates to approximately 87,100 mature individuals.

Mortality from intentional poisoning, which appears to be a particular problem in hunting reserves where game is commercially exploited, may once again be on the increase (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2016). 15 cases of death have been reported from poisoning events in 2015 - 2016 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2016). This is of particular concern, as the dip in the population in the late 1990s was caused by additional mortality due to poisoning events, with the Doñana National Park population seriously affected by the illegal use of poisoned bait&#160;during this period (Ortega&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009, Ferrer <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Electrocution remains a significant source of mortality, despite mitigation measures leading to a highly significant reduction in the numbers of birds killed (<span class=""msoIns"">Lopez-Lopez <em>et al. </em><span class=""msoIns"">2011). This is a particular problem for immature eagles, and of six satellite-tagged individuals that visited Morocco in 2015 one was electrocuted, prompting the discovery of four further carcasses of immature birds near two recently installed high-voltage powerlines (Godino<em> et al.</em> 2016). Relatively few individuals are believed to have entered Morocco, indicating that powerlines may represent a serious threat to the potential re-establishment of a breeding population in the country. Despite the general success of mitigation measures applied in&#160;Andalucía (<span class=""msoIns"">Lopez-Lopez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em><span class=""msoIns"">2011), eleven individuals have been found electrocuted since 2010 (J.

The development of large areas of land for the production of renewable energy so far does not appear to have had negative impacts, however one individual was found dead in Andalucía in 2012 (J. R.

Human activities in the vicinity of active nests can disturb incubating adults and reduce hatching success (González&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006,&#160;<strong></strong>Margalida&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). The limitation of funds for adequate monitoring and implementation of mitigation actions (particularly around the safety of powerlines for birds) may be a significant constraint in the future (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>i</em><em>n litt</em>. 2016).<strong style=""""></strong><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>","The species's global population is estimated at 530-540 breeding pairs, equating to 1,060-1,080 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>), which is assumed to be indicative of a total population of c.1,600 individuals.",Increasing,"An Iberian breeding endemic eagle, most of the population breeds in <strong>Spain</strong> with a small but increasing population in <strong>Portugal</strong>. In Spain, breeding occurs in the&#160;Sierras of Guadarrama and Gredos, the plains of the Tajo, Tiétar, Guadiana and Duero rivers, the central hills of Extremadura, Montes de Toledo, the Alcudia valley, Sierra Morena, Campo de Montiel, the Guadalquivir marshes, the agricultural lands of&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Cádiz and in Salamanca, Valladolid, Zamora and Burgos (González 1996; S.

Garrido <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>The species recovered from a low of only 30 pairs in the 1960s to 38 pairs in 1970, and to around 200 pairs by 2004 (González and Oria 2004), despite a brief dip in the mid-1990s attributed to a viral haemorrhagic disease reducing rabbit populations (J. Criado<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>1999). The population has subsequently increased considerably, although it now appears to have reached a plateau (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). By 2020, the global population had increased to 530-540 pairs (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Portugal&#160;was recolonised in 2003 after an absence of breeding activity for over 20 years, and numbers have been slowly increasing since, with 16 breeding territories located in 2016 and 17 breeding pairs in 2019 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2013; S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Interchange of individuals has been noted between the populations in Portugal and in&#160;Andalucía. There is considerable variation in the rate of population increase throughout the range: In Extremadura, the increase was only c. 2% between 1990 and 2015 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016), while in&#160;Andalucía&#160;the population has more than doubled since 2008 to 111 pairs (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016). Improved adult survival appears to have driven the population increase and the observed temporal and spatial variation in population growth rates (Ferrer &amp; Calderon 1990; Ortega <em>et al. </em>2009). More recently, reduced adult survival appears to have caused a plateau in population size (<span lang=""EN-US"">S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Initial positive trends were associated with conservation measures, which reduced the mortality associated with powerlines and poisoning events, but also benefited the population through supplementary feeding, reparation of nests, reintroductions and reduction of disturbance during the breeding period (González&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2007,&#160;<span lang=""ES"">López-López <em>et al. </em>2011,&#160;J.

However, recently mortality caused by powerlines, shooting and collision with wind turbines has increased, and poisoning remains a threat (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In Andalucía, a reintroduced population has been established in Cádiz, with four to five breeding pairs producing offspring, which have subsquently bred at several sites in southern Spain and in Portugal (Muriel <em>et al. </em>2011, J. R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016). As a result of the improving fortunes of the species in Iberia, an increasing number of dispersing immature birds are being recorded in <strong>Morocco</strong>, where the species became extinct as a breeding species in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century (Thevenot&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003, Maghreb Ornitho 2017).

Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Around 60% of the total breeding population is now located in protected areas (national and EU Special Protected Areas), down from c. 70% in 2011 (Barov and Derhé 2011), which may reflect the growth of the population into new areas. Dispersal and critical areas for the species have not been updated for several years, therefore many are not legally delimited or protected against damaging activities (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Since 1987, national and regional governments have been implementing a coordinated conservation plan for the species. A European action plan was published in 1996 and updated in 2008 (Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2008). The national plan for Spain was implemented in 2018, while in <span lang=""EN-US"">Portugal a plan is being prepared&#160;(S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). <span lang=""EN-US"">Between 1991-1999, more than 14,000 dangerous electric pylons were modified in Spain, considerably reducing deaths from electrocution (González and Margalida 2008,&#160;López-López&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). As a result, a national law was approved in Spain in 2008, establishing tools for the protection of birds against collision and electrocution in power lines and best practice for new power line construction or modification (Guil <em>et al. </em>2011). &#160;Work has also been carried out to isolate dangerous power lines on private farms (Cabezas-Díaz 2011). In Portugal, the main potentially dangerous electric pylons have been identified in the core areas of the species and a modification plan has been established. Around 40 km of powerlines were modified between 2009 and 2011; however, around 80 km still require funding (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Isolation of power lines has been demonstrated to be obsolete in many cases (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160; <em>in lill. </em>2020). A supplementary feeding programme has been established to mitigate the effects of rabbit decreases, and has significantly increased breeding success (González and Margalida 2008). Nest monitoring has reduced disturbance and improved reproductive success (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">The <em>Soaring&#160;</em>land stewardship network, which was created by SEO/BirdLife and the preceding Flying High Programme, for the conservation of Spanish Imperial Eagle lasted from 2006 to 2015 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016)<span lang=""EN-US"">. This network involved 112 municipalities, 22,000 ha of private land and 96 schools, and focused on habitat management, species conservation, awareness raising and information activities across the whole distribution range in Spain (Cabezas-Díaz and Hernáez 2012). In Castilla-La Mancha, an EU LIFE-funded projected, ""Conservación de especies prioritarias en el monte mediterráneo en Castilla-La Mancha""&#160;is working for the conservation of this and&#160;other species related to Mediterranean forests, while a counterpart project, LIFE Imperial, is focused on the conservation of the species in Portugal (R. Alcazar <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Andalucía, a conservation programme was implemented, which includes hacking techniques for the reintroduction of the species, <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">among other conservation actions (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Work is ongoing to raise awareness and support on private land where the species breeds, including improving habitat management (García 2007), and nearly 50% of breeding pairs are covered by such projects (González and Margalida 2008). In Cádiz, 73 young birds have been released as part of a reintroduction project (Ferrer 2011 <em>unpubl</em>.), and currently five breeding pairs have become established in the province providing a new population nucleus (Muriel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).

It forages in lowland and montane regions over open, often arid, country, and also scavenges at human settlements. It has a broad diet including carrion, tortoises, organic waste, insects, young vertebrates, eggs and even faeces (Margalida <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dobrev <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016). Usually solitary, individuals congregate at feeding sites, such as rubbish tips, or vulture restaurants (i.e. supplementary feeding stations), and form roosts of non-breeding birds<a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date: 20120227T1623""> (Ceballos and Donázar 1990</a>). It performs an energetic display flight with its mate. Several resident island populations show genetic isolation.

Illegal poisoning against carnivores seems to be the main threat operating on the breeding grounds in Spain (Hernandez and Margalida 2009, Sanz-Aguillar <em>et al. </em>2015b) and the Balkans (I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, Oppell <em>et al. </em>2016). Declines in parts of Africa are likely to have been driven by loss of  wild ungulate populations and, in some areas, overgrazing by livestock and improvements in slaughterhouse sanitation<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, Ogada <em>et al. </em>2016). The population crash in the Cape Verde Islands has been attributed to a rise in mortality due to the former use of long-lasting pesticides (some of which, although now illegal, are still easily bought and used), the ongoing poisoning of stray dogs, and a decrease in food availability due to urbanisation, rural abandonment and better sanitation (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2020).<em>&#160;</em>Within the European Union, regulations introduced in 2002, controlling the disposal of animal carcasses, greatly reduced food availability, notably through the closure of traditional ""<em>muladares</em>"" in Spain and Portugal<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Donázar 2004, J. C.

Similarly, closures of over 300 small rubbish dumps in Oman as part of an upgrade in waste management may reduce food availability (S. Al Touqi, cited in McGrady <em>et al. </em>2018), although a study in Turkey found no short-term effect on reproductive success of closure of rubbish dumps (Katzenberger <em>et al. </em>2017). In parts of the range where transhumance occurs, there may be asymmetries in food availability at different times of year (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2018). However, recently passed regulations will permit the operation of feeding stations for scavengers and guidelines about how to operate them exist&#160;(A. Brunner<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al.</em> 2010), and in eastern Europe dietary diversity has no effect on population sizes, but instead could affect territory size (Dobrev&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Poisoning is a significant threat to the species, often through the use of poison baits targeted at terrestrial predators (Carrete <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2009, Cortés-Avizanda <a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623""><em>et al</em>. 2009, 2015 Sanz-Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2015b, Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2016</a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a>), and through the consumption of poisoned animals. Recent analyses from many countries including Bulgaria (Angelov 2009) have highlighted potential contamination of Egyptian Vultures that may lead to increased mortality. Antibiotic residues present in the carcasses of intensively-farmed livestock may increase the susceptibility of nestlings to disease&#160;(e.g. avian pox has been reported as a cause of mortality in Bulgaria<strong><sup> </sup></strong>[Kurtev <em>et al.</em> 2008]).&#160;<br/><br/>It appears that diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for livestock, and which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International 2008), is driving the recent rapid declines in India<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, A. Rahmani <em>in litt</em>. 2012, Galligan <em>et al. </em>2014). NSAIDs are reportedly toxic to raptors, storks, cranes and owls, suggesting that vultures of other genera could be susceptible to its effects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by <em>Gyps</em> spp. vultures<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006). In 2007, diclofenac was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). This drug has recently been approved for veterinary use in Europe, and is commercially available in France and Spain, which is a major concern for the species (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Mortality at power lines has been found to be particularly common on the Canary Islands (Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2007a) and &#160;potentially risky in other regions of Spain (<a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623"">Donázar and Benítez <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span></a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a> 2007, Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and in Africa (Nikolaus 1984, 2006), with 17 individuals found killed by electrocution in Port Sudan, over 10 days in&#160; 2010 (I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2010, Angelov <em>et al. </em>2013a), indicating a potentially serious problem that has persisted for decades and will continue to contribute to Egyptian Vulture population declines. In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W.

The Spanish population was estimated to be stable for the period 1998-2011 (BirdLife International 2015, Tauler <em>et al. </em>2015), and the adjacent French population appears to be increasing (Lieury <em>et al.</em> 2015), although 2015 appeared to be a bad year there (Vulture Conservation Foundation 2016).

The veterinary drug diclofenac has now been banned by the Indian government. In 2007, a survey began to establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). &#160;Due to the recent legalisation of diclofenac for veterinary use in the EU, there is an active campaign against the use of diclofenac in the European Union (http://www.birdlife.org/europe-and-central-asia/project/ban-veterinary-diclofenac). An International species action plan for the species was published in 2008 (Iñigo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). National species action plans are in place in France, Bulgaria and Italy, and the species is included in the Balkan Vulture Action Plan (BVAP). Efforts are being taken to release captive-bred individuals in parts of Italy. In Spain, France, Italy, Bulgaria and Macedonia birds have been fitted with satellite-tags to study juvenile dispersion, migratory movements and wintering areas (e.g. García-Ripollés <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010,&#160;López-López&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Oppell <em>et al. </em>2015). Nest guarding schemes for pairs that are most threatened by poachers have been implemented in Italy and Bulgaria, where very small populations survive (Zuberogoitia<em> et al.</em> 2014, Oppel<em> et al. </em>2016). Expeditions to study the limiting factors in the wintering areas and along the migration flyway have taken place together with local organizations in Mauritania, Senegal, Ethiopia, Sudan and Turkey (Arkumarev <em>et al.</em> 2014, Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2014). A training seminar was held in Ethiopia to help build capacity for conservation of the species on its African wintering grounds (Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds 2013). A LIFE-Nature project in the Canary Islands has significantly enhanced adult and sub-adult survival through actions including education campaigns, control of illegal poisoning and modification of power lines (Badia-Boher <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian vultures was published in 2017 (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), and an international Flyway Action Plan for the Central Asian and Balkan populations was initiated in 2015 in Bulgaria, encompassing the Balkans, Central Asia, Middle East, and East Africa (S.

The species is considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Uganda (WCS 2016).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Start and maintain intensive cooperation with local stakeholders to ensure poison- and poaching-free zones at sites with high densities or congregations of the species throughout the breeding, migration and wintering range, alongside similar efforts for other threatened species. Build capacity in countries along the migration flyways and in the wintering areas. There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies in Namibia (Craig <em>et al. </em>2018). Research threats, monitor populations and protect key sites along migratory pathways and bottlenecks along the Red Sea Flyway (Buechley <em>et al. </em>2018). Protect nest sites where persecution is a problem. Research the causes and extent of current declines across the species's range. Insulate dangerous electricity pylons in areas where high mortality is recorded.  Coordinate monitoring to assess trends throughout the range. Relax the European Union sanitary regulations in relation to carcass disposal. Establish supplementary feeding sites based on rigorous scientific knowledge and under adaptive and appropriate management (Moreon-Opo <em>et al. </em>2015, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al. </em>2016). Raise awareness amongst pastoralists of the dangers of using diclofenac for livestock<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. Effectively reduce risks of poisoning through strict enforcement of poison-bait ban and education. Lobby for the banning of diclofenac for veterinary purposes throughout the species's range, and support the enforcement of this ban where it has been adopted. Where applicable, establish the impact of wind turbines, and lobby for effective impact assessments to be carried out prior to their construction. Where  appropriate, guard nests to reduce disturbance. Confiscate illegally  kept live birds and use them for the purposes of captive breeding and  future restocking and reintroduction programmes. In key areas of the  species's range, implement long-term and large-scale education and  community involvement programmes. The Flyway Action Plan for the conservation of the Egyptian Vulture in Central Asia and the Balkans (2017) additionally highlighted: the need to improve detection methods and better understand the causes of poisoning and illegal killing; legislation and enforcement to mitigate illegal killing; raise awareness of illegal killing; mitigate electrocution and collisions with energy infrastructure; raise awareness amongst planners and developers of dangerous energy infrastructure; monitor breeding pairs, productivity and success rate; protect breeding sites and foraging habitats; and ensure a successful <em>ex situ</em>&#160;Egyptian Vulture endangered species programme.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Information suggests the population has declined rapidly across the majority of its range, and is projected to continue to decline, and it is therefore classified as Vulnerable.","This species requires well-vegetated eutrophic to neutral swamps, marshes, lakes and slow-flowing rivers with areas of open water and abundant emergent fringing vegetation. It also breeds on saline, brackish and soda lakes and occasionally even in sheltered coastal bays (Kear 2005). The breeding grounds are reoccupied from early March (in the south) to early May (in Siberia) (Scott and Rose 1996) with breeding starting from April-May. During the winter the species frequents similar habitats to those it breeds in, including large lakes, slow-flowing rivers, reservoirs, brackish waters, marshes, weirs (Africa) and flooded gravel pits (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Fox <em>et al</em>. 1994, Scott and Rose 1996).&#160;The nest is a depression or shallow cup in a thick heap of vegetation positioned on the ground in shallow water&#160;(Johnsgard 1978,&#160;Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992,&#160;Snow and Perrins 1998,&#160;Kear 2005).&#160;As in the breeding season, the species will shift to coastal habitats such as brackish lagoons, tidal estuaries and inshore waters (where it may associate with sewage outfalls [Kear 2005]) when driven by frost or other compelling factors (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species has been recorded to 2690 m in Ethiopia (Ash and Atkins<em>&#160;</em>2009).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of seeds, roots, rhizomes, the vegetative parts of grasses, sedges and aquatic plants as well as aquatic insects and larvae, molluscs, crustaceans, worms, amphibians and small fish&#160;(Johnsgard 1978,&#160;Brown&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1982,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1992,&#160;Marsden and Bellamy 2000,&#160;Kear 2005).<br/><br/>Northern populations of this species are highly migratory (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Those breeding in the milder parts of western or southern Europe are sedentary or only make short-distance movements, often in response to harsh weather conditions (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), although individuals from some areas, such as France may utilise mulitple localities up to 200 km apart in one winter (Keller <em>et al. </em>2009, Gourlay-Larour <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).&#160;<strong></strong>","<p>It is thought that the primary factors that have led to the decline in this species are most likely to be a combination of: (i) loss of breeding habitat in eastern Europe, and (ii) changes in water chemistry (especially from hyper-eutrophication caused by agricultural runoff). The loss of habitat is thought to primarily result from changes in land management; either the abandonment or intensification of management of lowland marshes and fish ponds (Fox<em> et al.</em> 2016).&#160;The abandonment of traditional lowland grazing marshes results in succession to scrub and other unsuitable habitats, whilst greater agricultural intensification leads to marshes being drained. Negative changes to fish pond management also arise from either a reduction in fish production or an intensification that leads to greater use of fish food and medication treatments, and an increase in nutrient inputs (Fox <em>et al. </em>2016).</p>The species suffers from predation and nest predation by several introduced and native mammals including American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>&#160;(Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003), Raccoon Dog <em>Nyctereutes procyonoides,&#160;</em>Raccoon <em>Procyon lotor</em>, Red Fox <em>Vulpes vulpes</em> and Wild Boar <em>Sus scrofa</em>. Increased predation levels may be partly related to declines in Black-headed Gull <em>Chroicocephalus ridibundus</em> colonies, with which Pochard often associate for the benefits of predator deterrence; pochard breeding in association with gull colonies apparently benefit from elevated breeding success and female survival (Fox&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Väänänen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Invasive carp&#160;<em>Cyprinus carpio</em> may also provide competition for resources with this species, and have been shown to negatively impact the Pochard (Maceda-Veiga <em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;<br/><br/>The species may also be threatened by disturbance from hunting (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992; Evans and Day 2002; Kear 2005; Balmaki and Barati 2006; Sorrenti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006; H. Ibrahim&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), water-based recreation (Fox&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Kear 2005) and from machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000). Pochard are permitted for hunting in several eastern European states, which selects for breeding females and naïve juveniles (Fox <em>et al., </em>2016).&#160;The European hunting bag for the Pochard remains high in proportion to declining populations across the Continent (Hirschfeld <em>et al.,</em>&#160;2019). Brochet <em>et al., </em>(2019) estimates 30,000 birds are illegally killed/taken per year in North &amp; Central Europe and Caucasus, 5% of the population here, with Azerbaijan responsible for the largest number. This amounts to an estimated 2% of the global population. Eggs have also been sold in the UK. Adults are poisoned by ingesting lead shot (Spain) (Mateo <em>et al</em>. 1998), with one estimate that it accounts for the death of 56,511 Pochard in Europe each year (Andreotti <em>et al. in press</em>); and drowned in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm (China) (Quan <em>et al.</em> 2002). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006).&#160;<br/><br/>Emerging threats include climate change and changes to sex ratios. Pochard have a narrow ecological niche, particularly with respect to water conditions which are sensitive to climate change. For example, Jeppesen <em>et al.,&#160;</em>(2015) highlighted how climate change can synergistically act with water abstraction, leading to salinity increases at wetlands and leaving them unsuitable for Pochard. There is also evidence of an increasingly male-biased sex ratio (Brides <em>et al. </em>2017), believed to be due to increasing female mortality (suggestions for this include&#160;migration stress, and greater predation hunting risk during the breeding season) which may be contributing to global population declines.","The global population is estimated to number 760,000-790,000 mature individuals, which equates to 1.14-1.18 million individuals in total (Wetlands International 2021). Three flyways are identified, with the following population estimates: North-East/North-West Europe with 100,000 mature individuals (150,000 total); Central &amp; NE Europe/Black Sea &amp; Mediterranean with 350,000 mature individuals (530,000 total); Western Siberia/South-West Asia with 310,000-330,000 mature individuals (460,000-500,000 total).&#160;The European breeding population is estimated at 89,700-151,000 pairs, which equates to 179,000-302,000 mature individuals or c. 270,000-450,000 total individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).",Decreasing,"The species breeds from western Europe through central Asia to south-central Siberia and northern&#160;<strong>China</strong> (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). It is present throughout the year but may make within-winter movements. European migratory populations winter mostly in north-western and western Europe, the eastern Mediterranean, Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, as well as in <strong>Turkey</strong>, the Middle East and as far south as sub-Saharan Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997,&#160;Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Birds breeding in east of range winter in south-east and east Asia across the Indian sub-continent as far east as <strong>Japan</strong>.","The species may also be threatened by disturbance from hunting (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992; Evans and Day 2002; Kear 2005b; Balmaki and Barati 2006; Sorrenti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006; H.

The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the U.K. attracted nesting pairs to the area by causing an increase in invertebrate food availability and an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes. The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994). In the Trebon Basin Biosphere Reserve, Czech Republic, it was found that artificial islands and wide strips of littoral vegetation are the most secure breeding habitats that can be created for the species (nest survival in littoral habitats was improved by reduced nest visibility, increased water depth, and increased distance from the nest to the habitat edge, and nest survival on islands was improved with increased distance to open water) (Albrecht&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006). The use of lead shot in Europe is being phased out, and there is now a CMS resolution for global action (R.

When inland on migration the species also shows a preference for large river valleys (Flint&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984)<strong></strong>.&#160;Although Herring Gulls exploit refuse tips and farmland extensively all year round, their breeding distribution is extremely coastal compared to other <em>Larus </em>gulls (other than <em>L. marinus</em>) (Gibbons&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993)<strong></strong>. O'Hanlon <em>et al. </em>(2018) found that colonies were larger when associated with sheltered coastlines and farmland, believed to be due to the greater variety and availability of food.&#160;<br/><br/>The species has a highly opportunistic diet and will exploit almost any superabundant source of food (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. It takes fish, earthworms, crabs and other marine invertebrates (e.g. molluscs, starfish or marine worms), adult birds, bird eggs and young, rodents, insects (e.g. ants), berries and tubers (e.g. turnips) (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996)<strong></strong>. It also scavenges at refuse dumps, fishing wharves and sewage outfall zones and frequently follows fishing boats (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Huppop and Wurm 2000)<strong></strong>.&#160;The feeding range has been variously reported as 35 km (for breeding herring gulls in a Dutch colony) (Spaans 1971)<strong></strong>, 41 km (in Westphalia, Germany, outside the breeding season) (Sell and Vogt 1986)<strong></strong>, 50 km (for breeding birds in Morocco) (Witt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1981)<strong></strong>&#160;and 70 to 100 km (for herring gulls breeding in Denmark) (Klein 1994)<strong></strong>. Several other studies have reported shorter foraging distances (Witt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1981, Cramp and Simmons 1983, Sibley and McCleery 1983, Nogales&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Pons and Migot 1995, BirdLife International 2000)<strong></strong>. Refuse tips are frequently exploited by foraging individuals (Sibley and McCleery 1983, Nogales&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Pons and Migot 1995)<strong></strong>&#160;and so the feeding distribution of some colonies will be determined by location of refuse dumps (BirdLife International 2000)<strong></strong>. On the basis of a simple density model of birds at sea, it has been estimated that 95% of herring gulls breeding on Terschelling in the Dutch Wadden Sea foraged within 54 km of the colony (BirdLife International 2000)<strong></strong>.<br/>Northern breeding populations of this species are migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong> although populations in the south are nomadic or completely non-migratory (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species is highly gregarious and gathers in large flocks in favoured sites (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Individuals show foraging site fidelity (Shamoun-Baranes and van Loon 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;<p></p>","<p>The species is at risk from reductions in food supplies due to changes in fishing practices. Reduction in discards has greatly reduced available food in parts of the species range that had seen rapid increases in the previous century. Further, trophic shifts have impacted fishing activity and catch size, which appears to be directly related to colony reproductive success: lower catches are resulting in lower breeding success and the decline of colonies in the UK (Foster <em>et al.</em> 2017). Changes to land-fill management across northern Europe may be detrimental to winter survival of Herring Gulls (Olsson <em>et al. </em>2017, Shlepr <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;</p><p>The species is also vulnerable to collisions with wind turbines (Bradbury <em>et al. </em>2014) and was the most frequently recorded casualty in a study of 4.7 km of the English coastline over 11 years (Newton and Little 2009).&#160;</p><p>In the past, persecution has represented a significant source of mortality however, the EU directive (2009/147/EC) has made it an offense to kill birds or destroy eggs without license. This has likely resulted in a reduction in mortality due to persecution, however, there is still some level of culling, with 5,000 birds culled under license 2010-12 in the UK (Coulson 2015). The threat is unlikely to disappear, with a recent paper calling for lethal controls for closely related <em>Larus</em>&#160;spp. in Gulf of Maine (Scopel and Diamond 2017) however, this is thought to cause negligible declines.&#160;</p><p>The European Herring Gull, among other gulls, is currently at low risk of plastic ingestion in the Arctic, although southern populations have variable levels of plastic ingestion from the proximity to anthropogenic sources of pollution. The risk of plastic ingestion may increase as the human population, shipping and fishing activity increase in the Arctic region (Baak <em>et al. </em>2021).</p><p>The species is threatened by coastal oil pollution (Gorski <em>et al. </em>1977) and is susceptible to avian influenza and so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Botulism reports have been increasing in Britain in the last 45 years and, despite the number of deaths not having been quantified, it is suggested to have been a factor in the population declines in Britain (Coulson 2015). It is vulnerable to being caught as bycatch in fisheries, including longlines, trawls and gillnets (Anderson <em>et al. </em>2011, Zydelis<em> et al</em>. 2013).</p><p></p><p></p>","The breeding population is estimated to number 531,000-608,000 pairs, which equates to approximately 1,060,000-1,220,000 mature individuals and 1,590,000-1,830,000 individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).",Decreasing,"Herring Gulls breed from Iceland, the British Isles and France through northwest Europe to northwest Russia, and northern Siberia east to the Bering Strait.

The population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over 10 years or three generations). The population size may be moderately small to large, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in 10 years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","The species requires large and open expanses of lake, coast or river valley, within the boreal, temperate and tundra zones, nearby to undisturbed cliffs or open stands of large, old-growth trees for nesting. Its food is vertebrates (fish, mammals and especially birds), from marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. It is mainly migratory in the north and east of its breeding range, wintering in continental Europe and southern Asia, but sedentary elsewhere. Birds are usually seen singly, or in twos or threes (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","Threats that affect this species include loss and degradation of wetlands, human disturbance and persecution, environmental pollution, collision with wind generators (Krone and Scharnweber 2003), and indiscriminate use of poisons. Modern forestry methods reduce the availability of suitable nesting habitat (Orta <em>et al</em>. 2013). Organochlorine pesticide and heavy metal pollution resulted in reductions in breeding success, particularly in the Baltic region (Orta <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although some losses may be taking place in Asian Russia owing to increased logging and oil industry development, these are outweighed by increases in Europe.<br/>Accidental lead poisoning from spent ammunition remains a considerable source of mortality in Finland (Isomursu <em>et al. </em>2018), with other anthropogenic causes of death including collisions with traffic and power lines or deliberate shooting. Overall, this study found that anthropogenic factors accounted for 60% of eagle deaths. Loss of large trees has left a deficit of suitable nesting sites, and increasing habituation to humans has meant that eagles nest closer to cities (Shiraki 2018). This has increased the number of collisions between eagles and traffic, and may be linked to lower breeding success (ibid). Collisions with wind turbines is an additional source of mortality (Heuck <em>et al.</em> 2019; Matsuda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2021), though the risk can be mitigated with adaptive management (Matsuda&#160;<em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;<br/>Birds are occasionally threatened by outbreaks of avian influenza virus (Krone <em>et al. </em>2018).","In Europe, the   breeding population is estimated to number 10,400-14,600 breeding pairs,   equating to 20,900-29,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.). Europe   forms 50-74% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the   global population size is 28,200-58,400 mature individuals, although further   validation of this estimate is needed.
