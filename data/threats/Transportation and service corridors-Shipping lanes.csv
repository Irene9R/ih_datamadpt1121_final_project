507698,12695,Malaclemys terrapin,Vulnerable,A4acde,2019,2018-06-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>                 <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em>&#160;is assessed as Vulnerable due to observed threats documented in the past and projected into the future with ≥35% population declines of monitored populations resulting from overexploitation, accidental mortality as bycatch in commercial Blue Crab fisheries, coastal habitat loss due to development, principally the loss of limited nesting habitat, in addition to extensive estuarine saltmarsh loss, and ongoing subsidized nest predation by mesopredators (threats reviewed in Roosenburg 2004; Butler <em>et al</em>. 2018; Chambers and Maerz 2018; Roosenburg and Kennedy 2018). Overall, it is our assessment that <em>M. terrapin</em> has sustained range-wide population declines over the last 30 years (two generations) of 25-30% and that the rate of decline is predicted to continue at the same rate for another 15 years (one generation), or about a 10-15% further decline, for a total decline over three generations (45 years) of 35-45%. The species therefore meets the criteria for Vulnerable designation under criteria A4acde. <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> was last assessed in 1996, when it was evaluated as Near Threatened.<br/><br/>Documenting population declines for a long-lived species like <em>M. terrapin</em> is challenging and requires intensive, long-term sampling (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 2001). Female terrapins become sexually mature at 4-13 years and longevity may exceed 50 years. Using an average estimated generation time of 15 years, it is reasonable to examine trends in the terrapin population for the past 30 years (two generations) and project 15 years (one generation) into the future. Subpopulations for which long-term data are available show significant declines, upwards to 75% decrease in population size over 20 years in the two populations with long term data in South Carolina (Gibbons <em>et al</em>. 2001; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007), Maryland (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data), and 55% decline in a New York population over 20 years (R.L. Burke, unpubl. data). Other populations have high mortality rates due to anthropogenic causes (Wood and Herlands 1997; Avissar 2006; Szerlag and McRobert 2006; Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018) and, in some cases, a change in population structure has been observed (Roosenburg <em>et al.</em> 1997; Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is not possible to determine range-wide population declines over specific time periods other than to rely on anecdotal evidence suggesting that terrapins are now rarely encountered in areas where they were once relatively common (Kennedy 2018a,b).</p><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p></p></span>","<p>                      </p><p><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> is found in brackish coastal waters (salinity range = 0 to <a style=""mso-comment-reference: WMR_1;mso-comment-date:20161231T0810"">35</a>). Typical habitats include coastal regions, estuaries, lagoons, tidal creeks, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. In coastal estuaries supporting large watersheds, terrapins can occur far inland up to the terminal end of the salt wedge (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, Hudson River, and Pamlico Sound). Although <em>M. terrapin</em> is found in brackish water, periodic access to freshwater is necessary for long-term health, and populations in high salinity habitats actively seek and drink freshwater which is essential for neonate survival and growth (Dunson 1985; Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2009) and may be a contributing factor to the semi-terrestrial behavior of neonates to 3-year-olds.&#160;Hatchlings are exceptionally desiccation tolerant (Figueras <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The diet of <em>M. terrapin</em> consists largely of invertebrates, crustaceans, and mollusks (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995, 2018) and a variety of plant materials and algae (Tulipani 2015; Erazmus <em>et al</em>. 2018). In some populations terrapins are predators of the Salt Marsh Periwinkle (<em>Littoraria irrorata</em>), a snail that grazes on epiphytes that grow on Salt Marsh Cord Grass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>). Silliman and Bertness (2002) demonstrated through a series of experiments that when periwinkle predators were removed, periwinkles damage and kill cord grass, leaving a barren mudflat and increasing marsh erosion rates. Although terrapins were not removed or tested in this experiment, as a periwinkle predator they are frequently identified as a potential saltmarsh keystone species. This extrapolation suggests that healthy terrapin populations play a role in maintaining primary production in salt marsh ecosystems and stabilizing shoreline vegetation, thus reducing local erosion.<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> exhibits considerable variation in size, sexual size dimorphism, and reproductive output throughout its range. In general, along the Atlantic sea board there is a gradient of increasing body size, greater sexual dimorphism, later ages of maturity, and higher reproductive output with increasing latitude (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Gulf Coast populations do not conform to this latitudinal variation and are larger than their counterparts on the Atlantic Coast at the same latitude. Most comprehensive life history data come from long-term studies of populations in South Carolina, Maryland, and New York, with limited data from other parts of the range focused mostly on reproductive output and females. Nonetheless, the differences in morphological and life history traits contribute to different environmental stressors and management strategies relevant to terrapin populations throughout the range. Careful modeling is needed to compare reproductive traits among populations to assess how total annual reproductive output per individual varies along the latitudinal gradient.<br/><br/>Diamondback Terrapins under natural conditions exhibit high adult survivorship, low reproductive rates, and high egg/juvenile mortality characteristic of most temperate turtles (Mitro 2003). As a consequence of this suite of life history traits, increases in adult mortality result in declining populations (Congdon <em>et al</em>. 1993, 1994). Marked variation in life history traits can be attributed to a broad latitudinal distribution (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Females from northern populations mature later and at a relatively larger size than those from southern populations. Clutch size and body size appear to be somewhat correlated over the range; females from New York average 12.8 eggs per clutch (Burke <em>et al</em>. 2018), Maryland females may produce as many as 26 eggs per clutch (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data), and smaller females from more southern populations produce only 4–6 eggs per clutch (Seigel 1984). Average annual reproductive output depends on the number of clutches produced per season. In Chesapeake Bay populations, the average female may produce 1–3 clutches of about 13 eggs in a single nesting season (13–40 eggs/year) and detailed nesting data suggest that terrapins rarely forgo nesting annually, but the number of clutches per year may vary (Roosenburg and Dunham 1997). For detailed reviews of reproductive data, see Roosenburg (1994), Butler <em>et al</em>. (2006a, 2006b), Brennessel (2006), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Lovich <em>et al</em>. (2018).<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> demonstrates marked sexual dimorphism, most likely as a fecundity advantage (Carr 1952), with females being considerably larger, with maximum reported population mean female carapace length of 20.1 cm and male carapace length of 13.3 cm (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Female terrapins can reach weights over 2.5 kg in northern populations, but males rarely exceed 0.5 kg throughout the range (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). The maximum recorded size for an adult female, 32 cm carapace length, is much greater than that of males, 16 cm, from the same population, and the discrepancy between male and female size increases with latitude (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Female terrapins mature later and at a larger size than males. The resulting difference in body size is more pronounced in more northern populations. Size differences result in differences in jaw morphology and bite forces that likely contribute to resource partitioning (diet, habitat) between the sexes (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1999; Herrel <em>et al</em>. 2018). Throughout their geographic range, population means for hatchlings range from 25–38 mm in carapace length and 6.3–8.8 g in mass (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Maturity is reached at 4–13 years of age in females, and 2–7 years in males, depending on location (see summary in Brennessel 2006). Longevity may be greater than 40 years for some individuals; marked adult females have been recaptured 30 years after their initial capture as adults (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation time has not been reported in the published literature; available information indicates that it ranges from 13 to 20 years and also increases with increasing latitude (Mitro 2003; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation times in more southern populations are shorter, as maturity at lower latitudes is attained several years earlier (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Nesting requirements vary among subpopulations (Roosenburg 1994, Butler <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> embryos have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), with females produced at higher incubation temperatures, generating&#160;important differences between populations (Jeyasuria <em>et al</em>. 1994; Burke and Calichio 2014). The challenges of climate change, combined with sea level rise and nesting habitat loss (Michener <em>et al</em>. 1997, Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017) could potentially affect sex ratios in populations. The conservation challenges associated with climate change and TSD as it affects sex ratios generates new concerns for the effective management of terrapin populations throughout their range, particularly when integrated with the nesting habitat loss due to development (Seigel and Gibbons 1995).<br/><br/>Terrapin hatchlings in northern parts of the range also facultatively overwinter in the nest, suggesting that the nesting environment is critical habitat throughout the entire year (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2018; Graham 2009; Kitson 2016). Post-emergence neonate habitat is poorly known, but after emergence, some hatchlings move to shallow, self-excavated hibernacula in upland areas (Draud <em>et al</em>. 2004, Duncan and Burke 2016) before moving into intertidal marshes where they may remain semi-terrestrial well into their second growing season (Muldoon and Burke 2012). Adult terrapins hibernate communally in depressions in the mud at the bottom of tidal creeks and embayments protected from prevailing weather (Haramis <em>et al</em>. 2011), in undercut banks within the tidal zone, or burrow into creek banks (Yearicks <em>et al</em>. 1981). Southern subspecies (e.g., <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em>) may be active throughout the winter.</p><br/><p></p>","<p>                      </p><p>                     </p><p>Four main factors pose the most significant threats to <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> populations: 1) mortality of juveniles and adults in crab pots and mostly nesting females on roads, 2) loss of nesting and juvenile habitat to development and sea level rise, 3) the effect of subsidized predators at nesting beaches (Roosenburg 1991; Siegel and Gibbons 1995; Feinberg and Burke 2003; Woodland et al. 2017), and 4) loss of estuarine saltmarsh and mangrove habitats throughout their range (Kennish 2001; Ner and Burke 2008; Gedan <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In states with a commercial Blue Crab (<em>Callinectes sapidus</em>) fishery, which includes almost the terrapin’s entire range, incidental drowning in crab pots is considered to be the major threat to <em>M. terrapin</em> (Butler <em>et al</em>. 2006; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Terrapins, attracted to the bait, enter through an underwater opening, become trapped, and drown within a few hours (Wood 1997; Roosenburg 2004; Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Small males and juveniles are caught more frequently than adult females due to the limitations on the size of the trap entrance. Wolak <em>et al</em>. (2010) suggested that high mortality in crab traps has led to selection on body size traits in a Chesapeake Bay population. Most studied populations where terrapins occurred with crab pots have skewed sex ratio biased toward females that have lower catch rates because of their larger size (Chambers and Maerz 2018).&#160;Crab pots remain the most prominent threat to terrapin populations and their ubiquitous use throughout the terrapin’s range and habitat hamper other conservation restoration efforts because the mortality caused by crab pots is so high.<br/><br/>Adult female terrapins are frequently struck and killed by motor vehicles while attempting to cross roads and motorways in search of nesting sites (Wood and Herlands 1997; Szerlag and McRobert 2006; Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011; Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018). Hatchling terrapins migrate to water after emerging from the nest and can get trapped in vehicular tire tracks left in the sand on nesting beaches. If the hatchlings are unable to escape, they may die of dehydration or be crushed by the next vehicle. Large female terrapins often bear scars from the propellers of motor boats; in the Chesapeake Bay region and in Jamaica Bay, New York, boat impacts are a significant source of mortality for this age class in areas with moderate to high boat traffic (Roosenburg 1991; R.L. Burke and Roe, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Although most states now have legislation that regulates the collection of <em>M. terrapin</em> (Hackney 2010; Nanjappa and Conrad 2011; Kennedy 2018a), this species is still taken commercially in parts of Louisiana. Commercial interest in terrapins remains high, primarily for trade and consumption in Asia or to Asian communities in North America. Hatchlings sell in pet markets of Hong Kong for $50-500 each depending on colouration (T. Leuteritz, pers. comm.). In 2006, the last year in which terrapins were legally harvested in Maryland, watermen reported a catch of 10,500 pounds of terrapins. Additionally, harvest of terrapins for turtle farms in the US and Asia is taxing wild populations and contributing to potential illegal harvest in states where they are currently protected. One such event resulted in the offtake of more than 3,000 females from a single population in New Jersey. Serendipitously, this event resulted in the closure of the commercial terrapin harvest in New Jersey.<br/><br/>One of the terrapin subspecies, <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em>, is considered endemic and endangered in its restricted range in southern Florida. Unless examined by expert terrapin biologists familiar with all the subspecies, <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em> could easily be traded unnoticed because of its similarity to the other subspecies. Similar to endangered map turtles, genus <em>Graptemys</em>, some of which also can only be recognized by experts, the trade of endangered terrapin subspecies is facilitated by the trade of the species in general. Furthermore, several states throughout the range have provided protected status to terrapins or restricted trade and harvest. These terrapins cannot be distinguished from terrapins that were collected from areas where they were legally harvested or from farm-produced individuals.<br/><br/>Habitat destruction poses a serious and ongoing threat to the species. The Diamondback Terrapin’s range is coincident with areas of dense human population (Ner and Burke 2008), and &gt;50% of original estuarine saltmarsh habitat in terrapin range has been lost over the last century (Kennish 2001). Coastal development, particularly salt marsh draining and shoreline armoring for residential or agricultural purposes, increased use of coastal waterways for commercial and recreational purposes, and loss of sand dunes (important nesting habitat) contribute to habitat loss and degradation which negatively affects terrapins (Isdell <em>et al</em>. 2015). Coastal development is particularly problematic because it frequently destroys nesting beaches (Roosenburg 1991; Roosenburg and Place 1995). Three consequences of development for terrapins are: 1) higher concentration of nesting habitat in remaining areas resulting in greater predation rates of nests, 2) alteration of incubation conditions potentially affecting survivorship and gender because of temperature-dependent sex determination, and 3) increased predation on adult females. Additionally, sea level rise due to climate change may have a severe impact on diamondback terrapin habitat including loss of nesting habitat, but more seriously the elimination of critical juvenile salt marsh habitat. Recent GIS modeling based on predicted sea level rise suggests substantial habitat loss during the next 50-100 years in Chesapeake Bay (Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Human-subsidized predators (i.e., native or introduced animals whose populations prosper as a result of association with humans and human-altered habitats) are another threat to turtle populations (Boarman 1997). Studies across the range have identified (locally introduced) Raccoons (<em>Procyon lotor</em>), Skunks (<em>Mephitis mephitis</em>), Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), feral Hogs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), and non-native Norway Rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) as major predators on the adults, juveniles, and eggs of <em>M. terrapin</em>, accounting for a nest predation rate of 92%, and emerging hatchling predation rate of up to 20% (Feinberg and Burke 2003; Draud <em>et al</em>. 2004; Muldoon and Burke 2012; Buzuleciu <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Finally, the impacts of various pollutants in heavily urbanized estuarine environments jeopardize terrapin populations. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), heavy metals and various insecticides and herbicides all potentially affect terrapins (Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2018). Many of these compounds have been discovered in terrapins and have been demonstrated to have deleterious effects on development, growth, and survival (Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2009; Holliday and Holliday 2011; Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Microplastics, which are both pollutants themselves and synergists with other pollutants, were found in the feces of eight of eight terrapins tested in Jamaica Bay, New York (R.L. Burke, unpubl. data).</p><p></p>","<p>In the early 1900s, populations of <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> were in danger of extinction due to intense commercial harvest for human consumption (Hay 1917). Although pre-harvest population data are lacking, many populations had recovered to some extent by the late 20th century and <em>M. terrapin</em> was listed as Lower Risk/Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List in 1996 (Kennedy 2018b). However, data from long-term studies (Avissar 2006; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Roosenburg 2004; Wood and Herlands 1997) suggest that many terrapin populations are again in decline. Effects that contribute to observed declines in well-studied subpopulations (ongoing habitat loss/degradation, crab pot mortality, subsidized nest predation, and road mortality) are ubiquitous and likely to have a similar effect throughout the terrapin’s range (Seigel and Gibbons 1995). Low recruitment due to high nest predation, juvenile and adult male mortality in crab pots and high adult female mortality from vehicle collisions and crab pots in southern populations are cause for alarm because population models suggest a stable population requires both modest recruitment and, most importantly, high adult survival (Roosenburg 2004; Mitro 2003).<br/><br/>In Kiawah, South Carolina, population estimates from a mark-recapture study of <em>M. terrapin</em><span class=""datalabel1""> suggest a decline of 75% over the last two decades (Gibbons <em>et al</em>. 2001; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). High male and juvenile mortality rates in this population, likely due to incidental drowning in crab pots, result in an increase in the proportion of large females in the population (Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). Similarly, crab pots have been suggested to cause female biased sex ratios (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) and potentially driving the evolution of male body size (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010) in Chesapeake Bay. Similar levels of decline have been observed in the adult female population during a 20 year population study in the Patuxent River of Chesapeake Bay. Factors contributing to the decline in the Patuxent population include commercial harvest, bycatch mortality in commercial fisheries, an oil spill, and nesting habitat loss (W.M. Roosenburg, <span class=""datalabel1"">unpubl<span class=""datalabel1"">.<span class=""datalabel1""> data<span class=""datalabel1"">).<br/><br/>Commercial and recreational use of crab pots continues to be the major contributing factor to the population declines from New Jersey to Texas (Bishop 1983; Wood 1997; Roosenburg 2004; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Seigel and Gibbons 1994; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Populations in Chesapeake Bay have female biased sex ratios due to the impact of crab pots (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) in addition to compensatory growth and changed size structure as a consequence of continued crab pot mortality (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent work has suggested that even a single crab pot in a tidal creek or local area can drive population declines (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In estuaries near Tuckerton,&#160;New Jersey, road mortality contributed to a significant decline in the number of adult females over 13 years (Avissar 2006). This demographic shift was not attributed to crab pot mortality because the site is closed to crabbing; however, a decline in large females is consistent with the observation that road mortality of nesting females had increased (Avissar 2006; Szerlag and McRobert 2006). A long-term study on the Cape May Peninsula of southernmost New Jersey documented 4,020 road kills during a 7-year period (Wood and Herlands 1997). As of 2011, the total number of roadkills at this study site has surpassed 10,000 adult females (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data). The terrapin population decline during this time is unknown, but is likely substantial because the area also has a significant commercial and recreational crab fishery (Wood 1997). Similarly in Georgia, small tidal creeks impacted by commercial crabbing and nearby roads had reduced terrapin populations relative to creeks more isolated from these threats (Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>New York’s largest terrapin populations inhabit the heavily-urbanized Jamaica Bay. Researchers observed over 2,000 nests on one island in this study area in 1998 (Feinberg and Burke 2003). Recruitment is low because annual nest predation rates, primarily by raccoons, vary from 92-100%. The number of nests laid per year declined 43% from 1999-2011 (Feinberg and Burke 2003; R.L. Burke, unpubl. data) and the nesting terrapin population has experienced a 55% decline from 1998 to 2017 (R.L. Burke and Roe, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Little is known about terrapin populations along the Gulf Coast. Historical accounts suggest large populations once existed in this part of the range, but overexploitation has reduced populations which are slow to recover in the face of heavy crabbing pressure (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Dauphine Island, Alabama, formerly supported a significant terrapin fishery which currently remains as a relic population (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Recent studies in Louisiana have discovered subpopulations in the Rockefeller National Wildlife Refuge and its adjoining bayous and in Barataria Bay, but detailed population and life history data are lacking from this area (Selman <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pearson and Wiebe 2018). Small populations are also known from Galveston Bay, Texas, but the combination of development and pollution has reduced the available habitat to a few small islands within the bay (V. Guillory, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Bermuda’s terrapin population is estimated at about 100 individuals and recruitment is low, caused by low nest success (Outerbridge 2014). The reasons for developmental failure are not known, but could be due to insecticides and herbicides used around the only wetland where terrapins are found (M.E. Outerbridge, pers. comm.).</span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Malaclemys terrapin </em>inhabits the estuarine coastal waters of the United States along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Corpus Christi, Texas (Iverson 1992; TTWG 2017). A breeding subpopulation also is found in the Bermuda Islands (Davenport et al. 2005), which was considered native by Parham <em>et al</em>. (2008) and genetically attributed to subspecies <em>M. t. centrata</em>. The human role in the origin of the Bermuda subpopulation remains under consideration (Lovich and Hart 2018), but it currently is an established and protected population (Outerbridge 2014).<br/><br/>Subspecific distributional information for the morphologically-defined historically recognized subspecies is as follows (noting, however, that molecular phylogeography does not agree with this pattern, but that a revised taxonomy has not yet been formulated; see Taxonomy section):<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin terrapin</em>: from Cape Cod, Massachusetts southward to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin centrata</em>.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin centrata</em>: from the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina southward to northern peninsular Florida, where it meets and intergrades with <em>M. terrapin tequesta</em>; also on Bermuda.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin tequesta</em>: Atlantic east coast of peninsular Florida to Biscayne Bay, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em>.</p>  <p><em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em>: Florida Keys westward to the Marquesas Keys.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin macrospilota</em>: Gulf coast of peninsular Florida, intergrading with <em>M. terrapin pileata</em> in the panhandle and with <em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em> in Florida Bay.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin pileata</em>: from the Florida panhandle, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin macrospilota, </em>to<em> </em>Louisiana, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin littoralis</em>.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin littoralis</em>: western Louisiana and the coast of Texas, at least as far south as Corpus Christi Bay.<br/><br/>Anecdotal reports that this species is found in Mexican waters (e.g., Carr 1952) have been disputed (Smith and Smith 1979); there is no credible information indicating occurrence in Mexico (Iverson 1992; Mexican Red List Workshop participants, Sept. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Range Size:</strong>&#160;The presence of a coastal species like <em>M. terrapin</em> is difficult to determine because of their cryptic nature and the inaccessibility of much of their habitat. Its distribution is discontinuous along the ~5,000 km of coastline between Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Corpus Christi, Texas. However, it is unknown if the discontinuity can be attributed to natural biological boundaries or to barriers created by extensive urbanization and industrial development in portions of its coastal habitat. Terrapins inhabit salt marshes that form on the bay side of barrier islands, and the extent to which they move inland via estuaries varies considerably, but seems to be bounded by waters that are brackish for most of the year.&#160; Nonetheless, terrapin habitat, salt marsh juvenile habitat, and nesting areas, have all diminished greatly because of salt marsh loss and the development of coastal and estuarine waterfront (Kennish 2001; Ner and Burke 2008). No range-wide population estimate is available, but data are consistent in that subpopulations are local, sensitive to anthropogenic perturbation, and many individually studied subpopulations are small, while others are more robust (summarized in Roosenburg and Kennedy 2018).</p>","<p><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em>&#160;was utilized for food prior to European settlement in North America; however, as human populations increased throughout the terrapin’s range and terrapin consumption became fashionable, the exploitation reached unsustainable levels. By the late 19th century native populations were in dramatic decline, warranting the first federal attempts to farm terrapins (Kennedy 2018a). Captive propagation for commercial purposes was initiated in the early 20th century because of range-wide population declines and danger of extinction, indicating that fisheries of wild populations were not sustainable (Hay 1917). Extensive data are available for artificial propagation of terrapins for commercial purposes (Hay 1917; Coker 1920; Hildebrand and Hatsel 1926; Hildebrand 1932) but the general consensus of these studies was that it is not economically feasible to farm terrapins as a food source because of slow growth rates. The demand for terrapin meat eventually decreased and the depleted populations began to slowly recover after 1930 (Carr 1952). In the early 2000s increases in the commercial capture and trade of terrapins were identified (USDA 2011). Most of the captured turtles were shipped to Asian communities in major metropolitan areas in the US and also exported to Asia. This increase in demand alarmed turtle biologists and prompted many states to increase regulations, protection, and monitoring of terrapin populations (Kennedy 2018a). The primary concern with the resurgence of the commercial terrapin fishery is that, combined with habitat degradation, recovery will be slower, if not impossible. Export data for terrapins in 1999-2010 indicate an increase in the number of individuals and shipments, primarily as exports to Asia (USDA 2011). Concern about the increases in terrapin export has resulted in the closure of the remaining commercial wild harvest in all states except Louisiana. Maryland closed their commercial fishery, based primarily on the export to China and declining populations in Chesapeake Bay (Roosenburg <em>et al.</em> 2008). Following the closure of the Maryland fishery exports dropped by approximately 25% from their peak and most exports at this time are believed to originate from farms, although this has not been confirmed. Today, Louisiana remains the only state where terrapins can be harvested from the wild for commercial sale. Many states maintain a subsistence harvest of two per day for either consumption or pets.<br/><br/>Terrapins are currently bred in captivity (turtle farms) on a small scale in the United States and the hatchlings are sold commercially for the pet trade and to supply aquaculture rearing facilities in Asia that eventually supply the consumption trade and maintain reproductive colonies for the pet trade. Recent exports of high numbers of terrapin hatchlings originating from the single commercial turtle farm in Maryland revealed that successful terrapin farming requires a constant infusion of wild brood stock. The adults that produced most of the hatchlings sold were obtained from New Jersey in a manner that was disputably legal or illegal; New Jersey subsequently closed its commercial terrapin fishery (T. Leuteritz, pers. comm.).</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>Diamondback Terrapins are protected from commercial exploitation in most states where they occur, but as of early 2018 commercial harvests remain permitted under regulations in Louisiana (Kennedy, 2018a). Personal possession is permitted under certain conditions in most states (Nanjappa and Conrad 2011; Kennedy, 2018a) but restricted in most cases to no more than two individuals and permits required for possession as pets. <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> was included in CITES Appendix II in 2013, making its international trade subject to determinations and evaluation that traded volumes are not detrimental to the survival of wild populations.<br/><br/>Hackney (2010) used the standardized Natural Heritage Program to compare the conservation status of terrapins among range states. Of the 16 range states, one (Rhode Island) lists the species as S1, or critically imperiled. Four states list the species as S2, imperiled, while six states list it as S3, vulnerable. Four states consider the diamondback terrapin to be S4, apparently secure. South Carolina has not ranked terrapins according to this scale. State protective listing or harvest regulation in all range states is recommended. In Bermuda, diamondback terrapins have level 2 protection under the Protected Species Order 2012.<br/><br/>Diamondback Terrapins reside in coastal habitats that are intensively used and modified by humans (Kennish 2001, Ner and Burke 2008, Gedan <em>et al</em>. 2009). Safeguarding areas of optimal habitat, particularly foraging, nesting and hibernation sites, from development and other modification is essential for the long-term survival of this species. Terrapins occur in a substantial number of protected areas and their movement is limited (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mortality in crab pots and habitat fragmentation are suggested to reduce gene flow while signatures of the past commercial trade and movement of terrapins are still detectable in some populations (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2017, Converse and Kuchta, 2018). Terrapins use a variety of estuarine habitats throughout their range and local populations effectively exploit their native habitat. Populations can grow and respond quickly when provided with predator-free nesting areas, high quality juvenile habitat, and protection of adults, in particular reproductive females (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014, R.L. Burke, unpubl. data), suggesting that estuarine or marine preserves combined with nest predator control can provide an effective tool to restore terrapin populations in areas where numbers are reduced (Roosenburg 2018).<br/><br/>Bycatch reduction devices (BRD) can greatly reduce the number of terrapins that drown in crab traps (Wood 1997; Hoyle and Gibbons 2000; Roosenburg and Green 2000; Butler and Heinrich 2007). By installing BRDs in crab pots, most adult female terrapins are excluded, particular in mid-Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, and the Gulf coast regions where body sizes are larger. BRDs are also effective in southern Atlantic regions and Florida and perhaps more important because adult females never outgrow the vulnerability to crab pots without BRDs (Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011). Several states now require BRDs; however, regulations vary considerably across the terrapin’s range (Hackney 2010), as does the intensity of enforcement of regulations. Broad adoption of BRDs will significantly assist the species' prospects (Guillory and Prejean 1998; Rook <em>et al</em>. 2010; Radzio <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Perhaps the greatest concern for terrapins is entrapment in derelict or ghost crab pots that are not regularly checked. Several cases have been recorded where &gt;20 individuals have been recovered dead from crab pots that were abandoned, one with more than 100 individuals (Bishop 1983; Roosenburg 1991; Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>  <p>                     </p><p>Since 2003, research scientists and summer interns at The Wetlands Institute in New Jersey have deployed barrier fencing to reduce road mortality in their study area. Results to date suggest that barrier fencing can be an effective terrapin conservation tool (McLaughlin <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, at JFK Airport in New York, personnel successfully use barrier fencing to keep terrapins off runways (Burke and Francoeur 2014). Combined with nesting habitat improvement adjacent to roadways, fencing can dramatically reduce roadway mortality and help direct terrapins to protected nesting sites (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018). Finally, roadway warning signals activated at times of peak nesting in high use areas can dramatically reduce nesting female road mortality. Impacts by watercraft also present a problem for terrapins in areas with high boat traffic (Roosenburg 1991; Lester <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, terrapins appear not to respond to the noise of approaching vessels, increasing the risk of boat impact; thus suggesting that marine speed limits near areas of terrapin congregation (e.g., nesting beaches) would be the only effective mechanism to reduce boat strikes (Lester <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018).<br/><br/>Nest protection and head-starting programs exist at a variety of locations, and are subject to active research on their effective contribution to population dynamics and establishment success (Herlands <em>et al</em>. 2004; Smeenk 2010; Petrov 2014; Roosenburg 2018). High nest predation remains a key conservation problem for terrapins and control of mammalian nest predators increases nest success (Munscher <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the complete absence of nest predators can contribute to population recovery (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). Head-starting can supplement population growth and head-started individuals can establish within native populations. Furthermore, head-started females can become reproductive and some remain in the local population where they were released (Roosenburg 2018). However, the low level of gene flow among populations (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2015) suggests that source animals should only come from the same population they will supplement or from the nearest population for extirpated areas.<br/><br/>One example of effective terrapin conservation and restoration is the Paul S. Sarbanes Environmental Restoration Project at Poplar Island, Chesapeake Bay, Maryland (Roosenburg et al. 2014, Roosenburg 2018). Poplar Island’s restoration has established predator-free nesting habitat and extensive salt marsh habitat for juveniles. There also is an active head-starting program on Poplar Island. The terrapin population on Poplar Island is growing rapidly due primarily to the high nest survival (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014) and high quality juvenile habitat that ensures high post-hatching juvenile survivorship (Roosenburg 2018). Although head-starting does contribute to population growth, its impacts are secondary to that of the habitat creation and protection (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). The Poplar Island example illustrates the basic requirements for population recovery which suggests that estuarine reserves or sanctuaries that include both nesting and juvenile habitat, combined with nest predator control, offer an excellent strategy for terrapin population recovery.<br/><br/>Further research on terrapin conservation is needed, particularly towards understanding individual and seasonal movement patterns, habitat use at different life stages, and refinement of the taxonomy. Although some populations and areas are well studied, other parts of the range have less data, particularly the Gulf Coast and the populations within Pamlico Sound and the estuarine waters of North Carolina, and southern New England. Most states have some form of ongoing terrapin research, but the expansive range and the need for boats to access key habitats limits both surveys and detailed population studies. Recent work also has suggested that climate change will dramatically affect habitat availability for terrapins, particularly the juvenile dependence on saltmarsh habitat, which is predicted to decline dramatically due to sea level rise (Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further study of the effects of sea level rise is needed to evaluate how habitat and resources will be affected.<br/><br/>Although these conservation targets have been known for years, declines in terrapin populations have not been fully addressed for a variety of issues. Conservation measures, such as establishing requirements for bycatch reduction devices in crab pots, have often been effectively resisted by commercial fishermen through political lobbying efforts. Furthermore, even with regulations in place, lack of compliance and enforcement results in ineffective use rates (Radzio <em>et al</em>. 2014). Finally, conflicts between the preservation of nesting habitat shoreline and the development and protection of high-value coastal real estate seem to preempt terrapin conservation measures. Despite the slow pace of terrapin conservation, some progress has been made to reduce road mortality in some areas (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b) and population recovery and growth have been observed in at least one population (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). Additionally, the technology to reduce terrapin capture in crab pots has made substantial progress (Roosenburg 2004, Chambers and Maerz 2018) as range-wide fine-tuning of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) continues (Schwenter and Arndt, unpubl. data).</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

This species is targeted by various fishing gears in mixed grunt catches throughout its range. Species-specific data on catch landings are not available and there is little numeric information to evaluate. Declines are suspected at least off Brazil, but little is known on the overall status of its population. Due to the unknown impacts from fishing, this species is listed as Data Deficient. It is suggested that species-specific abundance information be obtained, particularly long term data, in areas where the species is heavily harvested. Further research on its life history is also needed.","This species inhabits rocky habitats in shallow and mid-shelf areas. It is often found near the shelter of caves, ledges or wrecks (Lieske and Myers 1994) and also occurs in tidepools (Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2008). Its has been observed near petroleum production platforms off the coast of Florida (Seaman <em>et al. </em>1989). Habitat surveys in Bonaire revealed that mature adults (&gt;20 cm) were most often found on shallow reefs 10-15 m, however it could not be established which biotope was used as a nursery by juveniles (Nagelkerken<em> et al</em>. 2000). Nearshore hardbottom habitats in south Florida are used abundantly by newly settled larvae and early juveniles (Lindeman and Snyder 1999). In Brazil, this species is common on deep reefs at depths of 35-60 m (Feitoza <em>et al.</em> 2005). A study of a tidal flat in Parangua Bay, Brazil, found this species to be one of the most abundant species (Spach <em>et al</em>. 2004). Smaller juvenile <em>A. surinamensis</em> individuals utilized some estuary areas and moved into transitional reef zones as they grew larger (Xavier<em> et al</em>. 2012). It feeds at night on crustaceans, molluscs, smaller fish and the long-spined urchin, <em>Diadema antillarum</em> (Randall <em>et al</em>. 1964).&#160;This species may form spawning aggregations (Luckhurst 2002). In Jamaica, sexually mature adults have been observed between April and August (Munro<em> et al</em>. 1972). Maximum total length for this species is 76 cm and the maximum published weight is 5,780 g (IGFA 2001).","This species is harvested by commercial, artisanal and recreational fishers in many areas of its range. Its shallow habitats are affected by coastal development, agricultural activities and watershed pollution. The impacts of fishing pressure, lack of enforcement of a spearfishing ban, and urbanization and degradation of coastal nursery areas may have impacts on this species in Curacao (Bruckner and Bruckner 2003). In southeast Florida, dredge and fill projects can bury nearshore hard-bottom areas used commonly by early life stages (Lindeman and Snyder 1999).","This species can be locally abundant in parts of its range.

Harvesting of this species in Cuba is not widespread and the numbers are clustered within the mixed grunts category in Cuba (R. Claro pers. comm. 2015). This species is included among the haemulids exploited by artisanal fisheries in Bonaire, Saba, Puerto Rico, St. Lucia, Jamaica and Dominica (Hawkins and Roberts 2004).&#160;This species is highly targeted and regularly captured in multi-gear artisanal and recreational fisheries at Franceses Island, Brazil, predominantly by hook and spear (Pinheiro <em>et al</em>. 2010), and also throughout the northeastern Brazilian coast (Ferreira and Rocha pers. comm. 2011). In the Abrolhos reef system in Bahia, Brazil, this species ranked fifth in percentage of haemulids censused (Francini-Filho and Moura 2008). Large schools have been observed in Brazil’s oceanic islands, with common but low abundances observed in coastal reefs; the decline of such schools is suspected to be due to artisanal spearfishing (B.

2365291,19488,Rhincodon typus,Endangered,A2bd+4bd,2016,2016-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>), the world’s largest living fish, is a cosmopolitan tropical and warm temperate species. Genetic results indicate that two major subpopulations exist, in the Atlantic Ocean and Indo-Pacific, respectively.<br/><br/>Pronounced size- and sex-based segregation is present in most of the species’ known coastal feeding areas, with coastal sites typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. The largest known aggregation sites for Whale Sharks host hundreds or low thousands of individuals, based on counts and model estimates. Although individual sharks are highly mobile, many show a degree of site fidelity.<br/><br/>Directed fisheries and significant bycatch fisheries have targeted areas where high densities of Whale Sharks occur, leading to rapid reductions in catch per unit effort (CPUE) measures. Some bias toward juvenile Whale Shark-dominated aggregations are present in trend data; in the absence of information on other life-stages, these trends are inferred to be representative of population-level declines. While a number of commercial fisheries for the species closed during the 1990–2000s, Whale Shark products remain valuable and the species is still commonly caught in some countries. Serious injury and inferred mortality through vessel strike is a threat to several globally significant aggregations, as is bycatch in net fisheries, and the risk of ship strike. In the absence of conservation action, declines is likely to continue into the future.<br/><br/>Based on count data, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, 75% of the global Whale Shark population is inferred to occur in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. A variety of datasets present declines of 40-92%, inferring an overall decline of 63% in the Indo-Pacific over the last 75 years (three generations), resulting in a subpopulation assessment of Endangered A2bd+4bd. In the Atlantic, the overall population decline is considered to be lower at&#160;&#160;≥30%, resulting in a subpopulation assessment of&#160;Vulnerable A2b+4b. Given the bulk of the global population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, the overall global decline is inferred to be&#160;≥50%. Globally, the Whale Shark is therefore assessed as Endangered A2bd+4bd.","Whale Sharks are found in both coastal and oceanic habitats (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Oceanic sightings are strongly correlated with temperature in the Indian and Atlantic oceans (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014), with most occurring between 26.5° and 30°C in the Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012). Depth was an important predictor in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but was not significant in the Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Whale Sharks are highly mobile, with mean daily movement rates of 24–28 km based on tethered geopositioning tags (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013). Cyclical or longer-term climate shifts affect Whale Shark occurrence and abundance (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012), which needs to be considered when discussing local abundance trends.<br/><br/>Whale Sharks spend the majority of time in the epipelagic zone, but dive to at least 1,928 m in depth (Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015). The driver of these deep dives is unclear, but may be related to foraging behaviour, especially when crossing oceanic waters with comparatively low surface productivity (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010, Brunnschweiler and Sims 2011, Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015) and/or assist with energy conservation when moving between prey zones (Gleiss <em>et al</em>. 2011) or navigating (Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015). Initial results from fatty acid dietary studies suggest that meso- and bathypelagic prey may be an important component of Whale Shark diet (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2013), and dive data from pop-up archival tags provide some evidence for mesopelagic foraging behaviour (Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Most Whale Shark sightings occur at a small number of known coastal feeding areas for the species, where the sharks aggregate on the surface to exploit seasonal productivity such as fish spawning events or zooplankton blooms (Rowat and Brooks 2012). A degree of inter-annual site fidelity has been documented in many locations (Cagua <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Sexual- and size-based segregation is typical in these locations, with a bias towards juvenile males from 4–8 m length (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). This pronounced segregation indicates that ontogenetic and sex-specific habitat or dietary shifts are present in the species. In the Gulf of California, juvenile sharks, comprising 60% males, were found in shallower waters exploiting abundant prey. Larger sharks, composed of 84% females, occurred in oceanic waters where they fed on diffuse patches of euphasiids (Ketchum <em>et al</em>. 2012). An initial stable isotope study of Indian Whale Sharks showed a positive relationship between size and δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N, suggesting that larger sharks feed on prey items of a larger size and higher trophic level (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2011). Females had lower values of δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N than males (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2011) suggesting that they have a different, more pelagic diet, while individuals of &lt;4 m total length (TL) also showed a lower δ13C than larger individuals suggesting a transition from pelagic to more coastal foraging habitats.<br/><br/>The largest recorded Whale Shark, approximately 20 m TL (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997) and 42 t in mass (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2014), have been reported from Taiwan. An individual extrapolated to be 18.8 m TL was caught in India (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2011). Norman and Stevens (2007) found that 50% of males were mature, based on clasper morphology, at a visually estimated TL of 8.1 m in Western Australia, while 50% maturity was estimated to occur at 9.2 m TL using laser photogrammetry in Mozambique (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Gulf of Mexico, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. (2012) visually estimated 50% male maturity to occur at around 7 m TL. Given the genetic differentiation between the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014), this may represent a subpopulation-level difference in the size of maturation. Size at maturity in female sharks is approximately 9 m TL, based on visual (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012) and laser photogrammetric estimates (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014) from the Eastern Pacific, and a 9.6 m TL individual recorded from Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2014). All of seven stranded female specimens from 4.8 to 8.7 m TL in South Africa were immature (Beckley <em>et al</em>. 1997). The only confirmed pregnant female examined, from Taiwan, was 10.6 m TL (Joung <em>et al</em>. 1996).<br/><br/>Whale Shark reproductive ecology is poorly known. Pregnant female sharks are seasonally found in the Eastern Pacific, particularly off Darwin Island in the Galapagos Archipelago (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014) and the Gulf of California (Eckert and Stewart 2001, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012), but rarely sighted outside this region. An exception is St Helena Island in the mid-Atlantic, where pregnant female sharks are routinely observed on a seasonal basis (A. Dove, pers. comm). The single pregnant female that has been physically examined, from Taiwan, had 304 pups in various stages of development, the largest litter size reported from any shark species (Joung <em>et al</em>. 1996, Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2010). This discovery established that Whale Sharks are aplacental viviparous. Paternity analysis on a subset of the offspring established that a single male might have sired the entire litter, suggesting that the species has the capacity to store sperm (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2010). The largest size class of embryos, 58–64 cm TL, appeared close to fully developed (Joung <em>et al</em>. 1996). The smallest free-swimming neonate found in the wild, from the Philippines, was 46 cm TL (Aca and Schmidt 2011). Size at birth is therefore presumed to be around this range (Aca and Schmidt 2011). Reproductive periodicity is unknown: resightings rarely occur in the areas where pregnant sharks are observed (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted).<br/><br/>Age and growth data on Whale Shark are sparse. Stranded sharks in South Africa (Wintner 2000) and fishery catches in Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2014), respectively, have been assessed. Both studies were limited by small sample sizes of predominantly juvenile sharks. Hsu <em>et al</em>. (2014) concluded that growth band deposition is likely to be biannual and, based on this, estimated that male sharks begin maturing at ~17 years and females at 19–22 years in the Indo-Pacific. However, these estimates have some important caveats: biannual band deposition has been demonstrated in very few other shark species, and other orectolobiform species have been shown to have aperiodic band pair formation (Huveneers <em>et al</em>. 2013). Validation through wild growth studies is important to confirm these results. Initial results from laser photogrammetric studies indicate that growth increments over periods of 1–3 years are too small to be accurately measured, but the technique may have value over longer time-frames (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). Generation length is estimated as 25 years.","Major contemporary threats to Whale Sharks include fisheries catches, bycatch in nets, and vessel strikes. Other threats affect Whale Shark on local or regional scales.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>Whale Sharks are presently fished in several locations. In southern China, large-scale commercial take of Whale Sharks appears to be increasing (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although Whale Sharks are not necessarily targeted, they are routinely captured and retained when sighted (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). A small-scale opportunistic fishery for Whale Sharks is also present in Oman (D. Robinson, pers. comm).&#160; <br/><br/>Whale Sharks have previously been targeted in large-scale fisheries from India, the Philippines and Taiwan, with hundreds of sharks caught annually in each country until species-level protections were implemented (Rowat and Brooks 2012). A smaller directed fishery occurred in the Maldives until Whale Sharks were protected in 1995 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993). Broader-scale subpopulation reduction caused by these fisheries was raised as a possible driver of declining sightings in Thailand (Theberge and Dearden 2006) and Western Australia (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Occasional directed catch or bycatch of Whale Sharks has been documented from many of their range states, particularly where large-mesh gillnets are in common use (Rowat and Brooks 2012).<br/><br/>Tuna are often associated with Whale Sharks, and tuna purse-seine fisheries often use Whale Sharks as an indicator of tuna presence, even setting nets around the sharks (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Direct mortality in purse-seine fisheries appears to generally be low, recorded as 0.91% (one of 107) and 2.56% (one of 38) of sharks where fate was reported by observers in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, estimated mortality rates in the Western Central Pacific purse-seine fishery were higher: 12% for 2007–2009 and 5% in 2010. This extrapolated to a total mortality of 56 sharks in 2009 and 19 in 2010 (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013). Observer reports on release condition from this region from 2010–2014 were generally consistent, with 50–60% of encircled sharks released alive, 5–10% dying and 30–40% of status unknown (Clarke 2015). Assuming a poor outcome for the latter category, potential mortalities in 2014 range from a minimum of 11 to 42, with a higher number possible depending on longer-term survival of the sharks released alive (Clarke 2015). Available data on the number of Whale Sharks caught are likely to underestimate total catch (Clarke 2015). The longer-term survivorship of Whale Sharks released from nets has not been examined at this stage. Common release practices, such as being lifted or towed by the caudal peduncle, are likely to cause stress, injury and possibly death to the sharks.<br/><br/>Shipping lanes, where they are placed close to Whale Shark feeding areas, can create a serious risk of vessel strikes. Whale Sharks routinely feed at the surface (Motta <em>et al</em>. 2010, Gleiss <em>et al</em>. 2013), and propeller injuries are commonly recorded during monitoring programs (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2006, Speed <em>et al</em>. 2008, Fox <em>et al</em>. 2013). While mortality events are seldom reported in the contemporary scientific literature, they were often noted from slower-moving vessels in the past (Gudger 1941). It is likely that fast-moving, large ships do not register or report impacts, and as Whale Sharks will typically sink upon death, these are unlikely to be documented (Speed <em>et al</em>. 2008). Areas where Whale Sharks appear to be at particular risk include the Mesoamerican reef countries in the Western Caribbean (Graham 2007, R. de la Parra-Venegas pers. comm.) and Gulf states (D. Robinson pers. comm.), where a high frequency of serious propeller injuries are observed during monitoring.<br/>&#160;<br/>Inappropriate tourism may be an indirect threat to Whale Shark in some circumstances (for example from interference, crowding or provisioning). Marine pollution events occurring in Whale Shark hotspots, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Hoffmayer <em>et al</em>. 2005, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2012), may result in mortality or displacement from preferred habitats. These more local threats, as well as potential future concerns such as climate change impacts (Sequiera <em>et al</em>. 2014), should be closely monitored.","Based on counts, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, it is inferred that approximately 75% of the global Whale Shark population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. In the Indo-Pacific, a population reduction of 63% is inferred over the last three generations (75 years), and in the Atlantic a population reduction of more than 30% is inferred (see the discussion for each subpopulation below). Combining data from both regions, it is likely that the global Whale Shark population has declined by &gt;50% over the last 75 years.<br/><br/>Available datasets for Whale Sharks, in particular those from coastal sites, are typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. Acknowledging this, we make the assumption that trend data in the visible fraction of the population (i.e. mainly juveniles) is representative of the adult population. <br/><br/><em><strong>Global population size</strong></em><br/>Whale Sharks are individually identifiable based on their characteristic spot patterns (Taylor 1994, Arzoumanian <em>et al</em>. 2005, Marshall and Pierce 2012). A global database of Whale Shark sightings, comprising submitted photographs from both researchers and the public, is hosted online at Wildbook for Whale Sharks (<a href=""www.whaleshark.org"">www.whaleshark.org</a>) (Wild Me 2016, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). As of February 2016, there were 7,011 individual sharks on this database, identified from images submitted between 1964 and 2016. However, 70% of sexed individuals (n = 3,420) were male, with the majority of these likely to be immature based on length estimates (Norman and Stevens 2007, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012, Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). This dataset is assumed to not fully represent female, small juvenile or adult sharks (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Therefore, the total represents a minimum number of sharks alive over this period.<br/><br/>Two global-scale genetic studies on Whale Sharks have estimated genetic effective population size – the number of breeding adults – albeit based on small sample sizes of 70 (Castro <em>et al</em>. 2007) and 68 sharks (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2009), respectively. Castro <em>et al</em>. (2007) used mitochondrial DNA to estimate current genetic effective population size to be 119,000–238,000 sharks. Schmidt <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated genetic effective population size to be 103,572, with a standard error of 27,401–179,794, based on microsatellite analysis. However, lack of knowledge on species-specific mutation rates mean these estimates should not be used for management purposes (J. Schmidt pers. comm., T. Vignaud and S. Planes pers. comm).<br/><br/><em><strong>Global population structure</strong></em><br/>While global connectivity of Whale Shark subpopulations has been postulated (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013b), a large global genetic study using both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analysis has demonstrated that the Whale Shark subpopulations in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific are functionally separate (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014). Large-scale photo-identification studies in the Indian Ocean (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010) and western Atlantic (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013), along with Wildbook online database results (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), have shown limited connectivity exists between non-contiguous countries. Based on these results, here we have considered two separate subpopulations in this assessment.<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic subpopulation trend<br/></strong></em>A decline of  ≥30% in the Atlantic subpopulation is inferred over the last three generations (75 years) based on data from tuna fleet observers off a likely centre of abundance for this subpopulation. Between 1980 and 2010 there was a decline in sightings per unit effort (SPUE) off western Africa, with SPUE peaking in 1995 and declining thereafter (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, sightings decreased from about 500 during the 1990s to around 150 during the 2000s. Peak-month sightings also declined by approximately 50% over this time (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>At Gladden Spit in Belize, Whale Shark sightings declined from a mean of 4 to 6 sharks per day between 1998 and 2001 to less than 2 per day in 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), with reports from diving guides indicating that numbers have remained low until 2016 (R. Graham, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In the Azores, there was a significant increase in sightings in 2008 and afterwards compared to the decade before (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This was strongly correlated with the location of the 22°C isotherm, indicating that this increasing sighting trend is due to environmental conditions (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic subpopulation size</strong></em><br/>Regional counts of identified sharks or modelled abundance estimates are available from many of the larger known aggregation or feeding areas. Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. (2012) photo-identified 350 individual Whale Sharks from Holbox Island in Mexico between 2005 and 2008, and estimated that 521–809 sharks participate in this aggregation. Aerial surveys from this area and the adjacent Caribbean coast have counted up to 420 sharks in a single aerial survey (de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011). The largest-known aggregation as of February 2016 occurs seasonally off the Yucatan cost of Mexico, with over 1,100 identified sharks (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Satellite-tagged sharks from this aggregation have been tracked to the northern Gulf of Mexico (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013), where aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been reported (Hoffmayer <em>et al</em>. 2005), south to Belize where 106 individual sharks were identified between 1998 and 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), and off the island of Utila, Honduras, where 95 sharks were identified between 1999 and 2011 (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2013). One shark, tagged in 2007, was tracked swimming across the equator to the South Atlantic Ocean, near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013). The end point of this track was 543 km southeast from the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, where 54 Whale Shark sightings were recorded between 2000 and 2005 (Hazin <em>et al</em>. 2008). This individual was subsequently photo-identified back off the Yucatan coast in 2011 and 2012 (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Aside from St Helena Island (A. Dove, pers. comm.), there have been few photographic records from elsewhere in the Atlantic (Wild Me 2016). There were, however, 2,297 records of Whale Sharks from the logbooks of tuna purse-seine vessels between 1980 and 2010, mostly from the eastern Atlantic (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014) and particularly off the coast of Gabon (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). An additional 1,449 sightings were recorded from the Azores archipelago between 1998 and 2013 (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><em><strong>Indo-Pacific subpopulation trend</strong></em><br/>A decline of &gt;50% (likely around 63%) in the Indo-Pacific Whale Shark subpopulation is inferred&#160;over the last three generations (75 years)&#160;based on relevant indices of abundance from Mozambique, the broader Western Indian Ocean, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and the Western and Central Pacific, and actual levels of exploitation in mainland China, the Maldives, India, the Philippines and Taiwan.<br/><br/>A commercial fishery for Whale Shark existed in Taiwan until 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). Information provided by fishers operating from Hongchun harbour in southern Taiwan indicated that 50–60 sharks were caught each season in the mid-1980s, declining to less than 10 per year in each of 1994 and 1995 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). Although definitive catch trends are not available, there was a significant (58%) decrease in the estimated annual catch in 1997 of 272 sharks (Chen and Phipps 2002) to a reported catch of 113 sharks over 15 months in 2001–2002 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean total length of landed sharks was noted between 2002 and 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean size of landed sharks was also noted in southern Chinese waters, from 8.27 m prior to 2004 to 6.3 m in 2008–2011 (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Data from observers aboard the tuna purse-seine fleet in the Western and Central Pacific noted 1,073 Whale Shark sightings, with most from the Bismark and Solomon Seas (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013). The occurrence of Whale Shark in free school sets decreased by approximately 50% between 2003 (1%) and 2012 (0.5%), potentially representing a fall in abundance (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material), although a weak linear increase in occurrence probability was modelled by Sequeira <em>et al</em>. (2014) between 2000 and 2010 (Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, model performance for this latter dataset was poor (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The influence of environmental variability on sightings of Whale Shark can complicate the interpretation of trend data, particularly with the shortage of long-term datasets. A decline in Whale Shark sightings along the eastern coast of South Africa between 1993 and 1998 (Gifford 2001) was included in the proposal for listing the sharks on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES 2002). However, with the benefit of hindsight, the substantial variability in sighting data from this area over summer months (Cliff <em>et al</em>. 2007) and seasonal changes in their oceanic distribution (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012), makes it unclear whether these earlier data are indicative of a true subpopulation decline. North of this area, in the northern Mozambique Channel and broader western Indian Ocean, a slight increase in Whale Shark sightings was noted between 1991 and 2000 based on tuna purse-seine vessel data, then a decrease from 2000 to 2007 (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013a; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, 600 sightings were reported from the 1990s decreasing to ~200 across 2000–2007 (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Peak monthly sightings decreased by around 50% over the study period (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Inhambane, Mozambique, in the southern Mozambique Channel, sightings declined 79% between 2005 and 2011 (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This decreased rate of sightings has persisted to at least January 2016 (S. Pierce, unpubl. data). Sharks routinely move between South Africa and southern Mozambique (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), but there is limited or no connectivity between these and other known coastal feeding areas to the north in Djibouti, Seychelles and Tanzania (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Prior to the species being protected in the Maldives in 1995, catches of Whale Shark declined from around 30 each year from one of the significant fishing locations up until the early 1980s to a catch of 20 or less Whale Sharks from the entire archipelago by 1993 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Two hundred and fifty-three Whale Shark sightings were recorded by a local dive charter company in the Andaman Sea, Thailand, between 1991 and 2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Sightings per unit effort showed a significant decline over this period, with an overall decrease from 1.58 Whale Sharks per trip in 1992–1993 to 0.13 sharks per trip in 2000–2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A low absolute number of sightings persisted until at least the 2002–2003 season, although effort data were not recorded (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Following the conclusion of data collection for that study, shark sightings have likely increased in frequency according to reports from dive operators. However, sharks are perceived to be smaller than those sighted in the 1990s (P. Dearden, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) analysed tourism sightings at Ningaloo Reef, Australia, between 1995 and 2004, corrected for search effort and environmental fluctuation, and identified a 40% decline in sighting rate and a decline in mean shark length of 1.6 m over this time period (Table 1 in the supplementary material), although seasonal shifts in peak abundance to outside observation months may also have contributed to this observed decline (Mau and Wilson 2007, Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Analysis of individual sighting data from 1995 to 2006 identified behavioural heterogeneity in the sharks at Ningaloo, with the majority showing some site fidelity in that they were sighted in multiple seasons (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008). This (majority) subset of the study population was increasing over the course of this work (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008). Follow-up analyses on a slightly longer dataset (1995 to 2008) confirmed this result, with smaller individuals contributing in larger numbers to recruitment, thereby potentially explaining the observed decline in mean size (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009; Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, a genetic study on Ningaloo sharks indicated declining genetic diversity over five consecutive years for mtDNA (2007–2012) and two (2010–2012) for microsatellites (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Whale Sharks were fished in the Philippines prior to protection in 1998, with Whale Shark catch per unit effort (i.e., per boat) declining from 4.44 to 1.7 in Pamilacan and 10 to 3.8 in Guiwanon between two surveys conducted in 1993 and 1997 (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/><em><strong>Indo-Pacific subpopulation size<br/></strong></em>Six hundred and seventy sharks were photo-identified in southern Mozambique between 2003 and 2014 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Off Mafia Island in Tanzania, 131 sharks were photo-identified between 2006 and 2014 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Off Djibouti, 297 individuals were photo-identified between 2003 and 2010 (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2011), while 443 individuals were photo-identified off Mahe in the Seychelles between 2001 and 2009 (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2011). A subset of the Seychelles dataset, comprising records from 2004 to 2009, was modelled to produce an abundance estimate of 469 to 557 sharks from that area (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Comparisons of identities collected from the Seychelles, Djibouti, Tanzania and Mozambique, comprising a total of 1,069 individual sharks sighted up to 2009, found no matches between these countries (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Norman <em>et al</em>. (submitted) updated these figures and found three international matches (all between Mozambique and Tanzania) from 1,098 individuals. A significant aggregation of juvenile Whale Sharks also occurs in the Red Sea off the Saudi Arabian coast, with 122 individuals identified to 2013 (J. Cochran, pers. comm). Aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been noted off the Qatar coast (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013). One hundred and six sharks have been identified around South Ari Atoll in the Maldives (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2010, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2012), with a modelled abundance estimate of around 74 to 104 sharks (Davies <em>et al</em>. 2012). There were 1,184 Whale Shark sightings in the Indian Ocean recorded by tuna purse-seine vessel logbooks between 1991 and 2007, with almost all of these from the Western Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>Eighty-two sightings were recorded off Christmas Island, Australia, between 1996 and 2008 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2009). Whale shark photo-identifications range back to the early 1990s off Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006; Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2009). Three hundred and eighty-six sharks were identified here between 1995 and 2008 (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009), with over 1,000 sharks identified by 2015 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Although two satellite-tagged sharks were tracked moving from Ningaloo Reef to the vicinity of Christmas Island (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010), no exchange of photo-identified sharks has been documented to date (Wild Me 2016). One photo-identified Whale Shark was, however, recorded from both Ningaloo Reef and Borneo (B. Norman, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Whale Shark abundance at Ningaloo Reef, Australia has been modelled by two studies. Meekan <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated super-population size to be 319 to 436 sharks between 1992 and 2004. Holmberg <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated annual abundance to vary between 86 and 143 sharks in the years 2004 to 2007, when length was used as a covariate. Whale Shark abundance in this area is correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index and several other oceanographic variables, which potentially relate to the strength of ocean currents and local productivity (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Over 820 individual sharks have now been photo-identified from the Philippines (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), with large aggregations recorded from around Donsol (Quiros 2007), Oslob on Cebu Island (Araujo <em>et al</em>. 2014, Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), and Pintuyan on Southern Leyte (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Excluding the Philippines, 326 sharks have been photo-identified from Southeast Asia (here including Cambodia [3], Indonesia [64], Malaysia [32], Myanmar [4], Taiwan [7] and both coasts of Thailand [216]) and added to the global database by February 2016 (Wild Me 2016).<br/>&#160;<br/>In the Eastern Pacific, Whale Sharks are seasonally present in small numbers around Darwin and Wolf islands in the north of the Galapagos Archipelago (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. (2014) identified 82 individuals here from 2011–2013 and estimated an annual study population size of 695±166 individuals for the Galapagos Islands. Males and immature females are rarely observed at this location, so this estimate refers predominantly to large, apparently pregnant females (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014). Two hundred and fifty-one individual sharks were photo-identified in the Gulf of California, Mexico, between 2003 and 2009: 129 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, 125 from Bahía de La Paz and smaller numbers from other sites (Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012). Modelled abundance estimates from this dataset were 54 in 2008 and 94 sharks in 2009 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, and between 19 and 62 through 2005–2009 at Bahía de La Paz (Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012). Outside of these areas (Galapagos Islands and Mexico), few photo-identified sharks have been added to the global database from the Eastern Pacific (Wild Me 2016). Twenty-five whale sharks were reported from tuna purse-seine vessel observers in 2014 (Clarke 2015).",Decreasing,"The Whale Shark has a circumtropical distribution through all tropical and warm temperate seas, apart from the Mediterranean (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Their core distribution is between approximately 30°N and 35°S, with occasional seasonal penetration to the north and south (Colman 1997, Rowat and Brooks 2012, Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). The northernmost records are from 44°N in the Bay of Fundy, Canada (Turnbull and Randell 2006) and the Sea of Okhotsk off Japan (Tomita <em>et al</em>. 2014), with the southernmost from 37°S in Victoria, Australia (Wolfson 1986). Whale Shark distribution is likely to be temperature limited, as they are rarely sighted in surface temperatures of less than 21°C (Iwasaki 1970, Colman 1997, Duffy 2002, Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014, Tomita <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Areas where 500 or more individuals have been documented through either counts or model estimates include the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (Robinson <em>et al</em>. in review), Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), Darwin Island in the Galapagos (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014), Quintana Roo in Mexico (de la Parra Venegas et al. 2011, Ramírez-Macías et al. 2012), Inhambane province in Mozambique (Norman et al. submitted), the Philippines (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), and around Mahe in the Seychelles (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Evidence from fisheries catches indicates that the Gujarat coast of India (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2012), Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012) and southern China (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012) also had large numbers of Whale Sharks in the vicinity, at least prior to the initiation of targeted fisheries in those countries, with estimated catches of up to 1,000 individuals per year (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/>&#160;<br/>In the Indian Ocean, data from the tuna purse-seine fleet has identified the Mozambique Channel as having a high density of Whale Shark-associated sets (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Whale Shark sightings were correlated with effort (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Modelled habitat suitability was highest in the eastern Atlantic in the area off Gabon and surrounding countries (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014), while the Bismark and Solomon Seas have relatively frequent Whale Shark sightings within the Western and Central Pacific (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Whale Sharks are subject to large- and small-scale bycatch in fisheries, with some national and international trade in products. They are also a focal species for marine tourism industries.<br/><br/>The only known targeted fishery for Whale Sharks to have existed in the Atlantic Ocean was located in Santa Cruz, Cuba, where 8–9 sharks were caught each year until the fishery was banned in 1991 (Graham 2007). Aside from Venezuela, where Whale Sharks were occasionally harpooned by fishers (Romero <em>et al</em>. 2000), there are few other records of utilization or trade of individuals from this subpopulation.<br/><br/>Prior to 1985, there was little demand for Whale Shark meat in Taiwan, with specimens of several tonnes weight selling at between US$200–300 (Chen and Phipps 2002). No dedicated fishery was present, though Whale Sharks were caught as bycatch in set-net fisheries (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). A meat fishery developed during the 1990s, with annual catches estimated to be 272 individuals in 1996 from set-net and harpoon catches (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). Total catches were likely to be higher (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). Whale Shark became the most expensive shark meat available in Taiwan by 1997, reaching prices of US$13.93/kg (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). A small 2 t Whale Shark could fetch US$14,000, with a larger 10 t shark selling for around US$70,000 in 1997 (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). Catches declined after this peak, potentially due to local stock depletion, to 80–100 sharks through the country each year after 1997 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, the annual volume of Whale Shark meat traded more than doubled between 1998 and 2000, to 60 t in 2000 (Chen and Phipps 2002). Market surveys in 2001 indicated that catch was under-reported in official statistics, and that significant quantities of meat were likely being imported through unofficial channels (Chen and Phipps 2002). Following the introduction of specific export codes for Whale Shark meat in 2001, 2 tonnes of exports (to Spain, valued at US$1.15/kg) and no imports were recorded over the following year (Chen and Phipps 2002). A total of 693 sharks were caught in Taiwan between 2001 and 2008 (Hsu et al. 2012). Total allowable catch quotas steadily reduced through to zero sharks from 2001 to 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). A small international trade in live Whale Shark was also noted in Taiwan (Chen and Phipps 2002), and is also present in mainland China (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Prior to the protection of Whale Shark in India (2001) and the Philippines (1998), Whale Shark meat was exported from those countries to Taiwan (Chen and Phipps 2002). From 1990 to 1997, 624–627 Whale Shark were caught from four of the primary fishing sites in the Philippines (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2002). Whale Shark meat from mainland China was also thought to be illegally exported to the Taiwanese market (Chen and Phipps 2002). While Whale Shark is not presently targeted off mainland China, there is a large bycatch, estimated to be more than 1,000 individuals per annum (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Whale Shark is considered a high value catch in this fishery, so they may be actively targeted in the future (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although the species is technically protected, catches are unmonitored and enforcement is minimal (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). A reduction in the mean size of landings has been reported, from 8.27 m prior to 2004 to 5.5 m from 2004–2007 and 6.3 m from 2008–2011 (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is unclear whether this apparent decrease in mean catch length reflects a decrease in landings of large sharks.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, Whale Shark fins were regarded as low value due to poor quality and the difficulty of preparation (Chen and Phipps 2002). Demand for fins within trade was minimal, although they were sometimes sold as display or trophy fins for shark-fin soup restaurants (Chen and Phipps 2002). More recent surveys have reported that Whale Shark fins are now demanding high prices, which is likely to result in increased targeting (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Whale Shark fins are sporadically seen in Hong Kong markets (G. Curtis, pers. comm.), indicating that international trade in Whale Shark fins is still likely to be occurring. The source of these fins is unknown. A live shark was seen with a recently removed first dorsal fin in the Maldives (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2009). Whale Shark were also opportunistically finned in Indonesia in the 2000s (White and Cavanagh 2007).<br/><br/>The Whale Shark fishery in India was reviewed by Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. (2013). A traditional small-scale seasonal harpoon fishery in India took Whale Shark for their liver oil, which was used to waterproof boats. In the mid 1990s, fishery effort increased along the Gujarat coast to meet demand for oil, meat and fins from countries in Europe and Southeast Asia. From 1990 until 2001, when Whale Shark became legally protected in territorial waters, there was a targeted commercial fishery in Gujarat. Between 1889 and 1998, 1,974 sharks were recorded as landed through India. Some bycatch still occurs following the closure of this fishery, with 79 landings from 2001 to 2011 (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>A small opportunistic fishery is active in Oman (D. Robinson, pers. comm). Small-scale harpoon and entanglement fisheries for Whale Sharks have taken place in several other countries such as Iran and Pakistan (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Recent landings in these areas are unknown. Fishers in the Maldives used to take 20–30 individuals per year for their oil, but reported declining catches during the 1980s to early 1990s (Anderson and Ahmed 1993), and the fishery was banned in 1995. Occasional hunting may have continued following protection (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Tourism industries based on viewing Whale Shark have now developed in several countries or locations, including Australia, Belize, Cuba, Djibouti, Ecuador, Honduras, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mexico, Mozambique, Oman, Panama, the Philippines, St Helena, Saudi Arabia, the Seychelles, Tanzania and Thailand. These range in size between a maximum of 24 tourists at a time in Cuba (Graham 2007), to over 250 licensed tour operators off Quintana Roo in Mexico (Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Direct expenditure for Whale Shark-focused tourism at South Ari Atoll in the Maldives was estimated at US$9.4 million in 2013 (Cagua <em>et al</em>. 2014), while payments for tours alone off Quintana Roo in Mexico were estimated to be US$7 million in 2013 (R. de la Parra Venegas, pers. comm). In Western Australia, whale shark tourists spent an estimated AU$6 million in the Ningaloo region in 2006 (Catlin and Jones 2010). Tourist numbers have since doubled, from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 per year, so expenditure will also have substantially increased (B. Norman, unpubl. data). Graham (2007) projected that, globally, Whale Shark tourism was likely to be worth over US$42 million annually. Rapid increases in the numbers of tour participants in some key locations, such as in Mexico (R. de la Parra Venegas, pers. comm.), Australia (D. Robb, pers. comm.) and the Philippines (Araujo <em>et al</em>. 2014) indicate that the industry is growing fast in economic importance.",Marine,"The Whale Shark has been listed in a number of international conventions and agreements. The species is included in Annex I (Highly Migratory Species) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides a framework for the conservation and management of fisheries, and other uses of the seas. To date, no management initiatives enacted through UNCLOS have included the Whale Shark. Under the aegis of this convention, the United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks was introduced in 1995, which has potential for direct actions to be taken in relation to species such as Whale Shark, although none have yet been proposed (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Also in 1995, the FAO finalized a Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and then in 1998 the International Plan of Action for Conservation and Management of Sharks (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Davidson <em>et al</em>. (2015) noted that only 22 National Plans Of Action had been published at that time, limiting the effectiveness of this initiative.<br/><br/>The Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Bonn Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in 1999. This identifies it as a migratory species whose unfavourable conservation status would benefit from the implementation of international cooperative agreements. The CMS has provided a forum for the development of more direct conservation approaches with the adoption, in 2010, of a Memorandum of Understanding on the migratory shark species listed on this agreement, including Whale Shark. There were 40 signatories to this memorandum as of February 2016, which aims to improve scientific knowledge, ensure fisheries sustainability, protect critical habitats, movement corridors and life stages of sharks, while increasing public participation and national, regional and international cooperation towards these objectives. Whale Shark routinely move across political boundaries (summarised in Rowat and Brooks 2012), emphasising the importance of this unified approach.<br/><br/>Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 2002. This requires fishing states to demonstrate that any exports were derived from a sustainably managed population, enabling exports and imports to be monitored through a permit system. Continued presence of Whale Shark fins in Hong Kong markets, a major international transit point, despite no records in the CITES Wildlife Trade Database (http://trade.cites.org) suggests that illegal trade is occurring outside the CITES permit system. No Whale Shark fisheries have been certified as sustainable under CITES Appendix II regulations. Identifying the source of these fins, and enforcing CITES regulations, should be a key goal for managers.<br/><br/>National- or territory-level management measures for Whale Shark, via shark fishing bans or specific species protection, are in place in American Samoa, Australia, Bahamas, Belize, Cambodia, Chagos Archipelago (UK), China, Congo-Brazzaville, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, French Polynesia, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Honduras, Indonesia, India, Kuwait, Maldives, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Myanmar, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Palau, Panama, Philippines, Qatar, Reunion, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, South Africa, St Helena Island (UK), Taiwan, Thailand, Tokelau, United Arab Emirates and USA. Species-level legislative protection is an important conservation goal in countries where Whale Shark are still caught, either as a target or bycatch, including China, Mozambique, Oman, Pakistan and Tanzania.<br/><br/>While many of the larger commercial fisheries for Whale Sharks have now ceased, primarily due to rapid catch reductions, fishery and trade management is still required. The active fishery in Chinese waters is almost certainly unsustainable (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). This national fishery is likely to be the largest single direct threat to Whale Shark recovery in the Indo-Pacific. Enforcement of existing laws for Whale Shark protection, and education and awareness programmes for fishers, will be an important component of management there.<br/><br/>Key habitats for Whale Sharks, in the form of coastal feeding locations or movement corridors, are protected in Australia (Ningaloo Reef), Belize (Gladden Spit), Costa Rica (Cocos Island), Ecuador (Galapagos Islands), Mexico (Yum-Balam Biosphere Reserve), Panama (Coiba Island) and the UK (St Helena Island). Site protection is necessary in some areas where high densities of Whale Sharks are present, as anthropogenic pressures on these sites could have disproportionate impact on subpopulation declines. Important aggregation areas for Whale Sharks in Mexico (de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011), Mozambique (Haskell <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Qatar (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013) are examples. Where Whale Sharks are routinely feeding on the surface, such as off Quintana Roo in Mexico (Motta <em>et al</em>. 2010, de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011), these areas should also be managed to reduce vessel strikes in nearby shipping lanes. This could entail either seasonal ‘go-slow zones’, or moving these routes to avoid the shark aggregations. Protection of the specific biological phenomena that influence Whale Shark presence at many aggregation sites, such as fish spawning events (Heyman <em>et al</em>. 2001, de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013), would also help to safeguard these habitats.<br/><br/>Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) have banned the intentional setting of purse-seine nets around Whale Shark in the Eastern Pacific, Western Central Pacific (WCP) and Indian Oceans, though not yet in the Atlantic Ocean (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, a large proportion of entangled Whale Sharks (73% in WCP; SPC-OFP 2012) were not sighted prior to nets being deployed. Therefore, fisher education and regulation on safe release practices should be a key management goal. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and Indian Ocean Tuna Commission require that best practices for safe release of Whale Sharks be followed when they are accidentally encircled (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014), and similar guidelines were endorsed by Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission members in 2015. All RFMOs should prohibit the deliberate setting of nets around Whale Sharks, and require that Whale Sharks be safely released when they are caught accidentally (i.e., using updated recommendations following Poisson <em>et al</em>. (2014) and the summary of guidelines by Clarke 2015). Fisher education and training initiatives would be useful to facilitate implementation.<br/><br/>Whale Shark tourism is managed through legislation in Australia, Belize, Ecuador, Mexico and St Helena Island (UK). At the time of writing, whale shark tourism was not legal in Qatar, where whale shark aggregations occur in a restricted oil field (Robinson et al. 2013). Voluntary codes of conduct exist in many other tourism locations. As tourism can increase the risk of boat strikes, due to the close proximity of boats and sharks, enforcing minimum approach distances for vessels can help to reduce shark stress (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2010) and reduce the probability of boat strike. Similarly, enforcing general codes of practice for tourism industries will help to ensure their sustainability.<br/><br/>In some areas, such as China, India, Mozambique, Taiwan and Tanzania, the close proximity of whale shark feeding areas or movement corridors with net fisheries leads to regular incidental bycatch. Restrictions on mesh size, net length and fishing locations can help to avoid whale shark catch. Training in safe release, or provision of bycatch reduction technologies (deliberate weak points in nets or other ways to avoid entanglement) could help to reduce the likelihood of shark injury or mortality when interactions occur.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In the 1970's it was considered relatively common, however, its rarity has increased with time. The last record was captured from southwest Florida in 1987. Its low fecundity may cause its population to be less resilient to disturbance.

In the Clinch River, Virginia, Western Sand Darters were captured in a large riffle-run area with substrate dominated by large gravel and small and medium rubble; small patches of sand were more than 10 meters away (Jenkins and Burkhead 1994). It has been recorded as occurring in quiet margins of drainage canals and shallow backwaters, usually where there is enough current to keep the bottom largely free of silt. In the north, this species often occurs in the mouths of tributaries to large rivers, over bottoms of shifting sand (Eddy and Underhill 1974, Phillips<em> et al</em>. 1982). Habitats in the southern part of the range include more often include deep, open channels of medium to large streams, moderate-sized rivers, and sparsely vegetated ditches (Douglas 1974, Robison and Buchanan 1988, Etnier and Starnes 1993, Pflieger 1997). In the upper Tennessee River system, Western Sand Darters may move into shallow riffles to spawn (see Burkhead and Jenkins 1991). Individuals bury themselves in sandy bottoms with only the eyes and part of the head protruding.","Habitat degradation is considered to be the primary cause of decline (Douglas pers. comm.1993, Shute pers. comm.1993, Jelks <em>et al</em>. 2008). Habitat has been degraded and remains threatened by siltation (Smith 1979, Pflieger 1997), such as results from poor agricultural practices, and chemical spills, such as that which occurred in the Clinch River in 1967. Alteration of the Mississippi River for commercial navigation purposes, including multiple lock and dam structures, has eliminated habitat for this species (Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 2005). Impoundments have undoubtedly destroyed much habitat in the Tennessee River drainage (Burkhead and Jenkins 1991). Extirpations associated with impoundments in Illinois and Wisconsin were reported by Smith (1979) and Becker (1983); a Wisconsin extirpation below a dam also was associated with the use of fish toxicants during a carp control program (Becker 1983). In Tennessee, ""both the Powell and Clinch river habitats are jeopardized by coal-related pollution originating in Virginia, and local gravel-removal operations pose an additional threat to the Powell River population"" (Etnier and Starnes 1993). Stream channelization is a potential threat. Small scattered populations are highly vulnerable to local extirpation.","This species is represented by a large number of distinct, extant occurrences (subpopulations) (at least several dozen).<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but probably exceeds 10,000. This species occurs in small isolated populations and is generally uncommon; it is extremely rare in the eastern part of the range (Page and Burr 2011) but common in a few rivers in the northern and western parts of the range (Page and Burr 1991). The species appears to be more abundant in the northern part of the range than farther south (Williams 1975). It is locally common in Wisconsin (Becker 1983) but not abundant anywhere in Missouri (Pflieger 1997). Small populations are sporadically distributed in Arkansas, where the species is not commonly collected (Robison and Buchanan 1988). It is ""exceedingly rare"" in the well-collected range in Tennessee (Etnier and Starnes 1993), rare in Virginia (Jenkins and Burkhead 1994) and Illinois (Smith 1979).<br/><br/>Over the long term, this darter has declined in distribution and abundance (Kuehne and Barbour 1983; Hubbs pers. comm. 1993, Burr pers. comm. 1993), but the magnitude of the decline is uncertain. Much of the decline probably occurred decades ago. Recently the species was rated as ""vulnerable"" in the southern U.S. by Warren <em>et al</em>. (2000). In Iowa, it has been extirpated or nearly extirpated in the Cedar, Des Moines, Raccoon, and Shellrock rivers, and it persists as a widespread species only in the Mississippi River (Harlan <em>et al</em>. 1987). In Missouri, the species has progressively declined in collections from the upper Mississippi River since the early 1940s; it seems to be declining also in the lowlands of southeastern Missouri (Pflieger 1997). Trend in range extent in Arkansas is uncertain (Robison and Buchanan 1988). This species was formerly described as the most common darter in the Powell River, Tennessee, but now it is exceedingly rare in the well-collected Powell and upper Clinch rivers (Etnier and Starnes 1993); it is also rare, but apparently has been recovering, in the Clinch-Powell system in Virginia (Jenkins and Burkhead 1994). In Kentucky, the species has been found in 5 general locations, but in 3 of these the most recent records are earlier than 1984 (Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Information System, data through May 2005). A survey of the Big Black River system in Mississippi (the only known location for the species in that state), did not detect this species (Pezold <em>et al</em>. 1993).<br/><br/>Trend over the past 10 years is unknown; overall, habitat quality and population size are suspected to be declining.

At an estimated generation time of 25 years (by analogy with <em>B. affinis</em>), total population decline has exceeded 90% over the past three generations (here estimated as three times the time of maturity) as a result of exploitation of eggs and adults as well as habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation and the decline is projected to continue into the future, hence the species also qualifies for listing as CR under criteria A2acd+4cd.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<em>Batagur baska</em> is a highly aquatic turtle species, associated with estuarine river sections, with nesting taking place on large on sand banks.

Females mature at 45 cm carapace length and may reach 60 cm; males mature at around 40 cm carapace length and can reach up to 49 cm (Moll 1985). Breeding maturity may occur at an age of nine years in captivity, but requires up to 25 years in rivers with modest productivity (Moll 1980). Females only produce a single clutch per year of about 18-33 eggs (P.

The total Indian population was estimated as fewer than 40 animals, with about three nests produced per year, although there was hope that more animals and/or nesting sites might exist and be found with intensive survey efforts (Lucknow Red List Workshop participants, 2005). Participants at the 2011 Singapore Red List Workshop estimated that about 30 adult animals remained.&#160;In India, there are 8 males and 7 females; and 300 juveniles in captivity (S. Singh pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Myanmar: Historically <em>Batagur baska</em> was numerous in the Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar (Maxwell 1911), but populations had declined to a few nesting animals in the early 1980s (Moll 1985) and there are apparently no records from the wild in recent years, despite surveys. Currently, only three females remain in two pagoda ponds (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>In Austria, there are two males, three females and 15 juveniles held in an assurance colony (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Batagur baska</em>&#160;once ranged from Orissa and West Bengal in India through Bangladesh and Myanmar (lower Ayayarwady, Sittaung and Thanlwin [Salween]), and possibly as far south as the Andaman Sea side of Thailand at the Kra river.&#160;It is now limited to the Sundabans area of India and Bangladesh, with three females in two different temple ponds in Myanmar (S. Singh and P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018). Populations of river terrapins in Southeast Asia previously referred to this species are now considered a separate closely related species, the Southern River Terrapin (<em>Batagur affinis</em>).</p>","<p><em>Batagur baska</em> has been heavily exploited for its flesh and eggs, typically for local subsistence and ritualistic consumption.&#160;</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p><em>Batagur baska</em> has been included in CITES Appendix I since 1975, prohibiting all forms of international commercial trade. It is also protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (amended), which includes endangered species that may only be hunted under exceptional circumstances, under licence from both federal and provincial authorities.&#160;Myanmar formerly had laws controlling egg collection, but with near extirpation of the terrapin within the country, such laws are now antiquated (Moll 2009). Marine and freshwater turtles are included in the Myanmar Fishery Law, and Myanmar Protection of Wildlife, Wild Plants and Conservation of Natural Areas Law of 1994, however, wildlife laws in Myanmar are poorly enforced.&#160;<em>Batagur baska</em> is not listed under the Bangladesh Wildlife Preservation (Amendment) Act (BWPA) 1974.<br/><br/><em>Batagur baska</em> has been recorded from Sunderban Tiger Reserve (W Bengal) and Bhitarkanika Wild Life Sanctuary (Orissa) in India (Hanfee 1999), and is apparently now extinct at the latter site (Lucknow Red List Workshop participants 2005).<br/><br/>The species has historically received some captive management efforts in India. The Sundarbans subpopulation receives significant unofficial protection from the tiger and dense mosquito populations inhabiting the Sundarbans, but with tiger poaching at an all-time high, this effect may have disappeared.<br/><br/>Ensuring the survival of <em>Batagur baska</em> in the wild will require strict implementation of existing protective measures for the last remaining populations, vigilant protection of remaining habitat for these populations, and further coordinated population management and restoration efforts, including captive breeding and headstarting. Working with local communities to reduce and eventually eliminate egg poaching appears essential. The opportunities for a major Bangladesh-India transboundary conservation project for the Sundarbans, targeted for funding by the UNDP, warrant investigation.<br/><br/>Moll <em>et al</em>.

3149565,908,Alosa alabamae,Near Threatened,A2ac,2021,2020-04-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Alosa alabamae </em>is a coastal, schooling, and anadromous species that returns to natal rivers to spawn. Historically, this species was very widely distributed throughout the coastal waters and associated rivers of the Gulf of Mexico. However, very little is known about this species within its marine range. As this is an anadromous species, it has been heavily impacted by habitat alteration and dam placement that prohibits it from reaching natal spawning grounds throughout its range. As a direct result, its global population has undergone declines in abundance compared to historical levels. Additionally, there are estimated declines in Area of Occupancy (AOO) approaching 30% over the most recent ten years available (2001 – 2010), thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths. More recent distribution information or population abundance estimates (2011 – 2020) are not available. Based on limited reports of successful threat mitigation throughout its range, it is inferred that the rate of decline in AOO has not changed. It is therefore suspected that the declines in the global population size have tracked closely with declines in AOO and are nearing 30%. This species’ relatively short generation length coupled with relatively recent Population Viability Analyses and recent reports of attempts to increase available spawning habitat (e.g., ‘conservation locking’, fish passages, etc.) in parts of its range indicates recovery from low population levels over time in the absence of threats may be possible. However, despite local information on conservation efforts and success using these mitigative techniques in parts of its range, no current evidence is available to suggest these initiatives are taking place on a wide enough scale to cause a drastic increase in spawning habitat availability at this time, despite urgency expressed by state managers and researchers dating back to at least the late 1990s. <em>Alosa alabamae</em>&#160;nearly meets the requirements for Vulnerable under criterion A2ac; therefore, it is conservatively assessed as Near Threatened. Additional conservation actions should be taken to mitigate current spawning restrictions and provide further access to suitable spawning habitats. Further research is urgently needed regarding this species' population abundance as it may in fact, qualify for a threatened category.</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>This is an anadromous species that presumably spends much of its life schooling in coastal marine waters before migrating into natal rivers to spawn (Mickle<em> et al. </em>2015). It is known to a maximum standard length of 51 cm (Whitehead 1985).<em> </em>Little is known about its ecology when utilizing marine habitats (Mickle&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), but it is thought that it primarily feeds in coastal marine waters (Mettee and O'Neil 2003) before migrating up into rivers during spring months (February – May: Mickle <em>et al. </em>2015). Kern <em>et al. </em>(2017) reports that upstream movement in the Lower Flint River, Georgia is greatest during April – mid-May. Juveniles reside in their natal drainage&#160;during&#160;the summer and fall and migrate to the Gulf of Mexico in late fall or winter (Barkuloo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993). Overall, the spawning habitat requirements of this species varies. Researchers support that this species spawns in shoal habitat downstream of the JWLD based on observations of the species congregating over the shoals during spawning season, as well as usage by other spawning anadromous species, such as the Gulf Sturgeon, <em>Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi</em> (NOAA 2017). In northwest Florida, spawning occurs in moderate currents over coarse sand and gravel (Laurence and Yerger 1966, Mills 1972). Adults selected limerock boulder substrate and used sandy substrate in the same proportion of its availability as preferred spawning grounds in the Lower Flint River, Georgia (Kern <em>et al. </em>2017). Mettee <em>et al. </em>(1996) suspects that spawning occurs in late afternoon or at night. In Missouri, young have been captured in swift water about rock wing dikes in the Osage River and over rocky shoals with a noticeable current in the Gasconade River (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). </p><p>  </p><p>Males reach sexual maturity between 1 to 5 years of age and females at 2 to 6 years in the Choctawhatchee River, Alabama and Florida (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). Age-2 and -3 adults are the most prevalent age class of spawning adults and repeat spawning is common, but the percentage of returning spawners is highly variable among years&#160;(Laurence and Yerger 1966, Mettee and O’Neil 2003). Given that it is known to have a maximum longevity of up to 6 years and females are known to reach maturity as early as two years (Mettee and O'Neil 2003), declines in population abundance and/or distribution should therefore be estimated over a time period of 10 years (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). </p><p></p>","<p></p><p>As this is an anadromous fish that requires an extensive spawning migration from coastal marine waters into natal rivers, the decline of this species’ global population and distribution is likely to be due to the<strong> </strong>modification and impoundment of riverine systems (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2011, NOAA 2017). Locks and dams built for navigation, hydroelectric generation, and flood control have effectively blocked migration routes to many historic upstream spawning areas for&#160;this species (Robison and Buchanan 1988, Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). High-lift navigation dams on the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers have blocked spawning migrations in the Mobile basin. Furthermore, streams have been degraded by siltation and pollution, and commercial and navigational dredging of sand bars has further degraded or eliminated some spawning habitats. Suspected threats to the remaining subpopulations in Alabama include increased sedimentation, pesticide runoff from agricultural operations, prolonged drought, and possible reservoir construction for water supply on major tributaries (Mettee in Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Additionally, NOAA (2017) suggests that low population abundance also poses a moderate threat to this species. This species is suspected to have been negatively impacted by threats within its marine distribution (Gulf of Mexico), possibly from impacts stemming from the Deepwater Horizon Oil spill, given the poor physiological condition and visible wounds/lesions present on the body of captured adults during spawning runs in the years following the oil spill and anecdotal evidence of other fish species with similar lesions; however, this cause is unconfirmed and the physiological condition improved in 2014 (Sammons 2014). In the past, harvesting in the Ohio River was considered a major threat to this species; however, no commercial harvest records exist after the early 1900s (<span class=""copy"">Hildenbrand 1963), and is no longer considered a threat. More research is urgently needed to determine the current (2011 – 2020) extent of suspected decline in abundance and estimated decline in available spawning habitat from these threats.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><strong>OVERALL POPULATION INFORMATION </strong></p>  <p>Limited population information is available for this species throughout its range and the total global adult population size is unknown; however, declines at least approaching 30% are suspected. Most of the species-specific information available is from the Apalachicola River in northwest Florida (NOAA 2017). The studies conducted in the ACF (Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Flint) river system are the only abundance estimates, either historic or current, for this species in any river system (NOAA 2017). General information presented below refer to the historic or current distribution of this species in river systems and are primarily based on capture data from multi-species surveys, project monitoring, incidental catches and anecdotal information (NOAA 2017). It is also known to migrate into the marine waters along the Gulf coast; however, little is known about this species within the marine environment, despite it spending a majority of its life there (NOAA 2017).</p>  <p>Overall, this species has declined, and in some cases, has been extirpated from large portions of its historical range (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). For example, it is suspected to have severely declined or may be extirpated from Iowa, Tennessee and Louisiana (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). It has been eliminated from much of its former inland distribution, especially in the Mobile Basin and the Mississippi River Valley (M. Warren 1999 pers. comm., Boschung and Mayden 2004); subpopulations are small and are now very rare throughout the entire Mississippi River basin (Lee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1980, Robison and Buchanan 1988, Etnier and Starnes 1993, Pflieger 1997). It is considered rare or extirpated in much of its former range in Alabama (Boschung and Mayden 2004), including the upper Tombigbee, Cahaba, Coosa, and upper Alabama rivers (Mettee in Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). As of around 1990, abundance was evidently still declining in the Pearl River system of Louisiana and Mississippi (Gunning and Suttkus 1990), and Ross (2001) reported that this species may be extirpated in the Pearl River. </p>  <p>Schaffler <em>et al. </em>(2015) reports that the Apalachicola River system has the largest extant subpopulation, but remnant subpopulations do occur in the Choctawhatchee River in Florida and Alabama, and the Pascagoula River in Mississippi. NOAA (2017) indicates this species was previously distributed within roughly 21 major river systems and associated tributaries at least throughout some time in history. It is estimated that ten out of the 21 known river systems still support spawning subpopulations (&lt;50%) with suitable, accessible habitat, and include the Apalachicola drainage, parts of the Mississippi, Missouri, Meramec, White, Ouachita, Pascagoula, Escambia (and Conecuh), Choctawhatchee and Suwannee rivers (NOAA 2017). It is suspected that this species' global population abundance has greatly diminished over the past 20 – 50 years range and is likely, or potentially extirpated from much of its former inland distribution where it has not been observed in many years, including the Ohio, Arkansas, Red, Illinois and Mary rivers, as well as the upper and lower Mississippi River mainstem (NOAA 2017). It is also considered rare or is sporadically recorded in parts of its range, such as in the Mobile Bay and Mobile River basin, Lake Pantchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and the Tangipahoa, Pearl, Ochlockonee and the Econfina rivers (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p>As global population data are not available, the decline in population size was suspected based on the decline in AOO. Based on its distribution between 2001-2010, and the inference that the rate of decline has remained constant, it is suspected that the total global population size has declined by nearly 30%. Current distribution data as well as abundance data are urgently needed.</p>  <p><strong>RIVER/BASIN SPECIFIC INFORMATION:</strong></p>  <p><strong>Apalachicola River Drainage:</strong></p>  <p>Most of the information regarding this species is from the Apalachicola River in northwest Florida where the largest subpopulation remains below the Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD). The ACF River system contains the largest spawning subpopulation of this species within its range, although the subpopulation may be several orders of magnitude<strong> </strong>smaller than historical levels (Sammons 2014, Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017).</p>  <p>Previously, researchers collected 141 Alabama shad in the Apalachicola in 1966 over the course of 17 sampling days using a variety of methods (Laurence and Yerger 1966), 251 were captured in 1969–1970 (Mills 1972) and 400 were captured from 1994 to 2000 in the Choctawhatchee River (Mettee and O’Neil 2003). These relatively low catch rates suggest low abundances in previous years (Ely&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008). </p>  <p>Apalachicola&#160;Alabama Shad exhibit low genetic diversity, which may inhibit its ability to respond to unanticipated environmental and anthropogenic changes (Moyer 2012). Smith&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2011) conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) of Alabama Shad in the Apalachicola River System and predicted that the subpopulation was increasing and could reach carrying capacity in about 40 years given the conditions remain favourable (e.g., allowing passage of spawning adults through the dam). However, this subpopulation declined rapidly after 2013 from unknown causes and has remained at a low level (S. Sammons pers. comm. April 2020).</p>  <p>Despite apparent declines in global population size over time, the subpopulation of this species within the ACF River system has remained self-sustaining and therefore, a project to restore passage to upstream spawning habitats has been initiated (Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015). Cooperative studies supported by many local, academic, state, and federal partners have started tracking the movements of this species in 2005 in the Apalachicola River (USFWS 2008, Ely <em>et al. </em>2008, TNC 2010, NOAA 2017). Results of this collaborative study showed that the existing lock at JWLD could be operated to allow movement upriver and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began ‘conservation locking’ to provide this species with upstream access (NOAA 2017). Abundance of this species prior to 2005, including prior to the installation of the dam, were never estimated (Ely&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008), but these improvements in facilitating fish passage is thought to have allowed recruitment to increase in recent years (Young&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Schaffler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and are expected to be a major component of the future restoration of this species in the Apalachicola River (Kern and Sammons 2015).</p>  <p>Adult subpopulation estimates (spring), adult CPUE (spring) and juvenile CPUE (fall) are available for this species in the ACF River system between 2005 – 2016 and are based on mark-recapture methods (NOAA 2017). Adult subpopulation estimates show high variability (approximately 122,500 individuals estimated in 2012, compared to 300 and 0 individuals estimated in 2015 and 2016, respectively) during this time series but are based on whether ‘conservation locking’ took place (NOAA 2017). During periods of ‘conservation locking’ this species was successfully able to pass upstream and yield higher subpopulation estimates overall indicating better recruitment (Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017). However, in the years where ‘conservation locking’ did not take place due to lock maintenance and upgrades (2013 and 2014) and in the years directly after (2015 and 2016), adult subpopulation estimates were low (i.e., below 2,000 individuals). Spawning subpopulation size estimates were attempted in the Apalachicola River in 2014; however, too few individuals were collected to allow for a subpopulation estimate (Sammons 2014). More recently, egg collection for this species was more successful than larvae collection, but still much lower than that of the similar American Shad (<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>) and it is possible that the low efficiency resulted from low densities of adults, as few adult individuals were collected below JWLD in 2017 (Sammons 2018). </p>  <p>Spawning individuals are now able to access over 150 miles (241.4 km) of necessary historical habitat and spawning areas in the ACF River system for the first time in over 50 years now that the JWLD lock operates within their natural spawning cues (TNC 2010, NOAA 2017). ‘Conservation locking’ is thought to be making a tremendous impact on this species within the ACF River system; adults are most commonly found in the Flint River arm of Lake Seminole above the JWLD (Sammons 2013, Sammons 2014) and juveniles are likely able to move downstream to contribute to the adult stock (NOAA 2017). Despite the enhancement of spawning and recruitment of this species due to ‘conservation locking’ (Young 2010, 2011, Sammons and Young 2012, Schaffler <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017), and although the ACF River system has had the largest known subpopulation of this species for decades, the lack of ‘conservation locking’ in 2013 and 2014 due to maintenance, combined with environmental conditions (cold and flooding) and poor condition of spawning adults (unexplained visible wounds) probably produced the weakest year class since research began on this species in 2005 (Sammons 2014, NOAA 2017). </p>  <p>Temperature is one of the main cues for this species to enter the ACF River system to spawn (Kern <em>et al. </em>2017). The unusually low water temperatures in 2013 and 2014 may have hindered the usual spawning cues for this species resulting in a limited number of fish migrating upstream (Sammons 2014). High water and discharge during this time may have also hindered catch rates, but more likely spawning subpopulation size was very low (Sammons 2014).</p>  <p>Differences in the trends of the adult subpopulation of this species can be partially explained by differing sampling effort due to environmental conditions and funding levels; however, researchers suspect the spawning subpopulation in the ACF River system in 2013 – 2016 was dangerously low compared to the 2009 – 2012 spawning subpopulations (Sammons 2014, NOAA 2017). Access to the more than 150 miles of spawning habitat for this species above Lake Seminole through ‘conservation locking’ appears to be necessary to increase the current low population levels. </p>  <p>Similar to other Clupeids, this species exhibits natural variability, and given that there are no historic estimates to compare to recent populations trends, it is very difficult to interpret population trends for this species (NOAA 2017). The studies conducted in the ACF River system are the only abundance estimates for this species throughout its global range, either historical or current, for this species in any river system (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Mississippi River:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically found in several parts of the Mississippi River and its tributaries (NOAA 2017). For example, it was known as far north as Keokuk, Iowa (Coker 1930), the Ohio River at Louisville (Evermann 1902) and eastern Oklahoma (Moore 1957, Miller and Robison 2004). Despite sporadic observations of this species and reports of depletion in the basin (e.g., Lee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1980, Page and Burr 1991), several small spawning subpopulations remain (NOAA 2017). </p>  <p><strong>Upper Mississippi River Mainstem:</strong></p>  <p>The Upper Mississippi River is the portion upstream of Cairo, Illinois. This species was recorded in a 1994 annual status report as being captured in a long-term resource monitoring program (Grutreuter <em>et al. </em>1997); however, no species data (i.e., number caught, gear used, location, etc.) were reported. Currently, there are 10 locks or dams on the Upper Mississippi River that border the state of Iowa and an addition seven locks and dams south of Iowa which likely prevent this species from reaching historical spawning grounds (Steuck <em>et al. </em>2010). Iowa DNR has not collected this species in the Upper Mississippi River in more than 25 years (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011), and no recent information is available to suggest otherwise between the year 2011 and present day (2020). </p>  <p><strong>Missouri River:</strong></p>  <p>The Missouri Fish and Wildlife Information System maintained by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) states that this species spawns in the Missouri River and two of its tributaries, the Gasconade and Osage Rivers (MDC 2015). Galat (2005) reported the presence of this species in the lower Missouri River in 2005 and stated that it is rare in the Ozark Plateaus region in southern Missouri. The MDC reported this species has been captured in the Missouri River at least up until 2012 in multi-species surveys (NOAA 2017).</p>  <p><strong>Meramec River:</strong></p>  <p>Burr <em>et al. </em>(2004) and Buchannan <em>et al. </em>(2012) list the Meramec River as one of the remaining spawning rivers of this species in Missouri and is supported by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC 2015). </p>  <p><strong>Lower Mississippi Mainstem:</strong></p>  <p>The Lower Mississippi River (south of Cairo, Illinois) used to provide a means for this species to reach many of its tributaries; however, no individuals have been found in the lower portion of the waterway in recent years in annual fish surveys conducted by USGS (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011, NOAA 2017).&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Ohio River:</strong></p>  <p>This species used to be present and abundant enough to support a small commercial fishery in the Ohio River during the late 19<sup>th</sup> century; however, by 1989, this species was extirpated from this river (Pearson and Pearson 1989). It has not been collected or observed from this river or the Tennessee River since the early 1990s (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). </p>  <p><strong>Arkansas River:</strong></p>  <p>No records of this species exist from the Arkansas River since the 1890s; however, few individuals may have been captured from its tributaries in the 1950s, but this is unclear (Lindsey <em>et al. </em>1983). This species may have been extirpated from the watershed due to dams (NOAA 2017). In a two-year intensive field sampling study of this species in Arkansas rivers, special emphasis was placed on sampling in the Ouachita and Arkansas rivers in 2019; however, conditions were not suitable for safe and effective fish sampling due to excessive flooding, therefore sampling did not take place in the Arkansas River (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). In 2020, sampling was conducted in the Arkansas River below the four most downstream dams, but no individuals were collected (Eggleton pers comm. June 2020). However, sampling was delayed due to field restrictions from the COVID-19 outbreak and did not allow for sampling to take place during optimal spawning times (Eggleton pers. comm. June 2020).</p>  <p><strong>Red River:</strong></p>  <p>This species has not been collected from the Red River or its tributaries since around the 1980s (e.g., Matthews and Robison 1988, Buchannan <em>et al. </em>2003, Smith <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p><strong>Illinois and Marys Rivers:</strong></p>  <p>There are historical records of this species within the Illinois rivers (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011); however, the abundance is not known (NOAA 2017). This species appears to have been extirpated from many Illinois rivers and are considered rare in the state (NOAA 2017). Annual field studies have yielded no additional records of this species (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p><strong>White River:</strong></p>  <p>The White River (Arkansas) is a minor tributary of the Mississippi River. Three juveniles were collected from the White River in 2006, which confirms there is probably a small spawning subpopulation (Buchanan <em>et al. </em>2012). In an ongoing two-year sampling study of this species in Arkansas rivers (2019 – 2020: Eggleton <em>et al</em>. 2019), three reaches of the White River were sampled for this species in 2020 and resulted in zero collected individuals (Eggleton pers. comm. June 2020). However, sampling was delayed due to field restrictions from the COVID-19 outbreak and did not allow for sampling to take place during optimal spawning times (Eggleton pers. comm. June 2020). </p>  <p><strong>Ouachita River:</strong></p>  <p>The Ouachita River is a minor tributary of the Mississippi River and includes the Little Missouri and Saline Rivers. This species is rare in Arkansas rivers overall and only a handful of adults have ever been collected; however, most individuals (adult and juvenile) have been taken from the middle Ouachita River and its largest tributary, the Little Missouri River (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). The Ouachita and Little Missouri Rivers are thought to contain very small spawning subpopulations of this species given that a majority of the 767 individuals ever collected (since 1879) were juveniles, and may represent the limit of their inland spawning migrations (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). There have been no recent reports of this species in the Saline River (Buchanan <em>et al. </em>1999); only a single specimen was collected in 1972 (Eggleton <em>et al</em>. 2019). An ongoing, two-year sampling study (2019 – 2020) of this species in the Ouachita River basin represents one of the most intensive efforts ever made to collect this species in Arkansas, but has yielded only a single adult male specimen and zero juveniles (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although it is likely this species was present in the Ouachita basin in 2019, severe hydrological conditions (e.g., excessive flooding) during the likely spawning window limited the ability for researchers to collect data on this species (Eggleton <em>et al.</em> 2019). </p>  <p><strong>Lake Pantchartrain, Lake Maurepas, and the Tangipahoa River:</strong></p>  <p>This species is caught sporadically within Louisiana, but data are limited within its rivers (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). </p>  <p><strong>Pearl River:</strong></p>  <p>This species has been reported in low numbers from the Pearl River in multi-species studies; however, this may be due to limited sampling effort during spawning periods (NOAA 2017). Smith <em>et al. </em>(2011) reported no individuals have been captured since the 1990s and Ross (2001) reported that this species may be extirpated in the Pearl River, but museum records attained by Tulane University in 2004 suggests otherwise (FishNet2 portal accessed March 2020). </p>  <p><strong>Pascagoula River:</strong></p>  <p>This Pascagoula River system (Pascagoula, Leaf and Chickasawhay Rivers) is the only system within the state of Mississippi inhabited by this species (Mickle <em>et al. </em>2010, Mickle 2010, NOAA 2017) and has one of the remaining spawning subpopulations of this species (Mickle 2006).<strong> </strong></p>  <p><strong>Mobile Bay and the Mobile River Basin:</strong></p>  <p>This species was historically prevalent in the Mobile River basin (Evermann and Kendall 1897) and some studies suggest that subpopulations persist (e.g., Boschung and Mayden 2004, Mettee in Mirarchi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004); however, few individuals have been captured throughout the basin in recent years (NOAA 2017). For example, the most recent Mobile Basin records are limited to&#160;single adult individuals collected in the Black Warrior River in 1998 (the first record from that river in more than 100 years) and in the Alabama River in 1993 and 1995 (Mettee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1996). In an effort to establish an annual spawning run in the Alabama River, 53 individuals in 2014 and 27 individuals in 2015 were captured below the JWLD in the Apalachicola River (Kern and Sammons 2015). Collected individuals were tagged with transmitters and stocked below the Claiborne Lock and Dam in 2014 and below the Miller’s Ferry Lock and Dam in 2015 in the Alabama River (Kern and Sammons 2015).

It was known to reach freshwater rivers as far inland as Oklahoma, Iowa and West Virginia (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011). According to Mickle&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2010), the range of this species has contracted to only the Pascagoula River drainage in Mississippi; however, Young&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2012) documents the existence of a reproducing population in the Apalachicola River in Florida and Smith <em>et al. </em>(2011) reported the present distribution extends up the Mississippi River drainage into eastern Arkansas and central Missouri. </p><p>NOAA (2013, 2017) recognizes the current freshwater range of this species to include the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, Flint (ACF) River system above Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD) in Florida/Georgia/Alabama, the Pea and Choctawhatchee rivers in Alabama, the Pearl River in Louisiana/Mississippi, and the Little Missouri River in Arkansas as reported by Smith&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2011). Limited information is available about its distribution in marine waters. The depth range of this species is unknown; however, similar to other closely related species, it probably occupies depths between 0–50 metres.</p><p>    </p><p>As spawning occurs in riverine environments, its freshwater extent was used to determine the area of occupancy (AOO), calculated from a 4 km² grid, and extent of occurrence (EOO), based on a minimum convex polygon. Based on the rivers where this species was distributed in 2001 and 2010 (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011), the AOO declined by from 8,816 km² in 2001 to 6,576 km² in 2010 and the EOO declined by from 897,311 km² in 2001 and 341,562 km² in 2010. Although more recent distribution data are not available, the rate of decline in AOO was inferred to have remained constant over the last 10 years. Therefore, we extrapolated the data to the present using an exponential regression, which results in an inferred decline in AOO of 27.8%.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>Alabama Shad were harvested for food from the Ohio River in Indiana and Kentucky, several rivers in Alabama, and the Ouachita River in Arkansas in the 1800s (Mettee and O'Neil 2003). Formerly, commercial fishing in the Ohio River amounted to several thousand pounds harvested per year and was considered a major threat to this species<span class=""copy"">. Commercial landings of this species were reported at 3,165 kg in 1889 and 48 kg in 1902 (Hildenbrand 1963). It&#160;disappeared from fishery statistics in the early 1900s and commercial landings have not been reported since (Hildenbrand 1963), possibly due to the construction of high lift locks and dams that blocked upstream migrations (Mettee and O'Neil 2003).<span class=""copy""></span></p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>This species is listed on the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Species of Concern List (Smith <em>et al. </em>2011) and has been petitioned to be included as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA: NOAA 2017). Despite being listed as a Species of Concern, this status does not carry any procedural or substantive federal protections (NOAA 2017). An overall paucity of available data regarding the life history and abundance of this species has ultimately prevented it from receiving more urgent conservation efforts based on the criteria used for the ESA (Grice <em>et al. </em>2014, NOAA 2017). Regardless of the lack of federal protection, it is protected by some states where it is currently, or was previously distributed (Meadows <em>et al. </em>2008, Mickle <em>et al. </em>2015, NOAA 2017, Eggleton <em>et al. </em>2019), as many have enacted recovery and conservation plans in response to river-wide declines.</p><p>State and Federal agencies are working with conservation groups and researchers to restore passage of Alabama Shad to their historic range upstream of Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD) in the Apalachicola basin. In 2008, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began ‘conservation locking’ by operating the lock at JWLD to provide Alabama shad access to upstream habitat (NOAA 2013). Subpopulation increases have been documented upon the strategic opening of a navigation lock on the Jim Woodruff dam by maximizing attraction flow near the lock entrance and increasing the time the upper gates are open during an afternoon locking cycle to&#160;allow fish to pass to spawning grounds (Young&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Efforts to pass shad through the lock have resulted in the passage of shad through Lake Seminole and into the Chattahoochee and Flint River systems in Georgia. These efforts are expected to continue to be a major component supporting the restoration of this species in the ACF River system (Kern and Sammons 2015). </p><p>The translocation of adults and supplemental stocking of juvenile fish from the ACF river system has been attempted in the past in Georgia with some success (T. Ingram pers comm. June 2020); however, adults transported into the Alabama River showed with little success due to a low number of individuals at the JWLD lock (Kern and Sammons 2015). Approximately 10,000 fry in 2013 and 102,000 fry in 2017 were stocked in the upper Flint River above Lake Blackshear that were spawned from adults captured below the JWLD; however, stock contribution was never evaluated (T. Ingram pers comm. June 2020). In 2012, roughly 100 adults captured below the JWLD were transported into to Lake Blackshear; young of the year were captured in fall gillnetting samples, thus indicating successful spawning of stocked adults (T. Ingram pers comm. June 2020). In Alabama, adult individuals were captured below the JWLD in 2014 and 2015 and transported into the Alabama River to establish and annual spawning run; however, no Alabama shad were found to have successfully navigated upstream of either dam (Kern and Sammons 2015). If numbers of this species increase in the future at the JWLD, it is likely that this method will be attempted again in Georgia and Alabama, as it may be one of the only ways to reintroduce this species into the mobile drainage (Kern and Sammons 2015, S. Sammons pers. comm. May 2020).</p><p>In an effort to establish an annual spawning run in the Alabama River, 53 individuals in 2014 and 27 individuals in 2015 were captured below the JWLD in the Apalachicola River (Kern and Sammons 2015). Collected individuals were tagged with transmitters and stocked below the Claiborne Lock and Dam in 2014 and below the Miller’s Ferry Lock and Dam in 2015 in the Alabama River (Kern and Sammons 2015). No Alabama Shad were found to have successfully navigated upstream of either dam (Kern and Sammons 2015).</p><p>Research into effective fish passages, restoration of hydrologic regimes, migrations, feeding, bycatch, spawning, rearing, and other habitat needs should be carried out (Meadows&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). Spawning habitats require protection and/or restoration, including maintaining flow regimes that would allow for large sandbars and preserve accumulation of large woody debris along steep riverbanks and enabling effective passage for fish throughout watershed&#160;drainages (Mickle&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Buchanan<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012). The variation in year-class strength typical to this genus suggests that subpopulations of Alabama shad can recover quickly to historic levels under favorable conditions (Ely<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2008). The majority of the&#160;subpopulation in the Apalachicola River system is dependent upon access to spawning in the Flint River; therefore, priorities to maintain the connectivity of this waterway are essential (Schaffler<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2015). Additionally, efforts to provide passage at other upstream barriers should be examined for the expansion of restoration efforts of this species (Sammons 2014), similar to efforts initiated at the JWLD. </p><p>            Subpopulations could increase if favorable environmental conditions are restored throughout its current range and recovery may be high in parts of its range with unimpounded systems and where management actions have already allowed for upstream passage for spawning runs. Beyond this, there is a need for studies focused on the adult life stage in marine and estuarine environments (Sammons 2014, Mickle&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Mettee and O'Neil (2003) recommend research on its distribution, spawning season variation, population size, fecundity, diet, and movements in the Mississippi River and its major tributaries and in Gulf Coast drainages containing known subpopulations. Future studies should also focus on potential environmental and biological mechanisms that may govern spawning stock size and survival (Sammons 2014).</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,"Global, Caribbean & Gulf of Mexico"

The dramatic stock decline began in the late 19th century and continues to the present day. From the late 19th century to 1992 the population has experienced a decline of more than 80%. During the last ten to fifteen years a very large decrease in the abundance of this species has occurred. The average age of fishes is subsequently decreasing as a result of catch of adults by poachers for caviar. This has resulted in females reproducing only once in their lifetime. This species has therefore been assessed as Critically Endangered.,"Habitat: All types of benthic habitats in large rivers and lakes of the Amur River basin. <br/><br/>Biology: Semi-anadromous (anadromous fishes spend at least part of their life in salt water and return to rivers to breed). The Kaluga Sturgeon spawns in lower reaches of the Amur River in strong-current habitats in the main stream of the river on gravel or sandy-gravel bottom. Spawning peaks from the end of May to July. Adults spawn many times during their life cycle. Spawning periodicity is 4-5 years in females and 3-4 years in males. The generation length of the species is not less than 20 years (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997, Berg 1948).","The causes of the population decline are still overfishing, both legal and poaching (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007). Recently, environmental pollution in the Amur River basin threatens the habitat and reproduction of this species (Shmigirilov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Chen 2007).","Currently, complete population data based on results of direct counts and fishery statistics do not exist for this species. A decline of catches has been observed since the end of the 19th century (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007). Towards the end of the 19th century, annual catch was approximately 500 tonnes. Before 1992 the annual catch was 92 tonnes. This indicates a greater than 80% decline in catches over 90 years (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007).<br/><br/>A hatchery is located in Luchegorsk at Khabarovsk district which contains a living collection of eight species of sturgeons (including the Kaluga Sturgeon) and hybrids. In 2007, this hatchery attempted the first re-stocking of juveniles of this this species into the Amur River.",Decreasing,"The Kaluga Sturgeon inhabits the entire Amur River basin from the estuary to the river’s upper reaches. It occurs in tributaries - the Shilka, Onon, Argun, Nerch, Sungari, Nonni and Ussuri and Neijiang Rivers (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997). It rarely occurs in Lake Khanka. Young specimens also appear in the coastal waters of the Sea of Okhotsk, near the northeastern part of the Tatar Strait, and in the Sea of Japan near the islands of Hokkaido and Honshu (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997, Shmigirilov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007).

3187455,10269,Huso huso,Critically Endangered,A2bcd,2010,2009-10-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species was historically known from the Caspian, Black, Azov and Adriatic Sea basins. It has been extirpated from the Adriatic (in the early 1970s, Gessner pers. comm.) and Azov Seas due to overfishing and loss of spawning sites due to dams. As the species is very long lived, individuals can still be caught in areas where their spawning sites have been cut off. The last wild population in the Black Sea basin migrates up the Danube river. All other Black Sea stocks are almost extirpated due to overfishing and impoundment of spawning rivers. In the Caspian basin, the last wild population migrates up the River Ural. The Volga population depends on stocking as the construction of Volgograd dam led to the loss of almost all of the species spawning sites in the river. Most of the few recorded females are in their first year of maturation. Based on catch data, and number of recorded spawning individuals it is estimated that the species has seen a wild native population decline of over 90% in the past three generations (a minimum of 60 years) and overfishing for meat and caviar will soon cause global extinction of the remaining natural wild populations. In the immediate future, survival can only depend on stocking and effective fisheries management and combating illegal fishing. Range states are also encouraged to provide protection to the species spawning and feeding grounds.","At sea, this species is found in the pelagic zone, following food organisms. It migrates further upriver to spawn than any other sturgeon; however this migration has now been disrupted due to river regulation (in the Danube drainage up to Morava River). It spawns in strong-current habitats in the main course of large and deep rivers on stone or gravel bottom. <br/><br/>This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Males reproduce for the first time at 10-15 years, females at 15-18 years, with an estimated generation length of 20-25 years. This species spawns every 3-4 years in April-June. A complicated pattern of spawning migrations includes one peak in late winter and spring and one in late summer and autumn. In spring, it migrates from the sea before spawning. Individuals migrating in autumn remain in the rivers until the following spring. Spawning occurs at temperature from 6 to 14 °C in the channel and spring flooded spawning grounds at a current speed of 0.8-1.2 m / sec. Spawners the late winter/spring run dominate the spawners in the Volga River (80%), whereas the late summer/autumn&#160; run dominates in the Ural River. Yolk-sac larvae are pelagic for 7-8 days and drift with current. Juveniles migrate to sea during their first summer and remain there until maturity. <br/><br/>In the past this species was the largest fish of the Caspian Sea, reaching lengths of more than 5 m and a weight of 1,000 kg. The lifetime of such large specimens, apparently, exceeded 100 years. Currently there are individuals up to 280 cm, weighing up to 650 kg. Average length of females is 240, males is 220 cm, weight respectively is 130 and 65 kg. The maximum age of 53 years was observed in 2003. <br/>&#160;<br/>Various environmental factors influence the distribution of the species in the Caspian Sea. One factor is water temperature, as mature Beluga prefer water temperatures not exceeding 30°C. They spend the spring and summer mostly in the northern and middle parts of the Caspian Sea and then move southwards to spend the winter in the southern areas, which coincides with highest densities of food organisms. The diet includes roach <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Rutilus rutilus</span> (L.), common carp (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cyprinus carpio</span>&#160;L.), herrings (Clupeidae), kilka (Clupeonella), crayfish (Astacus), gobies (Gobiidae), pike-perch (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sander lucioperca</span> (L.)), birds, sturgeons (Acipenseridae), and even seal (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>., 1995). Mature individuals of Beluga are less sensitive to low temperature than the immature, as they feed in the northern part of the Caspian Sea under the ice. With water temperatures decreasing, Belugas reduce the range of depths at which they feed. Immature individuals in spring and autumn prefer the more desalinated sea areas. In summer the highest concentrations occur at the salinity of 3 to 7%. The largest concentrations of Beluga in the northern Caspian occur during the migration of its main prey organisms (herrings, kilka, gobies, roach, etc.).","Overfishing at sea and poaching in estuaries and rivers for meat and caviar is a major threat to the species. Overharvesting and a sharp increase in poaching has led to the largest and most mature specimens being removed from the population and reducing natural reproduction to almost zero (Krassikov and Fedin 1996). In the Ural river current fishing rates are 4 to 5 times sustainable levels (F Max) (Doukakis <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. accepted). <br/><br/>Bycatch is also a threat to the species. The species caviar is very high value (8,000 USD per kilo in 2009).<br/><br/>Impoundment of rivers has destroyed most of the species spawning grounds. The Volgograd dam, built in 1955, has decreased the area of available spawning grounds by 88-100% in the Volga river, similar areas have been reduced in the Terek and Sulak rivers from 132 ha and 202 ha, respectively. The Don river dam removed 68,000 ha of spawning ground and flow regulation in the Kuban river led to the loss of 140,000 ha (CITES 2000).<br/><br/>Due to the longevity of the species there is evidence of pesticide contamination, leading to many problems including reduced reproductive success (Gessner, J. pers comm.).<br/><br/>The Allee effect could also be a threat to the species.","Global fisheries statistics show that there has been a 93% decline in catch from 1992 (520 tonnes) to 2007 (33 tonnes) (FAO 2009).<br/><br/>The number of Beluga annually entering the Volga dropped from 26,000 (1961-65) to 2,800 (1998-2002), a decline of 89% in 33 years (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Only 2,500 migrated up Ural in 2002 (Pikitch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). <br/><br/>Currently it is thought that nearly 100% of Beluga in the Volga are hatchery reared, but there is evidence of spawning elsewhere in its distribution (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Despite intensive restocking in the Caspian Sea (91% of each generation is estimated to come from hatchery stock), the annual catch in the northern Caspian Sea has drastically fallen. Catches in the Caspian were: 1945-55 average of 1,380 tonnes; 1956-65 average of 1,283 tonnes; 1966-75 average of 1,623 tonnes; 1976-85 average of 849 tonnes; 1986-95 average of 506 tonnes; 1996-2003 (latest data) average of 60.8 tonnes (in Doukakis <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> accepted). This shows a decline of 95%. The official catch statistics support this trend, as they show that the species was abundant in 1938 and then stable to the late 1980s, with the major decline starting from 1990 to the present showing over a 90% decline in the past 60 years (see Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The agreed Beluga catch quota for all of the Caspian Sea (2007/8 - 28th session of the Commission) was 99.8 tonnes; this quota was not achieved. The proportion of Beluga (to other sturgeon species) in trawl catches of the northern Caspian Sea in all seasons of observations was at an average of 11%. Over the recent years, this percentage has decreased to 8.3%, and the catch of beluga during trawl surveys did not exceed 31 specimens per year&#160;(Khodorevskaya&#160;<em>e</em><em>t al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Spawning numbers for the Volga from 1961-65 was 26,000, whilst in 1996/1997 it was 1,800 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000), with 2,800 in 1998-2002 (Khodorevskaya <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009).<br/><br/>In the Sea of Azov, between 1979-1981 it is estimated that 551,000 individuals existed (from stocked, and dominated by sub-adult and juveniles); in 1988-1993 there were 25,000 and after 1994 they were only caught sporadically, despite banning of commercial fishing of Beluga in 1986. After 1986 the major threat was from bycatch. Since 1994, 98% of individuals recorded in the Azov Sea have been juvenile. In 2001 the first individuals were produced from captive bred individuals and released (Chebanov and Koziritskaya 2007).<br/><br/>Catches in the Danube have also declined. In the mid-Danube the annual catch was 23 tonnes (average between 1972-76) which dropped to 7.5 tonnes (average between 1985-89), a decline of 67% in around 12 years (CITES 2000). In 2002, 21.3 tonnes were caught in Romania, whilst only 8.4 tonnes were caught in 2005, showing a 60% decline in three years. The percentage of catch quota achieved in Romania was 85% in 2002, 84% in 2003, 46% in 2004, and 34% in 2005. In 2006 the catching of Beluga was banned in the Danube (Paraschiv <em>et al</em>. 2006).",Decreasing,"This species has been recorded in the basins of the Caspian, Black, Azov, and Adriatic Seas, however its current native wild distribution is restricted to the Black Sea (in the Danube only) and the Caspian Sea (in the Ural only).

The Report of the 28th Session of Caspian Bioresource Commission states that the total fingerling release of beluga in 2008 was 7.02 million from Russia, Iran and Khazakstan. <br/><br/>Some natural reproduction of the species remains in the Volga and Ural Rivers. However, at present the abundance of Beluga is extremely low. Since 2000 in Russia, it has only been caught for the purposes of reproduction (for hatcheries) and science. The protective measures at the feeding grounds are necessary to maintain the population of beluga, as well as the preservation of natural spawning and juveniles breeding at hatcheries.<br/><br/>In the Danube the release of recruitment size (over 15 cm long) from Romania into the Danube has risen from 12,500 in 2006, to 15,130 in 2007 and 20,000 in 2008 (Suciu pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Iran, in work with the World Bank, are increasing the rate of release of Beluga; in 2003, 6,000 individuals (CWT tagged and visible tagged) were released. The size of the released individuals has been increased from 3-5 g to 10-25 g to increase survival rates (Pourali <em>et al</em>. 2003). Hatchery experts (which are state owned) are given financial incentives upon the delivery of individuals ready to be released. Iran has also developed beluga farming to supply meat and caviar production to minimize the impact to the wild population (Pourkazemi pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The species is not fully protected in any range state, though fishing licences are required in most countries and Iran has banned private sturgeon fisheries. Overall however, enforcement measures seem to be lacking. In 1996, fishing in the open sea for the species was banned through an agreement between the countries bordering the Caspian Sea.

This species has undergone a major, long-term decline. Most of the decline occurred more than 10 years or three generations ago.","This species usually occurs in or near quiet permanent water of streams, marshes, ponds, lakes, and other quiet bodies of water. In summer, frogs estivate in small mammal burrows, leaf litter, or other moist sites in or near (within a few hundred feet of) riparian areas (Rathbun et al. 1993, cited by USFWS 1994; USFWS 1996). Individuals may range far from water along riparian corridors and in damp thickets and forests. Breeding occurs in permanent or seasonal water of ponds, marshes, or quiet stream pools, sometimes in lakes (Fellers, in Jones et al. 2005); eggs often are attached to emergent vegetation, float at surface (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984).","Factors contributing to the decline include wetland destruction and degradation/fragmentation, urbanization, residential development, reservoir construction, stream channelization, livestock grazing of riparian vegetation, off-road vehicle activity, drought, overharvesting, and exotic fishes (bass, mosquitofish) and possibly bullfrogs (Kiesecker and Blaustein 1998; USFWS 1994, 1996, 2000; Adams 1999, 2000; Lawler <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1999; Cook and Jennings 2001; Kiesecker, Blaustein and Miller 2001a; Cook 2002). An important threat is the loss of wetlands in the Willamette Valley (Oregon) and Puget Lowlands (Washington). Conversion of habitat to more permanent ponds is an important threat (as this allows breeding waters to be invaded by non-native predators). <br/><br/>Declines in the red-legged frog complex also have been attributed to global warming, UV-B radiation (Belden and Blaustein 2002), airborne contaminants (pesticide drift), and disease (see Davidson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2001). Davidson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>(2002) found support for the negative impact of wind-borne agrochemicals and weaker evidence for the widespread impact of habitat destruction and UV-B radiation; evidence did not support the hypothesis that declines have been caused by climate change.","Number of distinct occurrences (subpopulations) is unknown but probably is at least several dozen. According to USFWS (2000), the species occurs in about 238 streams or drainages.<br/><br/>In the mid-1990s, most of the occupied habitat was in Monterey, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Barbara counties; the species occurred in only 5 sites south of the Tehachapi Mountains (80+ historic sites) (USFWS 1996) Aggregations including more than 350 adults were known only from Pescadero Marsh Natural Preserve in coastal San Mateo County, Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, and Rancho San Carlos in Monterey County (USFWS 1996).

In 1981, the construction of the Gezhouba Dam in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River blocked the migration route of this species, preventing adult fish moving to the upper reaches of the river to spawn. Only two adult specimens (both females) have been recorded since 2002, despite recent surveys to re-discover the species. Juveniles were last recorded in the lower reaches of the river in 1995. It is expected that there are less than 50 mature individuals left in the wild and this species is assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), though more extensive surveys are needed in areas across the species range in order to confirm whether or not individuals of this species remain.","This paddlefish is considered anadromous (spends at least part of its life in the sea and migrates upriver to reproduce). This species occurs in broad surfaced main streams of large rivers, staying usually in middle and lower layers of the water column, and occasionally swims into large lakes.

Furthermore, the water vole is facing all the risks associated with geographically scattered and isolated subpopulations. It is suspected that the rate of population decline exceeds 30% over a 10-year period.","The water vole is almost always found near to water, preferring small (under 8 ha) freshwater lakes, ponds and slow-moving rivers and streams with dense riparian vegetation (Saucy 1999, Fedriani 2002). It sometimes occurs in drainage ditches and wet fields.  Abundant hydrophilic vegetation and shorelines suitable for water vole burrowing activity seem to be essential characteristics of water vole habitat.  Its diet consists mainly of aquatic plants, grasses, and herbs, although small animal prey are occasionally taken (insects, fish, tadpoles, freshwater shrimp). The burrows of the water vole typically have two entrances - one primary entrance above water level and one underwater entrance. The water vole is mainly active during the day, with two peaks in activity in late morning and early afternoon, as well some nocturnal activity.  It is active throughout the year, with no period of hibernation.<br/><br/>Reproduction occurs between March and October, with 3 to 4 litters of 2 to 8 young per litter, with the average reported as 3.5 to 6 young.  The gestation period is 3 weeks.  Sexual maturity is reached at 5 weeks old and the life span of the water vole varies from 2 to 4 years. The water vole lives in small family groups and, under optimal conditions, its density may reach 5 individuals for every 100 meters of riverbank (Saucy 1999, Palomo and Gisbert, 2002). There have never been any records of damage to human activity or agriculture by the water vole.","Since the water vole is restricted to wetland areas, it faces all the usual threats associated with this habitat.  The water vole only flourishes where the banks and vegetation have not been significantly altered by human activity. Consequently, habitat loss and degradation (as a result of drainage, dredging, canal-building, infrastructure development, intensive agriculture, and so on) are major threats. Competition with the introduced Coypu and Muskrat for food and dens is also a threat. In Spain, water vole decline is attributed primarily to anthropogenic habitat modification, but competition from the Norway Rat may be an additional factor threatening the water vole (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). Efforts to control invasive species by poisoning have resulted in accidental water vole deaths.<br/><br/>In descending order of importance, the principal threats are:<br/><ul><li>Secondary poisoning with anticoagulant rodenticides (Bromadiolone and Chlorophacinone) intended for the Norway Rat, Coypu and Muskrat, </li><li>Competition for habitat and food sources with the Muskrat and Coypu,</li><li>Predation by the American Mink, Polecat and Norway Rat, as well as domestic dogs and cats,</li><li>Trapping and shooting of ""vermin"",</li><li>Habitat modification, including draining of suitable wetlands, dredging, canal-building, disturbance by human activity and livestock, etc.,</li><li>Drastic variations in water level caused by dams or seasonal droughts,</li><li>Pollution and possibly disease and parasites.</li></ul>","The water vole is declining in most parts of its range. In France it is much less common than it was 10-15 years ago (S. Aulagnier, 2006), and in the Iberian Peninsula it is considered to be declining as a result of habitat loss and degradation (Palomo and Gisbert, 2002), although it is not currently classified as threatened in Portugal (Cabral, 2005). Several studies have shown that, in optimal habitat, water vole density can reach five individuals per 100 m of river bank, but that it is unlikely to exceed this figure (Saucy 1999, Palomo and Gisbert, 2002). Population fluctuations are not known (Saucy 1999).<br/><br/><strong>France</strong><br/>A recurring problem with accurately determining the full extent of water vole population decline is that the species has been poorly documented in the past, with older information on water vole population being anecdotal and patchy.  For example, an atlas of mammals of France (1984, Société Française de l'Etude et Protection des Mammifères - SFEPM) mentioned no threat to the water vole, and reported a nation-wide distribution of the species, with the exception of Corsica, the North, North-East and the Alps. There were no national surveys on the water vole and the vole was not even mentioned in the Action Programme for wild fauna and flora, a wide-ranging survey published in 1996 by the French Ministry for the Environment.  In contrast, over the last 10 years there has been increasing attention on the water vole, mainly owing to its apparent disappearance from many areas, a great cause for concern in a species with a normally high reproductive potential (3 to 4 litters per year, averaging 3.5 young per litter). These recent observations and studies all point to its rapid decline.<br/><br/><strong>Spain</strong><br/>The water vole has previously been little known and studied in Spain, yet it is probable that its numbers have suffered drastic declines in recent years, making it crucial to carry out further research and monitoring of the species (J. Román pers. comm., 2007).  Experts in Spain seem to agree that the water vole is facing similar threats in the Iberian Peninsula as those in France (M. Delibes pers. comm., 2007).  The water vole is not currently classified as a threatened species in any part of its range in the Iberian Peninsula, yet its subpopulations in this region exhibit a marked reduction, due to human-induced habitat degradation, destruction or modification, such as cementing over of riverbanks, canal-building, destruction of vegetation along waterways, draining of wetlands and water pollution (Álvarez, 1985; Garde, 1992).<br/><br/><strong>Portugal</strong><br/>The water vole faces a situation similar in Portugal to that confronting its subpopulations in France and Spain, though its status in this country is perhaps the least well-documented of the three.  Research conducted in several locations in Portugal where the water vole is present leads to the conclusion that it is scarce and under threat principally from habitat disturbance and predation, as well as isolation of subpopulations owing to the scattered nature of suitable habitat in Portugal.",Decreasing,"The Southwestern Water Vole, <em>Arvicola sapidus</em>, occurs only in freshwater habitats in parts of France, Spain and Portugal, where it is found from sea level to a maximum of about 2,300 m in the Pyrenees (Le Louarn and Quéré, 2003).<br/><br/>In France, the water vole remains relatively common in only three regions: Charente-Maritime, Brittany and southwest France (Pyrenees), though its distribution is still patchy in these areas.  In the French départements of Drôme, Var, Alpes-Maritimes, Hautes-Alpes, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Loire, Rhône and Ain, the water vole has become rare, with a maximum of only 10 locations per département.  In the Ain there is only one location, two in the Rhône and no more than 6 or 7 in the Hautes-Alpes.<br/><br/>In Spain, the water vole is now restricted to the northern and eastern parts of the country, and has disappeared from central Spain, where it was formerly common. <br/><br/>Locations of the water vole in Portugal are not well-documented but, as in other parts of its range, the water vole seems to be restricted to fairly isolated subpopulations in only a few parts of the country.",In some parts of its range (Spain) the water vole is considered a delicacy and is still consumed occasionally.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The water vole occurs in some protected areas within its range, although this does not particularly improve the status of this species (European Mammal Assessment Workshop 2006). As yet, the water vole receives no legal protection under EU legislation (Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005), nor under national legislation in any of the three countries where it occurs. Further research and monitoring is urgently needed to supervise the population trend, and the aquatic habitats where the water vole occurs require protection.<br/><br/>Nature et Humanisme and the SFEPM recommend the following methods for protecting the water vole (J.F. Noblet pers. comm.):<br/>-Prevention of the use of rodenticides in the habitats occupied by the water vole.<br/>Alternative methods of combating the proliferation of the Muskrat, Coypu and American Mink, by more selective means (live cage traps, etc.).<br/>-Forbidding the raising, import, transport or release of these three animals.<br/>-Legislative protection of the water vole, under Annexes I or II of the EU Habitats Directive, the Bern Convention, as well as in national legislation,Legislative protection of the water vole's habitat. <br/>-Information campaigns directed at the concerned parties (local elected officials, waterway engineers, waterway management bodies, etc.).<br/>-Regulation of management techniques of water ways and their shores, such as forbidding dredging and paving of water vole habitat and destruction of riverside vegetation.<br/>-Forbidding destructive agricultural practices and associated water pollution.<br/>-International cooperation between France, Spain and Portugal in protecting the water vole and coordinating research in cross-border areas where the water vole may occur.<br/>-An ongoing research programme, in order to thoroughly map and monitor the remnant populations and their trends and to analyse the reasons for their ongoing decline.<br/>-A captive breeding programme and eventual reintroduction of the water vole in suitable protected habitat.",Palearctic,,false,false,"Global, Europe & Mediterranean"

When ambient water temperatures drop below 20°C (68°F) in autumn and winter, manatees aggregate at natural and artificial warm-water refuges or move to southern Florida (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001, Weigle <em>et al</em>. 2001, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Most artificial refuges are created by warm-water outfalls from power plants. The largest winter aggregations (maximum count of 100 or more animals) are at refuges in central and southern Florida. The northernmost natural warm-water refuges used regularly by manatees are at Crystal River on the west coast and at Blue Spring in the St. Johns River on the east coast. Most manatees return to the same warm-water refuges each year; however, some use different refuges in different years and others use two or more refuges in the same winter (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1990, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, Deutsch 2000, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Many minor aggregation sites are used as temporary thermal refuges. Most of these refuges are deeper canals or boat basins where warmer water temperatures persist as temperatures in adjacent bays and rivers decline. Manatees using thermal refuges move to nearby grassbeds to feed (generally within 30 km), and may even return to a more distant warm season range during mild periods in mid-winter (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>As water temperatures rise manatees disperse from winter aggregation areas. While some remain near their winter refuges, most undertake extensive travels along the coast and some move far up rivers and canals. On the east coast, summer sightings drop off rapidly north of Georgia (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001) and are rare north of Cape Hatteras (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1982, Schwartz 1995); the northernmost published sighting is from Rhode Island (Reid 1996, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). On the west coast, sightings drop off sharply west of the Suwannee River in Florida (Marine Mammal Commission 1986), although a small number of manatees are seen each summer in the Wakulla River at the base of the Florida Panhandle. Rare sightings also have been made in the Dry Tortugas (Reynolds and Ferguson 1984) and the Bahamas (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001; Odell <em>et al</em>. 1978; Reid 2000, 2001). As in winter, manatees show strong site fidelity to the same summer habitats year after year (Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, Koelsch 1997, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>In recent years, the most important spring habitat along the east coast of Florida has been the northern Banana River and Indian River Lagoon and their associated waters in Brevard County; more than 300 to 500 manatees have been counted in this area shortly before dispersing in late spring (Provancha and Provancha 1988, FWC unpubl.). A comparable spring aggregation area does not appear to exist on the west coast, although Charlotte Harbor was visited in the spring by almost half of the 35 manatees radio-tagged at the Fort Myers power plant in Lee County (Lefebvre and Frohlich 1986). During summer, manatees may be commonly found almost anywhere in Florida where water depths and access channels are greater than 1 m (O’Shea 1988). Manatees can be found in very shallow water. Hartman (1979) observed manatees utilizing waters as shallow as 0.4 m with their backs out of the water. In warm seasons they usually occur alone or in pairs, although interacting groups of five to ten animals are not unusual.<br/><br/>Migration corridors and responses by individual animals have been elaborated by long-term telemetry studies (Weigle <em>et al</em>. 2001, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Scientists have demonstrated site-fidelity in manatees, but have also noted that individual animals adjust their behaviours to take advantage of protected areas or changes in availability of resources. For example, Buckingham <em>et al</em>. (1999) confirmed increased manatee use of selected sanctuary areas during times when surrounding disturbance by boats was high.<br/><br/>Shallow grass beds with ready access to deep channels are preferred feeding areas in coastal and riverine habitats. Manatees often use secluded canals, creeks, embayments, and lagoons, particularly near the mouths of coastal rivers and sloughs, for feeding, resting, cavorting, mating, and calving. In estuarine and brackish areas, natural and artificial fresh water sources are sought by manatees.  Although manatees can tolerate a wide range of salinities (Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 1998), they prefer habitats where osmotic stress is minimal or where fresh water is periodically available (O’Shea and Kochman 1990). Ortiz <em>et al</em>. (1998) report that “manatees may be susceptible to dehydration after an extended period if freshwater is not available”.<br/><br/>Manatees are herbivores that feed opportunistically on a wide variety of submerged, floating, and emergent vegetation. Because of their broad distribution and migratory patterns, Florida manatees utilize a wider diversity of food items and are possibly less specialized in their feeding strategies than manatees in tropical regions (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2000). Seagrasses appear to be a staple of the manatee diet in coastal areas (Smith 1990, Provancha and Hall 1991, Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2000). Packard (1984) noted two feeding methods in coastal seagrass beds: (1) rooting, where virtually the entire plant is consumed; and (2) grazing, where exposed grass blades are eaten without disturbing the roots or sediment. Manatees may return to specific seagrass beds to graze on new growth (Koelsch 1997, Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the upper Banana River, Provancha and Hall (1991) found spring concentrations of manatees grazing in beds dominated by manatee grass (<em>Syringodium filiforme</em>). They also reported an apparent preference for manatee grass and shoalgrass (<em>Halodule wrightii</em>) over the macroalga <em>Caulerpa</em> spp. Along the Florida-Georgia border, manatees feed in salt marshes on smooth cordgrass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>) by timing feeding periods with high tide (Baugh <em>et al</em>. 1989, Zoodsma 1991).<br/><br/>Breeding takes place when one or more males (ranging from 5 to 22) are attracted to an oestrous female to form an ephemeral mating herd (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995). Mating herds can last up to four weeks, with different males joining and leaving the herd daily (Hartman 1979, Bengtson 1981, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995). Permanent bonds between males and females do not form. During peak activity, the males in mating herds compete intensely for access to the female (Hartman 1979). Successive copulations involving different males have been reported. Some observations suggest that larger, presumably older, males dominate access to females early in the formation of mating herds and are responsible for most pregnancies (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995), but males as young as three years old are spermatogenic (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1995). Although breeding has been reported in all seasons, Hernandez <em>et al</em>. (1995) reported that histological studies of reproductive organs from carcasses of males found evidence of sperm production in 94% of adult males recovered from March through November. Only 20% of adult males recovered from December through February showed similar production.<br/><br/>Females appear to reach sexual maturity by about age five but have given birth as early as four (Marmontel 1995, Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, O’Shea and Hartley 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995), and males may reach sexual maturity at 3 to 4 years of age (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1995). Manatees may live in excess of 50 years (Marmontel 1995), and evidence for reproductive senescence is unclear (Marmontel 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995). Wild females have been documented continuing to calve into their late 30s (USGS-Sirenia, unpubl.), and a captive animal gave birth in her mid-40s (FWS, unpubl.). The length of the gestation period is uncertain but is thought to be between 11 and 14 months (Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1995). The normal litter size is one, with twins reported rarely (Marmontel 1995, Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, O’Shea and Hartley 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Calf dependency usually lasts one to two years after birth (Hartman 1979, O’Shea and Hartley 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1995). Calving intervals average about 2.5 years (when the calf survives to weaning), but they vary greatly among individuals and may be considerably longer depending on age and perhaps other factors (Marmontel 1995, Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995, Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1995, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1995). Females that abort or lose a calf due to perinatal death may become pregnant again within a few months (Odell <em>et al</em>. 1995), or even weeks (Hartman 1979).<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>The habitat and ecology of the Antillean manatee is thought to be similar to its sister subspecies. However, given that the Florida manatee inhabits the most northern extent of the species range, behaviour and life history characteristics may be dissimilar in this tropical subspecies. Antillean manatees use rivers, lakes, coastal and inland lagoons, and coastal marine environments, including seagrass, mangrove, and coral reef ecosystems. Although they are able to survive in fresh, estuarine, or marine environments for extended periods of time, several lines of evidence indicate a dependence on periodic access to fresh water for osmoregulation (Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 1998, 1999; Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2001; Reid <em>et al</em>. 2003). As herbivores, access to aquatic vegetation is necessary for survival; seagrasses (<em>Thalassia, Halodule, Halophila</em> and <em>Syringodium</em>) appear to be favored in estuarine and marine areas. Osmoregulation and thermoregulation are behaviorally controlled by movements between activity centers. Quiet protected areas are necessary for resting and for cows with young calves; connections (travel corridors) between feeding, drinking, nursery, mating, and resting areas are very important. A discussion of the environmental factors influencing seasonal movements and migratory behavior in both subspecies is provided in Deutsch <em>et al</em>. (2003).","<strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em></strong><br/>Threats to the Florida manatee encompass catastrophic natural events and anthropogenic factors that could cause declines in reproductive and survival rates or declines in the carrying capacity of the environment. Much of the following text is modified from the Biological Status Reviews for the Florida manatee (FWC 2002, Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><strong>Anthropogenic Threats</strong><br/>About half of adult mortality rangewide is attributable to human-related causes, primarily watercraft collisions (Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2002). This is significant because the manatee population growth rate is highly sensitive to changes in adult survival rate (Eberhardt and O’Shea 1995, Marmontel <em>et al</em>. 1997, Runge <em>et al</em>. 2004). The future of the Florida manatee is also jeopardized by the predicted loss and deterioration of warm-water habitat, including retirement or deregulation of aging power plants and reduction in natural spring flows.<br/><br/>Watercraft collisions:  Watercraft collisions account for approximately 25% of all manatee deaths and 35% of documented deaths of known cause, and are the single greatest cause of human-related mortality (Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995, Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995, FWC-FWRI unpubl.). In 2005, there were over one million registered vessels in Florida (FHSMV, http://casey.hsmv.state.fl.us/Intranet/dmv/TaxCollDocs/vesselstats2005.pdf), and many more out-of-state boaters visit Florida annually. The number of registered vessels in Florida has increased by an average of 2.9% per year over the past 25 years, doubling since 1980 (FWC, unpubl.). Given that about 97% of registrations are for recreational watercraft (Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995), it can be expected that there will be a continued increase in recreational vessels plying the waterways of Florida with a concomitant increase in the human population. In addition to the expected increase in boat numbers over the coming century, there are other factors that may act synergistically to increase the risk of collisions between manatees and watercraft. Modifications to the design of vessel hulls and engines are allowing boats to travel at higher speeds in shallower waters (Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995), thus threatening manatees and scarring seagrass beds. Boater compliance with existing slow speed zones is inconsistent (Gorzelany 1998, Shapiro 2001). <br/><br/>Sub-lethal effects on manatees of increased vessel traffic and a growing human population in the coastal zone are cause for concern.  Most adult manatee carcasses bear scars from previous boat strikes and the healed, skeletal fractures of some indicate that they had survived previous traumatic impacts (Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995, Lightsey <em>et al</em>. 2006). Of over 1,000 living individuals in the manatee photo-identification database (Beck and Reid 1995), 97% had scar patterns from multiple boat strikes (O’Shea <em>et al</em>. 2001). Approximately one-third of these individuals were severely mutilated, especially on the tail and the dorsum. It should be noted that the photo-identification database contains only animals with scars or other identifiable features. Non-lethal injuries may reduce the breeding success of wounded females and may permanently remove some animals from the breeding population (O’Shea 1995, Reynolds 1999). Vessel traffic and recreational activities that disturb manatees may cause them to leave preferred habitats and may alter biologically important behaviours such as feeding, suckling, or resting (O’Shea 1995, Wright <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Loss of Warm-water Habitat:  Expected changes in the network of warm-water refuges over the next several decades present the most serious long-term threat to manatees in Florida, as noted in the federal Recovery Plan: “one of the greatest threats to the continued existence of the Florida manatee is the stability and longevity of warm-water refuges” (USFWS 2001, p. 28). Ultimately, the discharges from power plants provide unreliable warm-water habitat when viewed over the long term (i.e., next 20 to 100 years) because the once-through cooling technology that creates the large thermal plumes is being replaced by more efficient and alternative cooling technologies (Laist and Reynolds 2005a). Short-term threats to the network of warm-water sites also loom on the immediate horizon.  Some aging power plants may be shut down and potential deregulation of the electric utility industry may eliminate or reduce the reliability of warm-water effluents that large numbers of manatees depend on to survive winter cold periods (Rose 1997, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2000). Temporary disruptions in heated effluents during winter have caused changes in local manatee distribution (Packard <em>et al</em>. 1989) and have been implicated in elevated numbers of deaths from cold stress (Campbell and Irvine 1981, Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995). The complete elimination of a secondary warm-water refuge in northeastern Florida through diffusion of the heated effluent resulted in a shift in manatee distribution within the area and in substantial mortality of manatees that remained in the region (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2000, Laist and Reynolds 2005a). Loss of certain key warm-water sites could result in catastrophic mortality and would likely reduce the environmental carrying capacity for manatees in Florida. <br/><br/>The long-term reliability of artesian springs that provide natural warm-water refuges for manatees is also in doubt because human demand for ground water and loss of recharge areas through development will likely result in diminished spring flows (Reynolds 2000, Laist and Reynolds 2005a). According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2001), Florida’s human population increased by about 23% to 16 million between 1990 and 2000, and projections suggest that the number of people living in Florida will increase by another 10 million people by 2025. In order to meet the increased demand for water that a growth in human population will entail, it is likely that spring flows and water quality will decline, further reducing natural warm-water habitat for manatees. This natural habitat will become even more important in the future as existing industrial sites disappear.<br/><br/>Other Direct Threats to Manatees from Human Activities: Other threats from human activities include entanglement (in fishing gear or debris), entrapment in water-control structures and pipes, exposure to contaminants, incidental ingestion of debris, and crushing (in flood-control structures, in canal locks, or between large ships and docks) (Beck and Barros 1991, Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 1995). Indirect effects from increased vessel traffic include increased water turbidity from wake action and scarring of seagrass beds by propellers (Sargent <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/><br/>Indirect Threats to Manatees from Human Activities: There is no commercial or subsistence utilization in the USA. However, manatees have become the centre of a large ecotourism industry at certain winter aggregation sites, such as Crystal River. Tens of thousands of people visit these areas to observe and swim with manatees. No-entry sanctuaries provide manatees with havens to avoid swimmers and boats at these sites. Manatees do, in fact, increase their use of these sanctuaries when more boats and swimmers are present (Buckingham <em>et al</em>. 1999, King and Heinen 2004). Manatees also have been found to alter their behaviour in response to the presence of human swimmers, including decreased resting and suckling and increased swimming (King and Heinen 2004).  <br/><br/>The tremendous growth in the human population in coastal Florida over the past half century has resulted in drastic losses of coastal wetland habitats. Seagrass distribution and abundance in many estuaries have declined as the result of direct human impacts (dredging and propeller scarring) and indirect effects of development (declining water quality and nutrient loading). Within Tampa Bay, for example, an estimated 80% of the seagrass present in the early 1900s was lost by 1980 (Kurz <em>et al</em>. 2000). This decline in seagrass coverage is slowly being reversed through actions to reduce nitrogen loading in the regional watershed, which have improved water clarity in much of Tampa Bay (Johansson and Greening 2000, Kurz <em>et al</em>. 2000). Non-point-source runoff is difficult to control, however, so water clarity declines in years of above-average precipitation. Reductions in optical water clarity cause declines in the health and abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (Stevenson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Indirect effects from increased vessel traffic include increased water turbidity from wake action and scarring of seagrass beds by propellers (Sargent <em>et al</em>. 1995). It will be particularly important to protect, restore, and maintain aquatic vegetation communities in the vicinity of warm-water aggregation sites. Without conservation measures to secure these winter habitats, manatees would have to travel greater distances, concentrate into smaller areas, and forage in sub-optimal environments.<br/><br/><strong>Natural Threats</strong><br/>Naturally-occurring catastrophic threats to manatees include prolonged periods of very cold temperatures, hurricanes, harmful algal blooms (i.e., “red tide”), and the potential for a disease epizootic. The threat from extended periods of cold weather relates to the availability and quality of warm-water habitat, which has already been discussed above.  <br/><br/>Hurricanes:  Hurricanes are another type of weather-related phenomenon that can potentially impact manatee populations. In the Northwest subpopulation, Langtimm and Beck (2003) found that adult survival rate was depressed in years with severe storms or hurricanes. The mechanism(s) underlying the lower survival probabilities are unknown, as there has not been a corresponding elevation in the number of reported carcasses. Such events could also result in large-scale emigration out of the affected region. In eastern Australia, for example, the simultaneous occurrence of flooding and a cyclone, combined with poor watershed management practices, resulted in the loss of 1,000 km² of seagrass beds and in the mass movement and mortality of dugongs (<em>Dugong dugong</em>; Preen and Marsh 1995). Given the notice from meteorologists that we have entered a new 25- to 50-year cycle of greater hurricane activity and intensity (Landsea <em>et al</em>. 1996), as well as possible longer-term changes associated with global climate change (McCarthy <em>et al</em>. 2001), storm activity may have a greater impact on manatee populations in the future.  <br/><br/>Red Tide: Manatees on Florida’s Gulf coast are frequently exposed to brevetoxin, a potent neurotoxin produced by the dinoflagellate <em>Karenia brevis</em> during red tide events. In 1996, 151 manatees were confirmed or suspected to have died in southwestern Florida from brevetoxicosis (Landsberg and Steidinger 1998, Bossart <em>et al</em>. 1998). This epizootic was particularly detrimental to the manatee population because more adults were killed than any other age class. Other red tide mortality events in 1982, 2002, 2003, and 2005 resulted in the confirmed red tide-related deaths of 37, 33, 86, and 68 manatees, respectively, with an additional 35 carcasses suspected to have died from red tide during those years (O’Shea <em>et al</em>. 1991; FWC unpubl.). Recent studies have determined that brevetoxin can exist outside of the algal cells (e.g., on seagrass) for extended periods of time, thus further increasing the threat to foraging manatees (Flewelling <em>et al</em>. 2005). Red tide represents a major natural source of mortality for manatees in the southwest region. There is no clear evidence that these events have been increasing in frequency along Florida’s coast, but certainly the impact on the manatee population has increased over the past two decades. The role of nutrient loading to coastal systems relative to the intensity and duration of inshore red tides is an active area of research for the FWRI harmful algal blooms group.<br/><br/>Pathogens: Manatees could potentially be exposed to pathogens. Spread of such pathogens could be particularly rapid during winter when manatees are concentrated in warm-water refuges. Large-scale mortality events caused by disease or toxins have decimated other populations of marine mammals, including seals and dolphins, removing 50% or more of the individuals in some events (Harwood and Hall 1990). Manatees have robust immune systems that have, through the present time, provided disease resistance. Since 1997 papilloma virus has been found in captive Florida manatees and there is some evidence that it may also be present in the wild population in northwest Florida (Bossart <em>et al</em>. 2002a, Woodruff <em>et al</em>. 2005). While the consensus is that this virus probably does not present a serious threat to manatees at this time, managers are proceeding cautiously (e.g., by establishing a quarantine on exposed captives) and surveillance for papilloma lesions in wild manatees continues.<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>Major threats to survival of the Antillean manatee include habitat degradation and loss, hunting, incidental catch/accidental take, watercraft collisions, entanglement in fishing gear, pollution, natural disasters, and human disturbance. Although threats due to hunting are diminishing in some areas, all other threats are increasing in most areas. Illegal hunting for subsistence and profit was reported as a significant threat in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.  Pollution from agriculture and mining was consistently noted in reports from South American countries. Intrinsic factors that limit the population’s ability to withstand these anthropogenic impacts include low fecundity, slow growth, limited dispersal, and restricted range.<br/><br/>Of particular note were: (1) In Belize, watercraft related mortality was reported as the major threat, followed by illegal hunting and entanglement in fishing gear; and (2) In north-eastern Brazil, the stranding of live-orphaned calves was identified as the main recent threat to the species (Parente <em>et al</em>. 2004). Between 1981 and 2002, 74 stranded manatees were reported on the north-eastern coast of Brazil with 58% (n=43) being live dependent calves. This high percentage suggested that that the main threat may be human disturbance resulting in mother-calf separation. Disturbance in the area is due to shrimp farms, salt farms, a general increase in human activities in the coastal zone, and uncontrolled tourism. Additional major threats include hunting, entanglement in fishing nets, watercraft collisions, indiscriminate development of the coast, and degradation of aquatic environments.","<strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em></strong><br/>The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) recently conducted two Biological Status Reviews of the Florida manatee that involved comprehensive compilation and synthesis of population and range data, along with extensive modeling of population projections (FWC 2002, 2003; Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006). In addition, the Manatee Population Status Working Group of the Florida Manatee Recovery and Implementation Team has produced a comprehensive Biological Population Assessment (MPSWG 2005).<br/><br/>There are no statistically based estimates (with variance) of abundance for the entire Florida manatee population. The minimum documented abundance is determined from range-wide synoptic surveys which have been conducted nearly every winter since 1991. The surveys are timed to coincide with periods of extreme cold weather when manatees aggregate at a limited number of warm-water sites. The highest count obtained during these surveys was 3,300 manatees in January 2001 (Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006); this is presumed to be a minimum count, but the fraction detected is unknown. Based on the assumption of a stable age distribution, and estimating proportion mature to be 0.70 from the core biological population model, the estimated number of mature individuals in the population is 2,310. Because detection probability varies greatly with weather conditions and across sites, population experts have consistently cautioned against using these data for trend analyses.<br/><br/>Long-term studies of the Florida manatee indicate that there are four relatively distinct regional subpopulations, as recognized in the Florida Manatee Recovery Plan (USFWS 2001). Each subpopulation comprises individuals that tend to return to the same warm-water refuges each winter and have similar non-winter distribution patterns. Exchange of individuals among subpopulations is considered to be relatively limited, based on data from telemetry (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1990, Weigle <em>et al</em>. 2001, Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003) and photo-identification (Rathbun <em>et al</em>. 1990, Reid <em>et al</em>. 1991, FWC and USGS, unpubl.). The four subpopulations differ in abundance, demographic rates, habitats, and major threats. What follows is a summary of our understanding of their rates of population growth over the past decade and very brief statements on the status of each subpopulation. Minimum population sizes are provided by the high synoptic survey count of 5 to 6 January 2001 (FWC unpubl.). Population growth rates cited below were estimated by Runge and colleagues (2004) using a stage-based model that integrated mark-recapture estimates of survival and reproduction (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2004, Langtimm <em>et al</em>. 2004). The estimates of vital rates were made possible through a long-term, multi-agency effort to photographically identify individual manatees based on their distinct patterns of scars and mutilations (Beck and Reid 1995).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Atlantic Coast subpopulation extends along the entire east coast of Florida (including the Florida Keys and Florida Bay), coastal states northward along the Atlantic seaboard, and the lower St. Johns River north of Palatka. A total of 1,444 manatees were counted in the Atlantic region during the 2001 synoptic survey. Craig and Reynolds (2004) estimated that the population size of manatees using power plants on the Atlantic Coast during winter 2001 was 1,607 (95% Bayesian credible interval: 1,353 to 1,972). Over the most recent 10-year period, Runge <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated that the Atlantic subpopulation had grown at an annual rate of 1.0% per year (95% CI: -1.2 to 2.9%), but this was not statistically different from zero. The subpopulation may have increased slowly or it may have declined slightly over this time period. Craig and Reynolds (2004) used a Bayesian approach to model growth in aerial counts of manatees at several major aggregation sites along the Atlantic coast (primarily power plants). This model took into account manatee movement between surveys and variation in detection rates with ambient temperature. The trends in counts suggest the population of animals using Atlantic power plants increased at a rate of 5 to 7% per year from 1982 to 1989, leveled off (growth rate 0 to 4%yr<sup>-1</sup>) between 1990 and 1993, and has been increasing at about 4 to 6% per year since 1994. The discrepancy in growth rates of these two modeling approaches needs further investigation to provide a better understanding of population trends along the Atlantic coast.<br/> <br/><strong>Upper St. Johns River Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Upper St. Johns River subpopulation occurs in a much smaller area in the river south of Palatka. A total of 112 manatees were counted during the 2001 synoptic survey, but intensive observations that facilitate identification of nearly every individual using Blue Spring, the main overwintering site in the region, indicate that at least 141 different manatees visited the spring during that winter. A total of 190 manatees were counted at Blue Spring during a synoptic survey in 2006. The subpopulation occupying the Upper St. Johns River has shown strong growth over the past decade, increasing at an annual rate of 6.2% (95% CI: 3.7 to 8.1%) based on the stage-based model. This growth rate is supported by high survival and reproductive rates. This is the smallest of the four subpopulations, contributing less than 5% to the maximum synoptic count, but it is growing the fastest.<br/><br/><strong>Northwest Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Northwest subpopulation extends from the Pasco-Hernando County line along the central Gulf coast northward through the Florida Panhandle and including the coastal areas of adjoining states at least as far as Louisiana. A total of 377 manatees were counted in the Northwest region during the 2001 synoptic survey.  This subpopulation has grown at an annual rate of 3.7% (95% CI: 1.6 to 5.6%) over the past 10 years. This is the second smallest subpopulation, accounting for about 11% of the highest synoptic count. Its dynamics are similar to those of the USJ, with a high adult survival rate, except reproduction seems to be lower.<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Subpopulation</strong>:<br/>The Southwest subpopulation extends from the Pasco-Hernando County line (north of Tampa) southward to Whitewater Bay (part of Everglades National Park) in Monroe County. Minimum subpopulation size from the high synoptic survey count in 2001 was 1,367 individuals for the Southwest region. This subpopulation has declined at an estimated rate of -1.1% per year (95% CI: -5.4 to +2.4%) over the most recent eight-year period. The relatively wide confidence interval reflects greater uncertainty about survival and reproductive rates in this region, in part due to a shorter time series of sight-resight data. Estimates of adult survival are lower than those of all other subpopulations, probably due to the combined effects of chronic human-related (watercraft) mortality and episodic mortality events caused by red tide. It should also be noted that manatees in the Southwest subpopulation are found in a broad diversity of habitats from the more developed Tampa Bay to the more pristine reaches of Everglades National Park; demographic data are lacking for individuals in the southernmost parts of the region. Temporary emigration outside of the study areas may result in a downward bias in survival rates.<br/><br/>FWC has a wide-reaching manatee carcass salvage and necropsy programme that recovers nearly every dead manatee reported in the state of Florida. Consequently, we have a long time series of excellent data on causes of death. In all of the four subpopulations, adult mortality is mostly attributable to human-related causes, primarily watercraft collisions. However, because of the lower survival rates in the Atlantic and Southwest subpopulations, the impact of this anthropogenic mortality on population growth is much greater than in the other two regions. For the immature age class, perinatal mortality is the most common “cause” and watercraft collisions is the next highest known cause of death for all subpopulations (see Major Threats).<br/><br/>It is clear that the two smallest subpopulations have been growing over the past decade, while the two largest subpopulations have grown slightly, not at all, or may be declining. Available data suggest that the Southwest subpopulation is in decline. One way to estimate the overall growth rate for the Florida manatee is to take an average of the four subpopulation's growth rates, weighted by relative size. This yields a point estimate of 0.6% per year. Confidence intervals do not incorporate our uncertainty in the relative sizes of the subpopulations. That is, this point estimate assumes that the sighting detection rate in the synoptic survey was the same in each region in 2001, which is very unlikely, and that weights have remained constant over time. So, while the available data suggest that the point estimate of population growth for this subspecies may be close to zero or slightly positive, the associated uncertainty means that the population could be declining or increasing slightly.  <br/><br/>Population Projections:  FWC used population viability analysis models to address the three criteria that involved the probability of future population decline or extinction (FWC 2002, 2003; Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006). The models were based on vital rate estimates for each of four subpopulations and they incorporated demographic and environmental stochasticity. The models simulated scenarios based on plausible future threats to manatees and their habitat, including expected declines in carrying capacity through loss of warm-water refugia (loss of power plant discharges, declines in spring flow), potential increases in mortality (mostly due to watercraft collisions) associated with projected human population growth, and natural catastrophic mortality events (red tide, cold, disease). The outcome of the most recent PVA model was that there is a 12.1% chance of a 50% decline in the next three generations (generation time estimated between 16.8 and 22.6 years), and a 55.5% chance of a 20% reduction in the next two generations (Criterion C1) (Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006). For details, peer reviews, and a fuller discussion of these results, assumptions, limitations, and conclusions, please see the FWC’s Biological Status Reviews of the Florida manatee.<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>There are no statistically derived population estimates for <em>T. m. manatus</em> within its range, which historically covers 41 countries in the Wider Caribbean Region. Peer-reviewed publications are sparse, but there has been a significant increase in research on Antillean manatees over the past 10 years, resulting in many theses, presentations at regional meetings, local reports, and adoption of management plans. <br/><br/>We compiled data gathered through an extensive literature review and personal communication with 45 scientists representing expertise in 29 countries, but exclusive of the Florida manatee population (which was assessed independently). Antillean manatee populations occur in 20 of the 37 countries assessed, with sightings of vagrants in additional countries. However, distribution is not continuous and populations are patchy and fragmented. Using these documents, supplemented by the questionnaires completed by local experts, we derived a very rough minimum population estimate for the subspecies. Our confidence in population estimates varies dramatically from country to country, depending on the nature and extent of recent research efforts. For that reason, we used orders of magnitude in an effort to establish some baseline population estimates for each of the 20 countries where populations are most probably extant and viable. Although the quality and quantity of data vary from country to country, there is consistency regarding a continuing decline in both manatees and the quality and quantity of available habitat.  <br/><br/>Estimates by country, based on the best available data, range from less than 10 up to ~1,000 total animals, with the largest populations reported from Mexico and Belize (Table 1). No country reports an increasing country-wide population (except Bahamas with less than 10 animals). All publications and personal communications indicate country-wide populations are declining, stable, or unknown. In a few countries, localized populations may be increasing; in most countries, reports indicate a significant decline over the past 30-50 years, but this is based solely on anecdotal evidence and/or interviews with local people. <br/><br/>While the data in Table 1 suggest that approximately 2,600 individuals exist, scattered widely through the Caribbean region, optimistic ""estimates"" of the size of the manatee population (also based on interviews with experts in different countries, and not necessarily on empirical data) suggest that it may actually be in the range of 5,600 individuals. The age structure of the various manatee subpopulations of <em>T. m. manatus</em> is unknown, but the percentage of mature animals in Florida was estimated to be 70% through population modeling (Haubold <em>et al</em>. 2006) and 46% through carcass recovery (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Marmontel 1995, Marmontel <em>et al</em>. 1997). The figure based on carcasses is biased low due to the presence of a large proportion of calves in the sample. We note that hunting and other threats in the Caribbean may lead to a very different age structure for <em>T. m. manatus</em> than for <em>T. m. latirostris</em>; in fact, if hunters target large (i.e., mature) manatees, the percentage of mature individuals for <em>T. m. manatus</em> could be substantially lower than is the case for <em>T. m. latirostris</em>. Therefore, we consider that the percentage of mature individuals for the Antillean subspecies is likely to lie somewhere between 46% and 70%. <br/><br/>Based on the above information, we feel it is likely that the actual population size is intermediate between the number counted (2,600; minimum population size) and the more optimistic suggestions (5,600); an average between those two numbers would place the actual population size at approximately 4,100 manatees. Using this average value, and the two percentages given above for mature animals, the number of mature individuals would therefore lie between 1,886 and 2,870. Selecting the average value between these numbers produces an estimate of 2,378 mature individuals. While we do not place much significance in these average values, it is reasonable to conclude - based on the available evidence and taking the precautionary approach - that the overall number of mature individuals in this subspecies is likely to be less the 2,500.",Decreasing,"Florida manatees (<em>T. m. latirostris</em>) are found only in the United States, although a few vagrants have been known to reach the Bahamas. Their year-round distribution is restricted to peninsular Florida because they need warm water to survive the winter. During the non-winter months (March to November), some manatees disperse to adjoining states. Along the Atlantic coast these states include Georgia (highest manatee use outside of Florida), South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia; one satellite-tagged manatee traveled as far north as Rhode Island (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 2003), and another manatee was observed in New York (Long Island). Along the Gulf coast west of Florida, manatees are occasionally sighted in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The source (Florida or Mexico) of the Texas manatees is not always clear, but the weight of recent genetic and other evidence suggests most are from the Florida subspecies. Major freshwater bodies utilized by manatees in Florida include Lake Okeechobee, St. Johns River, Suwannee River, Caloosahatchee River, among others.<br/><br/>During the warm season (March or April through October or November, depending on latitude and year), manatees disperse throughout the coastal waters, estuaries, and major rivers of Florida and some migrate to neighboring states, particularly south-eastern Georgia. Their range constricts dramatically in the winter season (December to February) when manatees seek shelter from the cold at a limited number of warm-water sites or areas in the southern two-thirds of Florida. These sites include 10 principal power plant thermal outfalls (seven on the Atlantic coast, three on the Gulf coast) and four major artesian springs (Blue Spring, springs at the head of Crystal River, Homosassa Spring, and Warm Mineral Spring) that are frequented by a large proportion of the manatee population during winter.<br/><br/>The Antillean Manatee (<em>T. m. manatus</em>) inhabits riverine and coastal systems in the tropical and subtropical Western Atlantic Coastal Zone from the Bahamas to Brazil, including the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Although at least one individual in the Bahamas is a known migrant from Florida (Reid 2000, 2001), the Bahamas is detailed in this <em>T. m. manatus</em> assessment rather than the <em>T. m. latirostris</em> assessment. During the past decade, populations have been confirmed in the coastal waters and/or rivers of at least 19 of the 37 countries with historical records (Table 1); a population may be extant in Haiti (Ottenwalder 1995), although in very reduced numbers if at all. Rare sightings, categorized as vagrants, have been documented in five additional countries (Debrot Gore pers. comm).<br/><br/>See the Supplementary Material&#160;for Table 1: Summary of reported data by country for extant manatee populations.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong><em>Trichechus manatus latirostris</em></strong><br/>The following text was excerpted directly from the Florida Manatee Recovery Plan (USFWS 2001), with condensation and some minor revisions from the assessors. The state of Florida’s Manatee Management Plan is due to be completed by June 2007 and will provide further details of planned management and conservation actions.  <br/><br/><strong>Efforts to Reduce Watercraft-Related Injuries and Deaths</strong><br/>The largest identified cause of manatee death is collisions with watercraft. Many living manatees also bear scars or wounds from vessel strikes. Because watercraft operators cannot reliably detect and avoid hitting manatees, federal and state managers have sought to limit watercraft speed in areas where manatees are most likely to occur to afford both manatees and boaters time to avoid collisions. In 1989, the Florida Governor and Cabinet approved a series of recommendations by the former FDNR to improve protection of manatees in 13 key counties. Since then state and local governments have cooperated in the creation and implementation of county Manatee Protection Plans and county-wide manatee protection speed zone rules. Two types of manatee protection areas also have been developed by FWS: (1) manatee sanctuaries, areas in which all waterborne activities are prohibited; and (2) manatee refuges areas where certain waterborne activities are restricted or prohibited. FWS and FWC continue to evaluate needs for additional protection areas that may be necessary to achieve recovery. The goal is to consider the needs of the manatee at an ecosystem level and to establish regulations to ensure that adequate protected areas are available throughout Florida to satisfy habitat requirements of the Florida manatee population with a view toward recovery.<br/><br/>In recent years, both the FWS and FWC have been using targeted enforcement strategies in an attempt to increase boater compliance with speed zones and ultimately reduce manatee injuries and death. FWS’ strategy has been to allocate significant enforcement manpower to specific areas on designated weekends. These enforcement teams travel to various locations around the state, with particular emphasis given to those zones within counties where there is a history of high watercraft-caused manatee deaths. FWC has increased its emphasis on enforcement and compliance with manatee speed zones by adding new officers, conducting law enforcement task force initiatives, increasing overtime, and increasing the proportion of law enforcement time devoted to manatee conservation.<br/><br/>Managers, researchers, and the boating industry have investigated the use of various devices to aid in the reduction of watercraft-related manatee deaths. For example, the State of Florida funded an evaluation of propeller guards (Milligan and Tennant 1998). The state’s evaluation concluded that these devices would reduce cutting damage associated with propellers when boats were operating at low speeds. However, when boats (including boats equipped with propeller guards) operate at high speeds, guards would be of little benefit because animals would continue to be killed by blunt trauma associated with impacts from boat hulls, lower units, and other gear. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) identified additional concerns, stating that propeller guards on small recreational vessels “may create more problems than they solve” and does not support their use on recreational vessels at this time (Carmichael 2001). There are propeller guard applications, however, that appear to work for certain large, commercial vessels; for example, the use of guards on C-tractor tugs has eliminated this specific source of manatee mortality at the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in St. Marys, Georgia. To prevent injuries to manatees, propeller guards are used on some rental and sight-seeing boats at Blue Spring and Crystal River.<br/><br/>Researchers have also begun to investigate the manatees’ acoustic environment to better evaluate the animal’s response to vessel traffic. This line of research needs to be thoroughly assessed for its potential as another management tool to minimize collisions between manatees and boats. Results from Gerstein <em>et al</em>. (1999) indicate that manatees hear in the range from 500 Hz to 46 kHz and that inadequate hearing sensitivity at low frequencies may be a contributing factor to the manatees’ ability to effectively detect boat noise to avoid collisions. One technology often discussed is an acoustic deterrence device mounted on a boat.  Conceptually, this technological approach may sound like an answer to the manatee/watercraft issue. A number of problems have been defined with the use of acoustic deterrents. No alarm/warning device has yet been demonstrated to adequately protect wildlife or marine mammals. Additionally, concern has also been stated regarding the increase in background noise that these deterrents would add to an already noisy marine environment. It has not been determined what negative impacts this device would have on marine life and what effects it would have on animals that use acoustic cues for a variety of purposes. For these reasons, this technology needs to be thoroughly researched and assessed and managers need to evaluate the MMPA and ESA “take” issues related to implementing such technology.<br/><br/>Current research into the sensory capabilities of manatees is being supported at both the state and federal levels. One study assessed the effects of boat noise in a more controlled environment, by recording the physical and acoustic reaction of a manatee to a pre-determined acoustical level. This study design will allow the development of a relationship between acoustic amplitude and behavioural responses. Another study examined acoustical propagation over various types of marine topography. In cooperation with Mote Marine Laboratory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the FWC is also examining manatee behavioural response to watercraft using new technology, the DTAG, a digital acoustic tag which records acoustic attributes of the environment and detailed manatee movement simultaneously. A study to assess manatee behaviours in the presence of fishing gear and their response to novelty and the potential for reducing gear interactions also has an acoustic component. The FWC is also supporting the development and implementation of technological solutions for reducing the risks that watercraft pose to manatees. <br/><br/>Additional priority actions to better protect manatees include boater education, maintenance of signs and buoys, compliance assessment, and periodic re-evaluation of the effectiveness of the rules. Such work requires close cooperation between FWC Imperiled Species Management, FWC’s Division of Law Enforcement, county officials, the Inland Navigation Districts, FWS, USCG, and, of course, boaters.<br/><br/><strong>Efforts to Reduce Flood Gate and Navigation Lock Deaths</strong><br/>Entrapment in water-control structures and navigational locks is the second largest cause of human-related manatee deaths. In some cases, manatees appear to have been crushed in closing gates; in others, they may have been drowned after being pinned against narrow gate openings by water currents. Water-control structures implicated in manatee deaths in Dade and Broward counties are operated by the South Florida WMD. From 1976 through 2000, 166 manatees have been killed in water control structures in Dade County alone, accounting for 33% of all manatee deaths in this county. In the early 1980s, steps were taken to modify gate-opening procedures to ensure openings were wide enough to allow a manatee to pass through unharmed. Steps were also initiated to fence off openings and cavities in gate structures where manatees might become trapped. Manatee deaths subsequently declined and remained low for much of that decade. Much progress has been made toward identifying, testing, and installing manatee protection devices (e.g., pressure sensors) at water control structures. The Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) has also installed removable barriers on the upstream side of the Ortona and St. Lucie Lock spillway structures. The large difference in the upstream and downstream water levels at these structures compromises the effectiveness and use of pressure sensor devices. Locks frequented by manatees have been retrofitted with an acoustic array on the gates; this device detects the presence of a manatee during lock closing to avoid pinning or crushing. An interagency task force, established in 1991, continues to monitor, examine and make recommendations to protect manatees at water control structures and navigational locks.<br/><br/><strong>Habitat Protection</strong><br/>Intensive coastal development throughout Florida poses a long-term threat to the Florida manatee. There are three major approaches to address this problem. First, FWS, FWC, Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GDNR), and other recovery partners review and comment on applications for federal and state permits for construction projects in manatee habitat areas and to minimize their impacts. Under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, FWS annually reviews hundreds of permit applications to the ACOE for construction projects in waters and wetlands that include or are adjacent to important manatee habitat. FWC and GDNR provide similar reviews to their respective state’s environmental permitting programs.<br/><br/>A second approach is the development of county manatee protection plans. The provisions of these plans are implemented through amendments to local growth management plans under the Florida’s Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act of 1985. In addition to boat speed rules, manatee protection plans are to include boat facility siting policies and other measures to protect manatees and their habitat.<br/><br/>A third approach to habitat protection is land acquisition. Both FWS and the State of Florida have taken steps to acquire and add new areas containing important manatee habitat to federal and state protected area systems. The State of Florida has acquired important areas through several programs, most notably the Florida Forever Program. In Florida, the Governor and Cabinet have included special consideration for purchase of lands that can be of benefit to manatees and their habitat. Over $500 million has been spent to acquire 250,000 acres, whose importance included, but was by no means limited to, protection of manatee habitat. FWS has also acquired and now manages thousands of acres of land important to manatees and many other species in the NWR System. In addition to these efforts, FWS’s initiative to propose new manatee refuges and sanctuaries factors into habitat protection. Both the State of Florida and FWS are continuing cooperative efforts with a view towards establishing a network of important manatee habitats throughout Florida.<br/><br/><strong>Manatee Rescue, Rehabilitation and Release</strong><br/>Thousands of reports of distressed manatees purportedly in need of assistance have been made to the state wildlife enforcement offices and other resource protection agencies by a concerned public. While most of the manatees do not require assistance, dozens of manatees are rescued and treated each year. A network of state and local agencies and private organizations, coordinated by FWS, has been rescuing and treating these animals for well over 20 years.<br/><br/>Manatees are brought into captivity when stressed by cold weather, when struck and injured by watercraft, when injured because of entanglements in crab traps and monofilament fishing line, when orphaned, and when compromised by other natural and man-made factors. Programme veterinarians and staff have developed treatments and protocols for these animals and have been remarkably successful in their efforts to rehabilitate compromised individuals. Since 1973, over 180 manatees have been treated and returned to the wild (FWS unpubl.).<br/><br/>Media coverage of manatee rescues, treatments, and releases helps to educate millions of people about manatees, the life-threatening problems that they face, and actions that can be taken to minimize the effect of anthropogenic activities on this species. In addition, more than 18 million visitors a year see manatees at rehabilitation facilities and participate in manatee education programs sponsored by several parks. The publicity and outreach inherent in this program provide significant support to efforts to recover the manatee.<br/><br/><strong>Public Education, Awareness, and Support</strong><br/>Government agencies, industries, oceanaria and environmental groups have all contributed to manatee public awareness and education efforts that were initiated in the 1970s. These efforts have expanded in scope and increased in quantity since that time. Some key counties in Florida have also started the education component of their manatee protection plans. These public awareness and education efforts encourage informed public participation in regulatory and other management decision-making processes and provide constructive avenues for private funding of state manatee recovery programs, research, and land acquisition efforts through programmes such as the specialty automobile license tag for manatees.<br/><br/>The public has been made aware of new information on the biology and status of manatees, urgent conservation issues, and the regulations and measures required to assure their protection through the production of brochures, posters, films and videos, press releases, public service announcements and advertisements, and other media-oriented materials. Outdoor signs have been produced that provide general manatee information and highlight the problems associated with feeding manatees.<br/><br/>Manatee viewing opportunities have also been made available to the public. In addition, volunteers from several organizations annually give presentations to schools and other groups and distribute educational materials at festivals and events. Such efforts are essential for obtaining public compliance with conservation measures to protect manatees and their habitats.<br/><br/>Many public awareness materials have been developed specifically focusing on boater education. Public awareness waterway signs are produced and distributed alerting boaters to the presence of manatees. Brochures, boat decals, boater’s guides, and other materials with manatee protection tips and boating safety information have been produced and are distributed by law enforcement groups, through marinas, and boating safety classes. Educational kiosks have been designed and installed at marinas, boat ramps, and other waterfront locations. Monofilament fishing line collection sites and cleanup efforts are being established.  Several agencies and organizations provide educator’s guides, posters, and coloring and activity books to teachers in Florida and across the United States. In addition, Save The Manatee Club (SMC) and FWC Advisory Council on Environmental Education have produced a video for distribution to schools throughout Florida and the United States. SMC and FWC also provide free manatee education packets to students and staff interviews for students. Agencies and organizations help to educate law enforcement personnel about manatees and inform them about available outreach materials that can be distributed to user groups.<br/><br/><strong><em>Trichechus manatus manatus</em></strong><br/>Conservation of the Antillean manatee at the regional level has been driven by the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (Freestone 1991), resulting in the Regional Management Plan for the West Indian Manatee, <em>Trichechus manatus</em> (UNEP 1995). In all countries with extant populations there is protective legislation with some effort towards conservation through governmental agencies and/or non-governmental organizations. In a few countries efforts have increased significantly over the past decade. Conservation measures include: (1) policy-based actions such as protective legislation, management plans, recovery plans, and community management; (2) educational outreach programs and awareness activities; (3) research actions such as site specific and country-wide surveys, behavioural studies both in captivity and in situ, remote sensing projects, health assessments, and genetic studies; (4) habitat and site-based actions such as protected areas and community-based initiatives; and (5) species-based actions such as re-introductions, stranding networks, and rehabilitation programs.<br/><br/>The species is listed on CITES Appendix I.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

This is probably due to a low fertility rate. The spawns, very difficult to discover in the recesses, never appear to involve more than a few dozen eggs. Feeding on crustaceans hidden among the narrow cracks and tiny gullies of the rubble surface, this fish has a very narrow and pointed mouth that can be inserted between the anfractuosities of the rock walls. Their highest density, once adult, is found below 10 meters. Young fish though, are found in quiet covers in water about 1 m deep.","Water pollution; disturbance of habitat, landslide, and sedimentation.","Unknown, but the species is widespread but rare.",Unknown,The species is endemic to Lake Tanganyika and is widespread in the lake.,,Freshwater (=Inland waters),There is no conservation measures in place for this species.,Afrotropical,,false,false,"Global, Eastern Africa & Pan-Africa"

12692964,63572,Pterapogon kauderni,Endangered,"B2ab(ii,iii,iv,v)",2007,2007-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Banggai Cardinalfish, <em>Pterapogon kauderni</em>, is a small reef fish endemic to the Banggai Islands off Sulawesi, Indonesia. This species is distinguished by having a relatively small population size, limited distribution (EOO about 5,500 km², AOO about 34 km² and it has two distinct geographic clades and one small subpopulation introduced accidentally to Sulawesi), plasticity and ontogenetic differences in microhabitat utilization, a social system based upon group living, territorial behavior in both males and females, paired courtship and spawning that is initiated by females, low fecundity, considerable investment in energy resources for reproduction, paternal oral incubation of eggs and free-living embryos, a lack of a pelagic larval phase, limited dispersal capability and localized settlement and recruitment. <br/> <br/><strong>Decline Rates</strong> <br/>Several subpopulations affected by the aquarium fishery exhibited dramatic declines between 2001 and 2004, among them: a complete extinction of a subpopulation was documented off Limbo Island in 2004. According to a 2001 census this subpopulation was composed of about 50,000 fish (densities = 0.02 fish/m²); and a small subpopulation off Bakakan Island that harbored 6,000 fish in 2001 was reduced to 17 individuals in 2004 (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>The rate of decline for this species is difficult to calculate, since the earliest quantitative surveys (2001) were carried out several years after the harvest began within its natural geographic range. However, one subpopulation localized inside a bay in Southwest Banggai Island has been off limits to all fishing since before the beginning of the trade (the bay is privately owned by a pearl farm business). The bay has the typical habitats, microhabitats, and oceanographic characteristics in which <em>P. kauderni</em> is found throughout the Archipelago, and therefore this subpopulation may be used to estimate what the historical baseline abundance for this species could have been. The density of this subpopulation was 0.63 individuals/m²). <br/> <br/>This density is significantly higher than the mean density (0.07 individuals/m²) of the eight censuses completed in 2004 in unprotected sites [S = 0.05; highest d= 0.21 (Bokan); lowest d= 0.028 (Bangkulu)]. In addition, a census was carried out about 300 m from the protected bay and the density was 0.071 ind./m² (Lunn and Moreau 2004, Vagelli 2005).  If the 0.63 density value is considered as the historical normal density for this species within the Archipelago, then a reduction of approximately 89% took place since the start of the fishery (about 9 to 10 years before the 2004 censuses). <br/> <br/>However, at one of these sites (Masoni) the density increased from 0.03 to 0.06 individuals/m² between 2001 and 2004. This increase is thought to have occurred in response to a collecting ban that the local people imposed in early 2003. In another site (Bokan) a more significant increase was found in 2004, i.e., 0.21 individuals/m². In this case too, collection in the census site (which has an area of occupancy of only about 1 km²) was banned in 2002 by the village chief because of disputes with outside collectors (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>The size class structure of populations found during the last survey (2004) within the natural range of <em>P. kauderni</em>, agree with those reported previously, where most fish encountered were large juveniles (6 to 9 months old), whereas newly released recruits (&lt;15 mm TL) are rare (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). Thus, in 2004 of a total of 3,672 individuals censused, within the Archipelago, 1,364 (37.1%) were adults, 2,140 (58.3%) were older juveniles and 168 (4.6%) new recruits and small juveniles up to about 2 months of age (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/><strong>Assessment:</strong> <br/>The decline information is not sufficient to apply Criterion A and likewise Criteria C and D cannot be used because the population is too large. However, based on the very small area of occupancy (AOO), the severe fragmentation (see the documentation below) and the ongoing continuing decline (local extirpations and marked decrease in population size in recent years) due to exploitation for the international aquarium trade, this species is assessed as Endangered under Criterion B.","<strong>Habitat:</strong>
<br/>The Banggai Cardinalfish occurs primarily on shallow sheltered bays and harbors, mainly on silty reef flats with sandy bottoms and sea grass beds. Depth distribution is generally ranges between 0.5 and 6 m, but is most commonly found between 1.5 and 2.5 m. Some populations inhabit very clear waters in coral reef areas, while others inhabit still, murky bays, and some groups are found in sandy patches associates with anemones, and less commonly, in open habitats (low branching corals and rubble). This species inhabits a variety of shallow habitats, including coral reefs (51% of identified groups), seagrass beds (35%), and open areas of sand and rubble (14%). It is most common in calm habitats on the protected side of larger islands; isolated populations also occur in areas affected by strong surge and moderate currents Water temperatures in these habitats range from 28°C to 33°C (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005). There is an ontogenetic shift in habitat and microhabitat use between juveniles and adults that occurs within the same area and depth; all size classes, including mating pairs and brooding males, overlap in their distribution; the shift in use is not the consequence of differential feeding habitats nor intraspecific competition (Vagelli 2004a). The processes governing this ontogenetic shift are not clear. No pre-settlement factor is involved, however, because this species lacks a pelagic larval phase and embryos released by brooding males settle into parental habitat directly (Vagelli 1999, 2002, 2004a; Vagelli and Volpedo 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Juveniles associate with sea grasses, sea urchins, sea stars, sea anemones, soft corals and corals. Adults shelter between the spines of sea urchins but also among anemones, corals, stony hydrozoans, rocks and artificial structures such as jetties (Allen 2000, Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2004a). Sea anemones utilized include <em>Actinodendron</em> sp., <em>Entacmaea quadricolor</em>,  <em>Heteractis crispa</em>, <em>Macrodactyla doreensis</em>, <em>Stichodactyla haddoni</em>, and <em>S. merteensis</em>. Corals include <em>Acropora</em> sp., <em>Anacropora</em> sp., <em>Echinopora horrida</em>, <em>Goniopora</em> sp.,  <em>Heliofungia actiniformis</em>, <em>Montipora digitata</em> and <em>Seriotopora hystrix</em>. Soft corals utilized include <em>Nephthea</em> sp. and stony hydrozoans include <em>Millepora</em> sp.  Sea urchin species utilized include <em>Diadema setosum</em> and <em>Tripneustes</em> sp., while the sea star is <em>Proteaster nodosus</em>. Banggai Cardinalfishes also associate with the submerged roots of mangroves (<em>Rhizophora</em> sp.). Census work showed that 43.7% of the groups were associated with hard corals, 31.9% with urchins <em>Diadema setosum</em>, and 24.4% with anemones (Allen 2000; Vagelli and Erdmann 2002; Vagelli 2004a, 2005).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Ecology:</strong>
<br/>When sheltering in anemones and <em>Heliofungia</em> corals, <em>P. kauderni</em> often associates with various species of anemone fishes (<em>Amphiprion</em>) and anemone shrimps (<em>Periclimenes</em>), and with several species of Apogonidae (<em>Apogon, Archamia, Cheilodipterus</em> and <em>Sphaeramia</em> when living among spines of sea urchins. In seagrass beds (predominantly composed of <em>Enhalus acoroides</em>), <em>P. kauderni</em> is associated with anemones, isolated live corals, sea urchins or sea stars forming small fish assemblages, commonly with <em>Abudefduf sexfasciatus</em> and several species of <em>Pomacentrus</em>, <em>Chromis</em> and <em>Halichoeres</em>.
<br/>
<br/><strong>Diet:</strong>
<br/>As opposed to other described apogonids, <em>P. kauderni</em> has diurnal trophic habits, and its feeding activity decreases with the day and ceases around sunset time. <em>P. kauderni</em> is a carnivore-planktivore that feeds principally upon copepods, but it is also a generalist opportunistic species that feed upon a variety of taxa, principally planktonic demersal and benthic organisms. Stomach content analysis found prey representing 29 taxa with a taxonomic level of suborder or higher belonging to 6 phyla: Rhyzopoda, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Chaetognatha, and Chordata. There were no significant differences in diet composition between size classes. Quantitative analysis showed that copepods make up about 79% of <em>P. kauderni</em> diet, and that other important components are decapods and isopods. There was an important variation in diet composition among the sites. Representative food items include ascidian larvae, chaetognaths, post-settled gastropod and bivalve juveniles, polychaetes, acarids, copepods, amphipods, stomatopods, cumaceans, isopods, euphausiids, ostracods, cirriped larvae, mysids, decapod larvae, tanaidaceans, and the larvae of teleost and chironomid insects (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005).
<br/>
<br/><strong>Group Size:</strong>
<br/>Within its natural geographic range <em>P. kauderni</em> formed groups with a mean of 9.5 individuals, although the majority of them were composed of fewer individuals. Group size varied with age class, habitat and microhabitat. The mean size of the 448 censed groups (3,672 individuals) was 8.2 individuals, and the group means per site ranged from 3.9 to 19.8 individuals. Most groups (73% of all groups) were composed by few individuals (1 to 6). The largest single group found was about 500 individuals (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005). 
<br/>
<br/><strong>Breeding Biology:</strong>
<br/>Banggai Cardinalfish pairs defend territories jointly and for three likely reasons: 1) spawning site defense (viewed as unlikely because spawning sites do not seem to be limiting), 2) partner defense (females defending brooding males), and 3) to avoid spawning attempts by ""sneaker male"" (Kolm and Berglund 2004). Contrary to predictions for a sex role-reversed species, and all other apogonids studied to date, males assume the role of the principal aggressor towards intruders in their territories prior to brooding (Kolm and Berglund 2004). For both males and females, however, territorial aggression is greater towards intruders of the same sex. In experimental introductions of larger male intruders into territories held by male-female pairs, the intruding male was unable to replace the resident male even though the resident female may have courted the intruder; as well, males never courted intruding females. Because this species may have roles that are sexually equivalent, male and females likely play different roles in the defense of jointly-held territories (Kolm and Berglund 2004).
<br/>
<br/>As with other cardinalfishes, the Banggai Cardinalfish is an obligate paternal mouthbrooder (Hayashi 1999). Reproductive behavior was filmed <em>in situ</em> by Dr. Masayoshi Hayashi (Yokusuka City Museum, Yokusuka, Kanagawa, Japan) and the film was broadcast on Japanese television in 1998. Other details on reproductive behavior were obtained from additional laboratory and field studies. Under laboratory conditions, <em>P. kauderni</em> reproduces throughout the year. Single females in captivity can reproduce once per month, whereas males mouth-brood up to six clutches per year. Females, under laboratory conditions can be reproductively active at about 9 months of age and 35 mm SL. The smallest female with signs of advance gonadal maturation found in the wild was 41 mm SL (Vagelli 1999, Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). Females initiate courtship and use a variety of different behavioral patterns during courtship interactions (Vagelli 1999, Kolm 2001). Between a few days and up to two weeks prior to courtship and spawning, a pair will separate from the main group of fishes, establish a spawning site, and commence territorial behavior (Vagelli 1999, Kolm and Berglund 2004). A secondary male may be allowed into the territory and be courted by the female although this male did not interfere with courtship of the primary male (Vagelli 1999). Spawning and juvenile release (settlement) in the wild appears to follow a lunar cycle, with a major spawning peak during full moon and a second, smaller peak during the last quarter, although in one geographically-distinct population major spawning activity occurs during the last quarter  (Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). Courtship occurs during daylight hours and, in laboratory conditions, concludes by mid-afternoon. At the time of spawning and egg transfer, the female exudes an egg mass from her genital papilla that is pulled, fertilized, and then gulped by the male. <em>P. kauderni</em> possesses low fecundity, females produce small egg clutches of up to about 75 eggs of 2.5–3-mm in diameter. The mean clutch size found being incubated by males in the wild was 41 eggs (range=12 to 73) (Vagelli 1999, Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). The male broods an egg clutch for about 20 days; after hatching, the eleutheroembryos (free embryos) remain within the mouth cavity for another 10 days before release. Under laboratory conditions, a female would also court and even spawn with a secondary male (Vagelli 1999).  Following spawning and egg transfer, females defend the brooding male from intruders while males manipulate egg masses within their oral cavities; occasionally, intruders attempt to take eggs from a male’s mouth. The fertility rate under laboratory conditions is about 40 to 60%. Besides normal loss due unfertilized eggs and embryos that do not finish developing, an important percentage of eggs are lost during the clutch transfer (Vagelli 1999). Males do not feed while incubating the eggs; upon hatching some 20 days after spawning, the embryos are held an additional 10 days until their yolk is consumed.  Then, the juveniles, about 5.0 to 6.0 mm SL, are released from the male's oral cavity. A major settlement peak appears to occur during the full moon and a second minor peak during the new moon (Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). Vagelli (1999, 2004b) and Kolm (2001, 2002) provide laboratory studies of the reproductive biology and early ontogeny of this species, while Vagelli (2004a), Vagelli and Volpedo (2004) and Vagelli, 2005 provide data from field studies. Principal characteristics of the reproductive biology include: 1) parental care of an advanced degree, 2) an elevated level of energy investment per offspring, 3) low fecundity, 4) direct development, 5) a lengthy oral incubation period that includes the retention of free embryos after the eggs hatch, 6) settlement of juveniles within the habitat of their parents (Vagelli and Volpedo 2004).
<br/>
<br/>The sex ratio within groups is approximately equivalent (Vagelli and Volpedo 2004). Longevity in captivity can reach 4 to 5 years (although reproductive activity decreases substantially after 2 to 3 years). However, in the wild most adult specimens are significantly younger (about 2 years old or less). Growth studies in captivity and using wild specimens show <em>P. kauderni</em> follows von Bertalanffy equation L∞ = 69 ± 1.58 mm, k = 0.21 ± 0.016, t<sub>0</sub> = -0.72 ± 0.15 months (r²= 0.99). At 12 months of age <em>P. kauderni</em> reaches a SL of about 43.5mm (TL of 64.5mm), at 18 months 47mm (70 mm TL). The largest wild specimen encountered was about 58 mm SL (88.5 mm TL) (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007). 
<br/>
<br/><strong>Resilience:</strong>
<br/>This species has a relatively short life span (ca. 2.4 years), matures at an average of 0.8 years (FishBase 2004) and has a generation time of 1.5 years (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007); these are all indications of reasonably good resilience. Unfortunately, this species' small population size, limited distribution, low fecundity, great parental investment, and rate of extraction lower this species resilience with corresponding severe negative effects. The combination of a lack of planktonic dispersal and particular oceanographic characteristics of the Banggai region (deep channels and strong currents) has likely contributed to the extreme philopatry of this species. In addition, its within-parental habitat recruitment, sedentary nature, and shallow habitat preference preclude <em>P. kauderni</em> from dispersing even to nearby islands and have led it to a high degree of genetic structure (Bernardi and Vagelli 2004). <em>P. kauderni</em> is especially susceptible to indiscriminate collecting, e.g., its association with shallow microhabitats greatly facilitates its capture, while the lack of dispersal mechanisms make it almost impossible for this species to re-colonize areas where they have been depleted (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007).
<br/>
<br/>This species is highly prized in the aquarium trade and thus highly vulnerable to over-fishing, post-capture mortality, and habitat destruction.","<strong>Threats to the Habitat:</strong> <br/>Although resident in naturally-silty harbors and bays, this species might experience negative impacts from harbour dredging and associated pollution, as well as sediment from coastal development and use. <br/> <br/>Juveniles may be vulnerable to local population dynamics of anemones and sea urchins that provide mutualistic microhabitat. Threats to these might be from harvest (aquarium trade or food trade) or coral bleaching (anemones).  Adults may be vulnerable to local population dynamics of sea grasses. <br/> <br/><strong>Threats to the Species:</strong> <br/> <br/><u>Exploitation</u> <br/>The Banggai Cardinalfish is highly-prized in the aquarium trade (Allen 2000, Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Kolm and Berglund 2003). It has been heavily exploited by the aquarium trade since its rediscovery in 1994. Despite claims that captive breeding has been successful, most aquarium specimens are still captured in the wild. Fishes are collected, mainly with nets, and held in floating nets until purchased by fish buyers who visit individual fishers at least 3 to 4 times a month. Collectors are paid a small sum (ca. US $0.01 to 0.025 in 2001) per fish by buyers who, in turn, sell to exporters for US $ 0.10 to 0.12 a fish (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). Since 1999, the fishery has expanded from Banggai Island and Bandang Island to villages in the Bokan area, on Bangkulu Island, Labobo Island, and Peleng Island, with most collection occurring near their own villages. By 2001, at least 17 villages and 230 fishermen were involved in the <em>P. kauderni</em> trade (Lunn and Moreau 2004). An estimated minimum of 600,000 to 700,000 individuals were collected per year by local fishers prior to 2001 (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Lunn and Moreau 2002); current harvest rates are believed to exceed 700,000 to 900,000 fish/yr (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/><em>P. kauderni</em> are shipped primarily by boat from the Banggai Archipelago to national exporters via Tumbak and Manado and to a Bali exporter via Palu, and also direct to Bali exporters. An estimated 115,000 fish/month were transported on the Tumbak–Manado route, 3,000/month along the Palu to Bali route, and up to 10,000 fish/month were sent direct to Bali in 2001 (Lunn and Moreau 2004). These numbers are close to earlier estimates of 50,000 to 60,000 fish/month arriving in North Sulawesi for exportation, with total estimated trade for 2000 and 2001 of 700,000 fish (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). Transhipment mortality is high because of lengthy travel times, usually 18 to 48 hours by boat (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002); no data on mortality from collecting or holding prior to transhipment appears to be available. The high mortality rate contributes to the disparity in prices paid to fishers and buyers (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). A minimum of four aquarium fish export companies operate in Bali; others exist in Kendary and Manado (Sulawesi).  he majority of <em>P. kauderni</em> captured in the Banggai Archipelago are destined for the international aquarium trade, with most exported to the United States, Europe and Asia. Wabnitz <em>et al</em>. (2003) and Lunn and Moreau (2004) further document the aquarium trade. <br/> <br/>In addition to the estimate of number of individuals collected and shipped reported in the assessment, trade surveys carried out by Lunn and Moreau (2004) suggest that a minimum of 118,000 Banggai Cardinalfish were sold each month by fishers in the Banggai Islands. Trade volumes are in all likelihood greater as this estimate only includes fish bought by Tumbak- and Palu-based buyers, not taking into consideration individuals collected and shipped from alternate locations, or lost to pre-sale mortalities in fishers’ holding cages (Lunn and Moreau 2004). <br/> <br/>A recent study showed that, despite the use of non-destructive fishing methods, the fishery had a negative effect on fish density when sites with high fishing pressure were compared to sites with low fishing levels (Kolm and Berglund 2003). Fishing also had a significant effect on group size (halving of average group size where sites with high and low fishing pressure were compared), which may lead to strong negative impacts on individual fitness in the future (referred to as the Allee effect in the scientific literature) (Stephens <em>et al</em>. 1999, Stephens and Sutherland 1999, Kolm and Berglund 2003). <br/> <br/>In addition to more detailed trade statistics to accurately reflect real trade volumes, regular monitoring of the fishery should be undertaken, particularly as studies seem to indicate that the expansion of the trade to new, previously unexploited areas is underway, moving outwards from Banggai Island to all of the major islands in the area. Lunn and Moreau (2003) also highlight that the pool of potential fishers could be large, particularly given that obstacles to entering the fishery appear to be minimal and alternative livelihood opportunities limited. <br/> <br/>Other Threats: <br/>This species is reportedly parasitised by four main parasite types. Three of them have been already identified, i.e., nematodes (6.6% of all individuals analyzed), digenetic trematodes (7.9%); and 4.8% of individuals were parasited by cestodes (plerocercoid larvae). The last type of parasites found consists of an undescribed isopod which was found encysted in the body cavity and on the external stomach wall of 7.2% of individuals analyzed. These endoparasites are currently being investigated and preliminary results indicate that they belong to a new family of epicaridean isopods with an unknown life cycle (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>Indirect evidence strongly suggests that the Crocodile-fish <em>Cymbacephalus beauforti</em> (Platycephalidae), several species of Lion-fish <em>Pterois</em> (Scorpaenidae) and the grouper <em>Epinephelus merra</em> (Serranidae) prey upon <em>P. kauderni</em>, particularly in areas inhabited by large groups. Other likely predators are the Stonefish <em>Synanceia horrida</em> (Scorpaenidae), several species of moray eels of the genus <em>Gymnothorax</em>, and <em>Echidna nebulosa</em> (Muraenidae) and the sea-snake <em>Laticauda colubrina</em> (Elapidae) (Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>The species is thought to suffer high mortality during the first days after settlement due to predation, including cannibalism (Vagelli 2002). For instance, despite that under laboratory conditions the average number of juveniles released was 40, and the average clutch size of brooding males in the wild was 18 embryos, out of 81 groups of new recruits found in the wild during 3 expeditions, most of them consisted of one or two individuals (mean: 2.3 individuals). The three largest groups found consisted of 15, 12, and nine individuals (Vagelli 2004a, Vagelli 2005). <br/> <br/>A newly emerging threat (a viral disease) has been documented in wild-harvested individuals maintained in captivity.  The origin of the iridovirus, as well as the prevalence in and impacts to wild populations, is currently under investigation (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007). <br/> <br/>Frequent earthquakes recently affected several zones within the Banggai Archipelago had a potential detrimental impact on localized <em>P. kauderni</em> subpopulations","The earliest known population survey (2001) identified <em>P. kauderni</em> on 16 out of 37 islands searched. Average densities in suitable habitat at three sites within the Banggai Archipelago were approximately 0.03 fishes per m² (Vagelli and Erdmann 2002). Based on these census data and calculations of the total available habitat, the species was estimated to have a total population size of 1.7 million fish (Vagelli 2002). Additional surveys in 2002 and 2004 covering the entire Archipelago (50 islands, 159 sites) expanded the range to 27 (17 major and 10 minor) islands. Surveys done in 2004 found <em>P. kauderni</em> in most sites at densities of about 200 to 700 individuals/ha. The mean density based on census carried out in seven locations throughout its natural range in 2004 was 0.07 individuals per m², with a total population size estimated at 2.4 million individuals (Vagelli 2005).
<br/>
<br/><em>P. kauderni</em> exhibits the highest degree of population structure that has been documented for a marine fish (Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 2005). This is a unique case of genetic isolation in populations separated by extremely short distances. Studies utilizing both mt DNA and micro-satellites have already indicated that populations occurring on reefs of the same islands, separated by only a few kilometers, are genetically isolated from one another (Bernardi and Vagelli 2004).  For instance, assignment tests performed in 23 subpopulations from all over the Archipelago, showed that 20 had a significant self-reassignment. When considering all the Bangkulu populations, 94% of the individuals from this island were reassigned back to the island - range 80.0% to 100% (Vagelli <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The lack of suitable habitats between subpopulations coupled with lack of dispersal mechanisms, are the most likely reasons for this isolation.
<br/>
<br/>Banggai Cardinalfish populations are distinguished for having two monophyletically-distinct clades: a southwestern clade restricted to the southwest of Bangkulu Island, and northern and eastern clades distributed throughout the remainder of its range (Bernardi and Vagelli 2004).  Eleven polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite loci have been isolated from male fishes; polymorphism ranges from 2 to 15 alleles and expected heterozygosities range from 0.107 to 0.928, thus allowing for genetic studies of this species with very high resolution (Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Generation length is estimated at being 1.0 years (FishBase 2004), however more recent estimates place it at 1.5 years (A. Vagelli, pers. comm. on 27th Feb 2007).",Decreasing,"<em>Pterapogon kauderni</em> is a rare example of a marine fish with an extremely limited geographic range. It is endemic to the Banggai Archipelago, which lies in the Banggai-Sula platform in eastern Indonesia. The Banggai Island group is thought to have been a geological entity during the Cenozoic, and is located within the region of Wallacea. The natural geographic range of <em>P. kauderni</em> extends from 01° 24' 57.6"" of latitude South (Monsamat, east Peleng) as its northern most distribution point to 02° 0' 53.5"" of latitude South (Loisa A), and from 123° 34' 11"" of longitude East (Patipakaman, central Peleng) as its westernmost distribution to approximately 124° 23' 30"" of longitude East (Kano) and the south-east tip of Taliabu. This distribution covers an area of approximately 5,500 km². However, within this range, the maximum potential available habitat is about 426 km of coastline extending from the shore to about 100 m off the coast, with a maximum available area of about 34 km² (Vagelli 2005).
<br/>
<br/><em>P. kauderni</em> was found in 74 sites in 30 islands. Four sites were located in the Lembeh Strait (three islands and Sulawesi) in north Sulawesi, where this species was introduced in 2000, and in one site in central Sulawesi (Luwuk). The rest of sites were located within its natural distribution, i.e., the Banggai Archipelago. Here, it was found in 17 of the 20 major islands and in 10 of the 27 minor islands.
<br/>
<br/>The most isolated subpopulation inhabiting a large island was located in the eastern coast of Tempaus, which is separated from the subpopulation inhabiting Masoni Island by 16 km, and towards the west the closest subpopulation is found in south Bokan, at about 30 km. The second most isolated subpopulations inhabit Bangkulu Island, with its north subpopulation separated by about 13.6 km from south Peleng, and by about 13.5 km from Labobo Kenecil. Then, the subpopulation inhabiting Masoni Island is separated by about 11 km from the subpopulation located in Limbo, and by 16 km from that inhabiting Tempaus. Finally, the subpopulation found in Labobo is separated by about 10 km from the subpopulation located in Bangko and by 13.6 km from the closet subpopulation inhabiting Bangkulu. All other large islands are inhabited by at least one subpopulation of <em>P. kauderni</em> that is separated by no more than (and frequently less) 5 km from another subpopulation inhabiting a different large island. Despite that oceanographic and physiographic conditions, as well as availability of habitats and substrates were similar to those found on big islands inhabited by <em>P. kauderni</em>, no populations of <em>P. kauderni</em> were found in the other 17 minor islands, reefs and atolls located far from the big islands. Furthermore, some of these small islands were separated by very short distances from big islands inhabited by <em>P. kauderni</em>. Thus, no subpopulation of <em>P. kauderni</em> was found in Tanalan (localized at only 3.7 km  from the subpopulation inhabiting Masepe),  Belangan (at 2 km from the population of Bokan), Bongko (at 3.7 km  from the subpopulation of north Bangkulu), Sidula (at 5 km from the subpopulation inhabiting center-east Bangkulu), Togonglantan (separated by 5 km from the subpopulation of Bangkulu and by 6 km from that in habiting Labobo), nor in Tabija, which lays at only 1.5 km from the <em>P. kauderni</em> subpopulation inhabiting the bay localized south of  Keya on the nor-occidental coast of Taliabu.
<br/>
<br/>The Luwuk subpopulation, whose origin is not clear, is restricted to a very small area inside the harbor and is exposed to high levels of pollution and contaminants. Despite thorough searching from the harbour mouth to as far north as Botok (68 km), and as far south as Luk (46.5 km), no populations of <em>P. kauderni</em> were found outside the harbour, despite that environmental conditions and substrate availability were much better than those inside the harbor. The closest subpopulation of <em>P. kauderni</em> to the one at Luwuk is located about 100 km southeast, in Patipakaman (Peleng Island).
<br/>
<br/>The Lembeh subpopulation is located about 400 km north of the natural range of <em>P. kauderni</em> natural range; it was first detected in the Lembeh Strait in September 2000 occupying an area of approximately 50 m along the coast of Sarina Kenecil Island. The establishment of this subpopulation is a consequence of accidental or intentional releases from an aquarium fish operation in the area. By November 2000 this subpopulation expanded to the ""Police Pier"" on the margin of Sulawesi, where by May 2001 about 650 individuals occupied an area of approximately 750 x 250 m. By April 2004, <em>P. kauderni</em> extended its range from the Police Pier to at least 200 m to the south, and at least 500 m to the north. In addition, it was found for the first time in Sarina Island, and in Lembeh Island, where it was introduced in 2002 (Erdmann and Vagelli 2001, Vagelli and Erdmann 2002, Vagelli 2005).

<br/>See distribution map, and maps in the attached PDF.",,Marine,"Soon after the Banggai Cardinalfish appeared in the aquarium trade, a breeding programme was developed at the New Jersey State Aquarium (Vagelli 1999). But apparently no concerted effort within the aquarium trade has been made to replace wild-caught fish with captive-bred fish (Vagelli 2002, 2004b). As this fish can be reared through its entire life cycle in captivity (Vagelli 1999), it is strongly recommended that efforts be developed to raise this species in captivity and in the field (it is highly recommended that such efforts be undertaken in partnerships with local communities, preferably in Indonesia, to avoid removing livelihoods from the area). Such initiatives would reduce the need to capture wild specimens to supply the trade and reduce impact on existing populations in the region. <br/> <br/>In order to obtain reliable estimates of trade volumes for this and other marine ornamental species it is recommended that Indonesian government (and other governments) disaggregate the ‘aquarium fish’ category so that trade statistics can be obtained at least for marine versus freshwater species; and ideally by species. <br/> <br/>It is further recommended that a trade monitoring system be established through direct collaboration with exporters. Targeting and inputting trade volumes of the Banggai Cardinalfish into GMAD could help spearhead such a monitoring initiative and allow better estimates of traded numbers to be derived (Wabnitz <em>et al</em>. 2003). Moreover, collectors and traders should be encouraged to gain MAC certification for the Banggai Cardinalfish. <br/> <br/>Additional improvements in the sustainability of the current trade through directed training programmes on holding, packing and shipping, to reduce mortality rates of the species, are also recommended (Lunn and Moreau 2004). The development of environmental education material and programmes to promote public awareness are strongly encouraged and the potential implementation of marine protected areas should also be investigated (Lunn and Moreau 2004). <br/> <br/>In summary, conservation actions required for this species include the development, implementation, and effective enforcement of regulations designed to significantly reduce and regulate the collection and export of this species for the aquarium trade (a proposal to include this species in CITES Appendix II was withdrawn (CoP 14 Prop. 19 ); and to protect and conserve critical habitat. Management actions that would benefit both this species and the fisher communities that harvest it at present could include artificial propagation at the local level with the intention of substituting completely captive-bred fish for wild-caught fish. In addition, a concerted and effective effort should be made to reduce post-capture mortality at all levels of the collection, marketing, and export chain.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

In Mexico, it occurs on lower mountain slopes and adjacent plains and beaches (Stebbins 2003), sometimes in irrigated areas. Canyon bottoms, arroyos (dry creeks), and rocky slopes may support relatively dense populations in some parts of Arizona and Sonora. In southern Arizona, the Gila Monster is more abundant in wetter and rockier palo verde-sahuaro desert than in drier and sandier creosote-bursage desert, where it occurs mainly in or near rocky buttes or mountains (Lowe <em>et al</em>. 1986). In New Mexico, the species is most commonly associated with desert scrub vegetation in rocky regions of mountain foothills and canyons; sometimes it is found along the lower fringes of pinyon-juniper woodland or oak woodland; rarely encountered in agricultural areas (Degenhardt <em>et al</em>. 1996). Gila monsters are mainly terrestrial but infrequently climb into vegetation. Refuges include spaces under rock, dense shrubs, burrows, or woodrat nests. Sub-surface shelters are important components of the habitat, and certain ones are used with a high degree of fidelity (particularly in winter), sometimes by multiple individuals concurrently (Beck and Jennings 2003). In Arizona, Gila monsters spend about 98% of the year under cover (Lowe <em>et al</em>. 1986). In Utah, individuals spent over 95% of active season underground; occasionally they basked near shelters in spring; shelters were burrows or crevices in rocky areas; hibernacula faced south (Beck 1990).","Populations have been exploited (illegally) by commercial and private collectors, and they have suffered from habitat destruction due to urbanization and agricultural development (New Mexico Department of Fish and Game 1985). Concrete-lined canals are barriers to movement (Brown and Carmony 1999), as are busy highways. Mortality on roads likely is increasing as traffic volume increases on established highways and new roads are built. The most important reason for the decline is habitat loss resulting from development (Campbell and Lamar 2004). It is probably decreasing in southern Sonora due to expanding commercial agriculture.","This species is never very abundant, but its abundance varies greatly. It is represented by well over 100 collection/observation sites that are well distributed throughout the range (e.g., see Campbell and Lamar 2004). The total adult population size is unknown but is probably at least several thousand; the species is fairly common in at least some parts of the range. Lowe <em>et al</em>. (1986) stated that Gila monsters are infrequently seen but not rare or uncommon in Arizona. In New Mexico, the species is commonly encountered in the Redrock Wildlife Area in Grant County and at Granite Gap in Hidalgo County; a density of approximately five individuals per sq. kilometre was estimated for one area (Degenhardt <em>et al</em>. 1996). Populations are declining over most of the United States range (Campbell and Lamar 2004), but the rate of decline is unknown (probably less than 30% over the past three generations). Beck (1985) estimated that the population in Utah included 450 to 800 individuals, down from an estimated 2,000 to 5,000 before the 1930s. It is probably declining even more seriously in Mexico.",Decreasing,"The Gila Monster occurs in southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.

Historically the two species were harvested commercially for flesh and caviar, but no species differentiation was recorded in the landings data. <br/> <br/>Although some shortnose sturgeon may still be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are habitat related resulting from loss or degradation. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).   <br/> <br/>Shortnose Sturgeon stocks appear to be stable and even increasing in a few large rivers but remain seriously depressed in others, particularly southern populations. Previous Red Lists listed the species as Vulnerable. Since that earlier listing, a Recovery Plan has been developed and is being implemented and genetically distinct population segments have been identified. Although exploitation is no longer a serious concern, effects of habitat alteration and degradation and water quality (contaminant) concerns remain. Thus, the shortnose sturgeon should continue to receive a Vulnerable listing. This is based, in part, on an estimated population reduction of greater than 30% over the past three generations with some irreversible habitat losses and continued concern about impacts of pollutants and water-based development activities on population health. We also note extreme fluctuations in the number of mature individuals between rivers, from a few hundred or less in the Chesapeake Bay to perhaps 10,000 or more in the Hudson.","Shortnose sturgeon use of saltwater is generally amphidromous throughout most of the species' range, although far northern populations are anadromous (Kynard 1997). Spawning takes place in upper freshwater areas, while feeding (summering) and wintering occurs in both fresh and saline environments. This species typically spends its entire life history in the natal river and estuary and only rarely moves any great distance in near-coastal marine waters. There are no naturally land-locked populations of the species, but two rivers have populations that are segmented by dams.
<br/>
<br/>This species typically attains an adult size of 75–100 cm total length, though the maximum recorded size for a Canadian-caught female was 1.43 m and 23.6 kg (Dadswell <em>et al</em>. 1984).  Maximum ages determined for female and male shortnose sturgeon (again in Canada) were 67 and 32 years, respectively (Vladykov and Greeley 1963).  Prespawning migrations in northern populations are triggered by increasing water temperatures of 7–10°C, and during spawning, males are attracted to females by a female pheromone (Kynard and Horgan 2002a).  Spawning occurs at water temperatures of 7–15°C.  Spawning habitat is a substrate of rock or large gravel (usually rubble), and water depth during spawning is highly variable. Spawning suitability windows follow day length of 13.9–14.9 h, water temperature of 6.5–15°C, and river discharge that provides 30–120 cm/sec (mean 70 cm/sec) bottom velocity. All spawning windows must be open simultaneously for spawning to occur. Yearling shortnose sturgeon initiate the major dispersal that moves young fish to join older juveniles and adults in fresh or salt water foraging concentration areas. Yearling and older juveniles use the same summering and wintering habitats as adults (Kynard <em>et al</em>. 2000).
<br/>
<br/>In southern waters, shortnose males may mature in 2-3 years and females in 4-6 years. In northern portions of the range, maturation may not occur for 10-15 years (maximum). Spawning periodicity is poorly understood but in the northern part of the range, females are highly variable (2-9 years) and males spawn at 1-5 year intervals depending on fish age and foraging conditions. Some males in northern populations spawn annually.","Although some shortnose sturgeon may be harvested incidental to Atlantic sturgeon in Canada, there are no legal fisheries or by-catch allowances in U.S. waters. Principal threats to the survival of this species are blockage of up- and downstream migrations at dams, habitat loss or degradation due to dams and dam operations, river channel dredging, and pollution. Southern populations are particularly at risk due to water withdrawal from rivers and groundwaters and from eutrophication that directly degrades river water quality causing loss of habitat. Direct mortality is known to occur from impingement on cooling water intake screens, dredging, and incidental capture in other fisheries (NMFS 1998).","The estimate of the total current population size for the Hudson River indicates a 95% confidence interval of 26,000 to 55,000 individuals. The Saint John, Kennebec, and Delaware subpopulations appear to be on the order of 5,000 to 15,000 fish each. Estimates of other northern populations are the Connecticut River (CT-MA) — about 1,200 fish, and the Merrimack River (MA) of less than 100 individuals (Kieffer and Kynard 1993, Kynard 1997, Savoy 2004). Though many rivers in the southern region have been documented to contain shortnose sturgeon, few have had population estimates conducted. Only abundance in the Ogeechee and Altamaha rivers of Georgia have been estimated and both appear to be on the order of 1,000 fish each (Rogers and Weber 1994). Shortnose sturgeon occur only rarely in Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and no breeding population has been confirmed here.
<br/>
<br/>Walsh <em>et al</em>. (2001) analyzed shortnose sturgeon populations from two drainages in Maine and the Hudson River for genetic diversity. They noted significant differences between the Kennebec and Androscoggin stocks and even greater separation when compared to the Hudson stock.

From survey and tagging data, the National Marine Fisheries Service now recognizes 19 distinct population segments. The Shortnose Sturgeon Recovery Team considered sturgeon populations from two general regions, northern rivers and southern rivers. The largest populations in the northern region appear to be in the Saint John, NB, Canada (Dadswell 1979), Delaware, NJ-PA (Hastings <em>et al</em>. 1987), Kennebec, ME (Squiers <em>et al</em>. 1982), and Hudson, NY rivers (Bain <em>et al</em>. 1995).  <br/> <br/>See the <a href=""%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.natureserve.org/explorer/%E2%80%9C"">NatureServe Explorer</a> database for a more detailed description of this species’ range.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The shortnose sturgeon was listed as endangered under the inaugural U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1967.

A more detailed look at the data available for this species has resulted in it being downgraded to Least Concern. <br/> <br/>The lake sturgeon occupies the United States and Canadian waters of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River basin; Lake Champlain (Vermont-New York); the Lake Winnebago-Fox River complex (Wisconsin); Canada’s Hudson and James Bay watersheds; the Saskatchewan River (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba); and the Mississippi River basin area from the headwaters in Minnesota to the northern portion of the state of Louisiana and up the Missouri River into southern South Dakota. Well-regulated sport fisheries occur throughout the northern part of the range and Canada manages modest commercial fisheries in Ontario and Quebec provinces.  <br/> <br/>Although very little stock assessment is underway, the lake sturgeon subpopulation in the Mississippi and lower Missouri river basins is believed to be stable but relatively small, certainly compared to levels in the late 1800s prior to development of modern locks, dams and reservoirs. Area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and quality of habitats in this part of the species’ range are all diminished compared to historic conditions.  Restocking efforts using cultured fish are modest and fragmented among the states but results from Missouri DOC stockings are encouraging. Since there is currently no concerted basin-wide or interstate plan to manage or restore this stock, the Mississippi river basin lake sturgeon subpopulation is considered to be Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>The largest proportion of the global population lies in the Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River basin areas where numerous management and recovery plans are in place among and between states and provinces sharing boundary waters. Most threats here are understood and essential conservation measures are being implemented. Populations of lake sturgeon are being monitored and assessed and most segments of the stock appear to be increasing. Based upon all of the above information and IUCN definitions, the species currently is not facing a threat to its survival and is categorized as Least Concern (LC).","Based on pectoral fin ray sections it has been determined that lake sturgeon can live to be over 100 years old. One individual caught in Lake of the Woods, Ontario in 1953 was estimated to be 152 years old (Priegel and Wirth 1971). Lake sturgeon can reach lengths of 1.9 m, and weigh 91 kg. However, a 141 kg lake sturgeon was reportedly caught in Lake Superior in 1922 and a fish of equal weight was caught in Lake Michigan in 1943. Most fish reported in the literature were less than 35 years old.
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon from Black Lake in Michigan measured 75–193 cm total length (TL) and were 9–64 years old, with most fish less than 20 years old (Baker and Borgeson 1999). In the Lake Winnebago system of Wisconsin, female lake sturgeon reach sexual maturity between 24–26 years of age when they are about 140 cm long. Females spawn only every 3–6 years and can produce up to 700,000 eggs each time. Few male lake sturgeon mature before they are 114 cm long or 14–16 years old. Males spawn every one or two years (Priegel and Wirth 1971, Lyons and Kempinger 1992). In the Sturgeon River of Upper Michigan, male spawning intervals of two, three and four years were observed while females returned to spawn every three to seven years (Auer 1999). In Canadian rivers and lakes, mature male lake sturgeon range in size from 76–98 cm and females 84–117 cm (Houston 1987). Compared to sturgeon from Lake Winnebago and the Great Lakes, relatively little information is available regarding age, growth, maturity and spawning periodicity of lake sturgeon in the Mississippi River basin.
<br/>
<br/>During the spring season, lake sturgeon spawning occurs when water temperatures rise and reach 9–15 °C (Priegel and Wirth 1971, Kempinger 1988).  Spawning sturgeon will select shallow areas over hard clean substrate with relatively strong current velocities (Kempinger 1988).
<br/>
<br/>Usual lake sturgeon habitat is the highly productive shoal areas of larger lakes and rivers. They require moderate to swift currents and large rough substrates for spawning and embryo development. Lake sturgeon in the Upper Mississippi River prefer habitat in or adjacent to flow, but with relatively low to moderate current velocity (Knights, B. C., USGS, unpublished data).  They are rarely found in backwater habitats without flow. In the Mississippi basin habitat that is in or adjacent to current is generally depositional and has relatively compact silt or silt-sand substrates with presumed high densities of benthic invertebrates. These areas occur at the lower end of navigation pools near the main channel, the mouths of tributaries and large secondary channels, and at some channel border areas. While migrating, presumably en-route to spawning habitats or high use (feeding/home) areas, lake sturgeon will use areas of the river with relatively high current velocities including tailwaters, the main channel in the upper and mid reaches of navigation pools, and tributaries.
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon are known to move great distances to spawning and feeding habitats (Auer 1996). Wisconsin DNR recently reported that a sturgeon originally tagged in Lake Winnebago in October 1978 was recovered almost 19 years later at Locust Point Reef in Lake Erie, a minimum travel distance of almost 1,100 km (R. Bruch, WI DNR, news release).","The life history characteristics of slow growth, late maturation, and irregular spawning periodicity make lake sturgeon subpopulations particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation. Anthropogenic effects such as industrial and municipal pollution, blockage of access to habitats by dykes and dams, channeliszation and elimination of backwater areas, dewatering and water level fluctuations, physical destruction of spawning habitat, and inundation of habitat by reservoirs are known to threaten sturgeon subpopulations (Rochard <em>et al</em>. 1990, Auer 1996, Beamesderfer and Farr 1997, Noakes <em>et al</em>. 1999). Direct mortality of lake sturgeon due to impacts with commercial and/or recreational navigation vessels has been documented.  <br/> <br/>Dams may be the greatest impediment to lake sturgeon rehabilitation in the Great Lakes. Although there are numerous recorded instances of tagged sturgeon passing through navigation locks, many fish are precluded or delayed from reaching spawning or preferred feeding waters. Dams without locks completely block sturgeon passage and serve as severe impediments to lake sturgeon recovery in the Mississippi basin. Spawning and nursery areas are further degraded from land use problems such as erosion, sedimentation, and adverse discharges from point and non-point sources. Other concerns in the Great Lakes include stream channelization, over-exploitation and/or illegal harvest, lack of public concern and potential adverse impacts of lampricides on sensitive life stages.  <br/> <br/>Although lake sturgeon harvest from the Mississippi River is prohibited, financial incentive to collect roe for caviar remains. Small population sizes may limit poachers from targeting this species but it is likely that incidental captures are utilized and end up in the black market. With the first stocking of lake sturgeon by Missouri DOC now at age 17, there is increasing concern that poachers will target them as the females reach maturity within the next few years.","Lake sturgeon were, and in some cases continue to be, an important component of Native American diet and culture. Up until about 1870, lake sturgeon were primarily considered a nuisance by commercial fisherman and were stacked on the shores to rot (Milner 1874 cited in Becker 1983). Within the next 30 years the value of sturgeon for flesh and the use of roe for caviar became economically important. During heavy fishing years in the late 1800s lake sturgeon harvest from the Great Lakes averaged over 1,814 metric tons (mt) per year. In the peak harvest year of 1885, 4,901 mt were reported of which 2,359 tons came from Lake Erie alone. Sturgeon populations declined dramatically after 1900 and although some incidental harvest was reported until 1977, numbers were extremely low after 1956.
<br/>
<br/>Although lake sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes were greatly reduced due to overfishing during the last several decades of the nineteenth century they appear to be on the rebound throughout the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence basins with spawning populations being documented from 63 locations and spawning size estimates calculated for 17 of these sites.  The current status of lake sturgeon populations in most of the Great Lakes Basin, the St. Lawrence River and in Wisconsin’s Lake Winnebago system is stable or increasing. 
<br/>
<br/>Lake sturgeon were generally considered to be rare to uncommon in most waters of the Mississippi River basin since the late 1800s. In 1989, this species was declared as threatened by the American Fisheries Society in all Mississippi River states except Louisiana where they are believed to be extirpated (Williams <em>et al</em>. 1989). The Department of Natural Resources in Iowa and Illinois and the Missouri Department of Conservation list the lake sturgeon as endangered in their respective states, and in Minnesota, the lake sturgeon is listed as a species of special concern. The species appears to be extirpated from its former range in Alabama and Arkansas.
<br/>
<br/>The current status of lake sturgeon throughout the Mississippi basin is considered to be severely depressed from historical abundance levels. However, modern population assessment studies are lacking and rate of stock decline or growth is unknown. Native stocks were extremely depressed prior to the stocking program undertaken by the Missouri Department of Conservation. Following the first releases into Mark Twain Lake (Salt River, a Pool 24 tributary) in 1984, then at Louisiana on Pool 24 of the Mississippi River and at several Missouri River locations in 1988, increasing reports of incidental catch in commercial gear and by recreational anglers has been occurring.",Increasing,"Lake sturgeon spend their entire life cycle in freshwater and are widely distributed in North America. They currently range throughout much of the drainages of the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, the St. Lawrence River, Hudson Bay-James Bay, and the Saskatchewan River (Pflieger 1975, Becker 1983, Ferguson and Duckworth 1997). In the Mississippi basin this species occurs from the headwaters in Minnesota to the northern portion of the state of Louisiana and up the Missouri River into southern South Dakota. There is no known natural exchange of stocks between the Great Lakes and western Canadian provinces and those of the Mississippi River basin, though some stockings in the Mississippi have included lake sturgeon of Great Lakes Basin origin.  <br/> <br/>For a more detailed description of this species’ range, see <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/"">NatureServe’s Explorer database</a>.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Commercial harvest of lake sturgeon is prohibited in all U.S. waters and strictly managed in Canadian waters with closed seasons, size limits and gear restrictions.  <br/> <br/>Angling in some waters of Michigan is allowed with several restrictions as to season, fish sizes and gear. In Wisconsin, harvest is limited to two separate sportfishing seasons. Spear fishermen must purchase a one-fish sturgeon spear tag and they are allowed to spear a fish from early February until a specified quota is reached. In Lake Winnebago, the 2000 quota was set at 400 adult females, 400 juvenile females and 2,150 males. Once 80% of the quota is reached the fishery is closed after the next day. Typical spear fishing harvest in recent years produced 1,500 to 2,500 fish. Wisconsin’s hook and line fishery allows the catch of one fish per angler per season with a minimum size range of 127–178 cm, depending on location, during early September through 15 October. All anglers must apply for and use a free tag and the fishery produces about 300–400 fish per season.  <br/> <br/>Sport fishing for lake sturgeon is currently prohibited in the Mississippi River but is allowed in some tributaries in Wisconsin and Minnesota (e.g., Wisconsin, Chippewa, and St. Croix rivers) during a short hook and line season in the fall.  Angling in Minnesota has several restrictions as to season, fish sizes and gear and the reported annual sport catch was 2,200–4,200 kg in 1998–2000.  Harvest is not allowed in Iowa, Ohio, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and South Dakota. <br/> <br/>According to the CITES Management Authority of Canada (CMAC 2000) sturgeon harvest in Canada consists of aboriginal, commercial and recreational fisheries. The entire North American commercial harvest of lake sturgeon comes from Canada where in 1997, 223 mt were caught in New Brunswick and Quebec, with 90% (200 mt) being taken from the St. Lawrence River. Catch in Ontario during the late 1990s ranged from 5–8 mt. Most of this came from Lake Huron with a small amount from Lake St. Clair. In 1998, international trade in lake sturgeon meat was reported to be 18.2 mt exported from Canada to the U.S. (mostly New York). No caviar exports are reported and no export quotas have been established by range states. Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans reported that in recent years total recreational catch from the North and South Saskatchewan rivers in Alberta and Saskatchewan amounted to about 1,000 fish. <br/> <br/><em>Acipenser fulvescens</em> is not listed as a species at risk by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). Most subpopulations are thought to be capable of sustaining well-regulated fisheries. Although the species is managed and protected in Canada under the Federal Fisheries Act, regulations differ between provinces and are revised annually. This species is listed under provincial legislation as ""threatened"" in Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan (CMAC 2000). <br/> <br/>In recent years, interest in the restoration of lake sturgeon has increased greatly. Partnerships have been developed throughout the Great Lakes basin between state and federal natural resource agencies, commercial and sport fishers and other water users. Numerous management and recovery plans have been completed for select waters within the lake sturgeon range and are being implemented as resources allow. Their goals include conservation, rehabilitation and enhancement of sturgeon populations, completion of status assessments, harvest restrictions, identification and restoration of critical habitats and elimination of negative effects of dams.  <br/> <br/>Construction of spawning habitats using coarse stone rip-rapping has been undertaken in some states (particularly Wisconsin) and appears to be highly successful. Artificial culture and restocking of lake sturgeon is under development in Minnesota using wild broodstock. In New York, sturgeon eggs are taken from wild stocks in the St. Lawrence River and cultured fingerlings have been reared and released in several locations since 1995. Survival has been high and populations appear to be recovering. In Missouri over 210,000 lake sturgeon fingerlings have been stocked in the upper Mississippi and lower Missouri rivers since 1986. Survival of stocked fish is considered excellent as tagged lake sturgeon have been recaptured in the Mississippi, Missouri, Gasconade and Osage rivers and commercial fishermen have reported incidental catches reaching nuisance proportions (Hesse and Carreiro 1997).  Artificial culture and restocking of lake sturgeon is also under development in Minnesota using wild broodstock. Wisconsin DNR propagates some lake sturgeon for restocking purposes with cultured fish only being placed into the same basins from which broodstock were taken. The Tennessee Valley Authority has stocked thousands of young lake sturgeon within the Ohio River Basin.   <br/> <br/>A Lake Sturgeon Management Plan has been implemented in Alberta since 1997. This involves a zero catch limit on the North Saskatchewan River; and on the South Saskatchewan, a closed season during the 1 April to 15 June spawning period with a one fish limit (greater than 130 cm) outside that restricted season. There is no aboriginal fishery in Alberta. In Saskatchewan, a self-imposed moratorium on commercial catch of lake sturgeon has been in place since 1996 and sport angling has not been allowed since 1999. A multi-agency study of habitat, fish migration and abundance is currently underway (CMAC 2000). Manitoba reduced its possession limit of lake sturgeon to zero in 1995. The remaining few commercial fisheries closed down during the 1990s but catch and release angling is still allowed in addition to aboriginal subsistence fishing in most rivers. Lake sturgeon population management has been initiated in several Manitoba rivers with involvement of First Nations communities. <br/> <br/>In Ontario, a Lake Sturgeon Assessment Program has been implemented for Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair, including population abundance estimation and tagging to identify movements and verify ages. As enough information is developed a management plan for the species will be drafted. Commercial catch quotas of lake sturgeon were established in 1984 and were adjusted periodically - through never achieved. In 1997, the catch quotas amounted to 1,500 kg in Lake St. Clair and 13,124 kg in Lake Huron. Huron catch that year was 5,471 kg, the highest of the previous several years. <br/> <br/>Quebec allows the harvest of lake sturgeon with 19–20.3 cm mesh gill nets only during an open season of 14 June through 31 October. A minimum fish length is in effect and quotas are enforced by the requirement that all fish for market must be tagged, and the tag must stay with the fish until it is processed. Quebec sport fishermen may catch and keep one fish per day.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Although the estimated population size is above the thresholds for any of the categories for threat, it is not large (34,000–166,000 adults and sub-adults) and the number of mature individuals is unknown.  The estimated number of spawning females for the Klamath River (which supports most of the northern DPS) is only 760–1,500 per year. However, four out of seven (57%) of the known spawning locations have been lost within the last three generations for reasons, not all of which are clearly understood, and may not have ceased or reversible. <br/> <br/>Green Sturgeon are not subjected to overfishing and habitat fragmentation that have affected other sturgeon species.

Considerable research is underway or planned to fill in information gaps on stock structure, abundance and migrations.  Although Green Sturgeon currently does not warrant ""threatened"" status under U.S. Endangered Species Act, concerns remain about the limited number of spawning rivers, potential growth of fisheries, and persistent habitat threats from water withdrawals and agricultural pesticides. Given the species’ life history characteristics and limited number of spawning sites, it is considered likely that the species would quickly move into a threatened category if current conservation efforts were withdrawn. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.","The Green Sturgeon is among the most marine oriented and widespread of the sturgeons. Like most sturgeons, the Green Sturgeon is characterized by large size, longevity, delayed maturation, high fecundity, and far-ranging movements. Green Sturgeon reach sizes up to 2.7 m and have been aged to over 50 years (Nakamoto <em>et al</em>. 1995, Farr <em>et al</em>. 2002). Mortality rates of subadults and adults are low and probably do not exceed 10% per year from natural causes based on age frequency analysis.  Males typically mature at about 15–17 years and 1.5–1.8 m, while females typically mature at 20–25 years and 1.8–2.1 m (Van Eenennaam and Doroshov  2001a). Similarly aged males are generally smaller than females with males from the northern DPS achieving a maximum size of 168 cm, while sexually mature males and females from the southern DPS range in size from 139 to199 cm and 157 to 223 cm, respectively (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Spawning is believed to occur every 3-5 years and the generation time is 27–33 years (Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Green Sturgeon are oviparious broadcast spawners and adult Green Sturgeon typically migrate into freshwater beginning in late February and spawning occurs in April to June in deep, turbulent river mainstems (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Klamath and Rogue River populations appear to spawn within 160 km of the ocean while the Sacramento population may travel over 320 km upriver. Green Sturgeon eggs and larvae are comparatively larger than those of other sturgeon species. For example, Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported a egg diameter of 4.34, 3.40 and 2.62 mm for green, white, and Atlantic Sturgeon (<em>A. oxyrinchus</em>) respectfully indicating that Green Sturgeon have eggs which have a volume twice that of white and over four times that of Atlantic Sturgeon. Consequently, Green Sturgeon have a relatively lower fecundity in comparison to other similar sized sturgeon species as reproductive energy is more heavily invested in egg size rather than egg number (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001b, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000). Fecundity varies with age and size, but has been estimated to be in the order of  2,800 eggs per kilogram bodyweight; approximately half that of White Sturgeon (<em>Acipenser transmontanus</em>) at 5,648 eggs per kilogram bodyweight (Moyle 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The eggs do not form a thick jelly coat as do those of other North American sturgeon and exhibit poor adhesion to substrate (Deng 2000, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000), which would indicate sensitivity to turbidity loading  (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1994, Moyle 2002). Furthermore, the larger eggs and higher growth rates of developing Green Sturgeon in comparison to other North American sturgeons suggests that a higher oxygen demand may be required for proper embryonic development; thus Green Sturgeon may require colder, cleaner water for spawning. (USFWS 1995).
<br/>
<br/>Eggs hatch in 7 to 9 days at 15°C (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001). Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that temperatures above 20°C are lethal to embryos and temperatures above 24°C significantly reduce five-day larval growth rates. Larvae begin to feed at 10 days post hatch and complete metamorphosis into juveniles at 45 days (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Juvenile Green Sturgeon grow rapidly reaching 60 cm within 2–3 years and they spend 1–4 years in fresh and estuarine waters before dispersal to saltwater (Beamsesderfer and Webb 2002). Green Sturgeon are commonly observed in bays and estuaries up and down the coast and large concentrations enter the Columbia River estuary, and Washington's Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay during late summer (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Limited tagging studies show that tagged individuals from the Columbia River have been recaptured off the west coast of Vancouver Island (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>During the 1 to 4 years of freshwater residence, juveniles gradually move to deeper and more saline areas as they grow (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). As juveniles grow, they exhibit greater tolerance to salinity and achieve seawater tolerance at seven months or sooner (Allen and Cech 2003). Adults return to freshwater to spawn, and Green Sturgeon have been reported to spawn up to 160 km upstream in the Klamath and Rogue rivers, and over 300 km upstream in the Sacramento River (Beamesderder and Webb 2002). After spawning, they to sea in late autumn to early winter when temperatures drop below 10°C and flows increased above 100 m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Juveniles are opportunistic benthic feeders with a diet consisting of various invertebrates and fish (EPIC 2001, Moyle 2002).  Stomach content analysis indicates that adult Green Sturgeon have a marine diet consisting of various benthic invertebrates including shrimp, crabs, worms, amphioids, and isopods (EPIC 2001), but have also been observed feeding on sand lances (<em>Ammodytes hexapterus</em>) and other fish.","Sturgeon exhibit a combination of morphology, life history and habitat requirements that make them highly susceptible to negative impacts from human activities (Boreman 1997).  Anthropogenic activities known to impact sturgeon include: exploitation   blockage of available freshwater spawning habitat through diking, damming causing inadequate flow regimes, channelization, elimination of backwater areas, dewatering of streams, destruction of thermal refugia, loss of deep pools, inundation of habitat by reservoirs, and exposure to bioaccumulating industrial and municipal pollution, (Boreman 1997, EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The long life span and late age of maturity makes sturgeon vulnerable to chronic and acute effects of bioaccumulation. White Sturgeon, for example have been found to have the greatest contaminant concentrations compared to salmonids, suckers, Walleye (<em>Sander vitreus</em>), Pacific Lamprey (<em>Lampetra tridentata</em>), and Eulachon (<em>Thaleichthys pacificus</em>), [USEPA 1999]. Whole body concentrations of hexachlorobenzene (19 ųg/kg), DDT (787 ųg/kg), p,p’DDE (620 ųg/kg), Aroclors (173 ųg/kg), and dioxins were an order of magnitude higher in concentration than all other species tested.  Although Green Sturgeon are less exposed to anthropogenic contaminants due to their marine migratory phase, there is the potential for exposure when entering freshwater to spawn and during estuarine concentrations. <br/> <br/>Marine and estuarine environments in Canada are of concern as they are heavily impacted by a number of activities including logging, aquaculture, agriculture and urbanization, and can be the eventual sinks to freshwater pollutants. However, a 1994 assessment of the quality of the lower Fraser River ecosystem indicated that no dramatic changes in species assemblages were determined to have occurred since the previous study in 1974 (Healey <em>et al</em>. 1994) despite an increase in usage. Area managed for conservation also increased from 23 to 69% over the same time period with 80% of the increase being accounted for by conservation efforts on the Fraser River estuary (MWLAP 2002). The increase in estuary protection and the results from Healey <em>et al</em>. (1994) suggests that estuarine habitat loss that may effect Green Sturgeon is likely not substantial in Canada. <br/> <br/>In the US, where all known spawning populations occur, Green Sturgeon have lost spawning habitat to poor land use practices and habitat alteration through water management projects (EPIC 2001). This has caused a decline in general water quality in some areas through increased sedimentation as well as the loss of deep pools which Green Sturgeon are known to prefer. Furthermore, damming of river systems can block previously available spawning habitat, affect natural flow regimes, potentially reduce areas of thermal refugia, and change sediment transport characteristics of the river which may cascade and impact sturgeon by modifying ecosystem community structure (EPIC 2001). For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). <br/> <br/>Beamesderfer and Webb (2002 suggest that habitat conditions throughout the Green Sturgeon range have stabilized or are improving, but the results of spawning surveys have yet to substantiate that (NMFS 2002). Most of the northern population segment spawns in the Klamath River. Potential threats to this population include concentration of spawning, harvest (especially in mixed-stock estuarine fisheries), and loss of spawning habitat such as the Columbia River, and the Eel and South Fork, and Trinity Rrivers in California (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The southern population segment (south of the Eel River) is more of a concern because it has fewer spawners (limited to the Sacramento-San Joaquin system), which makes it more susceptible to catastrophic events. These fish also face potentially lethal temperature limits, entrainment by water projects, and may be adversely affected by pesticides and other toxic substances and exotic species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). It is probable that Green Sturgeon spawning habitat has been lost behind dams and water diversions throughout the Central Valley (e.g., Red Bluff Diversion Dam and Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District pumping plant). <br/> <br/><strong>Utilisation</strong> <br/>Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in two three fisheries. The smaller bycatch occurs in Klamath River Tribal salmon gill net fisheries while the larger portion is in the White Sturgeon commercial and sport fisheries (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). Total annual harvest of Green Sturgeon declined substantially to 1,192 fish in 1999–2001 from 6,871 fish in 1985–1989. Most of this earlier harvest came from the Columbia River (51%) and Washington coastal fisheries (28%). In recent years, Columbia and Washington coastal harvest was substantially reduced and in 2001 these two bycatch fisheries and that of the Klamath River tribes were about equal in number. Catch reduction in the Columbia River is a result of increasingly restrictive regulations. For the sturgeon sport fishery, slot limits prohibit retention of fish (white or green) less than 107 cm (42 inches) or more than 152 cm (60 inches). Green Sturgeon retained as bycatch in the commercial fishery must be between 122 and 168 cm (48-66 inches). <br/> <br/>Klamath Tribal fisheries (Yurok and Hoopa) accounted for an average 266 adult fish annually from 1986–2001 with no apparent trend. This fishery is monitored but not regulated. California sport catch of Green Sturgeon, primarily in San Pablo Bay, is not monitored, but is thought to be only a few fish each year (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). California slot size limits for both sturgeon species is 117–183 cm (46–72 inches). <br/> <br/>There is also a bycatch in the domestic trawl fishing industry in B.C., which takes about 171 Green Sturgeon annually (Davis 2004). <br/> <br/>There is no information on the extent of illegal exploitation of Green Sturgeon, but poaching activity on White Sturgeon in the lower Fraser River is a concern (Ptolemy and Vennesland 2003).","Preliminary population genetics results suggest that Green Sturgeon from the Klamath and Rogue rivers are similar to each other but distinct from fish from San Pablo Bay. Green Sturgeon commonly occur in the lower Columbia River (Oregon–Washington) and genetic samples taken there appear to be a mixture of the other populations (Israel <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS 2003) has determined that, based on genetic evidence of discreteness, there are two Distinct Population Segments (DPS's) for Green Sturgeon. The northern population ranges from the Eel River, California, to at least the Rogue River, Oregon. The southern population is principally comprised of the Sacramento River spawning stock.
<br/>
<br/>Their wide distribution, large numbers observed seasonally in some areas, and projections based on demographic rates suggest that total Green Sturgeon numbers are at least in the tens of thousands (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). The largest known spawning stock of Green Sturgeon is that of the Klamath River and its tributary, the Trinity River. The Klamath River population is estimated to number up to 66,000 individuals of which 3,000 would be mature adults. Actual spawner numbers in the Klamath were estimated at 760–1,500 females per year based on average harvest and total mortality rates (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Based on a review of recent tagging studies, harvest analyses, and stock assessments from many locations, Beamesderfer and Webb (2002) estimated that the total adult and subadult population size of Green Sturgeon is within the range of 34,000 to 160,000 fish. Of these, greatest abundance was recorded for the Columbia River estuary, and ocean and bay waters of Oregon and Washington.
<br/>
<br/>Attempts to determine trends in sturgeon abundance in the northern DPS have been inconclusive regarding the status of Green Sturgeon, and the status of the northern Green Sturgeon population is unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Similar attempts to determine the status of Green Sturgeon in the southern DPS were also inconclusive, and with the exception of anecdotal evidence of a reduction of Green Sturgeon entrainment at water export facilities indicative of a population decline, the status of the southern DPS is also unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).",Stable,"Green Sturgeon is an anadromous species that spend most of their life in near-shore marine and estuarine waters from Mexico to southeast Alaska (Houston 1988, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Large concentrations of Green Sturgeon are still found in coastal estuaries, but their range in freshwater has been restricted by damming in some rivers. For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). Spawning is presently known to occur in only three rivers in North America, all of which are in the United States: the Rogue River in Oregon (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Rien <em>et al</em>. 2001), and the Klamath and Sacramento river systems in California (EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002, CDFG 2002, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1992,1994).  Spawning populations have been extirpated from the San Joaquin, Eel, South Fork, and Trinity rivers, and possibly the Umpqua River (EPIC 2001, NMFS 2002). Seasonal concentrations occur in several estuaries including the Sacramento-San Joaquin, Eel, Columbia, Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor and the Fraser River (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Fishery managers in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia have recognized the sensitivity of Green Sturgeon to fishing and have actively restricted commercial and sport fisheries everywhere Green Sturgeon occur. None of the reviews examined mentioned any legal, regional, national or international trade in Green Sturgeon products. This species is not considered as good to eat as White Sturgeon and markets for their flesh are limited. <br/> <br/>Due to life history characteristics that make it particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events Green Sturgeon has a designation of ""Special Concern"" in Canada (Houston 1988, Davies 2004), and no harvest is allowed in Canadian waters. <br/> <br/>In response to a petition to list Green Sturgeon under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a status review for this species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). NMFS determined that the species is comprised of two distinct population segments (DPS) but that neither warrants listing as a threatened or endangered species at this time (NMFS 2003). However, because of remaining uncertainties about their population structure and status, both DPS populations were added to the agency's list of candidate species and will be reevaluated in five years provided sufficient new information becomes available.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

This species was historically recorded in southwestern Korea and in western Kyushu, Japan and in the Yellow, Yangtze, Pear, Mingjiang, and Qingtang rivers in China, but has been extirpated from all of these areas except for the mid-lower section of the Yangtze River, below the Gezhouba dam. This species was historically overfished. In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals, but between 2005-2007 the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was estimated to be 203-257 individuals. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period. The construction of the Gezhouba dam in 1981 blocked the migration routes of this species, making it impossible for it to reach spawning sites in the upper reaches of the river. Currently, there is just one remaining spawning ground (a 4 km stretch of river), which is situated below the Gezhouba dam. Furthermore, in 2003, the Three Gorges dam was constructed 40 km upstream of the Gezhouba dam. This has changed the hydrological regime (lowering the water level of the river in autumn and winter) and affected the water temperature. Between 1983 and 2007, more than 9 million juveniles (including larvae) were released into Yangtze River to increase population numbers, but the contribution to wild stocks is considered to be less than 10%. This species has therefore been assessed as Critically Endangered.","This species is anadromous (spending at least part of its life in salt water and returning to rivers to breed). Young of this species live in estuarine and nearshore habitats. When the species becomes sexually mature, it migrates up-river. Nearly mature adults (early stage III) arrive at the mouth of the Yangtze River in June or July. The adults do not feed while in the river. <br/><br/>Adults reach the middle sections of the river in September or October, where they overwinter. Ripe individuals were formerly found as far inland as the Jingsha River during the following October and November, where they spawned. Prior to construction of the Gezhouba Dam, the migration distance was as long as 2,500 to 3,300 km. Spawning sites often occur in turbulent sections of the river with rocky substrate and steep cliffs on both banks.<br/><br/>The roe is very large and it sinks and sticks to gravel until hatching. The hatched fries descend from the river to sea near the coast where they grow. They feed mainly on zoobenthos and other bottom invertebrates.<br/><br/>Juvenile <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. sinensis</span> of 7 to 38 cm tail length occur in the Yangtze River estuary from the middle of April through early October. These are presumably one-year-old individuals. Juveniles weighing a few kilograms can be found in coastal waters near the river mouth. Individuals from 25 to 250 kg in weight were registered in some fishing grounds of East China Sea and Yellow Sea. This species attains a length of more than 3 metres.","This species has been historically overfished. In the 1970s, fishing was unlimited, but seasonal (occurring mostly between October and November). Gear types include gill nets (upper reach) and row hooks (middle reach).&#160; Due to its life history characteristics, once depleted, stocks of this species take a long time to recover. Fry are also captured by traditional Chinese fishing methods (drift nets in the river and set nets at the river mouth).<br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation, alteration, destruction and changes to hydrological conditions also significantly impacts this species. The construction of the Gezhouba dam in 1981 blocked the migration routes of this species, making it impossible for it to reach&#160; spawning sites in the upper reaches of the river. Currently, there is just one remaining spawning ground, which is situated below the Gezhouba dam.<br/><br/>In 2003, the Three Gorges dam was constructed 40 km upstream of the Gezhouba dam. This has changed the hydrological regime (lowering the water level of the river in autumn and winter) and affected the water temperature. <br/><br/>Additionally, an increase in the amount of shipping traffic in the Yangtze river could be detrimental to the Chinese Sturgeon.<br/><br/>New evidence shows that water pollution is a potential factor lead to the decline of Chinese Sturgeon. Synthetic chemicals in water could contribute to the population decline of this species by significantly decreasing both the quality and quantity of eggs and spawning frequency of fish (Hu 2009).","In the 1960s, this stock supported a major commercial fishery, but catches in the late 1970s had declined to about 500 fish per year (The Changjiang Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988).<br/><br/>In the 1970s, the total spawning population of this species was estimated at 10,000 individuals. In 1981, the construction of the Gezhouba dam isolated the upper reaches of the Yangtze river. In 1983 and 1984, the mean spawning stock size was estimated at 2,176 individuals (946 and 4,169 as 95% confidence intervals). Available data from acoustic surveys show that between 2005 and 2007, the total spawning stock of Chinese Sturgeon was 203-257. This data indicates a 97.5% reduction in the total spawning population over a 37 year period.<br/><br/>During 1996-2001, studies using tag-recapture methods, population structure analysis and sonar counting indicated that the spawning stock in the Yichang spawning area (mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze river) had decreased since the completion of the Gezhouba Dam. Annual estimates of spawning adults within the 40 km (including the 4km long spawning area) ranged from 199 to 473 (Chang 1999, Wei 2003).<br/><br/>Between 1983 and 2007, more than 9 million juveniles were released into Yangtze River to increase wild stocks. Prior to 1996, only the larvae were released as techniques had not been developed to cultivate fry, so survivability is expected to be very low (Wei 200, Chen 2008). After 1999, improvement in hatchery techniques allowed juveniles to be raised and the released, but the contribution to wild stocks is considered to be less than 10% (Wei 2003, Zhu 2003).",Decreasing,"The Chinese Sturgeon is the most southerly distributed of the Acipenseriformes.

14871490,22823,Ursus maritimus,Vulnerable,A3c,2015,2015-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Loss of Arctic sea ice due to climate change is the most serious threat to Polar Bears throughout their circumpolar range (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stirling and Derocher 2012, USFWS 2015). We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term “management units” may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (M’Clintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89°46’N, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52°35’N (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bears’ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party “…shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,…” and according to Article VII, “The Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bears…” and&#160; “...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...”. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Further, the Parties shall consult with each other on the management of shared Polar Bear subpopulations, and exchange information on research and management programs. The PBSG has reiterated that all management actions be based on the best scientific information. The PBSG has identified these management elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Protection of essential habitats</li><li>Use of scientific evidence</li><li>Monitoring, prevention and sound management of human-bear conflicts</li><li>Development of inter-jurisdictional agreements for shared populations</li><li>Development of management strategies to minimize impacts of human activities (e.g. mining, shipping, oil and gas activities, tourism and other human-caused disturbance)</li><li>Management of sustainable harvest</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of the local public living in polar bear areas in developing and achieving the goals of the action plan </li></ul><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

If the decline has been less than 30 percent, listing as Near Threatened may be appropriate, unless population size is fewer than 10,000. Population size is unknown but may be fewer than 10,000. If population size is fewer than 10,000, listing criteria would include C1. Area of occupancy is unknown but may be less than 2000 sq km. The species occurs in more than 10 locations. Distribution is probably not severely fragmented.","This darter inhabits clear to slightly turbid water of raceways and swift to moderately swift riffles of small to medium rivers with expanses of clean sand or gravel; it does not associate with mud, clay, or submerged vegetation (Pflieger 1997, Ross 2001, Boschung and Mayden 2004). Usually it occurs in water more than 60&#160;centimetres&#160;deep with strong current. Individuals often bury themselves in sand with only the eyes protruding, or they may hide under rocks. In Arkansas, this species was collected typically at depths of 114-148&#160;centimetres&#160;and velocities of 46-90&#160;centimetres&#160;per second; predominantly on gravel, small cobble, and patches of sand (George <em>et al</em>. 1996).","The Crystal Darter is vulnerable to siltation and other forms of pollution from urbanization, strip-mining, logging, natural gas exploration, and improper agricultural practices, as well as stream alteration projects, such as damming, dredging, and channelization.<br/><br/>Dredging for navigation is believed to be a major threat in the upper Mississippi River system. Waterway construction has destroyed and degraded habitat in some areas. Construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, which connected the Tennessee and Tombigbee drainages, was followed by declines in Crystal Darter populations (Ross 2001, Boschung and Mayden 2004). Jay Hatch and Konrad Schmidt captured a specimen at a designated and active dredge spoil disposal site in the Mississippi River. Possibly the unconsolidated material gradually eroding back into the river provided a soft and suitable substrate for the Crystal Darter (Ray Katula, The Native Fish Conservancy).<br/><br/>The Mississippi River probably no longer serves as an effective dispersal corridor due to its increased silt load (Bauer and Clemmer pers. comm. cited by Boschung and Mayden 2004). In the lower Cahaba River, Alabama, the species is threatened by increased siltation and eutrophication perpetuated by upstream urbanization and strip mining (Boschung and Mayden 2004). <br/><br/>Populations remaining in the Mobile Basin are isolated from one another by dams and silty impoundments (Boschung and Mayden 2004).<br/><br/>This fish requires swift moving currents and therefore is susceptible to water flow modifications (dams, etc.). Altered flows due to hydropower dams are a possible problem in the lower Chippewa and St. Croix rivers in Wisconsin (Lyons pers. comm. 1994).<br/><br/>Introduction of nonindigenous fish species is another potential threat. Newly introduced species could compete with or prey on the Crystal Darter (Bauer and Clemmer 1983). <br/><br/>Localized populations are vulnerable to extirpation from single destructive events such as spills of toxins. <br/><br/>Crystal Darters are relatively tolerant of nondestructive intrusion, though heavy recreational use of habitat potentially could be excessively disruptive.","This species is represented by fewer than 100 occurrences (subpopulations).<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but presumably is at least several thousand. This species is not easily detected using standard fish survey methods.<br/><br/>The Crystal Darter is common in only a few streams; it is localized and generally rare (Page and Burr 2011). In Missouri, the species never has been common in collections, with most records represented by three or fewer specimens (one collection of 11 specimens) (Pflieger 1997). Crystal Darters appear to be rare in the Elk River, West Virginia; Osier (2005) captured only two specimens during 20 sampling occasions during 2002-2004.<br/><br/>This species has undergone a substantial long-term decline in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, number of subpopulations, and population size. It has been extirpated from 5 states in the northeastern portion of the historical range. In Iowa, recent records are available from Turkey Creek and pools 9 and 11 of the Mississippi River (Iowa Aquatic Gap Fish Atlas). In Missouri, the species probably is extirpated in the St. Francis River and Little River drainages, and it may no longer occur in the Meramec River (Pflieger 1997). The Crystal Darter was formerly abundant in the Tombigbee River in Mississippi but has not been collected there since 1981; the species is probably extirpated from the Tombigbee drainage in Mississippi, with the possible exception of the Buttahatcheee River (Ross 2001). The few individuals in the Tombigbee River and its major tributaries in Alabama may ""represent viable populations or stragglers destined for extirpation"" (Boschung and Mayden 2004). The species was once common in the Alabama River in Wilcox and Monroe counties (Alabama) but has not been collected there since 1975 (Boschung and Mayden 2004). The last collection in the Pascagoula River system was in 1933, although apparently suitable habitat still remains (Boschung and Mayden 2004).<br/><br/>Population size has probably declined over the past 10 years (three generations probably less than 10 years), but the rate of decline is unknown. This species is declining in most areas (Mayden pers. comm. 1994, Burr pers. comm. 1993, Douglas pers. comm. 1993, Shute pers. comm. 1993; Ross 2001). With continued habitat exploitation and degradation, the decline is expected to continue (Mayden pers. comm. 1994). In Alabama, the darter's conservation status has deteriorated since the late 1970s, and the extent of suitable habitat continues to decline (Boschung and Mayden 2004). Lyons (pers. comm. 1994) characterized Wisconsin populations as rare but probably stable. Some populations in the southern portions of the range may be stable (Stewart pers. comm. 1993).<br/><br/>Populations tend to fluctuate. A population may appear abundant in a locality for a time and then be essentially absent (Shute pers. comm. 1994).",Decreasing,"The historical range included the Mississippi River basin, from Wisconsin (Becker 1983) and southwestern Minnesota and the Wabash River, Indiana, south to southeastern Oklahoma (Miller and Robison 2004), northern Louisiana, southern Mississippi (Ross 2001), Gulf Slope in the Escambia, Mobile Basin, Pascagoula, and Pearl River drainages, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi (Ross 2001, Boschung and Mayden 2004, Page and Burr 2011). The species is now absent from much of the former range, including almost all of the northeastern portion of the range in Indiana and Illinois (Smith 1979), and it has apparently disappeared from much of the upper Mississippi River basin.

For example, extended drought may extirpate a population. and impoundments may block recolonization pathways from potential source populations in mainstem rivers (Kelch 1994). Also, existing habitat fragments may be too small to support successful spawning and development (e.g., see Bonner and Wilde 2000). When impoundments are numerous, Sturgeon Chub eggs and fry may become entrained in reservoirs and encounter heavy predation (Rahel and Thel 2004).

This species requires stretches of river characterized by rocky substrate (Williams 1998). Dams and impoundments are definite barriers to dispersal (J. D. Williams pers. comm. 1998). Any significant amount of urban development surrounding rivers in which the species occurs poses hazards, especially in terms of reducing water volume and causing thermal and chemical pollution. Eggs are laid in a saucer-shaped nest made in the bottom substrate by the male.","Most of this fish's riverine habitat has been destroyed and fragmented by numerous impoundments and dredging (Williams and Burgess 1999); additional impoundments have been proposed. Pollution and siltation have degraded habitat in the Chipola River, and there has been little effort to control or reduce the impact of these contaminants (Williams and Burgess 1999). The area below Jim Woodruff Dam in the Apalachicola River is subject to dredging for navigation, and this area also has irregular flows associated with power generation, flood control, and lock operation (Williams and Burgess 1999). Dam and impoundments have eliminated riverine habitat or changed it to a cold water system in the mainstem Chattahoochee River (Williams and Burgess 1999). Dakin <em>et al</em>. (2007) found that two dams in Georgia limited downstream bass dispersal and eliminated upstream dispersal. Some isolated populations could be in danger of suffering from the effects of genetic drift and inbreeding (Dakin <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Hybridization of Shoal Bass with other bass species, especially Spotted Bass, is suspected to be occurring in the Chattahoochee River below Morgan Falls Dam and is of concern to resource managers (C. Martin pers. comm. cited by Dakin <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/><br/>In Florida, populations have been greatly reduced by siltation of habitat and by dam construction. Removal of limestone shoals undoubtedly reduced the Apalachicola River population, where the Shoal Bass is now uncommon (Florida Natural Areas Inventory).","This species is native to three major river drainages, wherein Williams and Burgess (1999) mapped 50 sites (not necessarily all representing extant populations)--suitable habitat has been eliminated by 15 large impoundments within this range.

Meat is sold in natura, or as ""mixira"" or subproducts such as sausage. The mixira, which is the meat preserved in its own fat, is one of the products that prolongs the pressure on the species, since it commands a high price.</p>  <p>Take estimates are available only for a few sites where conservation and research projects are taking place.

These events have been documented in all Amazonian Manatee range countries (Reeves<em> et al. </em>1996, Orozco 2001, Franzini 2008, Souza 2015), and this is now a major threat for the species (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>When calves survive drowning in nets, they may be kept alive for later sale<span lang=""EN-US""> as pets, kept in pools or areas close to water bodies, and sold or given to influential persons. The number of rescued calves every year has been increasing, but the number recorded represents a small sample of occurrences in the Amazon.</p>  <p>Between 2008 and 2010, in the Brazilian state of Pará, 28 stranded Manatees were rescued, of which only one was an adult (Sousa <em>et al. </em>2010). An important threat in Pará is the use of fishing corrals, as they are usually built over submerged aquatic vegetation beds, where Manatees feed, and have already trapped a Manatee (M. Sousa, pers. com. 2016).</p>  <p>Presently, several institutions in Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Centro de Pesquisa e Preservação de Mamíferos Aquáticos, Mamirauá Institute and Zoofit) care for over 150 Manatees in captivity, mostly orphans. Between 2005 and 2015, INPA received an average of 10 calves per year. Of the 98 animals rescued during this period, 30% were accidentally caught in fishing nets (D. Souza pers. obs).

Since 2011 &#160;the Centro released and monitored 11 of those rehabilitated animals (Landeo and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Velásquez Varela <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>  <p><strong>Habitat alteration and disturbance</strong></p>  <p>Other anthropogenic actions have resulted in pollution, loss, alteration, degradation and fragmentation of habitats used by the Amazonian Manatee (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). </p>  <p>Changes in the aquatic environment as habitat degradation due to deforestation, pollution, contamination of the rivers by mercury for the gold exploration (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 2000), pesticides and heavy metals from agricultural waste and oil spills are potential hazards to the Manatee´s food supply (Rosas <em>et al. </em>1991). These elements are absorbed by aquatic weeds and may directly affect the staple diet of the species (Rosas 1994). Roots of floating and rooted aquatic plants (<em>Paspalum, Eicchornia, Salvinia</em>) have been shown to be important methylation sites (Guimarães <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;Over 300 dams are planned for the Amazon (Winemiller <em>et al. </em>2016), two of which are mega-enterprises in Brazil (Madeira and Xingu rivers). The building of dams can interfere with habitat quality, altering water speed, nutrient load and dynamics of macrophyte production (Junk and Nunes de Mello 1987). Brazil has extensive plans for navigation (Fearnside 2001, Brazil, PR, 2011) with dams allowing the opening of the waterway in the Tapajos river (Fearnside 2015) planned for soy transport, giving access to the Amazon river and the Atlantic ocean (Brazil, PR 2011, Millikan 2011).&#160;Amazonian Manatees are very sensitive to noise, and intense boat traffic on the Amazonian rivers can affect their behaviour and habitat use.</p>  <p>Oil spills may be a particular problem in Ecuador (Brice <em>et al. </em>2011, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013, Brice 2014), where oil exploitation has been permitted in important refuges for the species (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013). The use of fertilizers and weed control products in extensive monocultures (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013), incidental captures in fishing nets, the use of dynamite, the increasing use of motorized boats including in the Cuyabeno and Jatuncocha systems where there are nature tourism activities (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, b) are additional threats in Ecuador.</p>  <p>On the Peru-Colombia border, wood extraction activities are clogging lakes and stopping normal migrations of Manatees in the Atacuari area (S.

Analysis of feeding patches, direct sightings of <em>T. inunguis</em> and interview surveys have been used to try to estimate population numbers with limited results, due to opportunistic sightings and small samples without standardized effort. Traditional mark-recapture studies are not appropriate due to the species’ secretive nature. More recently there have been efforts to estimate populations with the use of rotary or side-scan sonars, but still with inconclusive results (Brice 2014, Francisco <em>et al.</em> 2015), which hinders the development of conservation strategies for the species. Magor empirically estimated a minimum population of 10,000 Amazonian Manatees for the Amazon basin (Husar 1977). Based on the analysis of mtDNA control region, Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>(2005) suggested a genetic estimate of the effective female population size of <em>T. inunguis</em> of approximately 455,000 individuals, indicative of a recent large population size. Genetic studies do not show a population structure throughout the region (Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p><p>In Colombia, due to conservation efforts with local communities, a reduction in hunting levels and an apparent increase in&#160;Amazonian&#160;Manatee population in specific sites has been noted in the last few years. In the Colombian Amazon, the population may have stabilized, but hunting continues on the Peruvian side of the river and this affects the Colombian population. During 2010-2015, Natütama registered 3 to 4 new calves every year in Colombia. Fishermen insist that there are more Manatees now, mainly because they see groups of 7 to 10 Manatees more often (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). Systematic monitoring with former Manatee hunters recorded 364 sightings around Puerto Nariño in 2014, including five different calves (<span lang=""EN-US"">Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;</span><em>et a</em><em>l. </em>2015).</p><p>A study conducted 1996-1999 in Cuyabeno Reserve (Ecuador) contradicted Timm <em>et al.</em>'s<em>&#160;</em>(1986) prediction of extinction in 10 years. However, relative abundance in Cuyabeno River was 0.01 animal / h effort and 0.007 animal / h effort in Lagartococha River. A total 40-49 animals were sighted in the Cuyabeno Reserve between 1996 and 1998, where they are considered rare (Denkinger 2010). The use of sonar produced estimates ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 individuals / 10 km in three sites (Parque Nacional Yasuni, Lagartococha and Cocaya lake systems); no animals were detected in 58 km of the Cuyabeno lagoon system (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Brice (2014), using side-scan sonar observed 24 individuals in 70 hours of sampling in the same region. In Ecuador the species is considered Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN criteria C2a(i), which indicates an estimated population of less than 250 mature individuals, and no subpopulation with 50 mature individuals (IUCN 2001).</p><p>Guzmán (2014), also using a side scan sonar, recorded 14 Manatees in 65 km of rivers and lagoons, or 2.15 ind / 10 km in the Lagartococha river, on border Peru-Ecuador, an area partially surveyed by Utreras <em>et al. </em>(2013). Bodmer <em>et al. </em>(2006) believed the population in the Pacaya Samiria Reserve was stable due to a slight increase in counts between 2003 and 2006. However, Soto (2007) points out that the estimation method has not yet been proven.</p><p>In some sustainable development reserves (SDR) in Brazilian Amazon, hunting has been decreasing over the recent years. This is probably a reflection of the conservation actions that have occurred in the region, and the lack of interest among young fishermen for hunting the Manatee. The frequent records of sightings of adults and females with calves during the rainy and dry seasons in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Souza 2015) suggest that populations of <em>T. inunguis</em> may be stable or increasing in these regions.</p><p>Sixty two per cent&#160;of hunters interviewed by Calvimontes (2009) in Amanã SDR (Brazil) believed the population is decreasing, although they attribute this to Manatees having moved away (due to habitat alterations and increasing levels of noise) rather than hunting. Calvimontes also reported that most hunters are turning into farmers, which should decrease the pressure on the species.&#160;Seventy three&#160;per cent of interviewees in the Belém region (mouth of the Amazon) considered the Manatee population is decreasing, due to hunting, pollution, boat traffic and noise (Miranda 2014). Half of the respondents in Franzini <em>et al.</em>'s&#160;(2013) study believed Manatee numbers are declining.</p><p>Seventy&#160;per cent&#160;of interviewees in the Ucayali region of Peru believed the population is decreasing (Silva <em>et al. </em>2014). In a preliminary survey of Manatees in the Lagartococha region, in 6.9 km of canoe transects Hidalgo (2010) observed 16 Manatees and 25 feeding patches, which lead him to evaluate that Manatees in the Lagartococha river basin may be stable due to the almost null human presence.</p><p>The progressive increase in the number of young calves arriving at rehabilitation centres in Brazil in the past five years has also led several researchers to suspect that the species may be undergoing some recovery, or that the increase is simply a reflection of the awareness campaigns implemented, with a concomitant increase in the number of rescued calves (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005). Alternatively, it may also suggest that calf takes are on the rise.</p><p>Although Manatees are widespread through a large area, there is a high level of uncertainty about population size, as no reliable method for determining abundance has been defined so far. Whatever the current population size, the overall population trend is most likely to be decreasing, given the species’ slow reproduction (sirenian populations grow at an annual rate of approximately 5-6%; Marsh<em> et al. </em>2004, 2011) and levels of exploitation (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 1992). In summary, although the population may be stabilizing in some parts of the Amazon region due to local awareness building and other conservation efforts, the overall trend is of a decreasing population.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Amazonian Manatees occur in northern South America, and are endemic to the Amazon Basin. Amazonian Manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, in river and lake systems, from the headwaters, in Colombia (Domning 1981), Ecuador (Timm <em>et al. </em>1986) and Peru (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1996) to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the Marajó Island) in Brazil (Best and Teixeira 1982, Miranda 2014) over an estimated seven million square kilometres. However, they are patchily distributed, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 km² (Junk 1997), but are limited by troubled waters (rapids and falls) and aquatic vegetation (Best 1983).</p>  <p>In Ecuador most records are from the extreme northeast, below 250 m altitude. From north to south there are records for the Güeppi river (tributary of Putumayo, in the border with Colombia), the Aguarico river and its Cuyabeno and Lagartococha systems, where most of the records come from (Denkinger 2010, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013) and in tributaries such as the Yanayacu, Cocaya and Zancudococha lagoon; in the Napo region they are found in the Añangu, Challuacocha and Yuturi lagoon systems, as well as in the Tiputini river and Yasuní basin, including the Jatuncocha and Tambococha lagoon systems (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a). In Peru they occur in the Loreto region in the Samiria, Pacaya, Marañón, Pastaza, Ucayali, Huallaga, Purus, Tapiche, Yarapa and Yanayacu rivers, as well as in the lower Puinahua and Iricahua rivers in the Ucayali basin; their occurrence has been mentioned for the Nanay, Orosa, Yavarí, Yaguas and Putumayo rivers, and in the Reserva&#160; Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, and in the Yanayacu-Pucate river (Silva 2010); in Colombia in the Putumayo, Amazon and lower Caquetá rivers; in Brazil they occur in most major river basins such as Solimões, Japurá, Juruá, Purus, Negro and Tapajós.</p>  <p>Although there are no records in the Guyana, the species may occasionally penetrate into southern Guiana close to the boundary with Brazil (Bertram and Bertram 1963). This possibility is enhanced by a Manatee rescue done by INPA in Takutu River border Brazil and Guyana (D. Souza pers. obs).</p>","<p>The historical main use of <em>T. inunguis</em> was to obtain oil, skin and meat (Domning 1982). In remote areas of the Brazilian Amazon, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 Manatees were killed between 1935 and 1954, not counting subsistence hunting (Best 1983, Rosas and Pimentel 2001), which still persists in modern times.</p><p>  </p><p>Currently, the main use of the species is for food. Manatee meat is highly valued, but all the other products are used as well (fat and skin are used in cooking and as medicine, bones are turned into utilitarian pieces and charms, and the skin produces very resistant leather). Medicinal uses are attributed to the fat being rubbed on the affected area (rheumatism and paralysis) and skin (helping the healing process of wounds and infections) (Miranda 2014).

44199757,4162,Cephalorhynchus hectori,Endangered,A4d,2013,2008-07-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is considered to be Endangered A4d due to an ongoing and projected decline of greater than 50% over 3 generations (approx. 39 years, Slooten <em>et al</em>. 2000) considering both the past and the future. It is also important to consider that although its extent of occurrence and area of occupancy likely exceed the thresholds for criteria B1, B2 and D2, Hector’s Dolphin has the most limited range of any marine cetacean other than the Vaquita (<em>Phocoena sinus</em>). In a population viability analysis, the estimated rate of decline was 74% over 3 generations where the time period under consideration was from 1970-2009 (Slooten 2007). The main cause of population decline is ongoing bycatch in fisheries.","The habits and biology of Hector's dolphin have been well studied in the last couple of decades, and this is undoubtedly the best-known species of the genus (Dawson 2002). It is found in shallow coastal waters, almost always within about 15 km of shore and &lt;100 m deep, strongly concentrated in shallow, turbid waters close to shore in summer months and dispersing more widely in winter (Slooten <em>et al</em>. 2006a). Photo-identification studies have demonstrated that at least some individuals are resident in small areas (about 30 km of coastline) year-round (Slooten <em>et al</em>. 1993). No two sightings of an individual have been more than 106 km apart (Bräger <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/><br/>Hector's dolphins feed on several species of small fish and squid (Dawson 2002). The diet is more varied on the east coast of the South Island (8 species make up 80% of the diet) than on the west coast (only 4 species make up 80%).","Hector’s dolphin faces serious pressures from human activities given its limited coastal distribution. The main threat to the species in general is entanglement in gillnets (Dawson 1991; Slooten and Lad 1991; Dawson and Slooten 1993; Martien <em>et al</em>. 1999; Secchi 2006; Slooten 2007; DOC and Mfish 2007), with trawl fisheries also causing some mortality. Amateur gillnetting (as opposed to commercial gillnetting) is a significant part of the problem (Dawson and Slooten 2005). Sixty percent of all dead Hector’s dolphins for which cause of death could be determined, had died as a result of gillnet entanglement (DOC and Mfish 2007). Risk analyses for Hector’s and Maui’s dolphins indicate that recent levels of mortality are unsustainable (Slooten and Lad 1991; Martien <em>et al</em>. 1999; Slooten <em>et al</em>. 2000; Burkhart and Slooten 2003; Slooten 2007; DOC and Mfish 2007). This conclusion is robust to the uncertainty in abundance, mortality, and vital rates (Slooten <em>et al</em>. 2000; Slooten 2007). The most recent population viability analysis indicates continued population declines (Slooten 2007). Additional threats include pollution, disease, vessel traffic, and habitat modification (Stone and Yoshinaga 2000).","Studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA show that North Island Hector's dolphins are genetically distinct from any of the South Island subpopulations, with no overlap of maternal lineages between them (Pichler <em>et al</em>. 1998). Such differences over such a small geographic scale have not been observed in any other genetic studies of marine mammals (Dawson <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Recent surveys indicate that the South Island Hector’s dolphin populations collectively number about 7,270 individuals (CV = 15.8%) (Dawson <em>et al</em>. 2004; Gormley <em>et al</em>. 2005). The North Island subspecies is estimated to number about 111 (CV = 44%), and that population’s abundance and range appear to have been declining rapidly over the past 30 years (Slooten <em>et al</em>. 2006b; Dawson <em>et al</em>. 2001).",Decreasing,"Hector’s Dolphin is endemic to New Zealand, and it has one of the most restricted distributions of any cetacean (Dawson and Slooten 1988; Dawson 2002). They are most common off the South Island and the west coast of the North Island. There are at least three genetically separate populations in the South Island, and a single small North Island population (<em>C. h. maui</em> - Baker <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>The map shows where the species may occur based on oceanography. The species has not been recorded for all the states within the hypothetical range as shown on the map. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are included in the list of native range states.",,Marine,"The species is listed in CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/>The entire range is within New Zealand waters, and therefore national conservation measures are discussed here. The New Zealand Government has created two protected areas to promote the conservation of <em>C. hectori</em>, and it is thought that these areas have contributed to reduced mortality in recent years. The Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary was established in 1988 under the Marine Mammals Protection Act to protect Hector’s dolphins. The 1,170 km² sanctuary extends 70 nautical miles alongshore around the Banks Peninsula to the Rakaia River and out to 4 nautical miles offshore (Dawson and Slooten 2005). Its effectiveness has been compromised by the interests of sports and commercial fishermen and by the fact that the dolphins’ offshore distribution extends beyond the protected area (Dawson and Slooten 1993). At Banks Peninsula the dolphins are found further offshore than elsewhere, probably because the bathymetry there slopes more gradually. Up to 65% of the dolphins in the area occur outside the sanctuary boundaries in winter months (Slooten <em>et al</em>. 2006a). <br/><br/>The protected area established for Maui’s dolphins stretches for 210 nautical miles along the west coast of the North Island out to 4 nautical miles offshore. Although this area was closed to gillnetting under the Fisheries Act in 2003, gillnetting has continued inside the harbors, and trawling is restricted only within the first nautical mile offshore (Slooten <em>et al</em>. 2006b). <br/><br/>Discussions between the Ministry of Fisheries and Department of Conservation are currently (early 2008) underway to develop a more comprehensive management plan. A continuing high level of bycatch mortality indicates that stronger protection from entanglement in commercial and recreational fisheries is needed. Protected areas, reduced gillnet fishing effort and changes in fishing methods have been recommended as necessary to ensure the species’ long-term persistence (e.g. Martien <em>et al</em>. 1999, Burkhart and Slooten 2003, Slooten 2007; DOC and Mfish 2007). Meetings of stakeholders have concluded that fishery mortality must be reduced to zero to allow the North Island subspecies to recover (Dawson <em>et al</em>. 2001; Slooten <em>et al</em>. 2006a). Several other small subpopulations (100 individuals or fewer) are at a similar risk from entanglement (Burkhart and Slooten 2003; Slooten 2005). Recent surveys (Dawson <em>et al</em>. 2004, Slooten 2005, Slooten <em>et al</em>. 2006a,b) indicate that restricting gillnet fisheries to waters >100 m deep would have a major benefit in terms of reducing bycatch. In waters <100 m deep it would also be advisable to institute observer programs on any trawl fisheries that operate in Hector’s dolphin habitat.",Australasian,,false,false,Global
45199861,14018,Mustela lutreola,Critically Endangered,A3ce,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Critically Endangered because of&#160;an ongoing population reduction. In the last ten years (a period exceeding three generations) this is inferred to have resulted in the loss of over half the population, and it is predicted to intensify in the next&#160;ten years&#160;to result in a decline rate exceeding 80% because of habitat degradation/loss and the effects of introduced species, notably American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>.","European Mink has&#160;specialised habitat requirements. It is&#160;semi-aquatic, inhabiting densely vegetated banks of rivers, streams and sometimes, during the warm season, it may inhabit lake-banks. It is rarely found more than 100 meters away from fresh water. There are no records of its presence on sea coast.&#160;It hunts&#160;both in riparian zones and in the water for amphibians, crustaceans (crayfish), fish, small mammals, insects and birds (Sidorovich <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998, Maran <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998; Palazón <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, 2008). Females become mature for the next breeding season at 11 months (T. Maran unpublished).","The decline and extinction of the European Mink cannot be explained with a single universal factor. The main factors operating the extinction have been (1) habitat loss, (2) over-exploitation and (3) impact of alien American Mink.<br/><br/>In the European continent, human activities have resulted in large-scale alteration of landscapes, which has had a substantial impact on various habitats and their species. The European Mink has proved to be sensitive to human-induced environmental change and disturbance. As the type and extent of human influence on the species and its biotope has varied in time and between regions in Europe, also the set of factors contributing to the extinction has varied.<br/><br/>Several factors have often been acting in concert with a cumulative effect. The course of decline during the first half of 20th century in central regions of Russia is a perfect illustration of this. There, the effect of over-exploitation was noticed almost throughout the entire European Mink range (this even resulted in a moratorium of hunting in several regions and even in reinforcement efforts in Yaroslavl Region, where around 130 European Minks&#160;were translocated with the hope to recover the original, depleted population). In addition, extensive change of habitats in the mid-20th century further contributed to the decline. Thereafter, the invasion of the American Mink posed a very serious threat to the native mink. Large-scale introductions&#160;of American Mink in Russia, first planned to be conducted only in regions outside the European Mink's natural range, were ultimately performed also inside the native mink range. The reason for this was twofold: (1) the original mink has become too scarce for the fur-trapping industry, (2) higher value of American Mink fur in the market (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). In these times, the American Mink and European Mink were not regarded by the relevant authorities to be two distinct species. In the course of the introduction operation, 20,400 American Mink were released in the USSR until 1971, with around 4,000 of them being released into the range of the European Mink (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). The intentional introduction of the alien species was strongly supported by rapidly developing mink fur-farming in the Soviet Union – escapees from farms formed a continuous source of new founders for introduction. American Mink farming started in the 1920s; in 1972, 1.9 million female American Minks&#160;were kept in fur-farms and in 1973, 4.9 million minks&#160;were raised in 146 farms in the former Soviet Union (Abramov 1974). As the native mink populations were small and highly fragmented by over-exploitation and habitat loss, the fur-farm escapees, being ecologically more flexible (Maran 1991) easily invaded into the freely available ecological niche, thus making it impossible for the depleted European Mink to recover. Even more, the remaining European Mink groups were an easy target for intra-guild aggression (Maran <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991, 1998; Sidorovich <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, 2001). The magnitude of the effect of mink farming on the native mink is well illustrated by a recent study in Denmark (a country with a very high number of mink farms), which concludes that 86% of free-living American Minks&#160;are escapees from farms (Hammershoj <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/>Local key factors have changed with time also in many other countries. For instance the impact of over-hunting and/or habitat change weakened the populations and accelerated the impact of the subsequent spread of the American Mink and/or the impact of other factors. It might well be that sometimes the interchange of key factors in time and/or the concurrent impact of several factors has led to a synergistic effect on the European Mink. Further, the time from the introduction of the threat to the extinction of the species can be highly variable, resulting in the so-called extinction or decline lag (Baillie <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). This, along with the interwoven effect of numerous factors, is likely to result in situations when it is hard or, in some cases, even impossible to identify the actual causes behind the extinction process.<br/><br/>The role of the alien American Mink deserves a special attention. Its role has been noted in several reports as a secondary or unimportant factor, usually emphasising that the decline of the European Mink started before the invasion of American Mink (Lodé 2002, Lodé <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2001, Rozhnov 1992, Schubnikova 1982). Still, there are several records of local extinction of the European Mink concurrent with rapid expansion of the American Mink, e.g., in Estonia, Tver Region in Russia, Basque country (Zadorra river basin and Cantabric rivers in Bizkaia province) in Spain, Belarus (Maran 1991,&#160;Sidorovich 1991, 1993;&#160;Katchanovsky 2002, Palazón&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, 2004;&#160;Põdra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Zuberogoitia <em>et al</em>. 2013, A Gomez pers. comm, 2014). The former range of European Mink included a number of large nature reserves where habitat alteration and hunting were minimal or absent (Maran <em>et al</em>, 1998, Maran 1992). Further, although there are 'time-shot' records on the co-existence of the two mink species, no records demonstrating long-term sympatric coexistence of the two mink species have been found. Numerous records reveal the local replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink, but no opposite events have been reported. Records on replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink are further supported by studies of behavioural interactions between the two mink species in the wild and well as in experimental conditions. All this evidences that the American Mink has played a special role in the demise of the European Mink. While most of the other agents which have been operating the extinction are relatively easy to stop by conventional conservation management, there is very little one can do to prevent the spread of the alien American Mink. This means that the presence of the American Mink in wide territories across Europe makes the efforts for species recovery a very complicated task.<br/><br/>A new complication is the rising trend for private individuals in France&#160;to keep&#160;American Mink&#160;as a pet.<br/><br/>In addition to the main factors behind the decline of European Mink populations, a number of other factors may pose local threat the remaining small populations, like hybridisation, road casualties, Aleutian disease and secondary poisoning.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation is still a serious threat especially in western populations, both in France and in Spain (mostly in Cantabric rivers).","Its range has reduced by over 85% since the mid-19th century. The remaining population is small, fragmented and declining. The most viable population in Western Europe is in the Danube Delta. The current European Mink range in Russia consists of isolated distant habitats patches of different size. These fragmented populations are scattered across western Russia, the Urals, and the northern Caucasus. The only parts of the range where the American Mink is absent are rivers in the Archangelsk Region and Komi Republic,&#160;and probably also in the Northern Caucasus. Everywhere else the populations of European Mink are vanishing or becoming increasingly fragmented and localised. The Russian population of European Mink has been estimated at about&#160;20,000 (Tumanov 2003, 2006), but this is not based on quantitative data because no large-scale census has been undertaken. Hunting bags suggest that the European Mink is rapidly becoming less abundant compared with the American Mink: for instance, in Vologda and Kostroma regions, the proportion of European Mink skins in the hunting bag of the two mink species decreased from 50–70% to 1–10% within the 5–7 years to 2006. For the whole of Russia, recent records refer only to the capture of single individuals or to local populations consisting of some tens&#160;of individuals (Skumatov and Saveljev 2006). The number of 20,000 Minks&#160;in Russia is a clear and extensive overestimate of the present population size.<br/><br/>Because of intensive American Mink control measures since 2003, the population in Spain (in the Mediterranean basin) was quite stable until 2010-2011. The main part of the population is in the Ebro river basin. Remarkable fragmentation has been observed in Cantabric rivers in the north (Basque Country). In 2011-2014, the fragmentation of European Mink population was observed also in the upper Ebro River as a result of American Mink invasion into the area (Asun Gomez &amp; Madis Põdra pers. comm. 2014). At the same time, a slight expansion of the range to south and south-east was observed in Aragon in Ebro River basin (Gomez <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The overwhelming majority of remaining populations are in decline and of low density. Therefore the size of the species's&#160;range leads to overestimation the population status. It is likely that the overall number of Mink declined more than 90% since the beginning of 20th century. Also, the presence of the American Mink in most of range fragments confuses the reports and makes the status projections to the future rather pessimistic.<br/><br/>Some national estimates of population abundance:<br/><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spain</span>:&#160;Fewer than 2,000 km of rivers occupied, probably near 500 individuals (Asun Gomez <em>et al</em>. in prep.).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">France</span>: status unknown, the latest data available date back to 2004, when the population was estimated to be around few hundred individuals.

There are around 3,500 km of canals there. European Mink is known to inhabit also the coasts of lagoons with total length of about 445 km, but will be found elsewhere. The estimated number of&#160;European Mink&#160;in the delta is 1,000-1,500 individuals.

In seven regions the species is known to be extant, and in nine regions is believed still to survive. From those only in 12 regions is&#160;European Mink expected to survive for longer than 10 years. The American Mink is now present within the whole remaining range of the European Mink, although it may be absent or very&#160;scarce&#160;in Northern Caucasus and in the north - approximately 64°–66°N, 44°–52°E (near Timanskiy kriazh, to Arctic circle).&#160;The most recent evidence of European Mink (2010-2014) comes from Krasnodar Region (2013), Tver Region (2012), Kostroma Region (2013), Vologda Region (2011) and Arkhangelsk (2014). It is believed that&#160;European Mink&#160;might still be found in Ivanovo Region, Yaroslav Region and Stavropol Region. In Arkhangelsk Region, a trail camera caught mostly European Mink in 2010, while by 2014 the majority of animals caught by the trap were already American Mink. &#160;The same applies to Komi Republic: in 2000 only European Mink was recorded, in 2011-2014 the American Mink became prevailing species.</li><li><strong>Estonia</strong>: the last wild individual was trapped in 1996. Island population establishment started in 2000 and has resulted in a small breeding population of fewer than 100 individuals in Hiiumaa Island.</li></ul>",Decreasing,"The historical range of the European Mink extended from Finland to east of the Ural Mountains, to northern Spain and the Caucasian Mountains (Novikov 1939, Heptner <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1967, Youngman 1990, Maran 2007). The relatively recent discovery of&#160;European Mink&#160;in France (1839) and in eastern Spain (1951) suggests late expansion of the species to the west (Youngman 1990, Michaux <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). However, over the last 150 years it has severely declined and been extirpated or greatly reduced over most of its former range (Maran 1999, 2007 and references therein).<br/><br/>The current range consists of a few isolated fragments: in northern Spain and western France, in the Danube delta in Romania, in Ukraine and Russia (Maran 2007 and references therein). In Estonia, the last wild individual was trapped in 1996. The&#160;establishment&#160;of an island population in Estonia&#160;started in 2000 and has resulted in a small breeding population of fewer than 100 individuals in Hiiumaa Island.&#160;The species is in decline even in its currently remaining range enclaves. Only Romania can, perhaps, be regarded as an exception. In Romania, the presence of the European Mink in Danube Delta was confirmed relatively recently (Gotea and Kranz 1999).&#160;The results of an IUCN mission in 2014 to Romania showed that the Danube delta population is clearly the most viable in the world: according to the assessment, the population in delta might be around 1,000 – 1,500 individuals. There is some information about the presence of the European Mink also in the Romanian Carpathians. In the Moscow region, the species was present in at least two locations until 1994 (Dinets 1995), but a snow-tracking survey of these locations found no European Minks in 1997 (V. Dinets pers. comm. 2015).&#160;In the Vologoda Region, considering the rapid decline of the species in the neighbouring regions and the presence of the American Mink, it is not likely that the European Mink populations will hold there for long. In the Arkhangelsk Region, a population seems to exist in the north-west of the region, which is close to the northern limit of the range, with very low abundance. The presence of the American Mink (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Neovison vison</span>) is likely to pose a serious threat to its long-term existence also there (Skumatov 2005, Maran 2007 and references therein). In 1981-1989, the European Mink was introduced to southern Kurile Islands (Kunashir, Iturup), Russia, far away from the native distribution range. This introduction was unsuccessful; no stable populations were established in these islands (A.V. Abramov pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Michaux <em>et al</em>. (2005: 2382), concerning the low genetic diversity in French and Spanish populations, speculated as follows: “The almost complete lack of variation observed in French and Spanish animals strongly indicates that very few individuals established the present-day W European population, possibly following a human introduction”. This wording has been often misread, resulting in misleading statements about an alien origin of European Mink in Spain and in France (e.g. in Clavero 2013, Carbonell 2015). As Diez-Leon <em>et al</em>. (2014) argued, the very low level of genetic diversity in western population provides no scientific ground to conclude &#160;that the European Mink is introduced by humans to Spain and France, and no other line of evidence suggests&#160;this.<br/><br/>It occurs from sea level to 1,120 m (Palazón <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).","<p>The species was largely in the fur trade during the first half of the 20th century. As of 2014, there are no data on present trade. The higher quality of farmed American Mink fur makes it highly unlikely that the trading could become an issue in European Mink conservation. Some recent illegal fur trade to neighbouring countries from Romania has stopped, because the fur-markets in these countries have crashed.&#160;It is still caught in small numbers in Russia by trappers hunting for American Mink.</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"European Mink is legally protected in all range states (Schreiber <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1989). In the Russian Federation only the Caucasian subspecies, <em>M. lutreola turovi</em>, is Red listed (Red Data book of Russian Federation 2001). At least part of the population occurs within protected areas.&#160;<br/><br/>The following conservation actions are ongoing as of in 2014:<br/><ol><li>General: conservation breeding programme in the form of European Mink EEP programme with about 250 minks&#160;in captivity is on-going since 1992.

New studies have been launched to study reproductive physiology, impact of captive conditions, options for artificial insemination, effect of behavioural personality types in mink to conservation breeding and reintroduction. There is an urgent need for species action plan in European Union for European Mink for better collaboration between different on-going conservation activities.  Clearly national and regional authorities need to increase attention and allocate sufficient and continued resources for European Mink conservation, otherwise this species will disappear soon. There is a need for large-scale coordinated efforts to secure the survival of the last small remaining populations in different areas inside of the historical range of the species, but also restoration and/or establishment of new populations is required.&#160;<br/><br/>Conservation breeding of the species needs all-European coordination so that all single-country initiatives collaborate. The current tendency for isolated one-country breeding efforts leads&#160;to ineffective use of resources and of competence, and also to the inability to reach a captive population size sufficient to maintain genetic diversity in captivity. For remaining in situ populations, the maintenance or restoration of sufficiently large areas of suitable habitats has to be secured by designation of new protected areas and improvement of management of existing protected areas. <br/><br/>The impact of the American Mink on local European Mink populations has to be monitored and controlled, and whenever possible and feasible the alien mink populations should be removed. Local authorities have to pay more attention to the effects of the American Mink on the local fauna, including the European Mink. They should support further studies and actions to mitigate the effect of alien mink to the native mink species. For example, intensive control of American Mink is on-going in Spain since 2003. More than 5,500 American Minks have been eradicated around and inside the European Mink distribution area. It is likely that without such a control of alien mink the native mink population in Spain would have vanished already (Gomez and Palazon pers. comm.). A recent boom in the mink-farm industry driven by increased market in China combined with the prohibition of mink-farming in several European countries has resulted in increasing interest in establishment of mink farms including in sites in or close to remaining European Mink areas, such as in Spain and in Romania.<br/><br/>For French and Spanish wild populations which appear to be highly inbred, further research needs to be carried out to identify whether these seemingly genetically highly uniform populations suffer from inbreeding depression. The introduction of individuals from <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ</span> stock from genetically diverse eastern populations has to be considered as a potential conservation measure, if further research confirms the need for this. In addition to genetic studies, comparative studies on ecology and behaviour of the disjunct mink populations (Spanish/French, Romanian and eastern European) should also be conducted to support the findings of genetic studies. The <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ </span>conservation breeding programme has to be enhanced and promoted, as it guarantees the survival of the species in case <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in situ</span> efforts temporarily fail. It also provides opportunities for the restoration of already vanished wild populations and reinforcement of existing populations whenever needed. Better coordination between different <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ex situ</span> actions over political borders is needed. Special studies have to be conducted to find the most feasible way how to incorporate the western low-variability populations into the joint programme with the high-diversity eastern population.&#160; <br/><br/>There is also a need for developing an all-European conservation breeding programme with secured long-term funding. Further studies are needed about the current&#160;status of the European Mink in Romania, Russia,&#160;Ukraine and elsewhere in the eastern part of Europe.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45224420,2061,Arctocephalus townsendi,Least Concern,,2015,2014-10-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The range of Guadalupe Fur Seals was considerably reduced by exploitation. Previously, they occupied an area from the San Benito Archipelago to the islands in southern California. Past abundance estimates range from 100,000 to 200,000 animals. In the 1950s they numbered 200-500, but numbers have increased steadily to around 20,000 in 2010. The relatively small population, limited area of occupancy, and reduced genetic variability of this species, make them vulnerable to a variety of threats. However, they do not qualify for threatened listing under any IUCN criteria and are therefore listed as Least Concern.","Guadalupe Fur Seals are sexually dimorphic, with territorial males being 3.8 to 4 times larger than adult females (Gallo-Reynoso and Figueroa-Carranza 1996). Fourteen adult females averaged 148.2 cm standard length (tip of nose to tip of tail) and their weight averaged 49.1 kg. Twelve territorial males averaged 219 cm (Gallo-Reynoso and Figueroa-Carranza 1996), and males averaging 180 cm weighed 160-170 kg (Bonner 1994).<br/><br/>Guadalupe Fur Seals are polygynous, with males establishing territories that are occupied by a small number of females (Peterson et al. 1968). Pups are born from mid-June to August with a median birth date of 21 June (Wickens and York 1997). From 1991 to 1993 the median peak pupping date was 3 July at Guadalupe Islands (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). For up to 31 days, males defend their territory with vocalizations, displays, and mutual displays with neighbouring bulls (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). Guadalupe Fur Seals prefer shores with abundant large rocks and lava blocks, often at the base of large cliffs.They inhabit caves and recesses, which provide protection and cooler temperatures, especially during the warm breeding season. This segregates them from other pinniped species (Peterson <em>et al</em>. 1968, Pierson 1987, García-Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Oestrus occurs 5-10 days after a female gives birth, and females can leave for their first foraging trip right after mating, or stay at the colony for a few days before departing (Peterson <em>et al</em>. 1968, Pierson 1987, Gallo-Reynoso 1994). Foraging and attendance patterns are not well-known but the limited information from four instrumented adult females indicates they travel a total mean distance of 2,375 km. The average distance to the feeding grounds was 444 km and the duration of feeding trips averaged 14.4 days. Diving records for one animal showed a deepest dive of 82 m (Gallo-Reynoso <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Feeding habits are poorly known, particularly for the main colony on Guadalupe Island where the few scats samples analysed to date included remains of the cephalopods <em>Onychoteutis banksi</em>, <em>Eucleoteuthis luminosa</em>, and <em>Dosidicus gigas</em>, as well as several fish, including <em>Scomber japonicus</em>, <em>Auxis thazard</em>, and <em>Sardinops sagax</em> (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). A study conducted during 2000-2001 on the San Benito Islands examined 218 Guadalupe Fur Seal scat samples in which 95.6% of the prey were cephalopod beaks including mostly <em>Loligo opalescens</em> and in lesser abundance <em>Gonatus</em> sp. and <em>Dosidicus gigas</em>. The few fish remains (4.4%) identified were mostly from <em>Merluccius productus</em>, <em>Engraulis mordax</em> and <em>Sardinops sagax</em> (Aurioles-Gamboa and Camacho-Ríos 2007). A similar diet was described in another study conducted during the summer of 2007 (50 scats) and winter of 2008 (56 scats) with the squid <em>Loligo opalescens</em> and <em>Gonatus</em> sp., making up 74% of the summer diet. In winter, these two squid species, along with <em>Dosidicus gigas</em> composed 87% of the prey. The fish <em>Argentina sialis</em>, <em>Merluccius productus</em>, and <em>Sebastes</em> spp. complemented the Guadalupe Fur Seal diet in both seasons (Pablo-Rodríguez 2009). Esperón-Rodríguez and Gallo-Reynoso (2013) and Gallo-Reynoso and Esperón-Rodríguez (2013) also found <em>Loligo opalescens</em> as the main summer prey for juveniles and subadult males at San Benito Islands.&#160; <br/><br/>Contents of faeces and gastrointestinal tracts from several individuals stranded off the coast of northern California near Farallon Island included <em>Loligo opalescens</em>, <em>Gonatopsis</em> sp., <em>Onychoteuthis borealis japonica</em>, as well as several fish species: <em>Citharichthys sordidus</em>, <em>Lampanyctus</em> sp., <em>Protomyctophum</em> sp., and <em>Scopelogadus</em> sp. (Hanni et al. 1997).<br/><br/>Killer Whales and Sharks, particularly Great White Sharks, are regularly seen around Guadalupe Island during the summer, and are most likely predators of Guadalupe Fur Seals. These two predators are rarely seen around the San Benito Islands.","Although the Guadalupe Fur Seal population is steadily growing, the species is still at risk because the total population remains relatively low and nearly all pup production occurs on only one island. Since the species passed through a genetic bottleneck and recovered from a very small number of individuals, genetic diversity was suspected to be low. Bernardi <em>et al</em>. (1998) tested both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in a sample of 36 individuals finding high levels of genetic variability relative to other species that experienced similar bottlenecks. However, when pre-bottleneck material is compared to material from animals in the surviving population, a significant loss of genetic variability is evident (Weber <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>The feeding grounds of the species include the region around Guadalupe Island and the San Benito Islands and the lower part of the California Current. This region is influenced by human population centres with contaminant runoff, extensive oil tanker traffic, and offshore oil extraction activity in southern California. Like all fur seals, Guadalupe Fur Seals are vulnerable to oil spills because of their dependence on their thick pelage for thermoregulation.&#160;<br/><br/>El Niño events may cause negative effects on the Guadalupe Fur Seal population dynamics due to high pup mortality caused by storms and hurricanes (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). Most of the temperate Eastern Pacific pinnipeds are exposed in some degree to deleterious effects of the El Niño (Trillmich and Ono 1991, Gerber and Hilborn 2001). Guadalupe Fur Seals share most of their haul-out and breeding sites with California Sea Lions, which have suffered from viral disease outbreaks in the past, and could be a vector for the transmission of diseases from terrestrial sources to Guadalupe Fur Seals. Additionally, human populations on the Guadalupe and San Benito Islands have the potential to introduce exotic fauna and diseases.<br/><br/>No conflicts with commercial fisheries are apparent at present time, although gillnet and set-net fisheries probably take some animals, as is likely also the case for entanglement in marine debris. There is a possibility for negative interactions between Guadalupe Fur Seals and Lobster fishermen particularly if the Fur Seal population continues to increase.","Guadalupe Fur Seals were abundant prior to seal exploitation, when they were likely the most abundant pinniped species on the islands of southern California (Walker and Craig 1979). Sealers harvesting Fur Seals in California and Mexico did not distinguish between Northern and Guadalupe Fur Seals in their harvest records, which makes it difficult to reconstruct former populations and geographic ranges. However, at least 52,000 Guadalupe Fur Seals were killed on several islands off the Pacific coasts of Mexico and the United States from the late 1700s to 1848, and the last few were harvested in Mexican waters in the late 1800s (Townsend 1931).<br/><br/>The species has recovered from near extinction when only a few dozen animals remained. Recent censuses (2008-2010) indicate that the population on Guadalupe Island numbers approximately 17,581 individuals. Another 2,503 individuals were estimated at San Benito Islands during the same years (García-Capitanachi 2011), bringing the minimum population size to 20,084. The species' overall population is slowly increasing and spreading with minor, temporary, decreases associated with El Niño events. The population clearly continues to be only a small fraction of the population size reached prior to the seal exploitation period, which has been estimated at around 200,000 (Hubbs 1979).&#160;<br/><br/>For most of the 20th century, the species only inhabited Guadalupe Island and showed a population growth of 13.7% annually from 1955 to 1993 (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). In 1949 an emaciated adult male was sighted at San Nicolas Island (Bartholomew 1950), followed by more frequent observations on other islands in southern California since 1969 (Seagars 1984, Stewart 1981, Stewart <em>et al.</em> 1987) including a territorial male and female with a pup at San Miguel Island (Melin and DeLong 1999). In 1997, a small group was discovered at the former rookery on the San Benito Islands, southwest of Guadalupe Island, near the Baja California coast. The numbers on the San Benito Islands for 2010-2011 have increased to around 3,000 individuals, but few pups are born there, indicating that this colony is mostly the result of immigration from the Guadalupe Island (Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>From 1991 to 1993, the breeding population on Guadalupe Island was composed of 35.7% adult females, 22.1% pups, 9.7% juveniles, 26.4% adult males, 4.7% sub-adult males and 1.3% undetermined individuals (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). &#160;During the 2007 and 2008 breeding seasons, the San Benito Islands population structure was 23.4-34.5% adult females, 0.4% pups, 18.6-29.1% juveniles, 6.2-12.6% sub-adult males, 23.4-34.5% adult males and a large proportion of undetermined (33.3-39.2%) individuals (Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Sexual maturity is attained by about 4-5 years of age and maximum longevity is approximately 20 years. Age-structure data are not available for the Guadalupe Fur Seal population, thus parameters like generation time are not reliable.",Increasing,"The distribution of the Guadalupe Fur Seal is centred on Guadalupe Island (Fleischer 1987, Gallo-Reynoso 1994, Belcher and Lee 2002, Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al</em>. 2010). A small breeding colony was discovered on the east side of the easternmost part of the San Benito Islands in 1997 (Maravilla and Lowry 1999); now animals are present and spreading on all three San Benito Islands (Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al</em>. 2010, García-Capitanachi 2011, Esperón-Rodríguez and Gallo-Reynoso 2012). Since the 1980s, Guadalupe Fur Seals have been observed more frequently on San Miguel Island and other southern California islands including, the Farallon Islands off the coast of northern California (Bartholomew 1950, Stewart 1981, Stewart <em>et al</em>. 1987, Stewart <em>et al</em>. 1992, Hanni <em>et al</em>. 1997). Guadalupe Fur Seal vagrants have been sighted and recorded stranded in California, Oregon, and Washington, USA, particularly during El Niño years (Hanni <em>et al</em>. 1997, Etnier 2002). Since 2009, around 50 Guadalupe Fur Seals have been found on the beaches along the west coast of Magdalena Island, located around 25ºN, approximately 500 km south of the San Benito Islands (Aurioles, unpublished data). The species' distribution at sea is poorly known, but records from a few satellite-tracked adult females suggest they may travel several hundred kilometres during feeding trips (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). Guadalupe Fur Seals have been sighted regularly in the Gulf of California, Mexico (Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al</em>. 1999) at the southern extent of their distribution.<br/><br/>Guadalupe Fur Seals were the most frequently encountered pinniped in archaeological deposits on the San Miguel Island prior to the seal exploitation period (Walker and Craig 1979). Indeed, its abundance in deposits dating from 3,500 years to the present, between 32°N and 50°N latitude, suggests that the highest density of sites and individuals occurred on the Channel Islands and southern parts of the mainland (34-36°N), with densities declining north of Point Conception (Rick <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Guadalupe Fur Seals were hunted to near to extinction by the late 19th century. There were no reports of the species until 1926, after which all animals that could be found were harvested for fur with the last reported kill in 1928. Although the species was declared extinct for a second time, scattered, unconfirmed reports during the 1930s raised suspicions that Guadalupe Fur Seals might have survived. In 1954 expedition to Guadalupe Island confirmed the species' survival (Hubbs 1956) and the Mexican government fully protected the species.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Guadalupe Fur Seal and its habitat are protected by the Mexican government and tourist visits to breeding islands are regulated and very limited. In the United States, the species is protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Fish and Game Code of the State of California. The Guadalupe Fur Seal was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1985, which automatically assigned the species the status of depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The West Ice stock has been surveyed four times in the last 15 years, most recently in 2012, and it has been declining at a rate of 3.7%/year. The stock in Canadian waters increased during the 1980s and 1990s but the rate of increase was declining over time and with no surveys since 2005 there is no way to know the recent or current trend. However, with changing sea ice conditions reducing the pack ice habitat needed by all Hooded Seals for pupping and molting, there is good reason to believe that numbers in all stocks might be declining. Assuming that the entire population will decline at 3.7%/year (which is the West Ice rate of decline currently), the three generation reduction would be 75% which qualifies Hooded Seals for listing as Endangered under criterion A3c. Even if the overall rate of decline were only 1%/year the three generation decline would be 32%, which would qualify Hooded Seals as being Vulnerable. Given that the population is still relatively large, and there are uncertainties about the rate of future decline we opt for the more modest listing of Vulnerable under criterion A3c for Hooded Seals at this time.","Hooded Seals are a sexually dimorphic ice-breeding pinniped. Adult males average 2.5 m in length and weigh 300 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986), with large animals reaching over 400 kg (Kovacs 2002). Adult females are smaller, averaging 2.2 m and 160 kg, but can reach 300 kg. Pups are born at approximately 1 m in length and 24 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals pup on pack ice late in the spring season, when the pack is already breaking up. The breeding season for this polygynous species is very short, usually lasting only about 2.5 weeks. Males attend a single female and her pup at a time, sequentially re-establishing with a new female if the male is competitively successful (Kovacs 1990). Mating takes place in the water (Boness <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1988). Hooded Seals have the shortest lactation period of any mammal, with most pups nursing for only four days (Bowen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985). Pups weigh an average of 48 kg at weaning, and on average double their birth mass in the short nursing period (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Lydersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1997). The short reproductive period is energetically advantageous to both males and females, with relative losses in body mass being small for both sexes compared to other phocid Seals (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Kovacs <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lydersen and Kovacs 1999).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals moult in July, with each breeding stock congregating on sea ice north of their respective whelping areas. If mixing does occur, the degree to which it takes place is unknown. Following the moulting period they disperse in the North Atlantic (Folkow and Blix 1999, Folkow <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Kovacs <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a). Apart from the breeding and moulting periods when Hooded Seals form loose aggregations in specific areas, they are thought to live quite solitary lives. However, little is known about them outside those periods. Groups of females and young animals have been seen at the northern ice edge in summer, but it is not known whether the groups are socially facilitated or solely the result of concentrations of prey. Hooded Seal longevity is 25-30 years (Kovacs 2002).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals are very capable divers that spend extensive periods at sea without hauling out (e.g., Folkow and Blix 1999, Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Most of their dives are from 100-600 m in depth and last 5-25 minutes, however, very deep dives to over 1,000 m and dives lasting almost an hour have been recorded (Folkow <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lydersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpubl. data). Similar to Elephant Seals, Hooded Seals perform drift dives, in which buoyancy controls their movements through the water column (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Hooded Seals feed on a wide variety of fish and invertebrates, including species that occur throughout the water column (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Examples of typical prey are pelagic Amphipods (<em>Parathemisto </em>sp.), Greenland Halibut, members of the Cod family such as Polar and Atlantic Cod, Redfishes, Sand Eels, Herring, Capelin, Squid (e.g., <em>Gonatus fabricii</em>), and Shrimp (Haug <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, 2007).<br/><br/>A recent study of foraging habitat selection by Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic documented significantly different preferences by adult males and females with the former occupying areas with complex seabed relief while the latter concentrated their foraging search effort along shelf areas (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Productivity (measured as chlorophyll a) was the most important single factor influencing habitat selection across all age groups.<br/><br/>Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known Hooded Seal predators (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). These predators are thought to be having increased impacts on Hooded Seals in the West Ice following the deterioration of breeding ice used by this species (Foote <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Øigård <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014); Greenland Sharks also take at least young Hooded Seals (Leclerc <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).","By-catch of Hooded Seals in coastal net fisheries has been reported from the USA, from trawl fisheries off Norway and Newfoundland, and from salmon drift nets used off Greenland (Woodley and Lavigne 1991, Reeves <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1992, Waring <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). Competition for food with commercial fisheries and other predators has been suggested as a factor that may limit population growth or lead to declines of Hooded Seals (Reijnders <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993). This factor may be playing a role in the continuing decline of Hooded Seals in the Northeast Atlantic given that abundance of Redfish, which are favoured prey of Hooded Seals, has declined in the late 1990s in both the Barents and Norwegian Seas due to excessive fishing pressure. No targeted catch is allowed for some Redfish species in this region and juvenile fish are being protected to attempt to promote recovery (ICES 2013b).<br/><br/>Impacts of oil spills on Hooded Seals have not been reported; however as an ice breeding species, they might be at risk of mortality from spills during the pupping season when newborn and newly weaned pups could be fouled (St. Aubin 1990). Hooded Seals have been exposed to <em>Morbillivirus </em>(Duignan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997), but are not known to have suffered fatalities during the mass die-offs of Harbour Seals in European waters from phocine distemper virus in 1998 and 2002. Subsequent testing revealed antibodies to the virus in 18-24% percent of the Hooded Seals sampled indicating exposure to the virus (Harkonen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Hooded Seals in the northeast Atlantic have high organohalogen contaminant burdens that are thought to be impacting thyroid homeostasis (Villanger <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>The Hooded Seal is a pack ice species, and is dependent on ice as a substrate for pupping, moulting, and resting and as such is vulnerable to reduction in extent or timing of pack ice formation and retreat (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Johnston <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Learmonth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). The very short, intense breeding season of Hooded Seals that is timed right at the end of the sea ice season, has likely put them at heightened risk of impacts arising from changes in the duration of the sea ice season (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, 2012; Stenson and Hammill 2014). The Barents Sea region’s sea ice cover is declining at twice the rate of other arctic areas with a shortening of &gt;20 weeks having taken place in the last few decades (Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015), so it is not surprising that the West Ice stock is the first to be heavily impacted.<br/><br/>The productivity of the ice-edge ecosystem is also dependent on the dynamics and seasonality of arctic ice, and alterations to the cycle of formation and retreat of the ice could be having negative effects on important Hooded Seal prey. For example, Polar cod abundance has declined markedly in the last decade in the Barents Region within a broad, rapid “borealization” of the fish community in this sector of the Arctic (Fossheim <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Decreases in sea ice cover could also lead to more shipping and development of extraction based industries in the Arctic (gas, oil, mining, etc.) which in turn could negatively affect Hooded Seals through increased exposure to contaminants and pollution, increased disturbance, and increased risk of shipping accidents and spills (Pagnan 2000).<br/><br/>Predation by Polar Bears is thought to be an increasing issue of concern with respect to the West Ice stock’s conservation status. Polar Bear diets have shown an increase in Hooded Seal consumption by 9.5% per decade since the mid-1980s in East Greenland along with a concomitant decrease in the consumption of Ringed Seals (McKinney <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). These changes are likely primarily due to changes in sea ice distribution and extent (but could also reflect a declining Ringed Seal population).","Hooded Seal populations are usually assessed based on aerial survey counts of pups at whelping areas in the pack ice, combined with population models to extrapolate to total population size. In Canadian waters, pup production estimates for the Front have been: 1978—26,000 (Winters and Bergflodt 1978); 1984—62,400 (Bowen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987); 1985—61,400 (Hay <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1985); 1990—83,100 (Hammill <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1992); and 2005—107,013 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). These figures indicate an increase of 5.2%/year during 1978-2005, 2.6%/year during 1984-2005, and 1.7%/year during 1990-2005. Pup production estimates for Gulf region in Canada have been: 1991—2,006 (Hammill <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1992); 1998/99—2,000 (ICES 2001); and 2005—6,620 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). Comparing counts in 1991 and 2005 suggests that the number of animals in the Gulf increased by 8.5%/year during that period. Only two estimates are available for Davis Strait, 19,000 pups in 1984 (Bowen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987) and 3,346 in 2005 (Hammill and Stenson 2006); this suggests a decline of 8.2%/year. Hammill and Stenson (2006, 2007) concluded that these estimates suggest a moderate increase both in pup production and population size between the mid 1980s and 2005 in the northwest Atlantic as a whole. Surveys carried out at all three whelping areas in 2005 produced an estimate of 116,900 pups born. The size of the whole population, modeled based on the pup counts, was estimated as 592,000 (Waring <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007). No more recent survey information is available for the northwest Atlantic breeding areas (ICES 2013a) and the down-turn in the number of animals in the Davis Strait in the 2005 survey is concerning, especially given its magnitude and the continued high hunting levels of this species in West Greenland.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals in the West Ice have shown, and continue to show, a declining trend. Pup production estimates have been: 1997—23,762 (ICES 2013a); 2005—15,250 (Salberg <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008); 2007—16,140 (ICES 2013a); and 2012—13,655 (Øigård <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Comparing the estimates for 1997 and 2012 indicates a population decrease of 3.7%/year and a reduction in population size of 43% in 15 years (1.2 generations using the generation time of 12.8 years calculated by Pacifici <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The most recent estimate of the total size of this population is 82,830 (SE=8,028) and models suggest a continued decline of approximately 7% per year in the coming decade (Øigård <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This stock is less than 10% of its abundance observed some 60 years ago (ICES 2013a). Overhunting was clearly involved in the collapse of this stock as quotas were being set for a population size much larger than it actually was. However, the cause of the significant, on-going decline in this population is thought to be related to climate change induced alternation of its sea ice breeding habitat and increased predation by Polar Bears and Killer Whales in the pupping areas (Øigard <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014) but prey availability might also be an issue.<br/><br/>Summing the most recent estimates for all stocks (three regions in the northwest Atlantic–2005; West Ice stock–2012) gives a total Hooded Seal population size estimate of approximately 675,000. However, with no recent surveys in Canada or Greenland this estimate cannot be considered reliable.<br/><br/>Available data show clearly that the Greenland Sea population has declined in recent years. With no surveys in the past 10 years, the trend for the northwestern stocks is unknown. Pup counts at the Front increased through until 2005, but with the rate of increase declining over time. With 15 years between surveys, it is possible that the population had peaked and started to decline before 2005. Since 2005, there have been several years with bad ice conditions when few Hooded Seals were sighted on the ice and it is not known whether any successful reproduction at all took place for the Gulf segment of the population (Stenson and Hammill 2014). Given the available data, the best estimate for the current population trend for Hooded Seals is -3.7%/year.<br/><br/>Because of their preference for heavy sea ice conditions for breeding, it is unlikely that Hooded Seals will continue to breed in their southern-most breeding areas in future. This species has been deemed one the most sensitive Arctic/subarctic marine mammal species to the impacts of climate change (Laidre <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008).",Unknown,"Hooded Seals are found at high latitudes in the North Atlantic, and seasonally they extend their range north into the Arctic Ocean. They breed on pack ice and are associated with it much of the year, though they can spend significant periods of time pelagic, without hauling out (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Folkow and Blix 1999, Anderson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Folkow <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Kovacs <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011a). There are four major pupping areas: near the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, north of Newfoundland in an area known as the Front, in central Davis Strait, and in the West Ice in the Greenland Sea near the island of Jan Mayen (Sergeant 1974). Hooded Seals sometimes wander extensively; young animals have come ashore as far south as Portugal and the Canary Islands in Europe and south into the Caribbean in the West Atlantic (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986, Rice 1998). They have also been found outside the Atlantic Region, in the North Pacific and even as far south as California (Burns and Gavin 1980, Dudley 1992, Fay 1995). Since the mid 1990s, large numbers of vagrant Hooded Seals have been found outside the Arctic in some years (Mignucci-Giannoni and Haddow 2002, Harris and Gupta 2006). Stranded Hooded Seals are increasingly common on Sable Island, Canada, and along the New England coast and in the Saint Lawrence River area, particularly in years with sparse sea ice conditions (Harris <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Lucas and Daoust 2002, Truchon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).","Hooded Seals were subjected to intense commercial hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries. Harvests were often conducted in association with Harp Seal harvests and commercial fisheries for Greenland Sharks. Norway, the Soviet Union (now Russia), Canada, and Greenland have all been involved in the commercial harvests of this species. Following World War II the hunt was primarily focused on pups because of their highly prized blue-back pelt, however, many adult females were taken while defending their pups until killing of mothers in the breeding areas was prohibited in the various areas (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988).<br/><br/>The abundance estimate for Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic is now a decade old; the last survey was conducted in 2005 (ICES 2013a), and the stock is now treated as a data-poor stock in terms of management protocols. Total allowable catch was set at 8,200 in 2007 and remained unchanged through to 2015 despite the lack of new information on stock sizes or trends in the region. However, Canadian catches are reported to be very low, some few 10s of animals per year.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals are also harvested in Greenland at a current level of a few thousand animals per year. It is assumed that most of those animals are from the northwest Atlantic breeding groups (Davis Strait, Gulf, and Front) given that most of the harvest takes place in West Greenland. However, some animals are also taken on the east coast of Greenland, and these animals are likely from the West Ice stock.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals have been harvested in the West Ice (Greenland Sea, north of Jan Mayen) for centuries. This hunt increased substantially after World War II, to levels that were clearly not sustainable. Regulatory measures were introduced in 1958 to reduce effort, and quotas were imposed in 1971 (Sergeant 1976, ICES 2006). Based on catch per unit effort analyses and mark-recapture pup production estimates it was assumed that the stock increased from the 1960s through to the 1990s at an unknown rate (Ulltang and Øien 1988). In hindsight this almost certainly was not the case (ICES 2013a). Aerial surveys in 1994 failed to produce an abundance estimate (Øritsland and Øien 1995). Recent modelling efforts suggest that a very substantial decrease in population abundance took place from the late 1940s up to the early 1980s (ICES 2006). This decline has continued through to the present and predictions suggest an ongoing decline of 7% over the coming decade (Øigård <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Total pup production in this stock was estimated to be 24,000 in 1997 and this number dropped to 15,250 in 2005 (Salberg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008) and has continued to decline to 13,655 in 2012, despite a complete cessation of commercial harvesting (Øigård <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Numerous conservation measures, international management plans, harvest quotas, agreements, and treaties have been developed for the conservation of Hooded Seals dating back to the 1870s. Molting Seals in the Denmark Strait have been protected since 1961. Harvest quotas at Jan Mayen began in 1971. Hunting was banned in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1972 and quotas were placed on the rest of the Canadian harvest beginning in 1974. A European Economic Community ban on importation on Seal products in 1985 reduced the harvest of blueback Hooded Seals through the loss of the primary market for the furs (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1992). Greenlandic hunting is not limited, and might be at levels that are not sustainable, given deteriorating breeding conditions. The northeast Atlantic stock has experienced close to a 90% decline and the decline is ongoing. Population information for the northwest Atlantic is a decade old, leaving trends unknown for this segment of the population.<br/><br/>Based on population size, geographic range, habitat specificity, diet diversity, migration, site fidelity, sensitivity to changes in sea ice, sensitivity to changes in the trophic web, and maximum population growth potential Hooded Seals were rated to be among the top three arctic marine mammal species in terms of sensitivity to climate change (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008). This species should be re-evaluated as soon as new data are available for Canada and Greenland.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The major causes for reduction based on observed and potential levels of bycatch in gillnet and trap fisheries are known and management measures have been introduced to mitigate these impacts in parts of the species range, but declines have not ceased. Declines for four subpopulations range from 46% to 87% over three generations, and declines are inferred in other depleted subpopulations. A global assessment based on <em>ca</em> 48% of the species-wide pup production, suggests the species has declined by 57% in three generations. Australian Sea Lions should be classified by IUCN as Endangered under criterion A2bd.<br/></p>  <em></em>","Australian Sea Lions are sexually dimorphic, with adult males reaching 1.25 times the length and 2.5-3.5 times the weight of adult females. Very little information on sizes of adult males is available, and some values in the literature may be overestimates. Adult males reach lengths of 1.8-2.5 m and weigh 180-250 kg. Females are 1.3-1.8 m in length and weigh 61-105 kg. At birth, pups are approximately 60-70 cm long and weigh 6-9 kg (Lowther and Goldsworthy 2011). Pups are dark chocolate brown to charcoal in colour at birth and lighten to a smoky grey before becoming brown. The pelage pattern of pups up until their moult at around 4 months of age is highly variable.<br/><br/>Females become sexually mature at 4.5-6 years of age and males at six years or more. The mean age of breeding females is 11 years (McIntosh 2007). The oldest breeding female recorded was aged 24 years, while the maximum longevity recorded is 26 years for females and 21.5 years for males (McIntosh 2007). Age-specific survival probabilities are high (0.98) after six years of age and are similar for males and females (McIntosh 2007).<br/><br/>Australian Sea Lions are unique among pinnipeds, being the only species that has a non-annual breeding cycle, with intervals between pupping seasons of ~17–18 months (Ling and Walker 1978, Higgins and Gass 1993, Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2006, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Furthermore, breeding seasons are protracted in duration (4-9 months), and occur asynchronously across the species range (breeding can occur at any time of the year) (Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2006, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Asynchronous breeding is maintained through extremely low rates of interchange between colonies by adult females, as demonstrated by genetic studies that indicate extreme population sub-structuring of mitochondrial DNA lineages (maternally inherited), even for those separated by short distances (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008, Goldsworthy and Lowther 2010, Lowther <em>et al</em>. 2012). The evolutionary determinants of this unusual reproductive strategy remain enigmatic (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009). Given the high level of genetic subdivision at the breeding colony scale, individual breeding colonies are considered subpopulations in this species (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lowther 2010, Lowther <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>The low synchrony of births within a breeding season requires males to mate-guard individual females until they come into oestrus around 7–10 days following the birth of the pup. Males are therefore sequentially polygynous, mate-guarding individual females until the male is compelled to go to sea and forage, after which he returns and repeats the strategy. Males defend their female(s) with guttural clicking, growling and barking vocalizations, posturing, and by fighting with rivals.&#160; Like most pinnipeds, there is a 4–6 month period of delayed implantation of the blastocyst following conception. This leads to a prolonged (active) placental gestation of up to 14 months, the longest for any pinniped (Gales and Costa 1997). The annual pregnancy rate of mature females is ~71 % (Higgins and Gass 1993).<br/><br/>Pups are continuously attended for the first 9–10 days after birth by their mother, after which adult females alternate between foraging trips to sea and nursing bouts ashore. Females nurse their pups for 15–18 months, usually weaning them before giving birth again, however females will nurse offspring for three or more years if they do not pup in the subsequent breeding season or their new pup dies. Adult female Australian Sea Lions behave aggressively toward pups that are not their own. Pups will play at the shoreline and in tide pools while their mothers are away, and following their postnatal moult, will actively swim on their own. Pups commence their own foraging trips at a young age and by six months can occupy part of adult female home range and explore adult foraging habitat at least eight months prior to weaning, allowing them to learn the location of suitable foraging habitat and the skills required to hunt successfully (Lowther and Goldsworthy 2012).<br/><br/>Australian Sea Lions restrict their foraging activities to continental shelf waters, with juveniles, adult females and adult males rarely exceeding depths of 90, 130, and 150 m, respectively (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010). The maximum recorded dive depth for an adult male is ~250 m (Goldsworthy unpublished data). The maximum recorded foraging ranges of juvenile and adult female seals are 118 and 190 km, respectively (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010). Adult males range much further and have been tracked up to 340 km from their colony. There is marked within and between-colony variability in the foraging behaviour of juveniles, adult females, and males (Goldsworthy <em>et </em>al. 2009, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010, Lowther and Goldsworthy 2011, Lowther <em>et al</em>. 2012). Foraging trips to sea are relatively short compared to other otariids (mean 1.1 day and maximum 5.1 days in juveniles; mean 1.2 day and maximum 6.2 days in adult females; mean of 2.5 days and maximum 6.7 days in adult males; Higgins 1993, Higgins and Gass 1993, Lowther and Goldsworthy 2011, Kirkwood and Goldsworthy 2013). Australian Sea Lions are benthic, diurnal foragers that routinely transit to foraging locations by swimming along the bottom and dive continuously while at sea and forage at all times of day (Costa and Gales 2003). During dives they minimize the time spent during the descent and ascent phases in order to maximize foraging time on the seabed. Individual dives rarely exceed eight minutes in duration enabling animals to perform around 10–11 dives per hour (Kirkwood and Goldsworthy 2013). Australian Sea Lions are fast, powerful swimmers and often “porpoise” out of the water when moving rapidly at the surface.<br/><br/>The diet of the Australian Sea Lion is poorly understood. Dietary information available is based on limited scat (faeces), digestive tract (autopsied dead animals), and regurgitate analyses (Gales and Cheal 1992, Ling 1992, McIntosh <em>et al</em>. 2006), some crittercam footage (Fragnito 2013), and analyses of prey DNA recovered from faeces (Peters <em>et al</em>. 2014). Cephalopods appear to be a key component of the diet, and include Octopus (Octopodidae), Squid (Loliginidae), and Cuttlefish (Sepiidae) species. Key fish taxa include Leatherjackets (Monacanthidae), Wrasse (Labridae), Flatheads (Platycephalidae), Perch (Sebastidae, Serranidae), Cods (Moridae), Mullets (Mullidae), and Nannygai/Redfish (Berycidae), Whiting (Siikginidae), Rock-ling, and Stingaree /Fiddler Ray (Urolophidae, Rhinobatidae). Small pelagic fish including Jack Mackerel, Yellowtail Scad, and Australian Sardine, have been recorded in the diet, but are not common (McIntosh <em>et al</em>. 2006, Peters <em>et al</em>. 2014). Crustaceans have also been recorded in the diet and include crabs (Stone Crab), prawns, and Rock Lobster (<em>Jasus edwardsii</em>) (McIntosh <em>et al</em>. 2006, Fragnito 2013). Crittercam data indicate that diet and feeding behaviour can vary markedly between individual animals (Fragnito 2013).<br/><br/>Predators of Australian Sea Lions include Great White Sharks (Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2007) and presumably Killer Whales (Ling 2002).","<p>Although now protected, Australian Sea Lions have not rebounded fully in numbers or reoccupied all of their former range. A range of anthropogenic factors have been identified which may be impacting the recovery of the Australian Sea Lion (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, DSEWPC 2013). The cumulative impact of many of these threats may vary across the range of the species. Fisheries bycatch (especially in gillnets) and entanglement in marine debris appear to pose the greatest threat to the Australian Sea Lion at present (Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2003, Goldsworthy and Page 2007, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010), while secondary threats include: habitat degradation and interactions with aquaculture operations; human disturbance to colonies; deliberate killings; disease; chemical pollution and oil spills; noise pollution; prey depletion and competition; and climate change (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, DSEWPC 2013). A substantial Sea Lion tourist industry has developed; this activity is regulated at Sea Lion colonies in parks to minimize disturbance during the breeding season.<br/></p>","Despite the large number of breeding sites (81) used by Australian Sea Lions, only seven sites produce more than 100 pups per breeding season, all of which are in South Australia. The average pup production per breeding site is just 40, with most sites (70%), producing fewer than 30 pups per breeding season (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, Goldsworthy unpublished data).<br/><br/>The species can be broadly separated into three main meta-populations: one in Southern Australia accounting for <em>ca</em> 84% of pup production; one on the south coast of Western Australia accounting for <em>ca</em> 10% of pup production; and one on the west coast of Western Australia accounting for <em>ca</em> 6% of pup production (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, Goldsworthy unpublished data). One very isolated breeding site at Twilight Cove in Western Australia lies 400 km distant from the nearest breeding sites to the east and west, and is considered an additional population.<br/><br/>Total pup production for the species currently is estimated to be 3,204; with 2,691 in South Australia, 335 off the south coast of Western Australia, and 182 off the west coast of Western Australia (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009, Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2011, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2013, Goldsworthy unpublished data). Pup production to total population multipliers developed for the species range from 3.83 to 4.08 (Goldsworthy and Page 2007, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010) giving a total population estimate of <em>ca </em>12,690 (range 12,290–13,090). Based on an age-structured model (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010), the number of mature animals in the population is ca. 6,500 (Goldsworthy, unpublished data).<br/><br/>Based on age-structure data that are available from one Australian Sea Lion population (Seal Bay, Kangaroo Island), generation time is estimated to be 12.4-12.8 years (Goldsworthy and Page 2007). Hence three generations is equivalent to <em>ca</em> 38 years.<br/><br/>Robust data on trends in pup production per breeding season (an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon) are available for a subset of subpopulations, mostly in South Australia. Pup production has declined for four main breeding subpopulations/regions: Seal Bay (~2% decline per breeding season or ~46% decline over three generations); nine subpopulations along the Bunda Cliffs (a 39% decline in mean maximum number of pups counted per site over 19 years, or ~64% decline over three generations); Olive Island (a ~8% decline per breeding season or 32% decline over seven years, equivalent to ~87% decline over three generations); and West Waldegrave Island (a ~42% decline in 10 years or a ~87% decline over three generations). Based on a global assessment of the species from data available for 23 subpopulations (accounting for ~48% of the species-wide pup production), total pup production has declined by 57% in three generations (Goldsworthy, unpublished data).<em><br/></em>",Decreasing,"<p>The Australian Sea Lion is endemic to Australia. Its extant breeding range extends from The Pages Islands (just east of Kangaroo Island) in South Australia to Houtman Abrolhos on the west coast of Western Australia. Pupping has been recorded at 81 island and mainland sites; 47 in South Australia and 34 in Western Australia (Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2011, Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2013, Goldsworthy unpublished data).<br/></p>","Australian aborigines have taken Australian Sea Lions for subsistence purposes for thousands of years. Early European colonists also took Sea Lions for food and other products, although numbers recorded in sealing logbooks were small (Ling 1999). Harvests by sealers in the 17th and 18th centuries reduced the population and extirpated them from areas around the Bass Strait and Tasmania. They are now protected by a variety of laws and are no longer hunted.",Terrestrial|Marine,"This species is protected in Australia by State Conservation agencies under numerous independently enacted state laws, the earliest dating back to 1889. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, 1999 provides protection for all pinnipeds in Australia. The Australian Sea Lion was listed as a Threatened species in the Vulnerable category under that Act in 2005. It is listed as a protected species (rare) in South Australia under the National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1972. In Western Australia they are protected under section 14 of the Wildlife Conservation Act, 1950 and are listed as specially protected in Western Australia under the Wildlife Conservation (Specially Protected) Fauna Notice 2005.<br/><br/>Between 2010 and 2012, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) introduced a range of management measures into the shark gillnet component of the Gillnet Hook and Trap (GHAT) fishery to mitigate the impacts of bycatch mortality on Australian Sea Lion populations off South Australia (AFMA 2010). This followed research that integrated an on-board independent bycatch observer program on gillnet vessels, and an extensive Sea Lion satellite tracking and spatial modelling program (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2010). The management measures introduced include spatial closures (most between 4–10 nm) excluding the fishery around all Sea Lion colonies off South Australia, and bycatch trigger limits that place a cap on the total numbers of Sea Lions that are permitted to be caught within areas of the fishery, which if exceeded result in extended (18 month) fishery closures (AFMA 2012). Given there is 100% observer coverage in this fishery, mostly through electronic monitoring, there is high compliance and most Sea Lion bycatch is now reported in fishery logbooks (AFMA 2013). Additional management measures, such as switching gear to hook and line, are being considered. Bycatch of Australian Sea Lion pups and juveniles in Rock Lobster pots has been largely mitigated through the introduction of Sea Lion excluder devices in the Western Australian and South Australian Rock Lobster fisheries.",Australasian,,false,false,Global
45228501,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"While Walruses occur over a vast area and are common in some regions, their future is by no means secure. Climatic warming will surely require them to live in a much different environment as sea ice recedes and disappears from many of the areas they have used in past centuries (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, 2012, 2015; Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2015). All reasonable scenarios expect that such drastic changes to their habitats will cause Walrus populations to decline throughout most of their range. Because of the expectation of a decline the IUCN SSC Pinniped Specialist Group has recommended that the Atlantic Walrus be listed as Near Threatened under criterion C1, and they have recommended that the Pacific Walrus be listed as Data Deficient. Models suggest that Pacific Walrus abundance declined by 50% between 1980 and 2000 (Udevitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009), and there is ongoing concern about female body condition and possible impacts on calf survival (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Considering both the certainty of future decline in their habitat quality and the limitations of abundance and trend data, the Walrus as a species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.","The Walrus’s most distinctive feature is the external tusks, which are possessed by both males and females. The tusks can grow to be a meter long and can weigh 5 kg in large bulls. They are one of the largest pinnipeds with Pacific Walrus males reaching 3.6 m in length and weighing 880-1,557 kg; adult females are about 3 m and 580-1,039 kg. Atlantic Walrus adults are slightly shorter and lighter. Newborns are 1-1.4 m long and weigh 33-85 kg (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).<br/><br/>Walruses are extremely social animals, and when on land or ice they are normally found in tight groups ranging in size from a few individual up to thousands. At sea they usually travel in groups as well (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). There is significant sexual segregation outside the breeding season, with males often being found in areas away from females and their calves. Walruses have a narrow ecological niche. They depend on: 1) the availability of large areas of shallow water with suitable bottom substrate to support a productive bivalve community, 2) the presence of reliable open water over rich feeding areas, particularly in winter when access to feeding areas is limited by ice cover, and 3) the presence of haul out areas in reasonably close proximity to feeding areas. The preferred haul out platform is sea ice, although both subspecies routinely use terrestrial haul out sites in the summer and autumn (Fay 1981, Hamilton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Because they feed in shallow, coastal areas Walruses usually perform only relatively shallow, short dives (Fay and Burns 1988, Born 2005). The Walrus’s main prey is bivalve mollusks that they search for using their sensitive whiskers on or in soft-bottom substrates. In addition to Clams, their diet can include Worms, Snails, soft shell Crabs, Amphipods, Shrimp, Sea Cucumbers, Tunicates, and even slow-moving Fishes (Born 2005, Sheffield and Grebmeier 2009). Some Walruses prey on birds and other marine mammals, eating a variety of Seal species (Lowry and Fay 1984, Fox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Seymour <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Walrus make foraging trips that last from a few hours to several days; in the Pacific, trips are shorter in duration and distance when they originate from sea ice versus land (Udevitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occur in the winter. Walruses are polygynous and the males establish small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes (Sjare and Stirling 1996, Sjare <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Most births occur in May of the following year. Most female Walrus give birth at 7-10 years old and usually they only produce one calf every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>The primary predators of Walrus are Polar Bears and Killer Whales (Killian and Stirling 1978, Fay 1981).","Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.<br/><br/>Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers <em>et al.</em> 2006, Skoglund <em>et al.</em> 2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.<br/><br/>Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011, Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova <em>et al.</em> 2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.","The Pinniped Specialists Group assessed the abundance and trend of the two Walrus subspecies as follows:<br/><ul><li>Atlantic Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;25,000, some subpopulations increasing but overall trend unknown</li><li>Pacific Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;200,000, trend unknown</li></ul>Considering these results, the abundance of the Walrus species as a whole is likely &gt;225,000 and the trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and are mostly found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas (Fay 1981, Rice 1998). The Atlantic Walrus occurs from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2014). Within that region nine stocks are generally recognized. Historically, Atlantic walruses occurred south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northwestern North Atlantic, but they were extirpated in this region by excessive harvesting (McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2014). Vagrants have been reported from New England, Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay in France/Spain. The Pacific Walrus normally ranges from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, which constitute the center of its range, to the Laptev Sea in the west and the Beaufort Sea in the east, with vagrants south into the North Pacific Ocean to Japan and southcentral Alaska (Fay 1982).","Native people of the Arctic have depended on Walrus for food, hides, ivory and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests continue today in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia. All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been managed under numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been well within sustainable limits (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010, Henriksen and Hilmo 2015). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland, and additionally females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Walrus are listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which allows for control of global trade in Walrus ivory.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia; they are on the Norwegian Red List (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and they are listed in the Russian Red Book (Boltunov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland (Wiig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated the Atlantic Walrus as a species of “special concern”, which acknowledges that they are at risk of becoming threatened in this region; this classification is attributed to climate change impacts on sea ice (COSEWIC 2006).<br/><br/>Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) generally prohibits taking of Walrus unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. MMPA regulations are used to control impacts caused by commercial fishing, oil and gas development, and other human activities. The Pacific Walrus is currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act which would provide additional protections. Within the US there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Russia, Walruses were commercially harvested through the 1980s, but harvests ended in 1991 due to economic collapse of the industry. The “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Pacific Walruses by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a quota is determined annually. Russian legislation prohibits sport hunting of Pacific Walruses, and a variety of types of protection are afforded to major haulout sites along the Russian coast (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Average body length reaches 126-129 cm, with a maximum body length of approximately 140 cm (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Both sexes become sexually mature at about 6 years of age, with most breeding females (74% in a 1974 sample) aged between 8 and 17 years (Popov 1979, 1982). The pregnancy rate for females older than 9 is reported to be as low as 0.2-0.33 (Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Miyazaki 2002), and Krylov (1990) reports a similar low rate of 0.34 for females aged 10-14 years. Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012), acknowledge that the reproductive rate is low in females &gt;20 years old, but suggest that the reproductive rate is &gt;0.5 for females &lt;20 years old taken together as a group. Since females &lt;20 years old make up approximately two-thirds of the population of adult females, they probably drive the overall reproductive rate for the population up to about 0.5. Both Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1999) and Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012) attribute the lower reproductive rates of older females to the effect of long term exposure to organochlorine contaminants in the older animals. Accumulation of contaminants with age has been documented in Caspian seals, but most animals appear to be below thresholds associated with reproductive pathologies (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Pups are generally born from mid-January to late February on the ice, with a birth weight of around 5 kg (Popov 1979), and are nursed for 4-5 weeks. In contrast to ringed seals, females do not usually construct lairs (Frost and Lowry 1981), possibly because sufficient amounts of snow overlying the ice are normally lacking. Pupping on the ice without lairs has allowed direct counts of pups to be made in the recent aerial surveys (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Pups do not enter the water until the ice melts in mid to late March.<br/><br/>The first documented observations of small numbers of Seals breeding in other parts of the Caspian were made in 1982, with females reported pupping on small sand islands in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, although it is likely this behaviour was not new (Krylov 1990). Large numbers of mostly nonbreeding Seals spend the winter in the middle and southern Caspian, with one estimate of 15,000 Seals along the Turkmenistan coast (Krylov 1990).<br/><br/>A post-breeding moult occurs from April to early May, during which the Seals first use the ice and then islands, sand bars, and reed beds for hauling out (Badamshin 1970, Krylov 1990). Presently, Komsomolets Bay and the Durnev Islands in Kazakhstan and Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj island in Russian waters represent the most important moulting habitats (Dmitrieva 2013). Aggregations of several tens of thousands of individuals can be found in Komsomoletz Bay during this period, and around ten thousand at Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj.<br/><br/>During late spring, summer, and early autumn, Caspian Seals are distributed throughout the Caspian Sea. They feed throughout the region, exploiting both the shallow basin in the north and the deep middle and southern basins (Krylov 1990). Recent satellite telemetry studies indicate about 60% of animals move to the middle and southern Caspian, with the remainder staying in the north, primarily around the inflow of Volga and Ural rivers (Dmitrieva 2013). The telemetry studies suggest considerable individual variation in summer migratory and foraging behavior, with individuals spending the summer period separated among shallow, intermediate, and deep water locations. This may reflect individual specialization or niche partitioning in relation to habitat or prey types (Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015a). <br/><br/>During the post-moult summer period Seals rarely haul out, spending several months at sea feeding. In late autumn the breeding adults gather in the northeast, hauling out on sandy islands and reed beds in increasing numbers until ice begins to form (Krylov 1990). When the surface freezes over, females form aggregations on the ice to give birth to their pups, tending to gather along cracks in the ice giving them ready access to the water, although like Ringed Seals they also construct and maintain holes in the ice for water access (Heptner <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Diving capacity for Caspian Seals is comparable to other small phocids, with maximum dive depths exceeding 200 m and dive times exceeding 20 minutes, but most dives are typically shallower than 15 m and shorter than 5 minutes. During the summer foraging areas are not limited by proximity to haul out sites, and animals may spend up to six months at sea. Foraging appears to be primarily benthic (Dmitrieva 2013).<br/><br/>Caspian Seals feed on a variety of fish species. During the summer and autumn, Seals move to and congregate where prey are abundant, particularly Caspian Kilka (<em>Clupeonella </em>sp.), Caspian Silverside (<em>Atherina mochon</em>), and Caspian Gobies (<em>Gobidae</em>) (Krylov 1990), with <em>Clupeonella </em>species historically making up a major proportion of their total annual diet (Kosarev and Yablonskaya 1994). A report on fish found in the stomachs of Seals in the northern Caspian in 1986-1987 (Piletskii and Krylov 1990) suggested that fish eaten in order of frequency were Roach (<em>Rutilus rutilus</em>), Zander (<em>Lucioperca lucioperca</em>), Gobies (<em>Knipowitschia </em>sp., <em>Neogobius kessleri</em> and <em>Benthophilus </em>sp.), and Bream (<em>Blicca bjoerkna </em>and <em>Abramis brama</em>), followed by C. deliculata and other species. A preliminary study from faecal samples collected on the Apsheron Peninsula in June 2001 and March 2002 suggested that Gobies, Silverside, and shrimp were important constituents of the diet of Seals at those times (Eybatov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). New studies of diet in Caspian Seals are required in order to get an accurate picture of current prey in different areas of the Caspian in light of potential changes to the abundance of fish species due to recent ecological changes occurring in the region.","Unsustainable hunting was the main driver of Caspian Seal decline during the 20th century (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012), and human caused mortality continues to be the main ongoing threat to the population. Recently, by-catch of Seals, primarily in illegal Sturgeon fisheries has been identified as a major cause of Seal mortality (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on semi-structured interviews conducted in fishing communities from Dagestan (Russia), Astrakhan region (Russia), and Atyrau region (Kazakhstan), Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2013) documented a minimum by-catch of 1,215 Seals during the 2008-2009 fishing season, 93% of which occurred in illegal Sturgeon fisheries. However, the study sampling reflected less than 10% of the overall poaching activity in the north Caspian, so the actual by-catch is likely to be substantially higher, and to exceed the Potential Biological Removal level (Wade <em>et al.</em> 1998) for the population (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Moreover, the survey did not cover fisheries in the middle and southern Caspian. Iranian commercial fisheries cause an estimated mortality of 500 Seals annually (Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). Further work is needed to fully quantify Seal by-catch rates throughout the Caspian Sea, and its implications for population demography. Fishermen frequently sell skins and blubber from bycaught Seals.<br/><br/>Natural sources of mortality include predation and disease. The primary non-human predators are Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and Sea Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus </em>spp.). Krylov (1990) estimated that Wolves killed 17-40% of Caspian Seal pups on “some breeding grounds from 1974 to 1976”, while Eagles took less than 1% of pups. The reverse was found during recent aerial surveys (Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). Few Wolves were observed each year between 2005-2012, but up to 3,100 Eagles. Eagles are likely to primarily scavenge afterbirth and dead pups, but may also be capable of killing unaccompanied unweaned pups.<br/><br/>Mass mortality events occurred in 1997 and 2000-2001, killing several thousand Seals each time, and have since been attributed to canine distemper virus (CDV). Presence of a hitherto unknown strain of CDV was confirmed in one dead Seal in 1997 (Forsyth <em>et al.</em> 1998), and the same strain was confirmed as the primary cause of death in Seals dying in 2000 in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (Kennedy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Examination of archived stranding records in Azerbaijan since 1971, show an increased mortality every few years, suggesting the possibility of previous outbreaks of CDV (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). A serology study of archived samples indicated that CDV was present in Caspian Seals in 1993, 1997, and 1998 (Ohashi <em>et al.</em> 2001). There have been no further mass mortalities since 2001, but disease would become a concern should they reoccur.<br/><br/>Degradation of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and overexploitation of primary food resources may also be threats to Caspian Seals (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993, Barannik <em>et al.</em> 2004). An invasive of Comb Jellyfish, <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, arrived in the Caspian Sea via ship ballast water in the Volga-Don Canal in 1999 (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000). Comb Jellyfish consume zooplankton rapidly, leading indirectly to a reduction in fish stocks and a substantial impact on local fisheries. A 70% reduction in commercial landings of three species of Kilka was recorded within three years of the Comb Jellyfish invasion (Kideys <em>et al.</em> 2005). Kilka are thought to be important prey for Caspian Seals in the central and southern parts of the sea, and the invasion of Comb Jellyfish is considered a threat to the Seals (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). In addition to impacts from Comb Jellyfish, most commercial fisheries in the Caspian are considered to be severely depleted or extinct due to unsustainable fishing practices and/or loss of fish habitats such as spawning grounds (Strukova and Guchgeldiyev 2010). While Caspian Seals are known to feed to on commercially important fish species, commercial catch rates are not necessarily an indicator of prey availability, and Seals have a varied and adaptable diet which includes non-commercial species such as Gobies. To date is has not been possible to make any quantitative assessment on potential impacts from changes in Caspian food webs and Caspian Seal energetics and demography. Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2015) did not find a significant correlation when testing for association between annual pup production and net primary productivity 2005-2012, but a longer time series of surveys is required to achieve adequate statistical power.<br/><br/>The Caspian Sea has no outlet and receives most of its input from the Volga, Ural, and other rivers. Contamination of the Volga with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s, but levels in Seals do not appear to be elevated, with the exception of zinc in some diseased animals that may have suffered homeostatic disturbance of trace metal levels (Anan <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Organochlorine levels (principally polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs)) have been assessed for Caspian Seals dying in the 1997-2001 CDV epizootics (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1999; Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2008; Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most animals were found to have levels below thresholds believed to cause toxic effects in mammals. Overall levels in Caspian Seals were lower than those seen in European Seal species, comparable to Baikal Seals, and higher than those reported for Arctic species (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Presently there is no evidence that organochlorine burdens in Caspian Seals cause reproductive or immune impairment, or contributed to the 1997-2001 CDV outbreaks at a population level, although some individual Seals may have high burdens (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002,&#160;Härkönen&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Organochlorine accumulation was found to be primarily age related, which means animals at the older end of the age distribution may be at risk of crossing toxicity thresholds towards the end of their reproductive lifespan (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It has been recommended that levels of persistent organic pollutants should be monitored in the future due to the continuing industrial development around the Caspian region and time elapsed since the last survey following the CDV epizootics (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Combined juvenile mortality from continued hunting, natural predation, and fisheries by-catch is believed to be unsustainable. Overall mortality before breeding from all sources is likely to be in the region of 50% (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). Demographic models indicate such a high rate of juvenile mortality would be capable of causing a continuing decline in the Caspian Seal population, with lowered fertility due to organochlorine contamination being a relatively minor factor (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Variation in annual pup production determined from aerial surveys makes empirical estimation of current population trends uncertain (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b), and a longer time series is necessary to assess the demographic trajectory directly.<br/><br/>As a landlocked ice-breeding species with no option to migrate to alternative habitats, Caspian Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). Warming may cause a reduction in the spatial extent, temporal duration, and stability of the winter ice breeding habitat. Premature break-up of the ice sheet before pups are moulted will cause significant mortality among pups of the year. January-March 2007 was one of the mildest winters in the Caspian in recent years, with ice cover suitable for breeding limited to a narrow strip along the coastline of the north-east Caspian. Storms in mid-February may have caused ice-flows with large numbers of pups to be swept out to sea, and pup counts for that year were less than one third the maximum observed for 2005-2012 (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). It has also been suggested that poor ice conditions may play a role in the epidemiology of CDV outbreaks due to Seal crowding on limited haulout space and poor condition of weaned pups (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Long term trends in Caspian Sea ice cover and the implications for population demography remain to be fully assessed.<br/><br/>Through the geological history of the Caspian, there have been several substantial fluctuations of sea level (Dumont 1998), which will have affected the relative amounts of shallow and deep water habitats available to Seals. The population adapted to those past changes, but there is some concern about whether the same will be possible for future sea level changes given added pressures of habitat loss and human impacts.<br/><br/>Further threats to the Seals on shore and on ice now come from increasing disturbance due to offshore and shoreline developments. One of the largest oil fields in the world is currently being developed in the Caspian, with the construction of numerous offshore oil drilling islands, pipelines, shipping access to these, and onshore logistics facilities. A recent study found that breeding Seals are using shipping channels as artificial leads into the ice and are giving birth close to the edge of these channels. A significant proportion of the breeding population and pups may therefore experience disturbance by shipping traffic depending on the ice conditions (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). More research is required to quantify the likely impacts of this intensive oil development. The coasts of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran have also seen increased development for domestic and leisure use in recent years, with many previously undisturbed stretches of coast now being developed.<br/><br/>Disturbance of island and reef haulout sites by illegal fishing activities and opportunistic Seal hunting are another ongoing problem. Recent surveys have found that the Caspian Seal has effectively disappeared from Azerbaijan, with the once important haulout sites of the Apsheron Peninsula and Archipelago abandoned. These sites were used by many thousands of Seals until the 1930s when they were heavily hunted (Krylov 1990). However, between 1997 and 2002 a few hundred Seals were still counted regularly at these sites (e.g., Allchin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Few live Seals have been seen in this area since 2004 (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). The overall Caspian Seal population decline since 2002 is unlikely to account for this total disappearance, which is most probably due in part to severe disturbance by illegal fishing and other coastal activities (T. Eybatov, unpublished data). Similar declines in the regularity of Seal occupancy have also been noted recently at other sites, such as South West Island near the Ural Delta and Osushnoy Island (Kazakhstan), Bautino (Kazakhstan), and in Turkmenbashi Bay (Turkmenistan). The number of Seals at Ogurchinsky Island (Turkmenistan) has also declined from several thousand in the 1980s to a few hundred (P. Erokhin, unpublished observations). The only previously recorded haulout site in Iran, at Ashoora Island, is no longer used by Seals (H. Asadi pers. comm.). There is a need to develop an inventory of all haulout sites throughout the Caspian together with archived and current records of Seal occupancy (Wilson and Goodman 2012).","Historically, the population of Caspian Seals was estimated to have exceeded one million (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). The most recent estimates of abundance are based on aerial surveys of the breeding population on the northern ice field conducted annually in February between 2005 and 2012 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). During this period estimated annual pup production ranged between 8,200 (95% confidence intervals 7,130-9,342) and 34,000 (95% confidence intervals 31,275-36,814). This would suggest there are currently approximately 68,000 reproductively mature individuals (male and female, based on the greatest observed pup production), with the total population in the region of 104,000 to 168,000 individuals derived from an age structured model (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2012; Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). Variation in weather conditions during surveys may account for some of difference in pup counts between years, but additional contributions from biological factors affecting fecundity cannot be excluded at this time (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). The variability in annual pup makes the current population trend uncertain, and a longer time series is necessary to directly assess the demographic trajectory (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). However, if pup mortality exceeds 50% due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes (a realistic scenario), this could be sufficient to result in ongoing declines (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>The population decline throughout the 20th century has been reconstructed by a demographic model using hunting statistics. By the 1950s–1960s, the population was estimated from this model to have been reduced to between 400,000-500,000 Seals (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), while an estimate based on a harvest of 86,000 pups in 1966, believed to be most pups born that year, also produced an estimate of 500,000 Seals for that year (Krylov 1990). Aerial surveys conducted in 1976 and 1980 suggested an estimate of 450,000 animals (Krylov 1990), although the hind-casting analysis suggests a population of only about 200,000 Seals remaining at that time (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Surveys in 1987 and 1989 resulted in an estimate of approximately 360,000-400,000 (Krylov 1990), but again the hind-casting analysis suggests this might again have been an over-estimate, with perhaps only about 130,000 Seals remaining by the late 1980s. Overall, the hind-casting analysis indicated a population reduction of about 66% during 1867-1964 and a further reduction of 73% during 1965-2005 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) estimated the total population of adult females as 354,210 in 1945 and 21,000 in 2005, later revised to 34,000 by Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015b) after accounting for survey observation errors. Although pup production has been revised upwards in more recent publications, this would not affect the relative decline, since it would imply correspondingly higher historical population sizes. The IUCN Criterion A calculator was used to project declines over a three generation period 1955-2015, indicating adult female numbers declined 91.5%. However, the scale of decline is dependent on estimated values for parameters such as pup survival and fertility rates, about which there is some uncertainty (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Therefore a more conservative position for the purposes of IUCN classification would be to accept a relative decline of at least 70% until more data are available to refine the historical demography.<br/><br/>Generation time from Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) is 18.8 years.",Unknown,"Caspian Seals are confined to the Caspian Sea. They range throughout the sea with seasonal migration between the southern, middle, and northern basins. More than 99.9% of breeding takes place on ice, which covers the shallow northern parts of the Caspian Sea in from late December to early April in typical years (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013, Dmitrieva <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015a). Occasional observations have been made of low numbers (a few tens of individuals) breeding on islets off Turkmenistan (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013).","Caspian Seals have been commercially exploited since the late 18th century. Harvests averaged 119,000-174,000 per year throughout the 19th century, with peaks of 300,000 having been recorded. In the 20th century, harvest levels peaked in the 1930s with an average annual harvest of 164,000 and a maximum single year take of 227,600. The numbers of Seals taken fell during World War II to an average of 60,800 per year, and subsequently ranged between a low of 41,400 and a high of 108,300 for the period 1951-1975 (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Commercial harvesting was temporarily halted in 1996 after a much-reduced estimated take of 14,000 Seals. Since the start of the 21st century smaller scale commercial and scientific hunting has taken place in Russia, typically with recorded hunts of tens or hundreds of individuals per year, with a maximum of 4,600 (in 2003-2004), reported for the period up to 2010. Official hunting is conducted under a quota system administered by an inter-governmental body, the Caspian Bioresources Commission. Typical annual quotas are for 18,000 Seals, with 8,000 allocated to Russia, and the remainder divided among the other Caspian states. The scientific rationale for the quotas is not clear. Currently only Russia actively pursues official hunting under the quota, but large scale hunting does not appear to be commercially viable at present and recorded takes are far below the official quota levels (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). The level of ‘unofficial’ or illegal hunting is poorly documented, but illegal hunting on ice on the scale of hundreds of Seals is known to take place periodically (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Seal skins are used for hats and other clothing in Russia, while Seal blubber is used as a medicinal tonic, fishing bait, and cattle feed in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The total economic value and trading networks for Seal products remain to be fully determined, but high quality individual seal skins may sell for up to $100 US dollars at the point of origin, while seal oil can sell for $14.00 per litre in local markets (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Various prohibitions, quotas, and protective measures have been taken to conserve the Caspian Seal, beginning in 1940 when seal nets were prohibited. The harvest of moulting Seals in the spring was ended in 1946, and in 1952 the Apsheron Archipelago in Azerbaijan was closed to sealing. Female harvesting on the breeding grounds was stopped in 1966 and all take was prohibited on the eastern islands of the northern Caspian in 1967. These last two changes led to a complete change in the commercial harvest, resulting in a switch to newborn and moulted pups. Quotas on harvest of pups, purportedly based on biological data, began in 1970 (Krylov 1990), although in retrospect the quotas were at unsustainable levels. The Russian Federation continues to consider the Caspian Seal to be a ‘harvested’ species, with quotas set through the Caspian Bioresources Commission (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2012).<br/><br/>A Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan was approved by the nations bordering the Caspian Sea, pursuant to the 2003 Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Caspian Environment Programme 2007), but it had no legally binding actions. The action plan recommended cessation of hunting, measures to reduce by-catch in legal and illegal fisheries, and the strategic creation of protected areas of sea, ice, and shore. However, to date none of the Caspian states have taken steps to implement the action plan. In 2012 the CaspEco Project, a UNDP funded follow up to the Caspian Environment Programme, published a framework report and road map for the establishment of a network of protected areas for Caspian Seals, including suitable locations (Wilson and Goodman 2012), but no further action has yet taken place. A number of small non-governmental organizations within Caspian countries are involved in producing educational materials and promoting awareness of Caspian Seals. In Iran, localised work with fishing communities has been conducted promoting release rather than killing of live animals found entangled in fishing gear, and a stranded seal rehabilitation facility has been established. In 2014 the Caspian States banned all catching of wild Sturgeon and in recent years Kazakhstan has increased maritime patrols to counter Sturgeon poaching which in principle may have potential to also help reduce seal by-catch.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231341,41672,Pusa hispida,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"As a species, Ringed Seals are widely distributed in ice-covered waters of the northern hemisphere, and they may presently number about three million animals. Some of the subspecies, however, have restricted distributions and exist in much smaller numbers. With climatic warming, all subspecies will be negatively impacted by continuing decreases of ice habitats critical for their reproduction. Nevertheless, at this time Ringed Seals as a species do not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing, and are listed as Least Concern. Subspecies <em>Pusa hispida ladogensis</em>, the Ladoga Seal, is assessed separately as Vulnerable and subspecies <em>P. h. saimensis</em>, the Saimaa Seal, is assessed as Endangered.","Ringed Seals are in many respects the “classic” ice-seal. Throughout most of their range they use sea ice exclusively as their breeding, molting, and resting (haul-out) habitat, rarely if ever moving onto land (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Their ability to create and maintain breathing holes in ice using the well-developed claws on their fore-flippers allows them to thrive in areas where even other ice-associated seals cannot reside. Although Ringed Seals are quite small they deal with the thermal challenges posed by the arctic winter by having a very thick blubber layer, and by building lairs (small caves) in the snow on top of sea ice during the winter. The lairs are particularly important for neonatal survival (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Ringed Seals also use natural cracks along pressure ridges and leads in the sea ice for surfacing and breathing. In Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa, the Baltic Sea, the White Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk, Ringed Seals haul out and pup on ice but rest on shore during the ice-free period (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kelly <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Reported mean age at sexual maturity for female Ringed Seals varies in the literature from 3.5 to 7.1 years (Holst and Stirling 2002, Krafft <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Males likely do not participate in breeding before they are 8-10 years old. Body sizes vary considerably between regions (Frost and Lowry 1981, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Ringed seals are long lived, with ages close to 50 reported (Lydersen and Gjertz 1987). Regional productivity rates are variable; reproductive success depends on many factors including prey availability, the relative stability of the ice, and sufficient snow accumulation prior to the commencement of breeding (Lukin 1980, Smith 1987, Lydersen 1995). <br/><br/>A single pup is born in late February-early March for the Ladoga, Saimaa, and Baltic subspecies (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998) and March-May for the others (Frost and Lowry 1981). Most births occur in subnivean lairs excavated in snow that accumulates near ice ridges or shorelines. Lairs provide thermal protection against cold air temperatures and high wind chill and afford at least some protection from predators (Smith 1976, Smith and Stirling 1975, Gjertz and Lydersen 1986). For Arctic Ringed Seals, lactation lasts an average of 39 days and pups are weaned at approximately 20 kg (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999). Females become receptive for mating towards the end of the lactation period, similar to other phocid seals. <br/><br/>Ringed Seals molt from mid-May to mid-July and during that period they spend quite a bit of time hauled out (Reeves 1998). Feeding intensity is at a minimum during molting (Ryg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). <br/><br/>Although they may dive to more than 500 m (Born <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), in many areas where they feed the water is not that deep and dives are correspondingly shallower (Gjertz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).<br/><br/>Outside the breeding and molting seasons, Ringed Seal distribution is correlated with food availability (e.g., Simpkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Freitas <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Numerous studies of their diet have been conducted, and although there is considerable regional variation several patterns emerge. Most Ringed Seal prey are small, and preferred prey tend to be schooling species that form dense aggregations. Fishes are usually in the 5-10 cm length range and crustacean prey in the 2-6 cm range. Typically, a variety of 10-15 prey species are found, with no more than 2-4 dominant prey species for any given area. Fishes are generally more commonly eaten than invertebrates, but diet is determined to some extent by availability of various types of prey during particular seasons as well as by preference, which in part is influenced by energy content of various available prey (Reeves 1998, Wathne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). Commonly eaten prey include Polar Cod, Arctic Cod, Saffron Cod, Redfish, Herring, and Capelin in marine waters (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Labansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), and Smelt, Vendance, Perch, Roach, Stickleback, and Burbot in lakes (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Invertebrate prey species seem to become more important in the open-water season and often dominate the diet of young animals (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Large Amphipods, Krill, Mysids, Shrimps, and Cephalopods are all eaten by Ringed Seals and can be very important in some regions at least seasonally (Agafonova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most important predator of Arctic Ringed Seals in most parts of their range and they are also eaten by Killer Whales and Walruses. Wolves, Wolverines, Foxes, Gulls, and Ravens may also prey on Ringed Seals, especially pups, in other areas (Reeves 1998).","Ringed Seals carry loads of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants from industry and agriculture that have been implicated in uterine pathology in Baltic Seals (Bergman and Olsson 1986), and high concentrations of mercury in Saimaa Seals is thought to have reduced pup production in the 1960s and 1970s (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). However, following restrictions on the use and release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment, contaminant levels are dropping rapidly in the Baltic (Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). The same is true with regards to POPs in Arctic populations (Wolkers <em>et al</em>. 2008). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to Ringed Seals. The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season or if food resources were negatively affected (Smith 1987, Reeves 1998).<br/><br/>Manipulation of water levels, recreational snow machine operation, net-fishing, boating, tourism, and development of cottages on the shoreline have been noted as threats to the Ringed Seals in Lake Saimaa, and industrial pollution, net fishing and poaching, as well as disturbance of on-shore summer haulout groups have been highlighted as threats for the Ladoga Seals (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007). Predation by Red Fox, Wolves, feral and domestic Dogs, and even birds of prey, are also risks for these lake Seals (e.g., Kunnasranta <em>et al</em>. 2001). By-catch in fisheries and other negative impacts associated with fisheries conflicts seem at present to be the major threat to Saimaa and Ladoga Seals (Kokko <em>et al</em>. 1998, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Verevkin 2002, Sipilä 2003, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Global warming may pose the greatest threat to Ringed Seals of all subspecies if it leads to large losses of the stable ice habitat required for pupping and rearing their young (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). Early break-up of the ice results in poor condition of pups and higher mortality rates (Smith and Harwood 2001). Associated changes in precipitation and weather patterns could also negatively affect Ringed Seal populations if there is insufficient snow cover to protect pups in lairs in the spring (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Ferguson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Hezel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Iacozza and Ferguson 2014). Pups born outside lairs have a very low chance of survival; the pups are so small that even large Gulls can be predators if they are exposed (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Declining trends in reproduction and survival of pups have already been noted in some regions that have been attributed to earlier break-up of the sea ice over recent decades and concomitant changes in the marine ecosystem (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stirling 2005). Reductions in arctic sea ice could have quite dramatic effects via prey availability if Polar and Arctic Cod populations are negatively impacted.<br/><br/>  Reductions in sea ice cover will likely lead to increased human activity in arctic regions in the form of shipping and resource extraction industries, with associated increased threat of marine accidents and pollution discharge (Pagnan 2000). An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Ringed Seals, to abandon areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997) although studies to date suggest relatively minor impacts of development (Davis&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1991; Moulton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, 2003, 2005; Blackwell&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2004). However, over-flights by aircraft certainly cause disturbance to Ringed Seals if flights occur by helicopter at less than 1,500 m distance or by fixed-winged aircraft at closer than 500 m (Born&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1999).","Available data on Ringed Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>&#160;Arctic Ringed Seal--1,450,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Okhotsk Ringed Seal--44,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Baltic Ringed Seal--11,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Ladoga Seal--3,000-4,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Saimaa Seal--135-190, trend increasing<br/></li></ul>The world-wide population size of Ringed Seals is not accurately known. Some recent survey data are available from parts of their range (see subspecies assessments), but for the Arctic and Okhotsk subspecies data are limited in spatial scope. Citing many factors such as the vast geographic area occupied by the species, its highly variable distribution within areas that have been surveyed, the unknown relationship between the numbers of individuals observed versus those not seen, and other factors, Frost and Lowry (1981) stated that it is “unwise to attempt an estimate of the world population of this subspecies”. Despite numerous surveys at specific locales conducted since then, Reeves (1998) believed that “this conclusion remains appropriate.”<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the figures presented above indicate the number of mature individuals is more than 1.5 million, and the total population size is likely more than 3 million.",Unknown,"Ringed Seals have a circumpolar distribution throughout the Arctic Basin including records of individuals near the North Pole (Rice 1998). Ringed Seals also range widely into adjacent seas being found in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, and Greenland, Barents, White, Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian Seas, and they occasionally range into some lake and river systems in Northern Canada (Heide-Jørgensen and Lydersen 1998). Separate subspecies occur in the Baltic Sea, Lake Ladoga in the Russian Federation, Lake Saimaa in Finland, and the Sea of Okhotsk (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Extralimital records for Ringed Seals extend far south on both sides of the Atlantic, to New Jersey USA in the west and Portugal in the east. In the Pacific, vagrants have been recorded south to the Zhejiang in China and southern California&#160;USA (Rice 1998).","Humans have hunted Ringed Seals in the Arctic since the arrival of people to the region millennia ago (e.g., Murdoch 1893, Riewe and Amsden 1979). They are a fundamental subsistence food item for most coastal dwelling northern indigenous peoples. Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1998) reported a combined estimate of 10,000 taken per year from the Bering, Chukchi, and western Beaufort Seas by Russians and Alaska Natives. They also estimated that the annual removal of Ringed Seals in the Canadian Arctic was in the “high tens of thousands”, and that in the 1980s, including animals killed and lost, the harvest was between 60,000 and 80,000, and may have exceeded 100,000 in some years. Another substantial annual harvest occurs in Greenland with nearly 100,000 taken per year in the 1970s and approximately 70,000 taken annually in the early1990s (Teilmann and Kapel 1998).<br/><br/>Commercial harvests of Ringed Seals in the early to mid-20th century were sometimes large and probably had significant local impacts on the respective populations. Harvest statistics reported for western Russia by Belikov and Boltunov (1998) suggest that maximum catches earlier in the 20th century exceeded the total allowable catches (TACs) significantly, with harvests of up to 8,900 in the White Sea (1912), 13,200 in the Russian Barents Sea (1962), and 13,200 in the Kara Sea (1933). Those harvests are thought to have dropped considerably in recent decades, though there are no available data. Reporting of harvest statistics and enforcement of TACs is difficult to manage in outlying areas, and the harvest of Ringed Seals in eastern Russia is largely unknown.<br/><br/>Although Ringed Seals in the Baltic and Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa were hunted in the past, hunting is no longer allowed (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Ringed Seals are protected by a variety of laws and quotas in different parts of their range, but even within Europe the legal provisions are not always being fully implemented in domestic law (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001). The population in Lake Saimaa has been protected since 1955, and additional protection has been afforded via the establishment of two national parks within the lake, and regulation of shoreline development. Similarly, the hunting of Seals in Lake Ladoga was prohibited in 1980 (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). In the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 allows Ringed Seals to be harvested only by Alaskan Native hunters for subsistence purposes, and that Act generally prohibits all other forms of taking except where specifically permitted.

This uncommon species could easily be targeted by aquarium trade. It also may be easily targeted for predation by the invasive lionfish given its small, shallow body and demersal habits (Green and Cote 2014).

The global population size, at over 25,000 animals, is well above the IUCN Red List Vulnerable threshold for a non-declining population. The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation (estimated to be over 16,000 and increasing at 3% per year or more) may have recovered to near or even above its level prior to commercial whaling. The East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation is estimated to exceed 4,000, and has probably been increasing but is still below its pre-whaling level. Bowhead Whale numbers in the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation remain at a small fraction of pre-whaling abundance with no estimate of trend. The main reduction in the global population occurred before the three-generation time window that would trigger the Red List population reduction (A) criterion. The East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea and Okhotsk Sea  subpopulations have separate Red List assessments, in addition to being included in this global assessment.</p>  <p>  </p>","Small to medium-sized crustaceans, especially krill and copepods, form the bulk of the Bowhead Whale diet (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pomerleau <em>et al</em>. 2011). Bowheads also commonly feed on mysids and gammarid amphipods, and the diet includes at least 60 species (Lowry 1993).<br/><br/>The seasonal distribution of Bowhead Whales is strongly influenced by prey availability and pack ice conditions (Moore and Reeves 1993). During the winter, they occur within areas of sea ice (Stafford <em>et al.</em> 2012) and appear to feed mainly near the bottom (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). During the spring, they use leads and cracks in the ice to penetrate areas that were inaccessible during the winter due to heavy ice coverage. During the summer and autumn, they concentrate in areas where zooplankton production is high or where large-scale biophysical processes create local concentrations of calanoid copepods (Finley 1990, Finley <em>et al</em>. 2000) and appear to feed mainly in mid-water and near the surface (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Pacific Arctic, six feeding hotspots have been identified including two in the Bering Sea and one in the Chukchi Sea along the northern coast of Chukotka where there is evidence of winter feeding, and three in the Beaufort Sea where most of the feeding occurs in summer and autumn (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The Bowhead Whale may be the longest-living mammal, possibly capable of living for over 200 years (George <em>et al.</em> 1999, Keane <em>et al. </em>2015, Wetzel <em>et al.</em> 2017). Nearly all life history data come from the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas population. Female age at sexual maturity is estimated at 18-33 years (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2013). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated the mean generation time for Bowhead Whales to be about 52 years, assuming an age at first reproduction of 20 years. Females give birth every 3-7 years (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 1992) and calves are weaned at 9-12 months of age (Koski <em>et al. </em>1993).<p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Extensive commercial hunting, beginning in the 1500s, depleted Bowhead Whales throughout their range. Commercial whaling for the species has been prohibited under international conventions since the 1930s. The limited subsistence whaling by indigenous communities  mentioned above has not impeded the recovery of the affected populations.</p><p>Accidental human-caused deaths are relatively few. During 2010-15, two dead-stranded and one live Bowhead were observed to be entangled with fishing gear but it was unclear whether the entanglement was the cause of death. Of the Bowhead Whales taken in Alaskan hunts during 1990-2012, 12% showed scars or wounds from fishing gear and 2% showed scars or wounds from ship strikes (George <em>et al.</em> 2017a).</p>  <p>There has been concern since the 1970s that disturbance from oil and gas exploration and extraction activities in the Arctic region would affect Bowhead Whales. Effects on diving behavior (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2013) and calling rates (Blackwell <em>et al.</em> 2015) in the vicinity of seismic surveys have been observed, but to date there has been no discernible population-level impact. Examination of whales taken in subsistence hunts off Alaska since 1980 found relatively low levels of morbidity, which would be consistent with an increasing population and good individual animal health (George <em>et al</em>. 2017b).</p>  <p>During this century, a profound reduction in the extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic has occurred and this reduction is predicted to continue, possibly leading eventually to the complete disappearance of sea ice in summer as mean Arctic temperatures rise faster than the global average (Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The short-term effects of reduced ice cover on Bowhead Whales in the western Arctic appear to be positive, due to increased feeding opportunities (George <em>et al</em>. 2015, Moore 2016). However, the long-term effects are less clear. The emergence of Bowheads as a separate, ice-adapted species may have coincided with the appearance of sea ice in the late Pliocene, and Bowheads could lose out to non-ice-adapted species in the long term, but no projections of the time scale of such an eventuality are available (Harington 2008, IWC 2016).&#160; </p>  <p>There is also concern that, as the sea ice diminishes, the opening up of the Arctic to increased vessel traffic, fishing activities, and extractive industries will increase human-caused impacts on Bowhead Whales (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014).&#160; </p>","<em><strong>Current Population sizes</strong></em><br/>The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation is estimated to have numbered 16,900 (15,700-18,900) in 2011 from shore/ice-based counts (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2016) or&#160;19,000 (12,400-28,500) from photo-identification capture-recapture (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160; Numbers in the East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation are estimated at 4,000-10,500 in 2013 from aerial surveys (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al.</em> 2015) or 4,500-11,000 in 2008-12 from genetic mark-recapture (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Given the increasing trend in the large Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation, the total range-wide population likely exceeds 25,000 individuals. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation is estimated to be only about 200, and the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation probably also numbers in the hundreds (see separate listings).<strong><em><br/> <br/> <strong>Population trends<br/></strong></em></strong>The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation has been monitored for more than 30 years and has been increasing over that period at an estimated annual rate of 3.7% (range 2.8–5.4%) in the presence of subsistence hunting (Givens <em>et al. </em>2016). The East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation has probably also been increasing. Based on aerial surveys and genetic capture-recapture, Rekdal <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that the number of Bowhead Whales using West Greenland waters in the winter-spring period increased from 1998 to 2006 and has levelled off since then. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation may be declining (Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2017). No estimates of trend are available for the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation.<strong><em><br/><br/>Pre-whaling population sizes</em></strong><em></em><br/>Commercial whaling for Bowhead Whales in the Bering Sea began in 1848 and expanded rapidly, depleting the worldwide population (Bockstoce and Burns 1993). Brandon and Wade (2006) estimated the initial abundance of the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation at 10–20,000. Using a different kind of population model, Witting (2013) estimated pre-whaling abundance to be 13-24,000. Therefore, the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation appears to have reached or exceeded estimates of its size prior to commercial whaling. All models indicate that the population reached a minimum size around 1914.<br/><br/>Basque whalers took Bowhead Whales in the northwestern Atlantic in the 16th century, but ambiguities over the species identity of whales taken in early commercial whaling have made interpretation of old catch records difficult. Genetic analysis of bones from 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century shore stations in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St Lawrence found that, contrary to previous assumptions, almost all bones were from Bowhead Whales rather than North Atlantic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena glacialis</em>) (Macleod <em>et al.</em> 2008). This suggests that 25-40,000 Bowhead Whales were taken in the eastern Canadian Arctic by Basque whalers during 1530-1610, followed by approximately 28,000 during the pelagic whaling phase during 1719-1915 (Ross, 1993).<br/><br/>The pre-whaling size of the East Canada – West Greenland population was thus probably at least 25,000, well above the likely current level.The pre-whaling size of the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea population has been estimated to be 33,000-65,000 using a simple population model (Allen and Keay 2006) applied to historical catch data from Dutch, German, and British sources compiled by de Jong (1983). The current population size, therefore, is a small fraction of the pre-whaling size.  The pre-whaling population size in the Okhtosk Sea has been variously estimated as between 3,000 and 20,000 depending on assumptions about past catches (Ivashchenko and Clapham 2010). The current population size is a small fraction of those estimates.",Increasing,"<p>Bowhead Whales are found only in Arctic and subarctic regions. Until recently they have spent much of their lives in and near sea ice and they migrate seasonally to avoid ice entrapment and to take advantage of food concentrations (Moore and Reeves 1993). With the reduction of sea ice cover, Bowhead Whales now occur increasingly in open water during the summer (Moore 2016).<br/> <br/> The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has traditionally recognized five stocks named for the regions in which Bowheads occur: Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas; Hudson Bay – Foxe Basin; Davis Strait – Baffin Bay; Svalbard – Barents Sea (Spitsbergen); and Okhotsk Sea (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 2003). Movements of tagged Bowheads indicating somewhat overlapping ranges, and lack of clear genetic differences, has discredited the traditional distinction between the Hudson Bay – Foxe Basin and the Davis Strait – Baffin Bay populations (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2006, Postma <em>et al.</em> 2006, Alter <em>et al.</em> 2012, IWC 2012). Four main subpopulations are now recognized: Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas; East Canada – West Greenland; East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea; and Okhotsk Sea. The boundary between the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas and Eastern Canada – West Greenland subpopulations is liable to become more porous as sea ice cover diminishes (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>With the exception of the Okhotsk Sea, genetic divergence between Bowhead Whales in different parts of their range appears to be low, and there is some evidence of movement between the main areas of occurrence (IWC 2013). The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation appears to be genetically and geographically isolated.</p>  <p>Based on direct observations and telemetry, the summer range of the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation extends from Chaunskaya Guba (Russian Federation) in the western Chukchi Sea through the Beaufort Sea and east to Amundsen Gulf (Canada) and Viscount Melville Sound (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Most of the whales appear to migrate into the Bering Sea in winter (IWC 2013, Quakenbush <em>et al.</em> 2012, Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, substantial catches were also taken in summer in the Bering Sea,&#160;but the climatic conditions were quite different then than at the present (IWC 2013) </p>  <p>Bowhead Whales belonging to the East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation are observed in Hudson Bay, Foxe Basin, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, Gulf of Boothia, Prince Regent Inlet, and other waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Tracking of satellite-tagged whales has confirmed movements from Foxe Basin through Fury and Hecla Strait into the Gulf of Boothia and Prince Regent Inlet, and from Cumberland Sound into Prince Regent Inlet, Gulf of Boothia, Foxe Basin, and Hudson Strait, while animals tagged in West Greenland moved to Prince Regent Inlet and Hudson Strait (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2012). The whales move out of the summering areas as ice forms in autumn to wintering areas in polynyas (Holst and Stirling 1999), unconsolidated pack ice, and open water near the ice edge off West Greenland (Reeves and Heide-Jørgensen 1996) and eastern Baffin Island. Sightings and strandings have occurred in recent years in the western North Atlantic as far south as Newfoundland (Ledwell <em>et al.</em> 2007) and the Gulf of Maine (Accardo <em>et al.</em> in press).</p>  The East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation occurs from the east coast of Greenland across the Greenland Sea, including the Northeast Water polynya off northeastern Greenland, in the Barents Sea, in the Franz Josef Land Archipelago, and in the Kara Sea at least as far as far as Severnaya Zemlya. There have also been sightings further south, exceptionally reaching Iceland and the coast of Finnmark. Vagrants have been observed as far south as the western British Isles and France (de Boer <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation occurs in the northern and western Sea of Okhotsk from Shantarskiye Zaliv east to Zaliv Shelikova, Gizhiginskaya Guba, and Penzhinskaya Guba (Moore and Reeves 1993,&#160;Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is no evidence of migration into or out of the Okhotsk Sea.","<p></p><p></p><p>Limited subsistence whaling on the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation by indigenous people of Alaska and Chukotka is permitted by the IWC on the basis of advice from its Scientific Committee (under its aboriginal subsistence whaling management procedure). Small&#160;hunts are also authorized in Canadian waters under co-management agreements between federal agencies and indigenous communities, and in West Greenland under the IWC management procedure. The reported average annual take in Alaska and Chukotka during 2006-15 was about 55 animals struck of which about 75% were successfully landed (Allison 2017, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>",Marine,"<p>Bowhead Whales were legally protected from commercial whaling under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) since its entry into force in 1948, and by its predecessor the Convention on the Regulation of Whaling since the 1930s.

Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling of Bowhead Whales is allowed by the IWC (the regulatory body established under the ICRW) from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock and off West Greenland on the basis of scientific advice (see <em>Threats</em> section). Hunting by indigenous people in Canada is co-managed by the federal government and regional bodies created under land-claim agreements. The Bowhead Whale has been included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Appendix I since 1975 and it is listed on the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals Appendix I.

In some cases, the pre-1972 species breakdown of “Sei” Whale catches can be determined from original records, or estimated, based on current knowledge of the geographical and seasonal occurrence of Sei and Bryde’s Whales, or from the compositions of later catches in the same area and season. The IWC Scientific Committee determined “low”, “best”, and “high” estimates of 20th century Bryde’s Whale catches in the North Pacific, totaling about 13,000, 17,000, and 27,000 respectively (IWC 2008), but the latest best estimate of the Bryde’s Whale catches in the North Pacific is about 20,000 (Allison 2017).</p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales were distinguished from Sei Whales in Peruvian catch statistics from 1973, and 3,589 are recorded as having been caught during 1973-83 (Allison 2017). Of the 2,639 “Sei” Whales reported caught during 1967-72, the majority were probably Bryde’s Whales, judging from the catch composition in 1973-77. </p>  <p>The current abundance estimate for the western and central North Pacific (west of 165°W) accepted by the IWC Scientific Committee is 26,300 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 18.5%) based on surveys conducted in summer during 1988-2016 (Hakamada <em>et al</em>. 2017, IWC 2018). </p>  <p>The most recent accepted abundance estimate for the East China Sea stock is 137 (IWC 1996). It was subject to whaling in southwestern Japan until the early 1970s, and may have been depleted (Omura 1977). Using photo-identification, Pheothep <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a population of 63±8 Bryde's Whales in the upper Gulf of Thailand. No other population estimates are available for southeast Asian waters.</p>  <p>Wade and Gerrodette (1993) estimated 13,000 (CV = 20%) Bryde’s Whales for the eastern tropical Pacific (in an irregularly-shaped area of 19 million km² between about 15°S and 25°N and extending westward towards Hawaii) from data collected during 1986-90. </p>  <p>An IWC/International Decade of Cetacean Research —later Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research — survey of the eastern equatorial Pacific (10°S-10°N, 80°-110°W) in December 1982 yielded an estimate of 17,000 (CV = 32%) Bryde’s Whales (IWC 1984), but the estimate should be recalculated using current methods. More recent surveys (2000-17) have been confined to certain coastal regions of Panama, Peru, Ecuador, and the Galápagos: 102 individuals were sighted including 4 resightings across years (Castro <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/> <br/> The number of Bryde's Whales in the Gulf of California has been estimated at 235 (range 173-327) (IWC 1996); these whales may belong to a wider eastern tropical Pacific population. </p>  <p><em>Southern Hemisphere</em><em><br/> </em>The Southern Hemisphere stocks of Bryde’s Whales have not been re-assessed since 1980, but the abundance estimates accepted at the time were: southern Indian Ocean − 13,854; western South Pacific − 16,585; and eastern South Pacific – 13,194 (IWC 1981). These estimates were not based on what are currently accepted methods of survey design and analysis. Based on a majority recommendation of the Scientific Committee, the IWC subsequently reset the classification of these stocks to “zero catch limit pending a satisfactory estimate of stock size” (IWC 1983).<br/> <br/> The South African inshore stock was estimated at 582 (±184) in 1983 (Best <em>et al</em>. 1984). Over 2,000 Bryde’s Whales are recorded as caught by modern whaling during 1911-67 in Cape Province, South Africa, including 1,300 during 1947-67 (Allison 2017). The relative proportions of the inshore and offshore forms in the catch are uncertain, because the two main South African land stations (Durban and Donkergat) were situated at the periphery of the ranges of the inshore and offshore populations (Best 2007).</p>  <p>No population estimates are available for the remainder of the South Atlantic. Of 2,536 “Sei” Whales taken by the pirate whaling ship <em>Sierra </em>in the South Atlantic during 1969-76, the majority are believed to have been Bryde’s Whales (IWC 1980). In addition, the majority or all of the 641 “Sei” Whale taken off Cape Lopez, Gabon during the 1950s are believed to have been Bryde’s Whales (Ruud 1952). Of the over 5,000 “Sei” Whales recorded as caught off Brazil during 1948-77, at least some were Bryde’s Whales: Omura (1962) and Williamson (1975) suggested that only 8% of the catches were Bryde’s Whales but most subsequent sightings and strandings of Sei/Bryde’s Whales in Brazilian waters have turned out to be Bryde’s Whales (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997). </p>  <p>In the western South Pacific, the number of Bryde’s Whales in the Hauraki Gulf was estimated to be 100-183 using photo-identification (Tezanos-Pinto <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p></span><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><em>Northern Indian Ocean<br/></em>Bryde’s Whales are distributed throughout the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal) but no population estimates exist for either region.

Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimate the generation time to be 18 years, in which case the time window for assessing the species against the decline criteria would be 1962-2016. Bryde's Whale catches are known with reasonable accuracy for this period, after making reasonable allowance for likely Bryde’s Whale catches recorded as Sei Whales, and total about 30,000, most of which were in the North Pacific (Allison 2017). Therefore, the global population of Bryde's Whales was probably not substantially reduced by whaling over this period.<br/><br/><em>Balaenoptera edeni edeni </em>may consist of a number of small inshore populations, for most of which estimates are not available or are in the low hundreds or fewer.

At least one form also occurs in the Red Sea. Migration to tropical waters in winter is documented for the southeastern Atlantic subpopulation (Best 2001) and for the northwestern Pacific subpopulation (Kanda <em>et al</em>. 2007). The migration patterns of other populations are poorly known. Their occurrence in the North Pacific is generally confined to waters warmer than 20°C (Omura 1959, Sasaki <em>et al</em>. 2013), but they are also found in colder waters off the west coast of southern Africa and northward to at least 3°N (off Cameroon) in the Benguela Current (Best 2001). <br/> &#160;<br/> <em>Pacific Ocean</em></p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales occur across the western and central North Pacific, mainly north of 20°N in summer and south of 20°N in winter. In the eastern North Pacific, they are rarely found as far north as southern California (U.S.A.), but they occur throughout the eastern tropical Pacific from the Gulf of California, Mexico southward to Peru (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). Phylogenetic analyses of available samples revealed that these whales were nominally <em>B. brydei</em>, of the type currently referred to as <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Kanda <em>et al</em>. 2007). They also occur throughout the rest of the tropical Pacific, and across the South Pacific southward to about 35°S, but with shifts in distributions between seasons (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996). They occur off the coasts of Peru and Ecuador, including the Galápagos Islands, perhaps throughout the year (Castro <em>et al</em>. 2017), and off Chile in an upwelling area between 35° and 37°S (Gallardo <em>et al.</em> 1983). All of a small number of genetic samples of Bryde’s Whales from Chile were assigned to <em>B. e. brydei</em>, and genetic samples of whales from Peru were also assigned to <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>In the southwestern Pacific, their distribution extends as far south as the North Island of New Zealand, where they occur year-round in the Hauraki Gulf (Baker and Madon 2007), and these whales have been genetically identified as <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Wiseman 2008). Bryde’s Whales taken under special permits by Japan in the western South Pacific north of New Zealand were also assigned phylogenetically to <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Kanda <em>et al</em>. 2007), as was a specimen taken to the north near the Kermadec Islands (Omura <em>et al</em>. 1981<em>, </em>Wada <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales, some of which appear to be resident, are found in the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) (Urbán and Flores 1996): these have been assigned phylogenetically to <em>B</em>. e. <em>brydei</em> (Viloria <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the small “Bryde’s Whales” taken in the Philippines artisanal whale hunt (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1996) included both <em>B. e. edeni</em> and <em>B. omurai </em>(Sasaki <em>et al</em>. 2006, LeDuc and Dizon 2002).</p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales that occur off southern and southwestern Japan are now considered to belong to an East China Sea population, having earlier been thought to be a local resident population (Yoshida and Kato 1999). Phylogenetic analyses show that they belong to <em>B. e. edeni (</em>Sasaki <em>et al. </em>2006, Kershaw <em>et al.</em> 2013). A stranding from Hong Kong in 1994 (LeDuc and Dizon 2002) and a rescued river-trapped individual in eastern Australia (Priddel and Wheeler 1998) have also been found to be closely related phylogenetically to the <em>B. edeni</em> clade represented by the Junge (1950) specimen from near Singapore and the southwestern Japan whales noted above (Sasaki <em>et al. </em>2006).</p>  <p><em>Indian Ocean</em></p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales occur throughout the Indian Ocean north of about 35°S. Those in the southern Indian Ocean appear to be large-type animals (Ohsumi 1980), as are the Bryde’s Whales found around the Maldives (Anderson 2005) and those of the northwestern Indian Ocean that were taken illegally by Soviet whaling fleets in the 1960s (Mikhalev 2000). All of these whales are assumed to be the offshore form <em>B. e. brydei, </em>and phylogenetically the whales from the southern Indian Ocean and the Maldives are in the <em>B. e. brydei </em>clade (Kershaw <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Kershaw <em>et al.</em> (2013) assigned Bryde’s Whales genetically sampled in coastal waters of Oman and Bangladesh to <em>B. e. edeni</em>.

The Junge (1950) specimen, used in recent studies as the genetic representative of <em>B. e. edeni</em>, is from Sugi Island, Sumatra, Indonesia.

Its main distribution is on Agulhas Bank between East London and Saldanha Bay (Best 2001). This population is closer phylogenetically to <em>B. e. brydei</em> and <em>B. borealis</em> than to <em>B. e. edeni</em> (Penry 2010). </p>  <p>Elsewhere in the Atlantic the distribution of Bryde’s Whales is not well known. They are observed regularly as far north as the Canary Islands and Madeira between June and November (Alves <em>et al.</em> 2010) and occasionally around the Azores (Steiner <em>et al</em>. 2007). One Madeira whale was identified genetically as <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Luksenburg <em>et al</em>. 2015). Bryde’s Whales are rarely found as far north as Cape Hatteras in the northwestern Atlantic (Rice 1998) and at least some of the records from the coast of the southeastern U.S.A. are a recently recognized taxon (subspecies or possibly species) that is found mainly in the Gulf of Mexico (Rosel and Wilcox 2014, Rosel <em>et al.</em> 2016). Bryde’s Whales have not been reported in the Mediterranean Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).</p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales occur throughout the wider Caribbean Sea (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001).

Samples of whales from Brazil have been assigned phylogenetically to <em>B. e. brydei</em><em></em>. However, considerable divergence was found between Bryde’s Whales from Brazil and those from Peru and Chile, which suggests that there are no direct movements of this species between the Atlantic and the Pacific (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p></span>","<p><span class=""datalabel1"">Between 2000 and 2016, up to 50 <span class=""datalabel1"">Bryde’s Whales were taken annually under special permit by Japan in the western North Pacific, but there are currently no plans to continue this catch.

The Bryde’s Whale is included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species although Japan has held a reservation against this listing since 1983.

For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The current global population size is uncertain due to lack of data from major parts of the range, especially from mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, rigorous evaluation against the criteria is not possible. However, plausible projections of the global mature population size indicate that it has probably recovered to over 30% of the level of three generations ago (1940) (i.e., reduction of &lt;70% over the last three generations) but has not necessarily yet reached 50% of that level; therefore, the Red List category is changed from Endangered to Vulnerable. It is important that existing data on abundance and distribution be worked up, and that data be collected in the areas where it is currently lacking, in order to verify to what extent the predicted recovery has occurred.&#160; <span class=""MsoCommentReference""></p>","<p>The available quantitative evidence suggests that the Fin Whale is a generalist feeder, sometimes preying heavily on fish but mostly on crustaceans. In Icelandic catches, 96% contained krill only, 2.5% a mixture of krill and fish, and 1.6% fish only (Sigurjónsson and Víkingsson 1997), while only 1 of 267 Fin Whales caught in the northeast Pacific off British Columbia, Canada, contained fish (Flinn<em> et al. </em>2002), and over 99% of stomachs with food in the Antarctic contained krill (Kawamura 1994). On the other hand, Overholtz and Nicolas (1979) reported apparent feeding by Fin Whales on American Sand Lance (Sand Eel),&#160;<em>Ammodytes americanus,</em> in the northwest Atlantic, and Mitchell (1972) found that Capelin, <em>Mallotus villosus</em>, comprised 80-90% of prey in Fin Whales caught off Newfoundland. Capelin abundance is extremely variable over time, and Fin Whales may feed opportunistically on Capelin in years with high abundance.<br/><br/>The Fin Whale is the fastest of the great whales, being able to maintain speeds of over 10 ms<sup>-1</sup> or 20 kn (Bose and Lien 1989). The high speed is likely an adaptation to avoid predation by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em>, (Ford and Reeves 2008) rather than to catch fast prey, because maximum speeds associated with lunge feeding are thought to be below 5 ms<sup>-1</sup> (Potvin <em>et al</em>. 2009). The apparent lack of winter breeding aggregations may also be an adaptation to avoid predation of calves, in the context of a flight rather than fight strategy to escape predation.&#160;</p>","<p>Prior to the advent of modern whaling in the late 19th century, Fin Whales were not subject to much human predation because they were hard to catch, but they were depleted worldwide by commercial whaling in the 20th century. Fin Whales have been protected in the Southern Hemisphere and North Pacific since 1976, and catches ceased in the North Atlantic by 1990, except for small “aboriginal subsistence” catches off Greenland. Commercial catches resumed off Iceland in 2006, but none have been taken in 2016 or 2017. A Japanese fleet resumed experimental catches of Fin Whales in the Antarctic in 2005, but this also has been discontinued. It seems unlikely that catching of Fin Whales will return to the high levels of previous years, not least due to the limited market demand for whale products.<br/> <br/> Fin Whales are one of the more commonly recorded species of large whale reported in vessel collisions (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001, IWC 2018d). An average of 2 collisions per year between Fin Whales and vessels was recorded off the U.S. east coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although reported incidents have been very few relative to the abundance of the species, most collisions involving large vessels are probably not detected, and to date there has been no satisfactory quantitative assessment of the actual risk. There is concern that collisions in the Mediterranean, especially in the main summering ground of Fin Whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Lyon where there are high densities of both whales and vessels, may be frequent enough to impact the population there (Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are also subject to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Nine cases of entanglement were recorded off the U.S. coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2017). Five entanglements involving Fin Whales worldwide were reported to the IWC Scientific Committee in 2017 (Hughes 2018). Although not all countries report, and some incidents will be missed by those that do, it appears likely that, globally, the threat from entanglement is low relative to the overall abundance of the species.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic<br/></em></strong>The Fin Whale was not easily catchable by early whalers due to its size and speed, but was heavily exploited from the start of mechanized whaling in 1864, particularly off Norway, Iceland, the Faeroes, and the British Isles. Whaling then spread to Spain, Greenland, and eastern Canada, and exploitation continued at a lower level until the 1980s. Fin whaling was phased out in the 1980s except for small catches off West Greenland. Catches resumed off western Iceland in 2007, but no catches have been taken there since 2015 (IWC 2018a).<br/> <br/> Catch statistics for the early years are incomplete: some are not divided into species, and a significant number of whales,&#160;perhaps 30-50%,&#160;were killed but lost due to lines breaking, etc. (Johnsen 1959, IWC 2017). The International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee has produced “best” and “high” estimates of Fin Whale kills in the North Atlantic totalling 98,000 and 115,000 respectively (IWC 2017).<br/><br/>Over the last three decades several sets of surveys have been conducted in the North Atlantic in summer to estimates the abundance of Fin Whales and other cetacean species. The most recent abundance estimates for each area are: East Greenland coastal 6,440 (CV 0.26) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018); East Greenland (excl. coastal), Iceland, and Faeroes 40,788 (CV 0.17) in 2015 (NASS2015 surveys, Pike <em>et al</em>. 2016); Norway and Jan Mayen 6,409 (CV 0.18) in 1996-2001 (Øien 2009); UK waters, North and Irish Seas, French and Spanish Atlantic waters and coast of Portugal 18,142 (CV 0.35) in 2016 (SCANS III surveys, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017); Atlantic Canada 3,522 (CV 0.27) in 2007 (Lawson and Gosselin 2009); U.S. east coast 1,595 (CV 0.33) in 2011 (Palka 2012); West Greenland 2,215 (CV 0.41) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018). The available estimates total about 79,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.13.&#160;These figures do not include the waters to the west of Ireland, where Fin Whales are fairly abundant. Data collected in Norwegian waters during 2002-17 have&#160; yet (May 2018) to be worked up.<br/><br/>Compared with previous estimates, the latest estimates show a substantial increase for the East Greenland–Iceland–Faroes area but an annual rate of increase that takes survey differences into account has not yet been calculated. The estimates for the Spain–Portugal–France–British Isles area show little change over the years from the first estimate of 17,355 (CV 0.27) obtained in 1989 (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). The trends in U.S., Canadian, western Greenlandic, and Norwegian waters have yet to be determined.<br/><br/>The overall increase in North Atlantic Fin Whales may represent a continuing recovery from past whaling, but it has also been hypothesized that the recovery was already essentially complete by 2000 and that the latest increase is due to environmental changes (Víkingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><strong><em>Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>Within the Mediterranean, the Fin Whale population was estimated in 1991 from surveys covering much of the western basin at 3,583 (CV 0.27) (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1996). Given the relative rarity of Fin Whales in the Mediterranean outside this area, a total population of about 5,000 for the Mediterranean is plausible (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The relative abundance in the Pelagos Sanctuary in the Gulf of Lyon has been monitored since 2009 from ferries on fixed routes, but the counts are too variable to estimate a trend (Cominelli <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Catches of about 7,000 Fin Whales taken in and near the Straits of Gibraltar during the 1920s depleted the local abundance and may have reduced a population migrating between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Sanpera and Aguilar 1992).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em><br/></strong>Some Fin Whales were likely taken by pre-modern whaling in Japan although the different species of <em>Balaenopter</em><em><em>a</em> were not always distinguished (Omura 1986). </em>A total of 76,000 Fin Whales are recorded taken by modern whaling in the North Pacific during 1910-75 (Allison 2017). The total killed is likely to be higher, because many or most of the approximately 6,500 unspecified whales taken during 1900-09 may have been Fin Whales, and in the early years of modern whaling there were likely, as in the North Atlantic, a substantial number of whales that were killed but not successfully landed. Fin Whales were legally protected from whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific from 1976, but small catches, reported at the time as Bryde’s Whales (<em>Balaenoptera edeni</em>), continued off Korea until 1981. These whales were probably from the East China Sea population.<br/><br/>North Pacific Fin Whale stocks have not been assessed in depth by the IWC Scientific Committee since 1973, when the assessment by Ohsumi and Wada (1974) was accepted. It was updated by Allen (1977). The stock in the western North Pacific was estimated to have declined from an “initial level” of 44,000 to 17,000 in 1975. The figures refer to the “exploitable” population, i.e., whales above the minimum allowed size at capture. Although these assessments were based on indices of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) that did not meet modern requirements for the analysis of such data (IWC 1989), there is no doubt that the populations declined substantially.<br/><br/>There is currently no population estimate for Fin Whales in the North Pacific as a whole, but one may become available once existing data holdings are worked up. The abundance information for each area is summarized here.<br/><br/>In surveys conducted in the Okhotsk Sea in 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2015, the Fin Whale was consistently the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (Miyashita 2004, Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011; Minamikawa <em>et al</em>. 2012, Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016) but the data have not yet been worked up to produce an abundance estimate.<br/><br/>The area of the northwestern Pacific bounded by the 170°E meridian, the coast of Japan, and the border of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone adjacent to Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands, has been surveyed during 2002-2015 by vessels associated with the JARPN II (2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programme in the North Pacific) programme. An estimate of about 4,000 Fin Whales (CV 0.4) was derived from data collected in July-August 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016).<br/><br/>The area between the 170°E and 135°W meridians. bounded to the north by the coast of Alaska and the Aleutian chain, was surveyed by the POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) international cruise in July and August over the years 2010-2012 (IWC 2018c). The data have not yet been worked up to yield an abundance estimate for Fin Whales, but the counts show that Fin Whales were approximately as abundant as Sei Whales, for which an estimate of about 30,000 whales (CV 0.24) has been calculated (Hakamada <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>It is planned to survey the Bering Sea in three parts over 2017-2019 under the POWER programme (IWC 2018c). The eastern Bering Sea was covered in 2017, and the Fin Whale was the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (<a href=""https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan"">https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan</a>). The eastern Bering Sea had previously been covered by U.S. fishery surveys, yielding an estimate of 1,061 (CV 0.38) Fin Whales (Friday <em>et al</em>. 2013). Zerbini <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated the abundance of Fin Whales to be 1,652 (CV ~0.2) in the coastal waters south of the Alaska Peninsula, which is included in the area surveyed by the 2011-12 POWER. An estimate of 4.8% for the annual rate of increase over the period 1987-2003 was obtained with nominal confidence limits of 4.1%-5.4%, but subsequent recalculation of the variance from the data indicates much lower precision (95% confidence limits -1.6% to +11.1% per year) (IWC 2009). In a survey of the western Bering Sea in 2005, Fin Whales (along with Humpback Whales) were the most frequently encountered species, but no abundance estimate has been calculated (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Based on surveys conducted during 2004-08, Best <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated the abundance Fin Whales in the waters of British Columbia (Canada) to be 329 (95% confidence interval (CI) 274-395).<br/><br/>The summer abundance off the west coast of the continental U.S.A. (Washington/Oregon/California) is estimated to have been 9,029 (CV 0.12) whales in 2014, while the average rate of increase over 1991-2014 was 7.5% per year. (Nadeem <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, the variation around the trend line was greater than would be expected from sampling variance alone, suggesting that a variable proportion of the population is found in the area each year.<br/><br/>This genetically isolated Gulf of California subpopulation was estimated in 2004 from a mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data at 613 (CI 426-970) (Díaz-Guzman 2006). There are no data on population trend for this subpopulation.<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>Along with other baleen whales, the IWC has traditionally managed Southern Hemisphere Fin Whales on the basis of six management areas, Areas I through VI, which are longitudinal pie slices 50°-70° wide. The areas were originally chosen as putative management stocks for Humpback Whales, and later used for all baleen whales, with little or no biological support (Donovan 1991).<br/><br/> Over 725,000 Fin Whales have been recorded caught in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905-76 (Allison 2017). There was a series of assessments in the 1970s, including a synthesis by Chapman (1976) which was reassessed for Area I by Breiwick (1977), and updated for Areas II-VI by Allen (1977). A later reassessment of Area VI Fin Whales was inconclusive (IWC 1980). <br/> <br/> These assessments were based on a combination of evidence, including trends in CPUE by whaling fleets, sighting rates by Japanese scouting vessels, and inferences on recruitment and mortality rates from age and length data. Their reliability is questionable on various grounds. For example, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently determined that CPUE data should only be used for stock assessments when the nature of the whaling operations is fully described (IWC 1989). A reanalysis of the historical data using modern methods and insights is warranted.<br/> <br/> Regular sightings surveys in the Antarctic south of 60°S were conducted under the IDCR/SOWER programmes in summer during 1978-2010 (IWC 2018) and the JARPA/II (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programmes in the Antarctic) in summer during 1987-2014 (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, only 55% of the historic summer catch taken during 1904-76 occurred south of 60°S, the remainder having been taken mainly between 50°-60°S. Hence there is probably considerable abundance outside the surveyed areas.<br/><br/>Circumpolar estimates from the IDCR/SOWER surveys increased from 2,100 during 1978-91 (CV 0.28) to 5,100 (CV 0.52) during 1991-98 (Branch and Butterworth 2001) but the more recent data do not appear to have been worked up. An extrapolation of the abundance estimate for 1978-91 to the area south of 30°S using Japanese Scouting Vessel data from 1978-88 yielded a circumpolar estimate of 15,000 (no variance given) (IWC 1996). The Scouting Vessel data were not collected according to any kind of statistical design and should be interpreted with caution.<br/><br/>Estimates from the JARPA/II surveys covering just half the Antarctic from 35°E to 145°W (southern Indian Ocean and south-west Pacific sectors) increased from 5,000 (CV 0.15) in 1996 to 17,600 (CV 0.26) in 2008, but large inter-annual fluctuations in the abundance suggested that the proportion of the population within the surveyed area varied from year to year (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). Approximately three-quarters of the historical catch came from within the 35°E-145°W sector.<br/><br/>Other data sources cover only limited areas and lack long enough time series to estimate trends. As examples, Viquerat and Herr (2017) estimated abundances of about 500 and 800 Fin Whales around Elephant Island and the South Orkneys respectively.<br/><br/>The current circumpolar abundance remains highly uncertain until all existing data are worked up and more data are collected from the zone 50°-60°S. Overall the information suggests a substantial increase has occurred, but the rate of increase is poorly quantified. All estimates of the rate of increase have very low precision but are compatible with an intrinsic growth rate of around 4-5% per year as assumed in the latest assessments.<br/><br/><strong><em>Biological parameters and assessment</em><br/> </strong>Estimates of age at sexual maturity for female Fin Whales, based on observed proportions mature by age, are 6-7 years in the Southern Hemisphere from British catches in the 1960s (Lockyer 1972) and Japanese catches in the 1960s and early 1970s (Mizroch 1981), but these values are likely negatively biased due to selection against smaller animals. For the North Atlantic, Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. (2013) report a value for Fin Whales caught off Iceland of around 8 years during 1965-89, increasing to 14 years during 2006-10, although the sample size in the later years was small. Aguilar <em>et al</em>. (1988) estimated 7.9 years from catches off Spain during 1979-84. There do not seem to be any precise values for the North Pacific, but Kimura (Ohsumi) <em>et al</em>. (1958) estimated 8-12 years. For the purpose of this assessment, the age at first reproduction of 10 years (9 years for age at sexual maturity) as estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007 is assumed. The values of other biological parameters (age at first capture, net recruitment rate, and natural mortality rate) were taken from the previous IWC Scientific Committee assessments (IWC 2017, Allen 1977).<br/><br/>The generation time for a non-depleted Fin Whale population is estimated to be 25.9 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The 3-generation window for application of the&#160;Red List&#160;A criterion is 1940-2018.<br/><br/>Because the available published assessments for this Fin Whales are not up to date, an illustrative population assessment is conducted here to enable estimation of a plausible population trajectory over the period 1940-2018 relative to the A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, it is reasonable to use conventional population assessment methods to provide a crude indication of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (“recruitment”) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately.<br/><br/>Based on the above (incomplete) information, the following population numbers (total, including immature whales) are assumed for the purpose of this Red list assessment:<br/></p><ul><li>North Atlantic: 70,000 whales in 2015; <br/></li><li>North Pacific: 50,000 whales in 2011; <br/></li><li>Southern Hemisphere: 25,000 whales in 2008.</li></ul><p>The parameter values are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material (which forms an integral part of this assessment). The estimated global trajectory for the number of mature individuals indicates that the 2018 mature population size is about 100,000 whales and may be around 45% of the 1940 level, which implies a classification of Vulnerable under the A1 criterion. According to this trajectory, there had already been considerable decline prior to 1940, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. For completeness it should be noted that other models have been posited that imply an increasing Fin Whale population prior to 1940 in the Southern Hemisphere (Mori and Butterworth 2006) but the pre-1940 period does not affect the Red List assessment against criterion A.</p>",Increasing,"<p>Fin Whales occur worldwide, mainly, but not exclusively, in offshore waters of the temperate and subpolar zones (Edwards&#160; <em>et al</em>. 2015). They show some poleward migration in summer but appear to be present at some level throughout their range throughout the year. Fin Whales are considered rare or absent in most of the tropics but were hunted off Peru and Ecuador and in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century (Allison 2017), and are still occasionally observed in the tropics, for example off Peru (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009) and the Seychelles (Keller <em>et al</em>. 1982). There do not seem to remain any confirmed records from the northern Indian Ocean, after correcting misidentifications (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic and Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>In the North Atlantic, the Fin Whale’s range extends as far as Svalbard (Norway) in the northeast (but rarely far into the Barents Sea), to the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay (Canada and Greenland) in the northwest (but rarely into the inner Canadian Arctic), to the Canary Islands (Spain) in the southeast, and to the Antilles in the southwest (Rice 1998, Perry <em>et al.</em> 1999), but it is rare in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001), where the few recorded strandings may be extralimital vagrants (Whitt <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Their main summer range in the northwestern Atlantic extends from Cape Hatteras (U.S.A.) (39°N) northward (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). They occur in summer (and possibly year-round) west and east of Greenland, around Iceland and the Faroe Islands and along the Iceland-Faroes ridge, and to a lesser extent in the Norwegian Sea and around Jan Mayen (Øien 2009). They occur off the northern and western British Isles and in the Bay of Biscay off northwestern Spain but are rare in the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). They regularly occur off the Azores in spring (Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011) and have been detected acoustically west of Madeira (32°N) in winter (Castellotti <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>While there may be some north-south migration between summer and winter, it appears from acoustic data that at least male North Atlantic Fin Whales are present throughout most of the range throughout the year (Morano <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are present in the central and western Mediterranean, mainly north and east of the Balearic Islands, and appear to be a mixture of a resident population and one migrating between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic (Notabartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2016). The area of abundance seems to be concentrated in the Ligurian Sea and the Gulf of Lyon in summer, but expands to cover much of the western and central Mediterranean in winter. Fin Whales are rare in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, do not penetrate far into the Adriatic or Aegean Seas, and are not present in the Black Sea. In the 20th century, Fin Whales were caught year-round near the Straits of Gibraltar (Allison 2017) and observations in this century show Fin Whales leaving her Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar&#160; during May-October and (mostly) entering the Mediterranean during November-April (Gauffier <em>et al</em>. 2018); the observations of calves leaving the Mediterranean during May-July suggests they were born there.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific<br/></em></strong>In the eastern North Pacific, Fin Whales occur year-round off the central and southern California coast. They occur in summer off the entire coast of western North America from California into the Gulf of Alaska and along the Aleutian Islands. Fin Whales marked off California in winter were recaptured in summer by whaling operations along the entire coast, suggesting migration (Mizroch <em>et al</em>. 2009). Offshore, Fin Whales occur across the North Pacific north of 40°N, at least from May to September in summer, with some tendency for a northward shift in distribution in high summer, when they enter the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Melnikov <em>et al</em>. 2017) and are also found along the east coast of Kamchatka (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017) and between Kamchatka and the Commander Islands (Miyashita 2006). They also occur in the Sea of Japan (Miyashita 2006). Fin Whales occur in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and have recently been detected as far as Point Barrow in the northeastern Chukchi, which may be an indication of a northward expansion as the Arctic warms (Crance <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are abundant in the offshore western North Pacific north of about 35°N in summer, and in the coastal waters of Hokkaido and northeastern Honshu (Japan) (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2016), but in recent years have only rarely been seen off central and southern Japan or around the Korean peninsula at any time of year (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017, Sohn <em>et al</em>. 2012). Both are areas where large catches were taken in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Fin Whales in the East China Sea are thought to belong to a distinct subpopulation from those of the North Pacific (Fujino 1960), and it is possible that the Korean and southern Japanese catches came from this stock. There were a few net catches in the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait in the early 2000s (CRI 2005-07).<br/><br/>Fin Whales occur, albeit in small numbers, in Hawaiian waters in both summer and winter (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The winter distribution in the North Pacific poorly known. While there appears to be some migration, acoustic data suggest that overall there is little seasonality in distribution, but that there is seasonality in the amount of vocalization (Watkins <em>et al</em>. 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>The Fin Whales inhabiting the Gulf of California appear to be a resident, genetically isolated subpopulation (Bérubé <em>et al.</em> 2002). Telemetry information has shown year-round residency in this area, with seasonal latitudinal movements (Urbán <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Southern Hemisphere<br/></em></strong>Some Fin Whales penetrate into the high Antarctic, along with Blue (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), Minke (<em>B. bonaerensis</em>) and Humpback Whales (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>), but are rarely seen in the pack ice. The Fin Whale summer distribution also extends into middle latitudes, as evidenced by both sightings and past catches (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Allison 2017). Fin Whales were abundant in summer in the Southern Ocean from 40°S to Antarctica in the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian Ocean sectors, and south of 50°-55°S in other sectors. Recent (post-whaling) data on Fin Whales in the Southern Ocean are available mainly for the area south of 60°S: for example, the international circumpolar IDCR/SOWER surveys under the auspices of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1978-2009 (IWC 2019) which showed that Fin Whales were still distributed in all sectors of the Antarctic, but with a much reduced abundance (Branch and Butterworth 2001); more recently, surveys around the South Orkneys and the South Shetlands (Viquerat and Herr 2017, Joiris and Dochy 2013) found substantial local densities of Fin Whales.&#160;An area of suspected high Fin Whale density to the south of Bouvet Island (55°-57°S 0-5°E) was confirmed by a sighting survey conducted there in December 2006 (Ensor <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Large numbers of Fin Whales were caught by whalers operating out of whaling stations on South Georgia (55°S) during 1904-65, but the species was rarely seen there in the ensuing three decades (Moore <em>et al</em>. 1999). Sightings have become more frequent lately but have not yet been quantitatively evaluated (Richardson 2012).<br/><br/>Outside the Antarctic, Fin Whales were caught in substantial numbers off the southwestern and southeastern coasts of southern Africa in winter, and in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century were also taken in the coastal waters of Mozambique, Angola, Congo, and Gabon (Best 1994), but they are very rare on the western coasts of southern and equatorial Africa today (Weir 2010, 2011). Catch rates of Fin Whales off South Africa declined to near zero by the early 1970s coincident with the severe depletion by whaling in the Southern Ocean, which suggests that this was a wintering ground for a population that migrated to the south in summer (Best 2003).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught off the coast of Peru, mainly in the austral winter, until catches petered out in the early 1970s. Sightings of Fin Whales in the eastern equatorial Pacific since whaling ended in 1976 have been relatively few, in contrast to Blue Whales which continued to be sighted frequently (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Landa <em>et al</em>. 1983, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught from several stations along the coast of Chile from 20° to 44°S from the early 20th century until 1983, but very few were caught after 1970. Catches were taken in all seasons but few in winter; the whales were typically small, with a modal length of 16-17m for each sex, compared with 20-21m (males) and 21-22m (females) for Fin Whales caught by Antarctic fleets. Given the lack of genetic distinction between fin whales in Chile and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere (Pérez-Álvarez <em>et al</em>. 2018) and the recovery in the Antarctic of marks placed in Fin Whales off Chile (Clarke 1978), it is likely that the Chilean Fin Whales were juvenile Southern Fin Whales <em></em> rather than a race of small Fin Whales (Cooke 2019). In recent years, Fin Whales have been observed in nearshore Chilean waters from 23° to 29ºS during spring and summer and seen to be feeding there (Pérez <em>et al</em>. 2006, Pacheco <em>et al</em>. 2015, Toro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Toro <em>et al</em>. classed 502 out of 519 Fin Whale sightings around the Chanaral and Choros Islands (29°S) in summer and fall as ""adults"" but used a size criterion of 17m developed for the smaller North Atlantic Fin Whale; hence the ""adults"" could have included whales of any age class except calves of the year. Pacheco <em>et al</em>. reported two mother-calf pairs off northern Chile (Mejillones Bay, 23°S) in spring 2006.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are now rare in Brazilian waters, but there is virtually no information from the period before the depletion of the whales around South Georgia (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997). A few were taken in a brief period of whaling in southern Brazil in the early 1960s.<br/><br/>Apart from the above-mentioned wintering grounds, the winter distribution of Fin Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is poorly known. Some may remain in the far south while some may disperse into oceanic areas in temperate latitudes. Acoustic detections of Fin Whales in the Antarctic peak in the autumn (May) and are absent in winter and spring, but this may reflect seasonality of vocalization as much as presence/absence (Širović <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><strong><em>Other areas</em></strong><br/>The only confirmed records from Indonesia are two strandings in 1937 and 1975 (Rudolph <em>et al</em>. 1997), which may have been vagrants. A reported sighting off Sarawak (Malaysia) in 1999 (de Boer 2000) is unconfirmed.<br/><br/>The map shows where the species may occur based on a synthesis of occurrence records and oceanography. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are included in the list of native range states.</p>","<p>Large-scale commercial harvesting of this species appears to have ceased, the last catches having been taken in the Antarctic in 2012 and in the North Atlantic in 2015 (IWC 2018a) but frozen products are probably still in trade. The latest entry in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Trade Database was an export of 2,546 tonnes of Fin Whale meat from Iceland to Japan in 2014, but only 1,624 tonnes appear to have reached Japan (CITES 2017).</p>",Marine,"<p>The IWC set catch limits at zero for Fin Whales in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere starting in 1976. The IWC adopted a provision (popularly known as the commercial whaling moratorium) in 1982 to set all catch limits for commercial whaling to zero from 1986, but Iceland, Norway, and the Russian Federation have lodged objections or reservations to the provision. Limited hunting of Fin Whales off western Greenland is permitted for “aboriginal subsistence” purposes.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are listed on Appendix I of CITES, but this does not apply to Iceland, Norway, and Japan, who hold reservations. Fin Whales are also listed on Appendices I and II of the Convention on Management of Migratory Species (CMS). Under the Agreement for Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black and Mediterranean Seas, Fin Whales in the Mediterranean, along with other cetaceans, are protected from deliberate killing by signatories to the agreement.</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is therefore classified as Least Concern.&#160;</p>","The stomachs of the two&#160;Pygmy Right Whales taken by whaling operations of the former Soviet Union (Ivashin 1972) and a juvenile stranded individual (Sekiguchi <em>et al.</em> 1992) contained mainly calanoid copepods. Seasonal inshore movements of Pygmy Right Whales may be related to the availability of food in spring and summer (Kemper 2018). It has been suggested that there are hotspots of occurrence in places where mesozooplankton, particularly <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em> and <em>Calanus tonsus, </em>are abundant (Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2013).<p>  </p>  <p></p>","This poorly known species has never been targeted by commercial hunts although at least two Pygmy Right Whales were taken by whalers between 1960 and 1970 in the South Atlantic (Ivashin <em>et al.</em> 1972). Of the over 100 strandings documented in Australia and New Zealand since 1980, one appeared to have involved entanglement in fishing gear (Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2013). One carcass of a whale suspected to be have been killed by a ship strike was recovered in South Australia in 2008 (Australia 2008). Three animals were caught in nets in False Bay, South Africa during 1957-65, two of which were released (Ross <em>et al</em>. 1975). In view of the relatively low level of human activity in most of its range, this temperate Southern Hemisphere species is probably not threatened by human causes at this time.<p>  </p>","<p></p><p>  </p>The Pygmy Right Whale is one of the least known baleen whale species, and there are too few records to attempt an estimate of population size, even to an order of magnitude. The three sightings of large groups mentioned above represent the bulk of the recorded sightings of live individuals to date. Apart from these three schools, most sightings have been of one or two individuals, sometimes in association with other species of whales and dolphins. The inconspicuous, small blow and quick, shallow surfacing of Pygmy Right Whales make them difficult to spot and identify at sea, such that the species might not be as uncommon as the small number of records suggests.<br/><br/>As might be expected, recorded live sightings exhibit clustering around areas with substantial on-the-water human presence, such as Auckland, Hobart, and Adelaide. The greater frequency of sightings and strandings in the summer months may simply be due to a seasonal increase in observation effort. The time series of strandings in Australia and New Zealand from 1980-2007 shows no obvious trend&#160;with records&#160;in southern Australia&#160;from&#160;all months and in New Zealand from all months&#160;except February and March&#160;(Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2013).  <p></p><br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>The Pygmy Right Whale probably has a circumpolar distribution in temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere between about 30°S and 55°S (extending to 20°S in at least the Benguela Current (southwestern African continental shelf) (Hoffmann and Best 2005, Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2013). There are only a few confirmed records of live whales at sea, but strandings have been reported from Argentina, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Namibia, South Africa, Chile, western, southern, and eastern coasts of Australia, and North and South Islands of New Zealand (Cabrera <em>et al.</em> 2005, Best 2007, Kemper 2002, Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rice 1998, Ross <em>et al.</em> 1975).<br/><br/>Two Pygmy Right Whales were taken by a whaling vessel in the South Atlantic between 34° and 35°S (Ivashin <em>et al.</em> 1972). An aggregation of about 80 whales was seen in November 1992 at 42°S about 750 km south of Cape Leeuwin, southwestern Australia (Matsuoka <em>et al.</em> 1996). A group of 14 was sighted in January 2001 at 46°S in the South Pacific about 450 km southeast of Christchurch, New Zealand (Matsuoka <em>et al.</em> 2005).

Recent research indicates a relatively large population at the southern limit of the species range: estimated population size is 6,345 individuals (95% CI 3,573–11,267) along ~ 390 km of coastline from Table Bay to Lambert’s Bay (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009), with further unpublished research indicating similar population densities at two sites in Namibia (Elwen unpublished data). Thus, it can be inferred that there are certainly &gt;1,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The species does not appear to clearly meet any of the Red List Criteria for a threatened status. However, there is considerable uncertainty around both population structure and total population size and there is no information on trend. Several threats have been identified, including entanglement in a variety of inshore fishing gears (e.g., beach seines, purse seines, trawls, and gillnets). Additionally, competition with Hake (<em>Merluccius</em> spp.) fisheries may represent an indirect threat, as although Heaviside’s Dolphins remain largely inshore of the fishing activity, juvenile hake are significant prey. Potentially emerging threats include an experimental mid-water trawl fishery for Horse Mackerel (<em>Trachurus capensis</em>) operating off the west coast of South Africa and industrial development, notably marine phosphate mining on the Namibian shelf, and port and mining infrastructure expansion projects in both Walvis Bay and Lüderitz, two high-density areas for Heaviside’s Dolphins. As this species is limited by water temperature, climate change represents an additional emerging threat.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Guidelines state that “if LC, NT, and VU are considered to be equally plausible categories, the taxon may be categorized as NT.” In the absence of quantitative data from areas outside the Table Bay–Lambert’s Bay segment of coastline, the possibility that there are &lt;10,000 mature individuals cannot be ruled out, nor can a projected continuing decline of at least 10% over three generations given the known and emerging threats. Therefore, it is plausible that the species meets criterion C for VU but it is also plausible that number of mature individuals in unstudied parts of the range would push the total above 10,000. As a near-shore species with a very restricted range in a poorly studied region, Heaviside’s Dolphin is considered Near Threatened. This lends emphasis to the importance of quantifying mortality rates and improving estimates of abundance for the total species range.</p>","<p>Heaviside’s Dolphin is a coastal, shelf-dwelling species seen mainly in waters less than 100 m deep (Best and Abernethy 1994) throughout the cold, northward-flowing Benguela Current. More than 85% of sightings have been in water with surface temperatures of 9-15°C (Best and Abernethy 1994). Evidence from photo-identification (Elwen 2008, Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b) and satellite-linked tagging (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2014) indicated small home ranges between 50 and 80 km along shore, but with some animals also moving offshore to at least the 100 m isobath.<br/><br/>Throughout most of their range, Heaviside’s Dolphins show a strong diurnal <span class=""msoIns"">i<span class=""msoDel"">nshore-offshore movement pattern (Elwen <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2010) driven by resting and socializing inshore by day and nocturnal foraging in deep water on prey associated with the deep scattering layer. The dominant prey taken by Heaviside’s Dolphins are shallow-water species or life-stages, for example juvenile Hake (<em>Merluccius capensis</em>), Goby (<em>Sufflogobius bibartus</em>) and Horse Mackerel, as well as cephalopods, including octopus (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 1992). Most fish eaten by Heaviside’s Dolphins are well below the modal length of commercially caught fish (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 1992), and there is little spatial overlap in fishing effort and dolphin habitat (Fairweather <em>et al.</em> 2006).</span></p>","<p>In general, Heaviside’s Dolphins appear to face fewer threats than other members of its genus. Although fully protected legally, some killing with hand-thrown harpoons or guns was reported in the past (Rice and Saayman 1984, Best and Abernethy 1994). Heaviside’s Dolphins are susceptible to entanglement in inshore fishing gears such as beach seines, purse seines, trawls, and gillnets (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Bycatch in commercial fisheries appears to be low, although an experimental mid-water trawl fishery for Horse Mackerel operating off the South Africa west coast is of concern. Heaviside’s Dolphin bycatch must be monitored and the potential effects of the full-scale operation should be considered if there is evidence of significant mortality of dolphins in this fishery.<br/><br/>Information on organochlorine pollutant levels in a small sample of Heaviside’s Dolphins from the South African west coast indicated no significant exposure to DDT (De Kock <em>et al</em>. 1994). A more recent analysis of heavy metals in the skin of Heaviside’s Dolphins from South Africa and Namibia revealed that while levels were higher than expected for some metals, sampled individuals were deemed to be at low risk of lethal poisoning (Serot 2013). The scarcity of arable land, low rainfall and scarcity of rivers throughout the species range may help to limit pollutants entering the marine environment.<br/><br/>The impacts of marine mining, notably sediment dredging for phosphates, on the marine environment are not well understood but include direct destruction of the seabed and benthic fauna, release of hazardous material into the ocean, and reduced light penetration (Currie 2012). In addition, proposed onshore processing plants, at least in Namibia, are in or near known high use areas for the species at the ports of Walvis Bay and Lüderitz.<br/><br/>Due to the limited range of temperatures occupied by the animals within the Benguela Ecosystem (a cold-water system surrounded by warmer waters), Heaviside’s Dolphins have been identified as one of the cetacean species most at risk from large perturbations associated with global climate change (MacLeod 2009).<br/><br/>Low human population densities and the scarcity of large ports along most of the species’ range probably help reduce adverse effects from boat traffic at a population level, although high site fidelity of the species may result in localized impacts.</p>","<p>No range-wide survey has been conducted for Heaviside's Dolphins. However, abundance estimates from photographic mark-recapture studies are available at several locations in South Africa and Namibia. A three-year study between Cape Town and Lambert’s Bay, South Africa estimated 527 animals (95% confidence interval (CI) 272–1,020) using 20 km of coastline in western Saint Helena Bay over six weeks of survey effort; 3,429 animals (95% CI 1,721–6,828), using the 150 km of coastline around Saint Helena Bay, over three summer seasons; and 6,345 animals (95% CI 3,573–11,267) using the full ~390 km of coastline from Table Bay to Lambert’s Bay (estimated between two summer field seasons; Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b). Sighting rates within this latter area ranged from 0 to nearly 2 groups per km (mean group size = 4.5, for 10 km long sections of coastline; Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Estimates are also available from two high-use areas in Namibia (Walvis Bay: 508 animals, 95% CI 461–833, over eight weeks; and Lüderitz: 494 animals, 95% CI 403–607, 14 survey days within one year).<br/><br/>The species has exhibited high site fidelity over several years (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b) and this may affect population structure and limit gene flow between high-density sites. An assessment of genetic diversity and population genetic structure was conducted for this species using both mtDNA control region sequences and 13 microsatellite loci using 395 biopsy skin samples collected from free-ranging dolphins along the South African (Table Bay, Saint Helena Bay, Lambert’s Bay, Hondeklipbaai, and Port Nolloth) and Namibian (Lüderitz and Walvis Bay) coastlines. Both genetic markers rejected the hypothesis of one homogeneous population, but results were somewhat contrasting. MtDNA control region data indicated six genetically differentiated putative populations among the seven sampling sites, with Hondeklipbaai and Port Nolloth grouping as one subpopulation, whilst the microsatellite data provided a different, but not mutually exclusive, signal, clustering the dolphins into a northern population (comprised of Lambert’s Bay, Hondeklipbaai, Port Nolloth, Lüderitz Bay, and Walvis Bay) and a southern population that included the animals in Table Bay and St. Helena Bay (Gopal 2014). Overall, there appear to be two primary populations (northern and southern), but within each there is some limited structure suggesting that gene flow is not entirely open between sites. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution of the mitochondrial sequences indicated a departure from mutation-drift equilibrium due to a population expansion at the two extremes of the geographic range, but not towards the middle of the distribution. Small but significant genetic differentiation was indicated by the two markers (Gopal 2014). Whilst considerable progress was made towards understanding the population genetic structure of Heaviside's dolphins in this first study that covered a large geographic range, further genetic research, including information on relatedness, kin associations, and mating patterns, would improve understanding of population status and facilitate identification of management units for conservation.</p>",Unknown,"Heaviside’s Dolphins have a limited range, restricted to southwestern Africa (southern Angola to Cape Point, South Africa), with records from about 17°S to the southwestern tip of the continent. They are commonly seen along the west coast of South Africa in the Cape Town region (Rice 1998, Dawson 2002). Records extend along the entire west coast of South Africa and Namibia, and into southern Angola (Best 2007), with the exact northern limit of the species range poorly known, but possibly variable due to natural fluctuations in water temperature at the northern end of the Benguela ecosystem.","Some illegal hunting has been reported, but it is probably not at a significant level (Best and Abernethy 1994, Best 2007). There is presently no known trade in the region, although some localized, illegal hunting or opportunistic use of by-caught animals may still take place on the South African west coast. No data are available on directed catches or bycatch in Angola.",Marine,"<p></p><p></p><p>Heaviside’s Dolphins are  listed in Appendix II of the Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species.<br/> <br/> More information is needed on the distribution of the species in Angolan waters in particular, as well as on the nature and extent of incidental catches. More research emphasis should in future also be placed on possible detrimental interactions due to the overfishing of prey stocks, especially Hake. Increased inshore fishing pressure will inevitably increase interactions between the fisheries and Heaviside’s Dolphins (Peddemors 1999).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Combining the most current abundance estimates for the various subpopulations results in a total of more than 195,000 whales. Given that there are no estimates for most of the Russian High Arctic, total abundance is likely more than 200,000. At least four subpopulations number more than 20,000 individuals. Some subpopulations are reduced below historical levels and some small subpopulations are declining but data are not adequate to assess overall population reduction or trend. As a species, Beluga Whales do not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and are listed as Least Concern.</p>  <p>Belugas in Cook Inlet have been assessed by IUCN as a separate subpopulation and are classified on the Red List as Critically Endangered (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2012). Several other subpopulations are small, declining, and/or occupy restricted areas, and warrant Red List assessment at the subpopulation level.</p>","Belugas are relatively well-studied as a result of carcass sampling conducted in association with hunting (Heide-Jørgensen and Teilmann 1994, Suydam 2009) along with a considerable amount of satellite-linked radio-tracking (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005), and aerial survey efforts (Moore, 2000, Belikov and Boltunov 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/> Belugas occupy estuaries, continental shelf and slope waters, and deep  ocean basins in conditions of open water, loose ice, and heavy pack ice  (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). In summer, they are found in coastal waters as shallow as 1–3 m deep and also in offshore waters thousands of meters deep. They typically enter estuaries and sometimes move upstream into rivers; there are records of individuals or small groups ranging hundreds of kilometers from the sea (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Belugas generally prefer to overwinter in areas with light or highly moveable ice cover (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2001, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017) and may occur as fully Arctic subpopulations (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998b, <em></em> 2001; Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or Subarctic subpopulations (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> Some Belugas undertake large-scale annual migrations between summering and wintering sites (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while others remain in the same area year-round, shifting offshore only when excluded from coastal habitat by fast-ice formation (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). Large numbers of migratory Belugas occur along the northwestern and northern Alaskan coast, in the Canadian high Arctic, and in western Hudson Bay. At certain times of the year, those whales migrate thousands of kilometers, in some cases as far as 80°N into dense pack ice (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or thousands of kilometers into the North Water polynya or to the pack ice off West Greenland (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). In some areas, beluga distribution appears to be determined by sea ice extent, with belugas shifting offshore during low-ice years to maintain associations with the marginal ice zone (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Non-migratory Belugas that generally make seasonal shifts in distribution of less than a few hundred kilometers are found in Cook Inlet, Cumberland Sound, Svalbard, and the St. Lawrence Estuary (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Kingsley 2002, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> While the general features of Beluga Whale habitat can be described for the relatively well-studied subpopulations, the importance of those features is not well understood (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). For example, the summer occupation of nearshore/estuarine waters has been ascribed alternatively to feeding (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1982), to warm water providing a thermal advantage to neonates (Sergeant and Brodie 1969), and to the presence of fresh water and coarse substrates facilitating skin shedding during molt (St. Aubin <em>et al</em>. 1990, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993). The relative importance of each of those factors likely varies according to the environmental conditions (e.g., water temperatures and prey availability) specific to each of the summering areas (Frost and Lowry 1990). Similarly, it is unclear why Belugas sometimes move into deep, ice-covered waters (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2016). One potential reason would be to avoid predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992). However, movements into the ice appear excessive for what would be needed to avoid Killer Whales (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and actually could expose Belugas to predation by Polar Bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987) as well as increase the risk of entrapment in the ice. It is possible that Belugas move into ice-covered offshore regions for feeding, primarily on Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), but few data are available to test this hypothesis (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, the associations of Belugas with features such as the continental shelf break and slope (Moore 2000, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017) may be related to biophysical processes that produce good feeding conditions (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/> <br/> Beluga dives may last more than 20 minutes and can reach depths of more than 900 m (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Beluga has a diverse diet, which varies greatly from area to area. Although various species of fish are considered to be the primary prey items (including Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.), Herring (<em>Clupea </em>spp.), and Arctic Cod), Belugas also feed on a wide variety of mollusks (such as squid and octopus) and benthic crustaceans (shrimps and crabs) (Quakenbush <em>et al</em>. 2015, Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas throughout their Arctic range (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992).","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease. Belugas are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance varies among the many Beluga subpopulations.</p><p>Hunting for human consumption is the biggest known threat to Belugas  across certain portions of their range. The most immediate concerns  relate to continuing harvests from small and depleted subpopulations (IWC  2000). The strong philopatry of Belugas, which causes them to return to  the same estuaries year after year, makes them highly vulnerable to  overexploitation. This behavioural trait is undoubtedly the most  important natural factor that has led to the extirpation of Belugas from  some parts of their range by a combination of commercial and  subsistence hunting (e.g., in southwestern Greenland and some river  mouths in Ungava Bay, Canada). In nearly all regions hunting is now  being controlled by limiting takes to sustainable levels (see  the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section).<br/> </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial reduction in the seasonal extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as changes in timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Belugas occur only in regions where sea ice occurs at least seasonally, suggesting a strong connection with sea ice influenced habitat. However, Belugas from some subpopulations spend many months in open water far from any ice while others spend most of their time in regions with sea ice concentrations up to 90%, indicating that the species as a whole has substantial flexibility in its relationships with ice (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). Belugas that occupy ice covered areas may do so for feeding on abundant ice-associated species such as Arctic Cod (<em></em>Loseto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Changes in the distribution and characteristics of sea ice will result in changes in productivity and prey species types and abundance (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008, Haug <em>et al</em>. 2017) but the potential costs or benefits to Belugas of such changes are not known. Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992) and it is generally assumed that concentrated sea ice provides Belugas some degree of refuge from predation. There is good evidence that Killer Whales are expanding their range in Arctic regions where sea ice has been declining (Higdon and Ferguson 2009, Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Belugas are susceptible to entrapment when sea ice conditions change rapidly and if they cannot escape they may die or be preyed upon by Polar Bears <em></em> and/or humans (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/></p>  <p>Known or potential threats include a variety of human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is allowing increases in the scale and distribution of some of those activities in areas previously covered with heavy ice. Ongoing and expanding oil and gas development, along with commercial shipping, is likely to impact habitats used by Belugas. Such impacts may be especially acute in shipping routes such as the Northwest Passage which traverses much of the summering habitat of belugas in Canada and Greenland (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas such as the Mackenzie Delta, West Greenland, and the Barents Sea are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which may include seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by icebreaking and shipping. Much of this activity is undertaken in the summer months in the same areas occupied by Belugas. In a study of responses of Belugas to icebreaking ships, the whales typically moved rapidly along ice edges away from approaching ships and showed strong avoidance reactions to approaching ships at distances of 35–50 km (Finley <em>et al</em>. 1990, Erbe and Farmer 2000). Expansion of commercial fisheries into new Arctic regions may have implications for bycatch of Belugas in fishing gear and depletion of Beluga prey resources. Construction of dams for hydroelectric development in the Hudson Bay area and along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence may have affected Belugas because of their dependence on estuarine conditions (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p> Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants from those sources that are high enough to cause impacts on health (Ross 2000). Threats from contaminants are of concern for Belugas in some areas. High levels of several contaminants have been found in Belugas sampled in the Canadian Arctic (Braune <em>et al</em>. 2005). Studies of the SLE Beluga subpopulation have found that concentrations of both total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated PCB congeners are much higher than in Belugas in the Arctic. Some scientists believe that the increased occurrence of opportunistic bacterial infections, parasitic infestation, gastric ulcers and other disorders in SLE Belugas is evidence of a link between immune system dysfunction and PCB exposure (Martineau <em>et al</em>., 1994). SLE Belugas also have elevated tissue levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (flame retardants) (Lebeuf <em>et al</em>. 2004). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Belugas are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2005). Significant epizootics have not been recorded in Belugas, but serological screenings document pathogen exposure (e.g., Alekseev <em>et al</em>. 2009) and necropsies find a variety of health issues (e.g., Martineau <em>et al</em>. 1988). Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. (2016) found low level exposure to biotoxins (domoic acid 2 of 15 tested and saxitoxin 1 of 12 tested) in Beluga samples from Cook Inlet. A mass mortality event in summer 2008 in the SLE, which included several Belugas, was linked to an intense bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate <em>Alexandrium tamarense</em> (Starr <em>et al.</em> 2017).  Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could impact disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p>The global Beluga population consists of multiple subpopulations with varying degrees of differentiation and abundance (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to the lack of sampling, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee organized information on Belugas on the basis of 29 provisional management stocks (IWC 2000), and a recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 21 stocks (NAMMCO in prep.).<br/></p>    <p>Stocks are generally based on nearshore areas (principally fjords, bays, and estuaries) where Belugas congregate during part of the open water season. Satellite telemetry, genetic studies, and organochlorine analyses have shown that Belugas have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2002; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, de March <em>et al</em>. 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Palsbøll <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some stock boundaries overlap spatially and seasonally during winter and during the spring and fall migrations (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014). For stocks that winter in the Bering Sea, limited satellite tracking data suggest that areas used generally do not overlap in the same year, suggesting that Belugas from different stocks have traditional winter ranges that are mostly exclusive (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/></p>  <p>While good abundance estimates are available for some Beluga subpopulations, the sizes of others are virtually unknown or only roughly approximated (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Available information is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Okhotsk Sea</strong></p>  <p>Belugas occur in two well-separated regions of the Okhotsk Sea.<em> </em>In the northeastern region, they summer along the coast and in estuaries of Shelikhov Bay and winter along the ice edge of the Bay and northwestern Kamchatka.<em> </em>Based on surveys in 2010, Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated there were 1,333 surface-visible Belugas in the northeastern Okhotsk Sea, resulting in an estimate of 2,666 total whales when corrected for availability bias (animals not seen because they were diving). In the western Okhotsk Sea, Belugas occur in the northern Sakhalin Bay and Amur River region as well as several smaller bays along the Shantar coast (Ulbansky Bay, Udskaya Bay, Tugursky Bay and Nikolskaya Bay.<em> </em>There Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated 4,780 visible Belugas and 9,560 in total. The population trend is unknown in both regions. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Alaska and Western Canada</strong></p>  <p>Five subpopulations of Belugas are known to occur in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. All five winter in the Bering Sea (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations migrate northward in spring and spend summer and early fall well north of Bering Strait (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while the Bristol Bay, Anadyr Gulf, and eastern Bering Sea subpopulations remain in the Bering Sea south of Bering Strait (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2016, NAMMCO in prep., Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC) unpublished data). </p>  <p>Bristol Bay Belugas have been counted using aerial surveys conducted periodically between 1993 and 2016.<em> </em>Correction factors to account for animals missed were applied to counts made in 2004 and 2005 (Lowry <em>et al. </em>2008) which produced an abundance estimate of 2,887 whales (Muto <em>et al. </em>2016).<em> </em>Similar correction factors applied to the 2016 count resulted in a population estimate of 3,166 whales (ABWC unpublished data). Lowry <em>et al. </em>(2008) reported that counts of Bristol Bay Belugas increased by 4.8% per year during 1993-2005 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–7.5%). The estimate based on 2016 counts was similar to 2004/05 suggesting that the increasing population trend had leveled off (ABWC unpublished data). </p>  <p>Belugas in Anadyr Gulf have never been surveyed adequately. An analysis of Beluga sightings obtained opportunistically during a survey for Pacific Walruses (<em>Odobenus rosmarus divergens</em>) conducted in the western Bering Sea in April 2006 estimated 15,125 Belugas in the area (with availability correction factor applied). However, the survey did not cover all areas known to be used by Anadyr Belugas, and it is possible that individuals from other subpopulations were also in the survey area. The maximum count along the coast in Anadyr Bay was 241 whales, and expert opinion suggests that the total Anadyr subpopulation is about 3,000 whales with fairly stable abundance (NAMMCO in prep.). </p>  <p>Aerial surveys for Belugas were flown in the eastern Bering Sea periodically during 1992-2001. Data collected in 2000 were used in distance sampling analysis that resulted in an estimate of 3,497 surface-visible Belugas in the survey area. The total abundance estimate was 6,994 whales (95% CI 3,162-15,472) when a correction factor for availability was applied (Lowry <em>et al</em>. in press). There are currently no data with which to estimate population trend, but another survey of the subpopulation was conducted in 2017. </p>  <p>Early estimates of the size of the eastern Chukchi Sea Beluga stock relied on June-July counts of whales in and near coastal lagoons with correction factors applied to account for animals missed.<em> </em>Those studies resulted in abundance estimates of roughly 2,000-4,000 whales (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1988, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>Subsequent tagging of whales with satellite depth recorders (SDRs) showed that during summer they had a very broad distribution, including considerable time spent in offshore areas where they were missed during coastal lagoon surveys (Suydam 2009). Further analysis of SDR data from eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea Belugas (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014) showed there is a date range and region where data from offshore marine mammal surveys (Aerial Surveys of Alaskan Marine Mammals (ASAMM); Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2013) could be used to estimate abundance of the eastern Chukchi subpopulation.<em> </em>That analysis (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2017) estimated there were 5,547 (CV 0.22) surface-visible Belugas in the study area in 2012. Data from SDRs were used to develop correction factors to account for animals that were missed because they were outside of the study area or diving too deep to be seen, resulting in a total abundance estimate of 20,752 whales (CV 0.70). Trend in abundance is unknown but there are several other years of ASAMM survey data that could be analyzed to look for changes over time. <br/></p>  <p>The most recent estimate of abundance for the eastern Beaufort Sea Beluga stock is 39,258 whales (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>This number was derived from aerial surveys conducted in the Mackenzie Delta and eastern Beaufort Sea in 1992 that estimated 19,629 (CV 0.23) surface visible Belugas (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 1996) and a correction factor to account for submerged whales.<em> </em>Synoptic surveys for Belugas were conducted in the region only in 1992, but Beluga sightings were recorded during offshore Bowhead Whale (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) surveys in 1982, 1984, 1985, and 2007-09. The number of Belugas counted at the surface was substantially higher during the 2007-09 surveys but it is unclear whether this was due to a shift in distribution or population increase (Harwood and Kingsley 2013). <br/></p>  <p>An isolated subpopulation of Belugas occurs in Cook Inlet, Alaska where they reside throughout the year (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005, Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2012, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Sightings are occasionally made outside of Cook Inlet in the Gulf of Alaska (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2000), and there is a small group (&lt; 20 animals) that is apparently resident in Yakutat Bay approximately 600 km to the east (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is considered to be part of the Cook Inlet stock (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Beluga abundance in the Inlet, including corrections for availability and sightability, is determined using aerial counts and video analysis of whale groups (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2000). The 2014 survey produced an estimate of 340 whales (CV 0.08; Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<em> </em>Abundance declined by nearly 50% between 1988 and 1994, and by about 1.3%/year during 1994-2014 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2015, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Canada and Greenland</strong></p><p>There are currently three main population centers for Belugas in Arctic Canada, High Arctic-Baffin Bay (HA-BB), Cumberland Sound, and Hudson Bay. A subpopulation that once occurred in southwest Greenland in winter is likely extirpated (NAMMCO in prep.). HA-BB Belugas summer mostly in nearshore waters around Somerset Island (Koski and Davis 1980, Smith and Martin 1994) and winter in northern Baffin Bay and off West Greenland (Doidge and Finley 1993, Heide-Jørgensen and Laidre 2004). An aerial survey of the Canadian High Arctic in summer 1996 produced an availability-adjusted abundance estimate of 21,213 whales (95% CI 10,985-32,619; Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>A 2012 winter survey off West Greenland resulted in a corrected estimate of 9,072 Belugas (CV 0.32) (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling by Innes and Stewart (2002) indicated a major decline in HA-BB Beluga abundance occurred between 1981 and 1994.<em> </em>Current trend in abundance is unknown. </p>  The Cumberland Sound Beluga subpopulation remains in the Cumberland Sound area throughout the year (Richard and Stewart 2008). Aerial surveys were conducted in typically used portions of the Sound in 2014, and abundance was estimated using a combination of visual surveys and photographic counts.<em> </em>The total abundance estimate (corrected for availability bias) was 1,151 whales (95% CI 761–1,744; Marcoux <em>et al</em>. 2016). Marcoux and Hammill (2016) constructed a model of this subpopulation using survey data collected during 1980-2014 and harvest data for 1920-2015.<em> </em>Results indicated that current abundance is substantially reduced compared to 1960 and that abundance is still declining.          <p>Four Beluga stocks occur in the Hudson Bay region.<em> </em>The eastern Hudson Bay (EHB) and western Hudson Bay (WHB) stocks summer in the regions for which they are named and winter principally in Hudson Strait (NAMMCO in prep.). Although some interbreeding occurs on the wintering grounds (Turgeon <em>et al</em>. 2012), genetic studies show that the two groups are distinct (deMarch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Colbeck <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that cultural transmission of migration routes exists which likely acts to minimize interchange between the groups.<em> </em>Systematic aerial surveys of EHB Belugas have been flown seven times since 1985. Surveys flown in 2015 produced an availability-corrected estimate of abundance of 3,819 whales (CV 0.43; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling of the series of survey estimates and harvest data for 1972-2016 indicates that abundance declined during 1974-2002, but has been stable since then (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Abundance of WHB Belugas was most recently estimated from visual and photographic aerial surveys flown in summer 2015. The availability-corrected estimate of total abundance was 54,473 whales (95% CI 44,988-65,957; Matthews <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Because of bad weather conditions, this estimate did not include the Ontario coast where nearly 15,000 whales were estimated in 2004 (Richard 2005). A comparison of surface abundance estimates from 2015 and 2004 for five strata surveyed in both years showed that 2015 counts were about 6% higher (NAMMCO in prep.). Belugas use James Bay in large numbers during the summer and remain in that region during winter (Bailleul <em>et al</em>. 2012).<em> </em>The 2015 aerial survey estimated availability-corrected abundance as 10,615 (CV 0.25; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Estimates from similar surveys conducted from1985 to 2011 ranged from 4,720 to 19,439 whales so the trend in abundance is unclear. Belugas were once abundant in Ungava Bay, with summer aggregations in and near several rivers.<em> </em>Numbers are now greatly diminished with no animals sighted on-transect during aerial surveys conducted there since 1983 (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>However, some Belugas still occur occasionally in the area as indicated by off-transect sightings during aerial surveys (Kingsley 2000) and land-based sightings (Doidge <em>et al</em>. 1994). Using data from surveys conducted during 1985-2008, Doniol-Valcroze and Hammill (2012) estimated Ungava Bay Beluga abundance to be 32 individuals (95% CI 0-94).   </p><p>&#160;A relict subpopulation of Belugas occurs in the Saint Lawrence River estuary (SLE) that is isolated from all other subpopulations both geographically and genetically (Brown Gladden <em>et al</em>. 1999; de March and Postma 2003). Both the core range used in summer and the total range of SLE Belugas have shrunk considerably since the 1930s (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2010). The size of the SLE subpopulation is believed to have declined from 7,800 whales in the 1866 to about 1,000 in 1985 (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2007).<em> </em>Abundance has been monitored since 1988 using photographic aerial surveys.<em> </em>An integrated population model using survey counts and vital rates indicated that abundance increased slowly between the 1960s and early 2000s then declined to an estimated 889 in 2012 (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Svalbard and Russian Arctic </strong></p>  <p>The Svalbard Beluga subpopulation is geographically isolated and genetically differentiated from subpopulations to the east and west (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2010). During the ice-free season Belugas in the archipelago are found very nearshore, often at the faces of glaciers (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>During winter, sea ice formation causes them to move offshore somewhat but they remain in the Svalbard area (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>Currently there is no abundance estimate for Svalbard Belugas but the first ever survey was to be conducted in summer 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>The Beluga subpopulation in the White Sea is genetically differentiated from other subpopulations (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>In summer, the whales are seen in several aggregation areas in the major bays (Andrianov <em>et al</em>., 2009, Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010a, Alekseeva <em>et al</em>., 2012). While some investigators believe that in winter Belugas move to the Barents Sea, they are seen in the White Sea in March (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and all of the Belugas tracked with satellite-linked tags have stayed in the White Sea (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2012, Svetochev and Svetocheva 2012, Kuznetsova <em>et al</em>. 2016). Aerial surveys for belugas were flown in the White Sea in July six times during 2005-2011. The abundance estimate for 2011 was 5,593 whales (CV 0.14), and estimates from prior years ranged from 5,009 to 7,464 (Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012a). Available data suggest that abundance is stable. <br/></p>  <p>Belugas have been recorded at many other locations along the Arctic coast of Russia, including the Kara, Barents, Laptev, and East Siberian seas as well as Nova Zemlya and Franz Josef Land (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964, Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012b). A compilation of observations made during 1958-1995 from sea ice reconnaissance flights showed many sightings in coastal and offshore waters from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea but few observations in the East Siberian Sea (Belikov and Boltunov 2002). Boltunov and Belikov (2002) considered that the primary summer habitats are near Franz Josef Land and in the Kara Sea and western Laptev Sea, and that most of Belugas from this region winter in the Barents Sea. There are no estimates of current abundance, but given the size of the area and the number of animals taken by historical whaling (Boltunov and Belikov 2002), it is likely that Belugas were once numerous there.<em></em><br/></p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p>Summing the various estimates above gives a total of approximately 195,000 Belugas in the surveyed subpopulations. Because no abundance estimates are  available for Svalbard and the Russian High Arctic and the estimate for the White Sea is not corrected for availability, it is nearly certain that total rangewide abundance is more than 200,000. Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) calculated that in a pristine Beluga population 68% of all individuals would be mature. Using that value the total number of mature Belugas is estimated at about 136,000. The number of mature Belugas in the largest subpopulation, WHB, is about 37,000.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Generation time is an important parameter for several of the IUCN Red List criteria, and calculations of generation time require an accurate method for determining or estimating ages of individuals. For Beluga Whales, this has been done primarily by counting layers in the teeth of harvested or stranded animals. Counts of growth layer groups (GLGs) have usually been converted to age in years assuming there were two GLGs formed each year (Brodie 1971, Sergeant 1973, Burns and Seaman 1988, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Formation of two GLGs per year was supported by examination of teeth from captive, known age, individuals (Brodie 1982, Goren <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Stewart <em>et al</em>. (2006) measured the incorporation of atomic bomb radiocarbon into Beluga tooth GLGs, and used those measures to estimate age. When those estimates were compared to ages based on formation of one GLG versus two GLGs/year, the data fit the one GLG/year assumption. Lockyer <em>et al</em>. (2007) examined 10 teeth from captive Belugas and found clear support for one GLG/year in six of the specimens, but results for the others were equivocal.  Hohn <em>et al</em>. (2016) considered that the bomb radiocarbon study and long-term photoidentification studies showed that GLG deposition is “unquestionably annual.” (also see Matthews and Ferguson 2014). However, Brodie <em>et al</em>. (2013) continued to argue for two GLGs/year, based on field observations of Beluga life history parameters in Cumberland Sound, captive animal studies, and suggested problems with studies that support one GLG/year. Using the assumption of two GLGs/year, Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated generation time for belugas as 16.4 years for a population in a pre-disturbance state. If one GLG/year is actually the case, generation time would be much longer, but calculations using that assumption have not been done.</p><span lang=""EN-CA""><p>Data on historical sizes of Beluga subpopulations are sparse. Innes and Stewart (2002) estimated the historical carrying capacity (K) of the HA-BB  subpopulation as 39,790 whales. Bettridge <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated K for Sakhalin - Amur Belugas as between 13,200 and 20,800. Cumberland Sound Belugas were estimated to number 3,100 in 1960 (Marcoux and Hammill 2016). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated that there were 6,663 Belugas in EHB in 1974. Abundance of                    Cook Inlet Belugas  in 1979 was estimated at 1,293 (NMFS 2003). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated that there were 7,800 Belugas (standard error 600) in the SLE in 1866. Comparing these figures with those for the most recent abundance estimates given above suggests a reduction of 88% for SLE belugas, and 28-74% for the other five subpopulations. While these comparisons show that some stocks have been substantially depleted and remain in that state, a species-wide reduction in abundance cannot be calculated. The difficulty of such a calculation is compounded by the lack of agreement on calibration of tooth layers for age estimation, which is central to determining generation length and the amount of depletion over time. The combined abundance of those six subpopulations known to be depleted constitutes less than 20% of the current species-wide abundance estimate, and there is no reason to think that all of the remaining subpopulations are similarly depleted.    </p><span lang=""EN-CA""></span>",Unknown,"<p>Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. (1964) correctly noted that “The Beluga is widely distributed throughout the northern seas.”<em> </em>More recent and more detailed mapping (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014) confirms that Belugas are widely distributed in Arctic regions, occurring nearly throughout northern waters of Russia, Alaska, Canada, West Greenland, and Svalbard. Gaps in the distribution occur off North and East Greenland and perhaps in central Russia. Sightings and telemetry studies show that Belugas occur north of 80° N latitude at Svalbard (Vacquié-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017), and north of western Russia (Belikov and Boltunov 2002) and Alaska (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>Subpopulations in the Okhotsk Sea and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence occur in Subarctic waters as far south as 50° N (Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2010) and 47° N (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2012) respectively. Belugas have been recorded as vagrant at Japan, New Jersey and Washington State USA, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Scotland, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark (Rice 1998).</p>","<p></p><p>In the past Belugas were hunted commercially at several locations but that is no longer the case. They are legally hunted for food by indigenous communities in several parts of their range, including western and northern Alaska (Frost and Suydam 2010), western and eastern Canada (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2017), some parts of Russia (D. Litovka pers. comm.), and Greenland (Heide-Jørgensen and Rosing-Asvid 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Legally-harvested Beluga products may be sold in Alaska Native communities. Some illegal hunting may also occur, particularly in parts of Russia (NAMMCO, in prep.). Russia allows Belugas in the White Sea and in the Sakhalin Bay - Amur River delta region to be live-captured for public display.<em> </em>Numbers taken in the White Sea are small (probably 5-6 or fewer per year, NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>The number live-captured at Sakahlin is more substantial, 0-81 per year during 2000-2017 (Shpak and Glazov 2014, NAMMCO, in prep.). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (2011) calculated the sustainable annual removal of Belugas from the Sakhalin subpopulation to be 29 whales. Records of historical kills were used in a population model to estimate that the Sakhalin - Amur subpopulation meets the definition of depleted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, which disallows imports for live display into the U.S. (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; <br/></p>",Marine,"<p>Although Belugas were hunted intensively on a commercial basis for oil and leather in many parts of their range during the 20th century, the only known direct removals at present are for food (subsistence use) and the aquarium trade. The Canada-Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga (JCNB) is expected to ensure the conservation of shared stocks of Belugas while NAMMCO is a regional management body to which Canada, Greenland, and Norway belong. Catch limits and other recommendations on conservation of belugas are made on the basis of advice from joint meetings of the JCNB’s Scientific Working Group and NAMMCO’s Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic. Catch levels from hunted Beluga subpopulations range anywhere from less than ten to a few hundred animals per year. There is concern that Cumberland Sound Belugas are being hunted at unsustainable levels (NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>Removals from the Bristol Bay, Eastern Bering Sea, Eastern Chukchi Sea, and Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations are considered sustainable (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). In both Canada (Richard and Pike 1993) and Alaska (Adams <em>et al</em>. 1993), indigenous peoples’ organizations have entered into co-management agreements with government agencies to work on conservation of Beluga stocks. Harvests from the Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulation occur in both Alaska and Canada, and that is managed by an agreement between the North Slope Borough (Alaska) and the Inuvialuit Game Council (Canada).</p><p></p><p>As a species, the Beluga is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

50354147,8153,Eubalaena australis,Least Concern,,2018,2017-12-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The current hemispheric population trend for Southern Right Whales is uncertain, in view of the recent evidence for levelling-off in the population growth in some of the major areas (southwest Atlantic and Australia) and the recent steep apparent decline in the southeast Atlantic. However, given the estimated total population size (13,600 individuals in 2009; IWC 2013), and the 5-10 fold increase in the population since the 1970s, the species, although still scarce relative to its historical abundance, is not considered under threat at the hemispheric level. The population size is estimated to be larger now than it was three generations ago (87 years, assuming a generation time of 29 years; Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007). By IUCN Red List criteria, the species is assessed as Least Concern.  Some breeding subpopulations are still very small and may need special protection to survive. The very small population off Chile/Peru has been assessed separately and listed as Critically Endangered.<br/></p>","<p></p><p>Southern Right Whales have been well-studied on their wintering grounds, especially at Peninsula Valdés, Argentina, off the southern coast of Australia, and off South Africa. Researchers have used callosity patterns to identify individuals on these grounds, and have learned much about the Southern Right Whale's behaviour and reproduction. Calves are born from June to October with a peak in August after a 12-13 month gestation period (Best 1994). Females usually produce calves at 3-year intervals when these are successfully reared, but the interval can shorten to 2 years following perinatal loss of a calf, which often results in an apparent 5-year interval (Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2015; Leaper <em>et al.</em> 2006). In recent years off Argentina greater numbers of dead calves and a correspondingly greater number of documented two-year intervals have been observed (Rowntree <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sironi <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>Where feeding occurs north of 40°S the diet consists mainly of copepods, south of 50°S mainly euphausiids (krill), and varying proportions of the two food items at intermediate latitudes (Tormosov <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160; Evidence from stable isotope analysis suggests that different individuals frequent different feeding grounds and that fidelity to feeding grounds is maternally directed (Morgana <em>et al</em>. 2014, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>","<p>Like their congeners in the Northern Hemisphere, Southern Right Whales can die from entanglement in fishing gear and from ship strikes (IWC 2001). However, this does not seem to have impeded their recovery, at least in the main areas of abundance. The lower average density of human populations, and thus fishing, shipping, and other potentially harmful activities in the Southern Hemisphere, compared with the western North Atlantic, probably makes this species less affected by such activities than is the North Atlantic Right Whale (IWC 2013).<br/> <br/> Harassment by Kelp Gulls, <em>Larus dominicanus</em>, that gouge skin and blubber from the whales’ backs, is extensive in the Península Valdés nursery ground (Rowntree <em>et al.</em> 1998). This appears to be learned behaviour that has spread through the growing gull population that increased by 2.7% per year during 1994-2008 (Lisnizer <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is thought that the resulting wounds are a contributory factor in some calf deaths, and a number of mitigation measures have been proposed to reduce the rate of gull attacks on Southern Right Whales (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012, Marón <em>et al</em>. 2015) </p>  <p>There has been a marked increase since 2003 in stranded Right Whale carcasses in the two bays (Golfo Nuevo and Golfo San José) on Península Valdés, Argentina, where the whales congregate in the winter and spring. The number of carcasses found averaged 63 per year during 2006-2015, of which about 90% were newborn calves (Rowntree <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sironi <em>et al</em>. 2016). A number of possible factors in the calf deaths have been suggested, including nutritional stress, biotoxin exposure from harmful algal blooms (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2015), and harassment by from Kelp Gulls (IWC 2016). There has been concern that the level of mortality may be anomalously high (a “die-off”, ) (IWC 2011). However, a long-term analysis of calf mortality rates in this population showed that the rate has remained fairly low over most of the last 40 years, averaging around 18% with some inter-annual fluctuation but with recent levels not being unusually high&#160;(Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2015). For most cetacean populations, only a small proportion of&#160;dead animals are ever found (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011), but the geography of the Península Valdéz wintering ground with its two semi-enclosed bays likely facilitates the stranding and discovery of dead calves. This provides a unique opportunity to study the causes of calf mortality.</p>  <p>Observed correlations between breeding success off Argentina and sea surface temperature anomalies at South Georgia suggest that as Antarctic feeding grounds warm up, the average calf survival rate of Southern Right Whales would be expected to decline (Leaper <em>et al.</em> 2006). Off Brazil, reproductive success depends on body condition and therefore foraging success, which in turn are at least partly determined by climate-driven changes in krill density (Seyboth <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>  The recent decline in Right Whales off South Africa, evident in single animals since 2010 and in cow-calf pairs since 2015, is unexplained (Findlay <em>et al</em>. 2017). No increases in sightings in other areas have been reported that might account for the missing whales. An as yet unidentified factor may threaten this subpopulation.","<p></p><p></p><p>  </p>  <p></p><p>Southern Right Whales were hunted extensively by pre-modern whaling starting in the early 17th century, but especially in the 18th and 19th centuries by American and European whalers. Not all records have survived, and there is uncertainty over the numbers of animals killed but not landed. The total number processed between 1770 and 1900 is conservatively estimated at about 150,000, of which 48,000-60,000 were taken in the 1830s alone. By the start of modern whaling at the beginning of the 20th century, the species was already rare, and catches thereafter until Right Whales were legally protected in 1935 totalled only about 1,000. Over 3,000 were taken illegally by Soviet whaling fleets mainly in the 1960s (Tormosov <em>et al.</em> 1998). The hemispheric population in 1770 is estimated to have been over 70,000 and to have been depleted to a low of about 300 animals by the 1920s. The species began to recover following protection in 1935, but the illegal Soviet catches in the 1960s are estimated to have removed over half of the remaining population and delayed recovery (IWC 2001, 2013).<br/></p><p>Four breeding populations of Southern Right Whales (southwest Atlantic – Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, southeast Atlantic – South Africa and Namibia; Australia; and southwest Pacific – New Zealand) have shown strong recoveries, with doubling times of 10-12 years (Bannister <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2016; Cooke <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2015; Best <em>et al</em>. 2001, Brandão<sup> </sup><em>et al</em>. 2013, Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Two further suspected breeding populations (southeast Pacific – Chile and Peru, and southwest Indian Ocean – Madagascar and Mozambique) remain at very low numbers and show no clear evidence of any increase.<br/></p>  <p>The pan-hemispheric population was estimated to have reached 13,600 animals by 2009 and still to have been increasing strongly (IWC 2013). In recent years there has been evidence of a levelling-off of increase rates in the western South Atlantic (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2017) and in western Australia (Bannister <em>et al</em>. 2016, IWC 2018). The southeast Atlantic population (South Africa and Namibia) appears to have declined sharply since 2015 for unknown reasons (Findlay <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/></p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>There can be substantial interchange of Southern Right Whales between breeding grounds off the same continent, for example between Argentina and Brazil (Groch <em>et al.</em> 2005), and some interchange between continents and major land masses, for example between Argentina and South Africa (Best <em>et al</em>. 1993) and Australia and New Zealand (Pirzl <em>et al</em>. 2009). As the populations recover the winter ranges of each population seems to have been expanding to include more of the historical range, for example, Argentina to Brazil (IWC 2013), Auckland Islands and Campbell Islands to mainland New Zealand (Carroll <em>et al</em>. 2014), and South Africa to Namibia (Roux <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recovery within regions has been uneven. The calving numbers in southwestern Australia have increased but they remain low in southeastern Australia despite the latter having been a major calving and whaling ground in the 1800s (IWC 2018).</p>  <p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Southern Right Whales have a circumpolar distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. The distribution in winter, at least of the breeding component of the population, is concentrated near coastlines in the northern part of the range. Major current breeding areas are off southern Australia, New Zealand (particularly Auckland Islands and Campbell Islands), Atlantic coast of South America (Argentina and Brazil), and southern Africa (South Africa and Namibia). Small numbers are also seen off central Chile, Peru, Tristan da Cunha, and the east coast of Madagascar (Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2001). In summer, Right Whales are found mainly in latitudes 40-50°S (Ohsumi and Kasamatsu 1986) but also occur in the Antarctic as far south as 65°S (Bannister <em>et al</em>. 1999) and around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (Nijs and Rowntree 2017). Movements of individuals between subantarctic waters in summer and winter calving grounds have been documented using photo-identification and satellite tracking (Bannister <em>et al</em>. 1999, Best <em>et al</em>. 1993, Pirzl <em>et al</em>. 2009, Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2016, Nijs and Rowntree 2017).</p>  The map shows where the species may occur based on oceanography.

Although the species is generally believed to be extinct (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007) sporadic unconfirmed reports of sightings mean that the species should remain as CR (Possibly Extinct), rather than Extinct (EX), pending the results of a range-wide survey planned for November-December 2017.</p>  <p>The 2008 IUCN Red List assessment classified the Baiji as CR (Possibly Extinct) based on the following criteria:</p>  <ul><li><strong>Criterion C2a:</strong> There were far fewer than 250 mature individuals, and, if the Baiji was not already extinct by 2008, a continuing decline in the numbers of mature individuals could be inferred or projected, and all individuals belonged to a single subpopulation.</li><li><strong>Criterion D: </strong>There were certainly fewer than 50 mature individuals. </li></ul>  <p>The following factors justify retaining the classification of the Baiji as CR (Possibly Extinct) in the current assessment:  </p><ul><li>The last confirmed record of the species was in 2002 and its decline was well documented before its disappearance.</li><li>The “severe threatening processes” known to have occurred have not been significantly addressed and remain unabated.</li><li>The Baiji was confined to a single, albeit large, freshwater basin, which given the massive human presence there, “predisposed” the species to extinction.</li><li>If any individuals remained, their presence almost certainly would have been documented given the strong human presence in the species’ historical extent of occurrence.</li><li>Surveys conducted since the early 2000s, which failed to detect any Baijis, have been “adequate and appropriate to the species’ detectability.” The surveys were comprehensive in their coverage and included the use of both visual and acoustic techniques, with state-of-the-art equipment employed by experienced researchers. Local reports of sightings since 2002 are unconfirmed.</li><li>The Baiji’s habitat remains highly degraded and unsafe for other riverine megafauna. This is demonstrated by the fact that the Yangtze Finless Porpoise subspecies (<em>Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis</em>), which was sympatric with the Baiji, has continued to decline and is listed as CR (Wang<em> et al.</em> 2013). Other megafauna in the Yangtze River face a similar situation, including the CR (Possibly Extinct) Yangtze Sturgeon (<em>Acipenser dabryanus</em>)<em> </em>(Wei 2010a) and Chinese Paddlefish (<em>Psephurus gladius</em>)<em> </em>(Wei 2010b)<em> </em>and the CR Chinese Alligator (<em>Alligator sinensis</em>) (Crocodile Specialist Group 1996) and Yangtze Giant Softshell Turtle (<em>Rafetus swinhoei</em>) (Asian Turtle Trade Working Group 2000).</li></ul>","Baiji have been generally found in eddy counter-currents below meanders and channel convergences (Hua <em>et al</em>. 1989, Zhou and Li 1989, Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2003). They are known to prey on fish of many sizes and various species, including both surface and bottom feeders (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997).","<p></p><p>The decline in Baiji abundance was caused by a combination of factors. The most consequential were probably incidental mortality from interactions with fisheries and loss and/or degradation of habitat by water development and management of navigation channels (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2013). Other threats contributing to the species’ probable extinction include some level of direct historical exploitation (e.g., during China’s “great leap forward” the Baiji’s traditionally venerated status as Goddess of the River was denounced and Baiji skin was used to produce handbags and gloves; Zhou and Zhang 1991), vessel strikes, harbour construction, sedimentation from poor land use practices, and pollution.<br/> <br/> Entanglement in fishing gear in the 1970s and 1980s was estimated to have been responsible for at least half of observed mortality (Lin <em>et al</em>. 1985, Chen 1989, Zhou and Li 1989). Longlines with thousands of unbaited hooks used for snagging bottom fish (""rolling hooks"") accounted for seven of 13 entanglement deaths recorded in the lower Yangtze between 1978 and 1985 (Zhou and Li 1989) and 15 of 28 in the middle reaches between 1973 and 1983 (Zhou and Wang 1994). Additional deaths from entanglement in rolling hooks were documented in the 1990s (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998). Baijis often had scars and open wounds from rolling hooks, and hook remains were sometimes found in the stomachs of dead animals (Lin <em>et al</em>. 1985, Zhou and Li 1989). Deaths also resulted from entanglement in gill nets and fyke nets (Zhou and Wang 1994). According to Zhou<em> et al.</em> (1998), both rolling hooks and fyke nets were banned in the Yangtze ""because both are harmful to fisheries resources, and because of incidental killing of Baiji,” but enforcement of these prohibitions was ""very difficult.""<br/> <br/> Electric fishing, although ""strictly banned"" in the Yangtze (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998), has been widely practised, particularly in the centre of the Baiji's distribution (International Whaling Commission (IWC) 2001). By the early 2000s this fishing method had come to be viewed as the most important and immediate direct threat to the Baiji's survival (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). Although there are few direct observations to support this, it was reported that electric shocks killed Baijis outright (Chen and Hua 1989, IWC 2001). It is well known that such shocks can kill some other aquatic organisms, possibly including those that were prey of Baijis. In the 2006 Yangtze River survey, illegal fishing activities were observed daily along the river and 1,175 fishing vessels were logged between Yichang and Shanghai alone (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/> <br/> Propeller and vessel strikes have killed and injured Baijis (Zhou and Zhang 1991, Chen<em> et al.</em> 1997) and were considered a significant threat to the species, especially in view of the rapid industrial and economic growth of China with its associated expansion of traffic on the Yangtze (Chen 1989, Chen and Hua 1989, Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998). During the 2006 Baiji survey, a minimum of 19,830 large shipping vessels were counted (more than one vessel per 100 m of river surveyed) (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/> <br/> Explosives used to deepen or widen river channels or for fishing were another cause of Baiji mortality (Lin <em>et al</em>. 1985, Zhou and Li 1989, IWC 2001).<br/> <br/> Water development has transformed the Baiji's habitat in important ways, for example blocking of animal movements by dams and barrages, eliminating access to tributaries and appended lakes, and reducing fish productivity<em></em>. A dead Baiji found at the bottom of a gate for a ship lock in a Yangtze tributary may have been killed accidentally by the structure (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000). Chen and Hua (1989) predicted that the controversial Three Gorges Dam, completed in the early 2000s, would eliminate counter-current habitat for approximately 200 km downstream and degrade the existing counter-current systems for another 160 km downstream. Further, stratification in the reservoir will have caused the water released below the dam to be cooler than previously, potentially affecting Baijis and their prey. The downstream effects of Gezhouba Dam were not as extreme as those predicted for Three Gorges Dam because the former is a low-head, run-of-the-river structure (Zhong and Power 1996), meaning that sediment is allowed to pass through (which allows the formation of the counter-currents where Baijis were often found) and no reservoir forms. Another effect of Three Gorges Dam was to facilitate large ship traffic in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and thereby increase the amount of underwater noise, and it would have increased the incidence of vessel strikes of Baijis (Chen and Hua 1989).<br/> <br/> Industrial expansion and intensified agriculture (both facilitated by water development) have caused major ecological problems in the Yangtze system. For example, Dongting and Poyang Lakes have become much shallower because of siltation from deforestation and agricultural development; in fact, it was suggested that Dongting Lake could disappear completely early in the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/> <br/> Pollutant loads in the Yangtze have increased with industrialization and the spread of modern agricultural practices. As of the 1990s, approximately 40% of China's industrial and agricultural output came from the Yangtze basin, with more than 16 billion cubic meters of wastewater discharged into the river annually, of which more than 12 billion cubic meters was industrially polluted and largely untreated (Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1998).</p>","The first estimate of abundance based on quantitative survey data (1979-81) was made by Zhou (1982), who concluded that the total population comprised only about 400 animals. On the basis of surveys conducted in 1985-86, Chen and Hua (1989) made an educated guess that the total population was around 300. Surveys by Zhou and Li (1989) between 1982 and 1986 suggested that there were 100 Baijis in a 770 km segment of the lower Yangtze from Hukou to the river mouth, compared with 78-79 dolphins counted by Chen and Hua (1989) in the same segment in 1985-86. Repeated surveys of a 500 km segment of the lower Yangtze (Nanjing-Hukou) in 1989-91 produced a maximal count of 12 individuals, leading Zhou <em>et al</em>. (1998) to infer a total abundance of about 30 Baijis in that river segment. Those authors reasoned that if the species still inhabited its historical range of about 1,700 linear kilometers of river, with a density similar to that found in their study area, the total population in the early 1990s would have been only about 100. Attempted comprehensive surveys of the entire species range in 1997-99 resulted in a maximal count (November 1997) of 13 dolphins (including one calf), leading to the generally accepted view that abundance had continued to decline and that the total population was by that time extremely small. The sighting rate in the three years of surveys declined at an annual rate of about 10% (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although no credible time series of counts or abundance estimates is available to provide a rigorous evaluation of trends, there is an overwhelming consensus that the Baiji population declined rapidly over several decades before its probable extinction in the early 2000s.<br/> <br/> The last documented sighting (supported by photographic evidence) was in 2002 and the last confirmed stranding was in 2001. In November and December 2006, a comprehensive visual and acoustic survey failed to find a single Baiji in the Yangtze River (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2007). Two research vessels covered the known habitat of Baijis from Yichang to Shanghai in both the upstream and downstream directions (for double coverage on both sides of the river). In addition, one vessel towed a hydrophone to listen for Baiji whistles and clicks during the downstream survey. Although Dongting and Poyang Lakes were not covered in the 2006 Yangtze mainstem survey, since 2000 no Baijis have been seen by researchers studying Finless Porpoises in those lakes. Another survey conducted for Finless Porpoises in 2012 also failed to detect any Baijis (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2014). One of the assessors (WD) received reports and hazy video footage of a Baiji sighting in the Tongling area of the Yangtze in 2007 but the species identification could not be confirmed. There are more recent unconfirmed reports of Baiji sightings by student volunteers and older fishermen but no photographic, video, or acoustic evidence is available to assess the reliability of these reports. In view of the unconfirmed reports, a precautionary approach has been taken by retaining the classification of the Baiji as CR (Possibly Extinct) rather than changing it to EX, pending the results of a third range-wide survey from Yichang to Shanghai, using the same rigorous methods as were used in surveys conducted in 2006 and 2012, this time with more targeted survey effort in Tongling. If these surveys fail to find a Baiji, the case for changing the species’ status from Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) to Extinct will be particularly strong.",Decreasing,"The Baiji is endemic to the Yangtze River of China. Some individuals were seen in the Qiantang River, immediately south of the Yangtze, after the great flood of 1955 but they disappeared after construction of a hydropower station in 1957 (Zhou 2009). Baijis also occurred in Dongting and Poyang Lakes (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1977, Chen<em> et al.</em> 1980) but disappeared from both of these appended water bodies of the Yangtze by the 1990s (Yang<em> et al.</em> 2000, Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). Their upstream limit in the Yangtze declined from the Three Gorges area approximately 35 km above Gezhouba Dam near Yichang in the 1940s to approximately 170 km below the dam site near Jingzhou (formerly called Shashi) in the 1990s (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003, Zhou 2009). These dolphins were once observed as far downstream as the river mouth near Shanghai (Zhou and Li 1989). No dolphins were found downstream of Jiangyin, located 256 km upstream of the mouth, during surveys in 1997-99 (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). During surveys in the late 1990s, Baijis were found mainly in several segments of the Yangtze between Tongling and Dongting Lake, such as the Tongling section, the Poyang Lake mouth area, and the Honghu section (Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2003). Turvey<em> et al.</em> (2010) concluded from community interviews along the length of the Yangtze River that while the Baiji steadily declined in abundance, this decline “was not associated with any major contraction in geographical range across the middle–lower Yangtze drainage, even in the decade immediately before probable global extinction of the species.” Hazy video footage taken in the Tongling area of the Yangtze in 2007 may have been a Baiji but the species identification could not be confirmed. Also, during the last two years there have been unconfirmed reports of sightings made by a team of student volunteers and older fishermen near Tongling (Wang Ding, unpubl. data).<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong>",There is no current trade in or use of this species or its products.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>In China, the Baiji is designated in the First Category of National Key Protected Wildlife Species and has full legal protection throughout its range. Protection from deliberate killing or injury appears to have been effective but, as noted under Threats, prohibitions on harmful fishing methods were generally not very effective and Baijis continued to suffer from the mortality, injury, and health impairment caused by the other threats listed.<br/> <br/> For several decades, those involved in trying to save the Baiji could not reach consensus on whether conservation should focus principally on <em>in situ</em> efforts to manage threats or on capturing some Baijis from the wild and moving them to a captive or semi-captive environment (IWC 2001, Reeves<em> et al.</em> 2003). From the late 1980s onwards, the primary strategy to prevent the Baiji's extinction was to capture as many dolphins as possible and to introduce them into ""semi-natural reserves,"" one of which (Tongling) was approved by the Chinese government in the 1980s, and the other (Shishou) in the 1990s. The approach of using semi-natural reserves as components of a broad-based conservation strategy was endorsed by international meetings of scientists in 1986 (Perrin and Brownell 1989) and 1993 (Ellis<em> et al.</em> 1993, Zhou<em> et al.</em> 1994). By 2005, establishment of an <em>ex situ</em> breeding population under semi-natural conditions was regarded as the essential short-term goal for the continued survival of the species (Braulik<em> et al.</em> 2005, Reeves and Gales 2006, Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2006, Wang<em> et al.</em> 2006, Yang<em> et al.</em> 2006). This was premised on the assumption that the total population of the species was small and declining rapidly and that the factors responsible for the species’ decline (severe habitat degradation; rolling hook, electric and explosive fishing; and boat strikes) were still at work and may have been increasing. The favoured site for establishing this population was the Tian-e-zhou National Baiji Reserve, a 21 km oxbow appended to the Yangtze near Shishou City, Hubei Province, which since 1990 has supported a translocated breeding population of Yangtze Finless Porpoises. However, the expectation that sufficient numbers of Baijis could be caught and placed in the reserves to establish a viable <em>ex situ</em> population proved unrealistic. Six capture expeditions, each lasting 2-3 months, were conducted between Chenglingji and Gongan in the 1990s but Baijis proved extremely difficult to locate, track, and capture. In 1995, a female Baiji was caught and released in the Shishou reserve. Less than seven months later her carcass was found entangled in the escape prevention net at the outlet of the reserve. At that time, one other Baiji was in captivity – a male (Qi Qi) that had been rescued from fishing gear in 1980 and rehabilitated. Qi Qi remained alone in his dolphinarium tank at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan until he died in 2002 </p>  <p>The Scientific Committee of the IWC reviewed the status of the Baiji in 2000, but members were unable to reach consensus on whether further attempts at live-capture should be made (IWC 2001). The IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group recommended in 2003 that: (1) available resources should be devoted to eliminating the known threats to the species in its natural habitat; (2) immediate action should be taken at national, provincial and local levels to fully enforce the bans on rolling hooks and electric fishing; and (3) if the capture/translocation effort continues, capture operations should be improved to prevent dolphin injury or mortality, water quality in the reserve should be kept at a high standard, and Finless Porpoises should be removed to ensure against deleterious interactions between them and the Baiji(s) (Reeves<em> et al.</em> 2003). In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture developed a Baiji conservation plan emphasizing the <em>ex situ</em> approach (Ministry of Agriculture 2001).</p>  <p>The Yangtze region is home to approximately 10% of the world’s human population and the Yangtze River has been undergoing progressive ecological deterioration for many decades. The Baiji is the victim not of active persecution but of incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts, primarily uncontrolled and unselective fishing (Turvey<em> et al.</em> 2007) </p>  <p>Conservation actions for Baijis may be too late to prevent its extinction. However, such actions can be justified by the fact that almost any substantial conservation measures in the Yangtze will benefit the Critically Endangered Yangtze Finless Porpoise, which is the world’s only freshwater porpoise and was sympatric with the Baiji before the latter’s disappearance. Research should concentrate on confirming the presence or absence of Baijis through rigorous searching effort. This effort should include the range-wide survey planned for November to December 2017 from Yichang to Shanghai in both the upstream and downstream directions (for double coverage on both sides of the river) using visual observers with high-powered binoculars and an acoustic search with a towed hydrophone to listen for Baiji whistles and clicks. &#160;Searching effort should also include more intensive surveys using both visual and acoustic techniques in the area around Tongling where recent unconfirmed observations of Baijis were reported. If a Baiji is found during any of these surveys, the conservation recommendations made by the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group in 2003 (see above) would remain valid.</p>  <p>The Baiji is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</p>",Palearctic,2002,true,false,Global

The current global population is estimated at 135,000 and the mature population at about 84,000, which is higher than the level of three generations ago. This is true of the global population as well as the three main regional populations individually – North Pacific, North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. The species does not, therefore, qualify for a Red List threatened category, and is listed as Least Concern. The Arabian Sea subpopulation appears to be isolated, is very small, and is listed separately as Endangered (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p></p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>With few exceptions, such as the Arabian Sea population, Humpback Whales undertake long migrations between breeding grounds in tropical coastal waters in winter to feeding grounds in middle and high latitudes (Clapham 2018).<br/> <br/> In the Southern Hemisphere, they appear to feed mainly in the antarctic and subantarctic, where the diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids (Krill, <em>Euphausia superba</em>) (Mackintosh 1970), although some feeding has been observed in the Benguela Current ecosystem on the migration route west of South Africa (Best <em>et al</em>. 1995); suspected prey species in that region are euphausiids (<em>E. lucens</em><em>)</em> and amphipods (<em>Themisto gaudichaudii</em><em>)</em>. Some Humpback Whales feed in summer in mid-latitude (41°-44°S) Chilean waters (Hucke-Gaete<em> et al</em>. 2013) <br/> <br/> Few data on diet in other areas are available. Humpback Whales caught off Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1950s and 1960s were consuming mainly Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) (Mitchell 1973). Those caught off California in the early 20th century were eating mainly euphausiids and sardines (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1997). Humpback Whales caught in the northern North Pacific in the 1950s were feeding mainly on euphausiids and fish (Nemoto 1959). In areas of Alaska and the North Atlantic, Humpback Whales have also been observed feeding in coordinated fashion on schools of Pacific Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), Sand Lance (<em>Ammodytes</em> spp.), and (more rarely) Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>), herding the school together with bubble nets, clouds or curtains (Hain <em>et al</em>. 1982).<br/> <br/> The timing of acquisition of tooth rake marks attributable to Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) indicates that Humpback Whale calves, but usually not subadults and adults, are subject to predation (Mehta <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Although modern commercial whaling seriously depleted all Humpback populations, some of which had already been reduced by pre-modern whaling, the species has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and there have been substantial increases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. Humpback whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling worldwide since 1966, and there have been few catches since 1968. It is unclear whether there has been any recovery in the small, isolated population in the Arabian Sea.<br/><br/>Today, small numbers only are taken for local consumption in Greenland (up to 10 annually) and the island of Bequia (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) (up to four annually), with occasional takes elsewhere (IWC 2018b).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales, along with North Atlanatic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena</em> <em>glacialis</em>), seem to be the most vulnerable of the large whales to becoming accidentally entangled, often fatally, in fishing gear and sometimes other debris. They are also vulnerable to injury by ship strikes, which can also be fatal. In most areas, the majority of entanglements (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also the majority of ship strikes, are likely to go undetected, but there is no generally accepted method for extrapolating from the observed events to estimate totals.<br/><br/>State members of the IWC are encouraged to report bycatches and ship strikes annually to the IWC, but few do so. The figures submitted in 2018 for entanglements include: USA 78 (26 in the Atlantic in 2015, 52 in the Pacific in 2016); Australia 46; Greenland 5, Japan 3, and New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, and Spain (1 each) (Hughes 2019). The reported ship strike numbers were: USA 13, Australia 5, and Brazil 1. &#160;The figures include some potentially non-fatal incidents (such as whales entangled and released).<br/><br/>Minimum estimates of average annual deaths in US waters are: west coast (2012-16) - 16.7 from entanglement and 2.1 from ship strikes (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2018); east coast (2010-14) ­– 7.2 from entanglements and 1.8 from ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Alaska and Hawaii (2011-15) − 18 from entanglements in fishing gear, 2.8 from unspecified marine debris, and 4.4 from ship strikes (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018). Urbán <em>et al</em>. (2017) reported 95 cases of entanglement of Humpback Whales on the Mexican Pacific coast during 2004-2017 of which 42 were released, 6 died and the fate of the others was either unknown or considered not to be severely injured.<br/><br/>In a study of Humpback entanglements in Scottish fishing gear during 1992-2016, Ryan <em>et al</em>. (2016) found that most Humpback Whales spent only brief periods in Scottish waters, but that the entanglement rate per day of whale presence was such that it would be unsustainable for a population that fed regularly in Scottish waters.<br/><br/>The distribution of Humpbacks in the Arabian Sea overlaps that of fisheries known to be dangerous to Humpbacks, and 30-40% of the photographed whales showed entanglement-related scars (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The last comprehensive assessment of North Atlantic Humpback Whales was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2002 (IWC 2003), but more recent data are available for some areas. The abundance estimate for the West Indies group of breeding aggregations, obtained from photographic capture-recapture, was 10,752 whales in 1992-93 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.07) with an estimated annual rate of increase of 3.1% (standard error (SE) 0.5%) over the period 1979-93 (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2003). The latest abundance estimate for part of the Cape Verde Island population is 260 during 2010-2013, also from&#160;photographic capture-recapture&#160;(Ryan<em> et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The most recent estimates of abundance in the individual summer feeding grounds are: Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy - 823 in 2008 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Canadian Atlantic (Newfoundland, Labrador, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and Scotia Shelf) - 2,080 (CV 0.22) in 2007 (Lawson <em>and</em> Gosselin 2009); West Greenland - 993 (CV 0.46) in 2015 (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); East Greenland coastal and central North Atlantic (Iceland, East Greenland, Faeroes, Jan Mayen) 10,031 (CV 0.36) in 2015 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018); northeastern Atlantic (British Isles, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea) 1,450 (CV 0.29) in 2001 (Øien <em>et al</em>. 2009). These estimates total about 15,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.25.<br/><br/>The abundance of Humpback Whales in the Gulf of Maine and northwestern Atlantic was estimated to be growing at 6.5% per year during 1979-91 (Barlow and Clapham 1997) but the rate of increase was less than 4% per year during 1992-2000 (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003). Abundance in the central North Atlantic (East Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands) increased sharply from 1987 to 1995 but there has been no clear trend since then (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were subject to significant removals by pre-modern whalers especially in their wintering grounds in the West Indies and Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Reeves 2003). Whaling in the West Indies (including Bermuda) is partially documented from 1664, but the main period was 1826-1928, during which about 8,600 whales were estimated to have been killed (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001). Whaling in the Cape Verde Islands occurred primarily during 1850-1912 with a total estimated kill of about 3,000 animals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Humpbacks were exploited by modern whalers in their summer feeding grounds from the 1860s, especially off Iceland and Norway (Jonsgård 1977<em>,</em> Allison 2017). About 3,200 Humpback Whales were recorded taken by early modern whaling during 1880-1916, mainly off northern Norway and Iceland. Allowing for a substantial struck and lost rate in early modern whaling, and considering that about 20% of the recorded catch of whales was unspecified to species, the total kill in this period may have exceeded 5,000 Humpback Whales.<br/><br/>About 1,500 Humpback Whales are reported to have been killed in the North Atlantic since 1916, from a variety of areas including the British Isles, Faeroes, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, and eastern Canada, as well as Norwegian pelagic catches. Humpback Whales were protected from commercial whaling in the North Atlantic from the 1955 season by the IWC, except for small catches off Greenland (IWC 1954). However, catch levels had become very low by the 1920s, despite continued high catches of Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>). This suggests that the Humpback population was low at that time.<br/><br/>Attempts to estimate pre-whaling populations from catch, abundance and trend data have yielded inconclusive results (IWC 2003<em>,</em> Punt <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, the current population level is probably considerably higher than the 1942 level because only a small number of Humpbacks (377) were caught between 1942 and the start of the period (from 1979) over which an increase has been documented.<br/><br/>Using genetic methods, Roman and Palumbi (2004) estimated the pre-whaling population of&#160;Humpback Whales in the North Atlantic to be 240,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 156,000-401,000). However, their method assumed that North Atlantic Humpback Whales form a single clade, which they do not (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hence, the Roman and Palumbi estimate would be expected to reflect the global abundance of Humpback Whales prior to whaling rather than the North Atlantic population.<em><strong><br/><br/>North Pacific</strong></em><br/>The total abundance of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific was estimated by photographic capture-recapture at 21,063 (CV 0.04) during 2004-06 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). A comparable estimate from 1993-96 data, calculated retrospectively, was 9,500. The population appeared to have been increasing since 1980 at rates of 5-8% per year in each of the areas with sufficient data to estimate trend (Calambokidis and Barlow 2017). More recent data from the U.S. west coast suggest that numbers there have levelled off (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Using a different model for the relation between summering and wintering grounds applied to the same data as Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2011), Wade <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2016, revised by Wade 2017) estimated a total of 15,805 for the wintering grounds and 16,225 for the feeding grounds. It is not clear why Wade’s totals are lower than Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>.’s, but all evidence indicates that the Hawaiian group is the largest of the wintering populations, comprising 10,000-12,000 whales and making up at least half of the total North Pacific population. Estimates for the other breeding populations are Mexican (2,000-5,000), Asian (1,000-2,000) and Central American (300-1,000); no estimate exists for the Western Pacific (Mariana Islands) area.<br/><br/>Independent of the above data, the abundance of Humpback Whales in the eastern North Pacific (170°E to 135°W) and the eastern Bering Sea has been estimated from the Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment (POWER) series of sightings surveys at 14,407 (CV 0.56) (Inai <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Humpback Whales are also abundant west of these areas, in the western Bering Sea and near the western Aleutian Islands, eastern and western Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands (Miyashita <em>et al</em> 2006<em>,</em> Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>,</em> Gushcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were hunted in Japan at least since 1570 and catching probably increased with the development of net-assisted whaling from circa 1677 (Kasuya 2018). The number taken is very uncertain because detailed catch figures prior to the 20th century are available from only two of about a dozen locations where whaling occurred in southern Japan, on both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts (Omura 1986).&#160;The proportion of whales killed but lost is also unclear: although quite high rates of escape were indicated, it is unclear how many of these would have been mortally wounded. A single whaling firm operating in Kyushu (southwestern Japan), among several known to have been active, took 21,790 whales between 1725 and 1874, of which the majority were likely Humpbacks judging from the species breakdown at neighbouring locations. The data suggest a decline towards the end of the 19th century, but not as marked as for North Pacific Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena japonica</em>).<br/><br/>Building on the works of Maury (1852) and Townsend (1935), Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted by month the positions of about 250 catches and a few sightings of Humpbacks in the North Pacific from a sample of logbooks of American sail whalers in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.&#160;Humpback Whales occurred in most of the summering and wintering areas known today, including the Sea of Japan and Okhotsk Sea. The logbooks are thought to comprise about 10% of all American voyages, but it is unclear how representative they are, especially of the earlier voyages. Furthermore, at least some European vessels were also active in the North Pacific.&#160;It is possible that a few thousand Humpback Whales were taken. Also in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, American shore-based whalers operating on the coast of California killed an estimated 2,000 Humpback Whales between 1854 and 1899 (Reeves <em>and</em> Smith 2010).<br/><br/>Modern whaling began in Japan in 1898 and catches by species are recorded since 1911. Humpback Whales made up only 2.0% (950 out of 47,343) of the catch of large whales in Japan (including the occupied Kuril Islands) during 1911-45, and only 0.2% (90 out of 48,010) of the catch of large whales in Japan during 1946-65 (Allison, 2017). Thus, the Asian migratory population was likely already depleted before the start of modern whaling, and already commercially extinct by the time the catching of Humpbacks in the North Pacific was prohibited by the IWC from 1966 (IWC 1965). Subgroups of the Asian wintering population that used more oceanic migratory corridors probably survived a bit longer, given that over 800 Humpbacks were taken in Ogasawara (Bonin Islands) between 1922-1945, nearly 800 in Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands) during 1958-62, and over 700 in Taiwan during 1920-39.<br/><br/>Approximately 18,000 Humpbacks are recorded as being taken by modern whaling along the American coasts during 1911-65 (5,000 in Alaska, 6,000 in British Columbia, 5,000 in California and Washington, and 2,000 off Baja California, Mexico) (Allison 2017). &#160;Modern pelagic whaling began in the 1930s and a total of over 8,000 Humpback Whales were taken, including 7,714 by fleets of the USSR, which illegally took 248 Humpback Whales after catches had been prohibited by the IWC (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Estimated catches of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific since 1942 total approximately 10,700 whales (Allison 2017). Given the evidence of an increase of over 10,000 whales between the 1980s and the early the 2000s, it is likely that the current population size in the North Pacific as a whole is above the 1942 level.<br/><br/>The Hawaiian wintering population is today the largest of the extant wintering populations. The 19<sup>th</sup> century records include relatively few catches or sightings of Humpbacks in this area, even though Hawaii was a major staging area for long-distance whalers in the Pacific. The thesis of Herman (1979) that Humpbacks were uncommon in Hawaii in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and earlier, based on the paucity of references to Humpbacks in contemporary accounts and local folklore, is controversial. However, it is plausible that Humpbacks were historically less abundant in Hawaii than they are today.<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Population estimates derived from photo-identification conducted in the Arabian Sea during 2000-04 were all less than 100 animals (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011). Provisional analysis of data collected during 2000-2015 yielded an abundance estimate of 89 whales (CV 0.26) in 2015, which may be negatively biased due to heterogeneity (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Soviet whaling fleet <em>Sovetskaya Ukraina</em> illegally took 238 Humpback Whales off the coasts of Oman, Pakistan, and northwestern India in November 1966 (Mikhalev 1997). The current population is very small and its current trend is not known. This population is listed separately as Endangered under Red List criterion D (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>Results of the IWC Scientific Committee’s multi-year “comprehensive assessment” of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, completed in 2015, are summarized by IWC (2016). The estimated total population size in 2015 was 97,000 (CI 78,000-118,000),&#160;obtained from a mix of photographic and genetic capture-recapture, aerial surveys, and shore-based censuses. The estimated total population size in 1942, from a fitted population model, was about 60,000 (confidence interval not given) while the estimated “pre-whaling” population size in 1900 was 138,000 (CI 112,000-198,000). All breeding populations were estimated to have recovered to a substantial fraction of their pre-whaling abundance, except for the West South Africa (BSB2) population, which may still be quite depleted.<br/><br/>The IWC comprehensive assessment assumed that catches by pre-modern whalers were small enough, or long enough ago, to be ignored. However, de Morais <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated catches of 11,000-33,000 Humpback Whales from pre-modern land whaling stations (armações) in Brazil during 1830-1924, and considered it likely that there had been similarly sizeable catches in the preceding century. From samples of logbooks of late 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century sail whalers, Townsend (1935) and Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted positions for about 2,000 Humpback catches and sightings in the Southern Hemisphere. These show presence of Humpbacks in most of the wintering grounds known today, except for northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef probably made access too risky. The 19<sup>th</sup> century whalers did not follow their prey to their Antarctic summering grounds. No attempt has yet been made to estimate total removals from the logbook samples.<br/><br/>The recorded catches by 20<sup>th</sup> century whaling in the Southern Hemisphere total about 220,000, after allowing for some Humpbacks among the 5,000 unspecified whales taken in the early years (Allison 2017). Of the total, about 83,500 were taken by pelagic whaling fleets in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, which started in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century mainly south of 55°S; about 40,000 from land stations in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, mainly at South Georgia; about 29,000 along the west coast of southern Africa (Gabon, Angola, Namibia, and western South Africa); about 20,000 in the southwestern Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mozambique, and Natal (South Africa); over 28,000 off western Australia; over 14,000 off eastern Australia and New Zealand; about 2,500 in the Southeast Pacific (Chile, Peru, and Ecuador); and about 2,000 off Brazil.<br/><br/>Attempts by the IWC to manage the hunting of Humpbacks in the Southern Hemisphere had limited effect. Takes of Humpbacks by pelagic fleets in the Southern Ocean (south of 40°S) were prohibited in the initial Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling that was adopted in 1946 and came into force in 1948. This ban was relaxed from 1950 to allow an annual catch of 1,250 Humpbacks, but the numerical limit was often exceeded and was dropped from 1954 when Humpback catching was instead limited to four days in February. From 1959, increasingly restrictive area limits were imposed. The report of an IWC expert group in June 1963 inferred from the continuing steep decline in the Humpback population that substantial unreported catches had occurred (Chapman 1964). The IWC finally banned all catching of Humpbacks throughout the Southern Hemisphere from 1964 (IWC 1965). Subsequently, it emerged that Humpback catches by the USSR fleets had indeed exceeded the reported values by about 46,000 whales, and had continued until 1968, with small takes continuing until 1973 (Zemsky <em>et al</em>. 1996<em>,</em> Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even before the 1964 Humpback ban, almost all of the additional Soviet catches had been illegal in at least one respect: they were either outside the permitted season, outside the permitted areas, below the minimum allowed body size, or of mothers with calves.<br/><br/>The IWC Scientific Committee’s recent comprehensive assessment, which took account of the previously unreported catches, showed that the current hemispheric population was, by now, very likely above its 1942 level. The assessment probably reflects the current population size and the trends over recent decades quite well, but both the estimates of pre-whaling population size, and the projections of future recovery, are probably more uncertain than the assessment results suggest, for the following reasons; firstly, as noted above, the pre-modern catches may not have been insignificant; secondly, simulation studies by Leaper <em>et al</em>. (2011) showed that alternative assumptions about density-dependent limitation can yield substantially different estimated population trajectories for both the past and the future; finally, Clapham and Zerbini (2015) cautioned that a key model assumption, that all historical breeding areas will be repopulated, may not hold when social factors are considered.<em><strong><br/><br/>Global Assessment</strong></em><br/>The mean age at first reproduction for Humpback Whales is estimated to be 10-12 years in the Southern Hemisphere (Best 2011) with a similar value in the North Pacific (Gabriele <em>et al</em>. 2007). Clapham (1992) reported a value of 5-7 years for Humpbacks in the Gulf of Maine, North Atlantic, but this increased to about 9 years for cohorts born in 1987 and later (Robbins 2007). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) cited 6 years as a reasonable default value, based on Clapham (1992). Taking a compromise value of 10 years, the generation time of 21.5 years estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) would become 25.5 years. Hence the 3-generation time window for applying the reduction criterion (A1) for a threatened category is 1942-2018.<br/><br/>Using the proportion mature of 0.62 estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007), the recent global population contains approximately 84,000 mature individuals out of a total of 135,000 whales. The population in 2018 is estimated to be above the 1942 level in each of the major ocean regions (North Atlantic, North Pacific, Southern Hemisphere). The small Arabian Sea population is probably below the 1942 level, because of the illegal catches taken in the 1960s.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p></p><p>The Humpback Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all the major ocean basins, and all but one of the subpopulations (that of the Arabian Sea) migrate between mating and calving grounds in tropical waters, usually near continental coastlines or island groups and productive colder-water feeding areas in temperate and high latitudes (Dawbin 1966, Clapham and Mead 1999). There tends to be strong, maternally directed fidelity to feeding and breeding grounds, but with some interchange between grounds, especially of males but also of females (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>Humpbacks in the North Atlantic range in summer from the Gulf of Maine in the west to the British Isles and Norway in the east. The northern extent of the Humpback's range includes the Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Davis Strait, but unlike Bowhead Whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>), they do not enter the pack ice. A number of main feeding grounds have been identified: Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, west of Greenland, west of Iceland, northeast Iceland, Jan Mayen, northern Norway, Bear Island, and western Svalbard (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Smaller numbers have been observed feeding in other areas such as the Hudson River Estuary (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2018). Humpback Whales are rare in the central and southern North Sea and there are very few records from the Baltic Sea. Humpback Whales were previously very rare in the Mediterranean Sea; there has been a notable increase in sightings since 1990, but they are still not common (Russo <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The main wintering grounds are in the West Indies and wider Caribbean region where they are found along the entire Antillean arc from Cuba to Venezuela (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The largest aggregations occur on Silver and Navidad Banks near the Dominican Republic, with much lower numbers in Samana Bay (Dominican Republic), off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico, and around the Virgin Islands and the eastern Antilles. Smaller numbers winter around the Cape Verde Islands (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009). There is some interchange of individuals between the eastern and western Atlantic wintering grounds (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2016), and some whales may remain in colder, more northern waters throughout the winter (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1993<em>,</em> Magnúsdóttir <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>,</em> Kowarski 2018).<br/><br/>While whales wintering in the Caribbean region have been matched photographically or genetically with whales in each of the summer feeding grounds, whales from the smaller Cape Verde Islands wintering group have to date been matched only with the northeastern feeding grounds. Individuals from the Cape Verdes have also been observed in spring in the Azores, where they appear to stop over to feed while on their way north (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009<em>,</em> Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011). The genetic and photographic evidence suggests that some of the whales on the Icelandic and Norwegian feeding grounds migrate in winter to an unknown area other than the West Indies or the Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Pike 2009).<br/><br/>The Humpback Whales that occur in the austral winter north of the equator along the African coast from Gabon to Guinea are known or presumed to be Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales (Bamy <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong></strong><br/>In the North Pacific, the Humpback Whale’s summer range covers shelf waters from southern California to the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, the Aleutian chain and Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, and northeastern Japan (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Humpbacks were hunted in the Sea of Japan and the Okhotsk Sea and in the past (Kasuya 2018<em>,</em> Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012). They were for some time rare in the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), but recently have been seen in the eastern and northern Okhotsk Sea (Guschcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>,</em> Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Humpbacks are not common in the Sea of Japan but continue to be taken occasionally as bycatch in Korean waters. Recent occurrence in the Beaufort Sea may be linked to warming climate trends (Hashagen <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds identified to date include (from west to east) are: 1) Asian – Ogasawara (Bonin Islands), Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands), and northern Philippines; 2) west-central Pacific (presumed to be the area of the Mariana Islands, including Guam); 3). Hawaiian; 4) Mexican - Baja California, Gulf of California, Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Mexican mainland; and 5) Central American – Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia (IWC 2018a).<br/><br/>The least well-known wintering area is the west-central Pacific, because only a few whales have been observed there (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017), but the existence of a substantial wintering ground had been inferred from the substantial proportion of Humpback Whales in the Aleutian Islands that could not be matched to other known wintering grounds (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). It remains to be determined whether this is the Marianas region, which was a Humpback whaling ground in the 19<sup>th</sup> century (Townsend 1935).<br/><br/>The Central American wintering ground overlaps the winter range of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, but there is probably not much temporal overlap because the Southern Humpback Whales occupy the area in the austral winter (Rasmussen <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Small numbers of Humpbacks have recently been seen at previously unknown winter locations such as Amami-Ohshima Island (28°N 129°E) and Hachijō-jima Island (33°N 140°E, about 300km south of Tokyo, Japan) (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The various wintering populations have different summer distributions but with considerable overlap. The whales wintering off Central America and mainland Mexico feed mainly off the coasts California, Oregon and Washington (USA), while whales from the Revillagigedo Islands feed mainly in the Gulf of Alaska (Urbán <em>et al</em>. 2017). Whales wintering off Hawaii are found in summer mainly in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska (including Southeast Alaska) and the waters of British Columbia (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Most of the whales summering off Kamchatka migrate to the Asian wintering grounds, a lower number to the Hawaiian grounds, and a few to the Mexican grounds (Titova <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Movements between wintering grounds have also been documented (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008) but these appear to be sufficiently few that the wintering populations remain genetically differentiated, especially with respect to mtDNA, which reflects maternal lineages (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><em></em><br/>The majority of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales migrate to the Antarctic in summer. They are abundant throughout the Antarctic in summer south to the ice edge, but not within the pack ice zone. There are also subantarctic summer feeding grounds around South Georgia (Dawbin 1966<em>,</em> Engel <em>and</em> Martin 2009) and the Fuegian archipelago (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Some mothers with calves remain in mid-latitude waters in the Chilean fjords in the summer (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the winter, Southern Hemisphere whales aggregate in specific nearshore breeding areas in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, at least two of which extend north of the equator, i.e. off Colombia and Central America in the eastern Pacific and in the Bight of Benin (5°N, 2°E) in the eastern Atlantic. Some wintering grounds are fairly localized, for example around island groups, and some are more diffuse, such as along the west coast of southern Africa and the coast of West Africa. As evidenced by acoustic detections, part of the population remains in the Antarctic in winter (van Opzeeland <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The currently known wintering grounds, with the names originally assigned by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (IWC 1998) but with some subsequent regrouping (IWC 2017), are:<br/><br/>A. Western South Atlantic: Coast of Brazil from Cabo São Roque (5°S) to Cabo Frio (23°S), but especially on the Abrolhos Bank (17-20°S);<br/><br/>B. Eastern South Atlantic: Benin Bight and Gulf of Guinea, from the waters of the Republic of Congo to the waters of Guinea (B1), West coast of southern Africa, including waters of South Africa, Namibia and Angola (B2);<br/><br/>C. Southwestern Indian Ocean: Coast of Natal, northeastern South Africa &#160;East Africa, including waters of Mozambique, Tanzania (incl. Zanzibar), Mayotte and the Comoros Islands (C1+C2), Eastern and southern Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius (C3+C4);<br/><br/>D. Western Australia: migration along the west Australian coast to wintering grounds off northwestern Australia;<br/><br/>E. Eastern Australia and Southwest Pacific: Eastern Australia (E1),<br/><br/>F. Oceania: New Caledonia (E2), Fiji and Tonga (E3), Cook Islands (F1), French Polynesia (F2);<br/><br/>G. Eastern South and equatorial Pacific: &#160;Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The groups A-G were originally considered to represent main breeding populations with the numbered sub-groups representing subpopulations. However, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently grouped subgroups E2, E3, F1 and F2 together as the Oceania breeding population. Subgroups C1 and C2 were combined, as have C3 and C4.<br/><br/>The feeding ranges of the different populations overlap in the Antarctic, with some movement of individuals around the Antarctic (IWC 1998), but overall the whales appear to feed preferentially in the sectors nearest to their wintering grounds. The sex ratio in the wintering areas tends to be biased towards males, potentially reflecting a reduced presence of females in their non-calving years or a generally shorter residence time of females (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). Rare movements of both sexes between breeding populations have been observed (e.g., western Africa to Madagascar (Pomilla and Rosenbaum 2005) and Brazil to Madagascar (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2011)).<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><em><strong></strong></em><br/>There is a resident year-round population in the Arabian Sea, whose range includes the waters of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011) and which is genetically isolated from other Humpback Whales (Pomilla <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, song types characteristic of Humpback Whales in the southwestern Indian Ocean have been detected off Oman (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2018); this could indicate the presence of Humpbacks from different populations in the Arabian Sea, or that Arabian Sea Humpbacks sometimes venture further afield and acquire new songs.<br/><br/>Only a few calves have been seen in the Arabian Sea, but from foetus sizes in pregnant whales captured in November 1966, Mikhalev (1997) concluded that the peak calving season is probably in February, with some spread. This is in contrast to Southern Humpback Whales, where peak calving occurs in July-August (Clapham and Mead 1999).<br/><br/>There have been a few records in the Persian Gulf, including the type specimen for <em>M. indica</em> (Gervais 1883) assumed to be a Humpback Whale; these were previously regarded as vagrants, but it is now thought that the regular range extends into the Persian Gulf (Dakhteh <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales seem to be quite rare in Indian waters (Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008) but there have been occasional strandings (Sutaria 2018) and acoustic detections (Madhusudhana <em>et al</em>. 2018) along the west coast. Of 14 individuals satellite-tagged off Oman during 2014-17, one was tracked to Goa and thence to the southern tip of India by January 2018 and back to the tagging site by March 2018 (Willson <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two specimens from the west coast of Sri Lanka (a bycatch in 1981 and a stranding in 1990) (Ilangakoon 2006) and Humpback Whale songs have been during February and March 1982 in the Gulf of Mannar, NW Sri Lanka (Whitehead 1985). Humpback Whales seem to be rare or absent in the northeastern Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.<br/><br/>There have been several sightings over the past 10 years in the northern Red Sea, including the Gulf of Aqaba, but the provenance of those Humpback Whales is unclear (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Large-scale exploitation of this species has ceased, but hunting for local consumption continues in Greenland and the island of Bequia (eastern&#160; Caribbean) (IWC 2018b).

The last substantial catches occurred in 1968. Despite having been severely depleted to a world population in the low thousands at that time, Humpbacks have recovered strongly to a world population that is estimated at over 80,000 mature animals and is increasing.<br/><br/>Humpback Whales enjoy additional protective measures, such as sanctuaries, in a number of countries.

DD was considered as still potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” Although the information is sparse, this species appears to occur in a variety of locations and across a substantial swath of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere and is not rare, therefore the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied.

Mean group size for 31 at-sea sightings was 3.1 animals (range 1-8: Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2004). Based on stranded animals, Patel <em>et al</em>. (2017) suggested that this species might occur in sexually segregated groups, often comprising unrelated individuals. Although few stomach contents have been identified, Best (2007) reported that off South Africa, Gray’s Beaked Whale consumed mostly fish prey (e.g. hake, <em>Merluccious </em>sp<em>.</em>, and two mesopelagic genera, <em>Lampadena spp</em>, <em>Photichthys argenteus</em>), although evidence from New Zealand suggests that small squids may be preferred there (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2014).

The full extent of this threat to this species is unknown and as of 2020 there are no known cases of them taken as bycatch. </p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). However, there are no confirmed cases of sonic related atypical mass strandings of beaked whales in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). Parts of this species range occur in areas with documented higher plastic pollution than the colder parts of its range (Suaria et al. 2020) and could be the single most important threat to this species given reduced threats from anthropogenic noise and fisheries bycatch compared to other beaked whales.&#160; &#160;</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and is a potential health hazard of unknown significance. However, in all reported cases, organochlorine residues found in Southern Hemisphere small cetacean are lower than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts (O’Shea <em>et al. </em>1980, Reijnders <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>  <p>Mesoplodonts are small whales that normally live far offshore; mortalities from ship strikes would be difficult to document, but some possible cases have been reported (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2009), including for this species (Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2004).</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species, although the nature and magnitude of these impacts is unknown at this time (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, these whales are unlikely to be impacted unless their prey are impacted and with their distribution throughout areas with canyons and deep-water, the threat to prey availability is low.</p>","<p>There are no estimates of abundance or population trends for this species, although it may not be as rare as some other <em>Mesoplodon</em> species. However, Thompson et al. (2016) suggested based on genetics that the population is large. Although rarely identified alive in the wild, it strands most commonly in New Zealand – Patel<em> et al.</em> (2017) reported 103 strandings there over a 20-y period (1993-2013).&#160; Strandings on the Chatham Islands date back to 1874 (<span class=""reference-text""><span lang=""EN-US"">von Haast 1876). &#160;Subtle morphological differences between Gray’s Beaked Whales on the east and west sides of New Zealand suggested restricted gene flow between these populations (Thompson <em>et al</em>. 2014), but a subsequent genetics analysis found that Gray’s Beaked Whales from all around New Zealand and western Australia were part of a large, panmictic population (Thompson <em>et al.</em> 2016).</span></p>",Unknown,"<p>Gray’s Beaked Whale has a circumpolar range in cool-temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere with most stranding records from between of 30°S and 45˚S (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2010) which includes some warm-temperate waters.&#160; Although there have been sightings in Antarctic waters to 65°S (Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2004), nearly all records (sightings and strandings) are from north of the Polar Front (<span lang=""EN-US"">Kasamatsu and Joyce 1990). Stranding locations include New Zealand, southern Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. There are numerous strandings, including numerous mass strandings, on the east and west coasts of New Zealand, in particular around the North Island and northern South Island of New Zealand (Baker 1999, Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2004, Thompson et al. 2013).

Combining the most current abundance estimates for the known and surveyed subpopulations results in a total global abundance of more than 170,000 whales, however this does not include Northeast Greenland or the Russian Arctic for which no estimates are available. Ten subpopulations number more than 10,000 individuals, and two subpopulations number more than 35,000. One subpopulation is thought to be increasing, five are considered stable, and for five the trend is unknown. As a species, the Narwhal does not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and is listed as Least Concern </p>  <p></p><p>Across the global range of the Narwhal, subpopulations are of various sizes and subject to differing levels of threats. Due to this variability, some of the subpopulations warrant Red List assessment.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Narwhals spend approximately two months each summer in ice-free bays and fjords of the Canadian Arctic, eastern Baffin Island, western and eastern Greenland, and Svalbard (Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). In some parts of this range during summer they may aggregate at tidewater glacier fronts (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2014, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). In autumn, Narwhals migrate with the forming fast ice to wintering areas that tend to be deep, offshore, ice-covered habitats along the continental slope (Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are highly adapted to winter habitats with limited open water (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). Few other cetaceans use areas with such dense sea ice cover, and Narwhals have remarkable site fidelity to these areas. They may dive to depths of over 1,500 m multiple times per day and spend over 3 h per day at depths of 800 m (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003,<em></em> 2010). A double-platform visual aerial survey over a Narwhal wintering ground in West Greenland found high densities of whales in the leads and cracks of the Baffin Bay pack ice, up to an average density of about 77 Narwhals/km² (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011).</p>  <p></p><p>In the winter, Narwhals feed intensively at the sea floor (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, <em></em>2004; Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a) but some subpopulations may also feed on pelagic prey (Watt and Ferguson 2014). A major portion of the annual energy intake is obtained during the winter. Although there seems to be relatively little feeding activity during the summer, Narwhals apparently feed opportunistically during this time. Narwhal sighting probability in winter in habitats with &lt;50% open water is significantly higher than sighting probability in habitats with &gt;50% open water, suggesting that the animals select for optimal foraging areas in dense pack ice regardless of the availability of open water (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). In the autumn and winter Narwhals are vulnerable to ice entrapments, or sassats, when rapidly changing conditions cause open-water areas used by the whales to freeze over and trap them, sometimes leading to suffocation (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). Calving occurs in spring during the northbound (or in some populations inshore) migration that coincides with the receding sea ice. There is remarkable consistency across Narwhal subpopulations in the types of habitat used, in site fidelity to migration routes and summering and wintering areas, and in feeding patterns (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Fish, squid, and shrimp make up the Narwhal’s diet (Hay and Mansfield 1989, Heide-Jørgensen 2009), especially Arctic fish species, such as Greenland Halibut (<em>R</em><em>einhardtius hippoglossoides</em>), Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), and Polar Cod (<em>Arctogadus glacialis</em>) (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a).</p>  <p></p>","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease (see also Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance among the many Narwhal subpopulations varies. </p>  <p>Narwhals were never the targets of large-scale commercial hunting except for a brief period of several decades of the early 20th century in the eastern Canadian Arctic (Mitchell and Reeves 1981). They were hunted opportunistically by commercial whalers, explorers and adventurers in many parts of their range. At present, Narwhals are hunted only in some indigenous communities in Canada and Greenland – for both human consumption and for ivory (see Use and Trade). In some communities Narwhal carcasses are at least partially used as dog food. The strong fidelity of Narwhals, which causes them to return to the same nearshore areas each summer, makes them highly vulnerable to overexploitation. In nearly all parts of their range, hunting is now controlled by limits on harvest levels that are judged to be sustainable (NAMMCO in prep.) (also see the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section) </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial loss of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), including changes in the timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015, Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The effects of climate change on Narwhals are uncertain. Broad changes in the ecosystem may influence the distribution of their prey. Narwhals are well adapted to a life in the pack ice as indicated by the fact that there is very little open water in their winter habitat (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005b), and they can be found in high densities in areas with more than 98% ice coverage (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). They spend much of their time in heavy ice and in some areas are vulnerable to ice entrapments where hundreds can become trapped in a small opening in the sea ice and die (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). This occurs when sudden changes in weather conditions (such as shifts in wind or rapid drops in temperature) freeze shut leads and cracks that the Narwhals were using, and such entrapment may be occurring more often as autumn freeze-up occurs later in the year and on an unpredictable schedule (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). When entrapped whales are discovered by hunters, they normally are harvested. Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) are known to prey on Narwhal in summering areas (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the presence Killer Whales in such areas can greatly affect Narwhal behavior (Breed <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sea ice normally inhibits movements of Killer Whales, and Higdon and Ferguson (2009) documented substantial increases in Killer Whale presence in Hudson Bay when sea ice reduction allowed them to pass through Hudson Strait. An assessment of the sensitivity of all arctic marine mammals to climate change ranked the Narwhal as one of the three most sensitive species, primarily due to its narrow geographic distribution, specialized feeding and habitat choice, and high site fidelity (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p>Known or potential threats to Narwhals include a variety of commercial human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is facilitating increases in the scale and distribution of those activities. Oil and gas development is ongoing and expanding, and along with commercial shipping is likely to modify and degrade habitat used by Narwhals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas in Greenland and arctic Russia are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which often includes seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by ice breaking and shipping. Finley <em>et al</em>. (1990) found that Narwhals at an ice edge reacted strongly to ice-breaking ships, and Cosens and Duek (1993) concluded that Narwhals would likely be able to detect the high-frequency components of icebreaker noise 25-30 km from the source. Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> (2013) speculated that noise from seismic surveys, at least in some contexts, could enhance the susceptibility of Narwhals to ice-entrapment.</p>  <p>Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants that are high enough to cause impacts on health and reproductive performance (Ross 2000). Organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants have been found in Narwhals in several areas (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2004). At Svalbard, Wolkers <em>et al</em>. (2006) found that levels of contaminants in Narwhals were higher than those in Beluga Whales (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>). </p>  <p></p><p>Commercial fisheries for Greenland Halibut operate in both the Canada and Greenland sides of Baffin Bay/Davis Strait and have done so on the inshore Greenland side for several decades (Treble and Bowering 2002). This fishing overlaps spatially with where Narwhals winter and feed extensively on the target species, Greenland Halibut (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Narwhals are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2006), but significant epizootics have not been recorded. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2001) found a low prevalence of exposure to <em>Brucella</em> spp. in Narwhals sampled in arctic Canada. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2000) found no serological evidence of exposure to morbilliviruses, and speculated that because they are immunologically naïve, Narwhals are at considerable risk of a serious epidemic if they become exposed. Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could influence disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The global Narwhal population consists of about 12 subpopulations with varying degrees of genetic differentiation and geographical isolation (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to incomplete sampling in parts of the range, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee recognized two stocks of Narwhal but noted that there were probably more that were not yet recognized (IWC 2000). A recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids (GROM) hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 12 Narwhal stocks (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>Discrimination and definition of subpopulations are based mostly on nearshore areas (principally fjords and bays) where Narwhals congregate during summer. Genetic studies, satellite telemetry, traditional ecological knowledge, stable isotope values, and contaminant analyses have shown that Narwhals have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (e.g., Palsbøll <em>et al.</em> 1997, Riget <em>et al</em>. 2002, de March <em>et al</em>. 2003, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2013). <br/></p>  <p>Available information on sizes of Narwhal subpopulations is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Northern Hudson Bay</strong></p>  <p></p><p>Narwhals from the Northern Hudson Bay subpopulation summer in northwestern Hudson Bay, particularly in Repulse Bay and in waters around Southampton Island. They winter in eastern Hudson Strait (Richard 1991, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010). The abundance of Northern Hudson Bay Narwhals in 2011, corrected for perception bias (animals that were at the surface but not seen by observers) and availability bias (animals too deep to be seen by observers), was estimated as 12,485 (CV 0.21; Asselin <em>et al</em>. 2012). Richard (1991) reported results of surveys conducted in 1982, 1983, and 1984 that were limited to areas with less than 20% ice cover and his estimates were not corrected for availability. Abundance estimates from Richard (1991) ranged from 1,038 to 1,517 but were certainly biased negatively. A similar survey in 2000 estimated uncorrected abundance as 1,780 (Bourassa 2003). Abundance of this subpopulation is believed to be fairly stable (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Somerset Island</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Somerset Island subpopulation range over a large area in the eastern Canadian Arctic. During summer, satellite-tagged animals were mostly concentrated around Somerset Island and they spent winter in Baffin Bay (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). The abundance of Somerset Island Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 49,768 (CV 0.20; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Previous abundance surveys were flown in 1982, 1996, and 2002. The corrected estimate for 1982 was 27,656 (CV 0.54; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggests that abundance has been increasing. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Admiralty Inlet</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals from the Admiralty Inlet subpopulation remain in and near the Inlet during summer, and spend winter in the Baffin Bay region (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2012). The most recent abundance estimate for Admiralty Inlet Narwhals comes from aerial line-transect surveys flown in 2013 (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). When corrected for perception and availability biases the abundance estimate for this stock was 35,043 (CV 0.42). Four previous surveys in 1975, 1985, 2003, and 2010 yielded lower mean abundance estimates with wide confidence intervals. Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggested that abundance has been stable. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eclipse Sound</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Eclipse Sound subpopulation generally stay in and near the Sound in the summer, and winter in Baffin Bay (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). The abundance of Eclipse Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 10,489 (CV 0.24; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). A previous survey in 2004 produced a higher corrected estimate of 20,225 with wide confidence limits (95% CL 9,471-37,096; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Available data are insufficient to detect any trend in abundance for this subpopulation (Witting 2016). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Baffin Island</strong></p>  <p>The Eastern Baffin Island Narwhal subpopulation summers in Cumberland Sound and along the Baffin Island coast to the north, and winters in northern Davis Strait (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). Abundance in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 17,555 (CV 0.35; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys in 2003 that had similar coverage of the eastern Baffin Island fiord area produced a corrected estimate of 10,073 (SE 3,123) Narwhals in the surveyed region (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Available data are insufficient to detect any trend in abundance for this subpopulation (Witting 2016).&#160;  </p><p><strong>Jones Sound</strong></p>  <p>  </p><p>The Jones Sound subpopulation of Narwhals summers between Devon Island and Ellesmere Island and in fiords of western Ellesmere Island. Jones Sound Narwhals have not been tagged and tracked, and their distribution at times of year other than summer is unknown (NAMMCO in prep.). The abundance of Jones Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 12,694 (CV 0.33; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). That is the only abundance survey conducted in Jones Sound so <a name=""_Hlk486932453"">there is no information on trend for this subpopulation</a>. </p>    <p><strong>Smith Sound</strong></p>  <p> </p><p>The Smith Sound Narwhal subpopulation summers along the southeastern coast of Ellesmere Island (Richard 2010); its wintering area is unknown. Abundance of Smith Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 16,360 (CV 0.65; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). That is the only abundance estimate for Smith Sound so there is no information on trend for this subpopulation. </p>  <p><strong>Inglefield Bredning</strong></p><p>This subpopulation of Narwhals summers in Inglefield Bredning which is its major concentration area in northwestern Greenland (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994). Little is known about distribution at other times of year. Abundance of Inglefield Bredning Narwhals in 2007, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 8,368 (CV 0.25; Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). Previous surveys of this subpopulation were conducted in 1985-86 (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994) and 2001-02 (Heide‐Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2004) with generally similar results, and abundance appears to be stable (Witting 2016).&#160; <br/></p>  <p><strong>Melville Bay</strong></p>  <p> </p><p>The Melville Bay Narwhal subpopulation spends the ice-free season in and near Melville Bay, and may spend significant time at the fronts of coastal glaciers that are important habitats for them (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). With freeze-up they move south to the southern part of Baffin Bay for overwintering (Dietz and Heide-Jørgensen 1995). Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported that the range of Narwhals in Melville Bay contracted over the period from 2007 to 2014. Abundance in 2014, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 3,091 (95% CI 1,228-7,783). Previous surveys resulted in estimates of 5,605 whales (95% CI 1,319-23,815) in 2007 and 2,983 (95% CI 1,452-6,127) in 2012 (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2014). Confidence limits for all three surveys overlap broadly and abundance appears fairly stable (Witting 2016). </p>  <p><strong>Northeast Greenland</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals assigned to the Northeast Greenland subpopulation are frequently seen during May-August in Young Sound (74°N) and along the coast as far north as Nordost Rundingen (82°N; Boertmann <em>et al</em>. 2009). There has been no attempt to estimate abundance of Narwhals in north-eastern Greenland, but surveys of the area were planned for 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.).<strong>&#160; </strong><strong><br/></strong></p>  <p><strong>East Greenland</strong></p>  <p></p><p>In summer Narwhals occur along the east coast of Greenland mostly from about 64° to 72° N, but they have been reported at more than 81° (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994), which means the distinction between Northeast and East Greenland Narwhals is uncertain. Narwhals are relatively common in Scoresby Sound and the Kangerlussuaq fjord (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). They winter in sea ice in the Greenland Sea and Fram Strait, but winter observations are sparse (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Aerial surveys conducted in Scoresby Sound in 1983-84 and from Tasiilaq to Scoresby Sound in 2008 and 2016 resulted in conflicting results, leading to the conclusion (as of summer 2017) that Narwhals off East Greenland are widely scattered and may number fewer than 1,000 individuals (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Svalbard- Russia</strong><br/></p><p>Narwhals that occur around Svalbard and in the northwestern Russian High Arctic have been little studied but they are thought to be widely distributed in low numbers throughout this region (Heide-Jørgensen 2009). Gjertz (1991) described previous observations and catches that were largely west and north of Svalbard. In August 1998, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. (2007) tagged three subadult Narwhals at Svalbard with satellite-relay data loggers and tracked them for up to 46 days. The whales spent time in fiords in western Svalbard, then moved north and east to deep offshore waters north of 80°N. A survey in the marginal ice zone north of Svalbard in August 2015 produced a corrected estimate of 837 (CV 0.50) Narwhals, but this estimate is negatively biased because the study area did not include the whole range used by Narwhals around Svalbard (Vacquie-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are no estimates of abundance for other areas and overall abundance and trend for this subpopulation are unknown (NAMMCO in prep.). &#160;  </p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p></p><p>The sum of the abundance estimates for the 12 Narwhal subpopulations listed above is 173,134. There is no estimate for Northeast Greenland and the figure for the Svalbard-Russia region is known to be an underestimate because only a portion of the known range was surveyed. If 71% of the overall Narwhal population consists of mature animals (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), the minimum number of mature individuals would be 122,925. The number of mature individuals in the largest subpopulation (Somerset Island) is estimated as 35,335. For the six subpopulations for which there is some information on trend, one is thought to be increasing and five are likely stable. </p>  <p>The generation length for the Narwhal was estimated as 21.9 years by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) and as 30 and 33 years in East and West Greenland, respectively, by Garde <em>et al</em>. (2015) using aspartic acid ageing. Using these estimates, three generations is 66-99 years. For most subpopulations, abundance estimates for years prior to 2000 do not exist, so trends in abundance over a three-generation period cannot be calculated.</p>  <p></p><p>  </p><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p></p>",Unknown,"Narwhals primarily inhabit the Arctic, including northeastern Canada, northern Greenland, Svalbard, and waters of northern Russia as far east as the East Siberian Sea. Their principal distribution is from the central Canadian Arctic (Peel Sound – Prince Regent Inlet and northern Hudson Bay) eastward to Greenland (Rice 1998). In the Canada-Greenland region in summer, Narwhals spend approximately two months in the high Arctic, largely in bays and fjords; they overwinter in offshore, deep, partially ice-covered habitat along the continental slope (Heide-Jørgensen and Dietz 1995). Narwhals migrate annually between these disjunct seasonal concentration areas, with the migratory periods lasting approximately two months (Koski and Davis 1994, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). Vagrants have been recorded at Newfoundland, the British Isles, Germany, and the Netherlands in the east, and in the Chukchi and Bering seas as far south as the Alaska Peninsula and Commander Islands (Rice 1998).","<p>Narwhals are hunted in Canada and Greenland for human and animal food and for tusk ivory. They supply various staples in the traditional subsistence economy. Today the main products are mattak (skin with some blubber attached) and ivory (Reeves 1993, Reeves and Heide-Jørgensen 1994, Heide-Jørgensen 1994). Narwhal tusks from Canada and Greenland are sold in specialty souvenir markets domestically and are also exported, either as whole tusks or as carved items. </p><p>In the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012), intense hunting of Narwhals (including associated loss due to wounding and sinking) in Greenland and Canada was described as a cause for concern, particularly given the lack of reliable data on hidden mortality and serious injury (see Finley and Miller 1982). Statistics on the number of Narwhals reported as landed by the hunting communities are available starting in the 1950s for Greenland and the 1970s for Canada (NAMMCO in prep.).​ Data summarized by Shadbolt<em> et al</em>. (2015) for the period 2007-2011 show a mean annual retrieved catch of 358 in Greenland and 621 in Canada. The Canadian catch was unusually large due to 624 Narwhals being taken from an ice entrapment event in 2008. Watt and Hall (2016) presented Canadian harvest data that had been corrected for estimated struck and lost. Those data indicate that the total number of Narwhals killed in Canada averaged 620/year (range 515-768) during 2011-2015. <br/></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>The Narwhal is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). As a result, a non-detriment finding (NDF; analysis showing that the taking and trade is not detrimental to the species’ survival or to maintenance of the species “throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystems in which it occurs”) by the Scientific Authority of the exporting country is required for export. This requirement has had the effect of forcing both Canada and Greenland to document catch and trade levels and to provide data on abundance and trends of hunted Narwhal stocks. Negative NDFs were issued for both countries (Greenland in 2005, Canada in 2010; Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015) making exports of Narwhal ivory from several stocks in Canada illegal for a brief period in 2010-11 and leading to a temporary export ban in Greenland in 2006. This ban remained in effect through at least February 2014 despite the fact that new information reported in 2009 indicated that removal levels for at least some stocks in Greenland were sustainable (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015). The NAMMCO Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic and the JCNB [Canada/Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga] Scientific Working Group meet jointly every other year to review new information on the biology of Narwhals and Belugas, update assessments, and provide advice to the Canada and Greenland governments based, in part, on a catch allocation model designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of removals from the various stocks (NAMMCO 2016, in prep.). Greenland’s annual report to NAMMCO in 2016 (NAMMCO 2017) noted that the NDF for 2016 compared catches and advice for 2013, 2014, and 2015, concluding that, “as a whole, in the period 2013-2015, catches … followed the advice from NAMMCO, JCNB or IWC for all stocks, except Narwhals in Inglefield Bredning, Melville Bay, Ittoqqortormiit and Tasiilaq.”<br/> <br/> The European Union established an import ban on Narwhal tusks in December 2004. This ban apparently was lifted in February 2010 in response to the fact that Greenland had introduced a quota system “based on scientific advice and more accurate population abundance numbers” (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015). Importation of Narwhal products into the United States has been prohibited under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act since 1972.</p>  <p>Particularly in the context of NAMMCO (NAMMCO, in prep.) and among non-governmental organizations (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015), there is increasing recognition of the need to improve understanding of the impacts – direct and indirect, individual and cumulative – on Narwhals from climate change and associated changes in human activity in the Arctic (e.g., mining, oil and gas development, shipping, fisheries, tourism).</p><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50368125,15421,Orcinus orca,Data Deficient,,2017,2017-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Killer Whale, as the taxon is presently defined and recognized (Society for Marine Mammalogy 2017), does not meet any of the IUCN Red List criteria for a threatened status. Killer Whales are numerically abundant (at least tens of thousands of mature individuals) and very widely distributed. Experts agree that the present taxon likely includes more than one subspecies, and possibly multiple species. Some small regional populations are known to have declined significantly and would easily qualify for a threatened status if assessed individually (e.g., ENP southern residents, the Bluefin Tuna-dependent population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar), but there is insufficient evidence to support a global decline in the species abundance that would make it meet Criterion A. However, the statement in the previous species assessment (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2013) still holds: “The combination of potential declines driven by depletion of prey resources and the effects of pollutants is believed sufficient that a 30% global reduction over three generations (77 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out for some ‘groups’ that may [eventually] be designated as species.” <br/></p>  <p>Although considerable effort continues to be made on improved understanding of the taxonomy of the genus <em>Orcinus</em>, the taxonomic issues have not been fully resolved. This is especially problematic due to the occurrence of sympatric, non-interbreeding ecotypes in the ENP, Antarctic, and possibly elsewhere. The taxon has previously been listed by IUCN as Data Deficient due to taxonomic uncertainty, and that listing should be continued until proper taxonomic units are described and Red List assessments of them can be carried out.</p>","<p>Killer Whales are known to   feed on a wide array of prey, including most marine mammal species (except river dolphins and Manatees), seabirds, sea turtles, many species of fish   (including sharks and rays) and cephalopods (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Ford   and Ellis 1999, Ford 2009). They have a diversity of foraging tactics,   including intentional beaching to capture pinnipeds on shore, creating waves   to wash seals off ice floes, and using cooperative techniques to herd fish   and to attack large prey such as Tuna and large whales (Dahlheim and Heyning   1999, Baird 2000, Pitman and Durban 2012).</p><p>Although Killer Whales are a generalist as a species, at least some   subpopulations (ecotypes and/or morphotypes) specialize on particular types   of prey (Bigg <em>et al</em>. 1990, Baird 2000). Studies in coastal waters of   the ENP, from California to Alaska, have described three distinct ecotypes of   Killer Whales, referred to as residents, transients (or Bigg’s Killer Whales),   and offshores. Although distinguished by ecological differences, there are   also differences in coloration, external morphology, behavior and acoustics   (Ford and Ellis 2014). The three ecotypes maintain social isolation from each   other (<em>i.e</em>., no interbreeding)   despite sometimes overlapping ranges. The ENP residents are Pacific Salmon   specialists and have a strong preference for one species, the Chinook Salmon   (Ford and Ellis 2006). Transients in coastal waters of the ENP focus their   foraging on pinnipeds and small cetaceans but also take large whales, especially   calves, opportunistically. Killer Whales in coastal Norway specialize on Herring   (Simila <em>et al</em>. 1996) and in the Strait of Gibraltar on Bluefin Tuna   (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006). Some Killer Whales in New Zealand may forage   selectively on rays and other elasmobranchs (Visser 1999), and in Western   Australia, Killer Whales take scores of Humpback Whale calves for several   months a year (Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2015).   Off the south coast of Western Australia one group of Killer Whales forages,   at least seasonally, on Beaked Whales (Wellard <em>et al</em>. 2106). In the Antarctic, there are five described ecotypes   of Killer Whales, each of them morphologically distinct with different   habitat and prey preferences. One type specializes on Minke Whales and Elephant   Seals taken in open water, one eats mostly ice-associated seals taken off ice   floes, another regularly preys on penguins but is probably mainly a   fish-eater, another rarely seen form has only been observed depredating Patgonian   Toothfish from commercial longlines, and the smallest form appears to be   entirely a fish-eater (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durban <em>et al.</em>   2016). <br/></p>   <p>Long-distance migrations   have been documented for high-latitude Killer Whales. Matthews <em>et al</em>. (2011) satellite-tracked an   individual for 5,400 km (and 38° of latitude) from the eastern Canadian   Arctic into the central North Atlantic. Durban and Pitman (2012) tracked Killer   Whales from the Antarctic Peninsula to southern Brazil and back – a non-stop   roundtrip of almost 9,400 km, and Pitman <em>et   al</em>. (in prep.) tracked fish-eating ecotype Killer Whales from the Ross   Sea to north of New Zealand and back – a &gt;11,000 km roundtrip covering 48°   of latitude. Many Antarctic Killer Whales appear to be highly philopatric. In   the Antarctic, some ecotypes readily enter areas of floe ice in search of   prey, while others hunt only in open water (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman and   Durban 2012). Killer Whales in some areas congregate seasonally in coastal   channels to forage and occasionally enter river mouths.</p>","<p>Killer Whales have been exploited (i.e., deliberately hunted) in several regions. Norwegian whalers in the eastern North Atlantic took an average of 56 whales per year from 1938 to 1981. Whalers in Japan took an average of 43 per year in coastal waters from 1946 to 1981. Soviet commercial whalers took an average of 26 Killer Whales annually from 1935 to 1979, primarily in the Antarctic, and then took 916 animals in the 1979/80 Antarctic season (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999,). Killer whales are also taken in small numbers for food (or as a population control measure) in coastal fisheries in Japan, Greenland, Indonesia, and the Caribbean islands (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/> Fishermen in many areas see Killer Whales as competitors, and intentional shooting is known to occur. This problem was especially serious in Alaska, where depredation of longline fisheries is extensive (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, Yano and Dahlheim 1995, Donohue <em>et al</em>. 2003), and retaliation for depredation was credited with contributing to a temporary population decline at Crozet Island, in the Southern Ocean (Poncelet <em>et al</em>. 2010). Depredation of longline catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., Aleutian Islands and Southeast Alaska, South Georgia, Crozet Islands, and several other Southern Ocean Subantarctic island areas, Australia, and other locations in the South Pacific). Increased depredation of Toothfish hooked in fisheries in the Crozet Archipelago appears to have had a positive effect on calving rates of female Killer Whales (Tixier <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> Incidental mortality in trawl, longline and driftnet fishing operations occurs, but is considered rare (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> Persistent bio-accumulating contaminants present a serious potential risk to some Killer Whale populations. Ross <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were very high in three Killer Whale populations (2 resident and 1 transient) frequenting the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada. Transient Killer Whales were particularly contaminated due to their high trophic position in the marine ecosystem. PCB levels in most Killer Whales sampled were greater than levels established at which adverse effects occur in Harbor Seals, suggesting that the majority of free-ranging Killer Whales in this region are at risk of toxic effects. The southern resident and transient Killer Whales of British Columbia and Washington are considered among the most PCB-contaminated cetaceans in the world (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2000). &#160;More recently, Jepson <em>et al</em>. (2016) found very high mean blubber PCB concentrations in Killer Whales in Europe. Small or declining populations of Killer Whales in the northeastern Atlantic (e.g., the very small population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar) have been associated with low recruitment, which is consistent with PCB-induced reproductive toxicity. Also, increasing levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers which, like PCBs, can cause immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive impairment, have become a concern in the southern resident population in British Columbia and Washington (Mongillo <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p><br/> Disturbance is another concern in areas where Killer Whales are subject to whale-watching tourism. Moving boats can disrupt foraging and resting, and underwater boat noise can affect social and echolocation signals of the whales or otherwise interfere with foraging (Erbe 2002, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, Noren <em>et al.</em> 2009). For example, close approaches by whale-watching vessels have been shown to result in avoidance responses by resident Killer Whales in British Columbia, which presumably has energetic costs to whales that are frequently subjected to this activity (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2006). Fast-moving boats in the proximity of Killer Whales also present a risk of vessel strikes (e.g., Visser 1999). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Potential disturbance and acoustic masking effects of increasing ambient noise levels associated with shipping and other vessel traffic is a growing concern in some regions (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Disturbance responses and masking of echolocation signals in areas with heavy ship activity have the potential to disrupt foraging behavior and reduce prey acquisition with possible population-level consequences (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014, Veirs <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/> <br/> </p>  <p>The <em>Exxon Valdez</em> oil spill in Alaska in March 1989 was strongly correlated with the subsequent loss of Killer Whales from transient and resident pods that had been seen swimming near or through oil slicks early in the spill (Dahlheim and Matkin 1994). The AT1 pod had at least 22 individuals when first censused in 1984, before the spill. Eleven individuals have been missing from this pod since 1990 and two more since 1992. Four more whales from this pod died in the early 2000s and there have been no recorded births within the pod since 1984. As of 2012, only 7 of the original 22 AT1 pod members remained. A resident Killer Whale pod affected by the oil had failed to recover 16 years after the spill (Matkin <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2012). Oil spills may also have indirect effects on Killer Whales by reducing prey abundance. </p>  <p><br/> There have been large-scale reductions in predatory fish populations (Myers and Worm 2003; Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003) along with overfishing and collapse of several important “prey” fish stocks worldwide (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2001). There have also been large declines in some marine mammal populations but many of those populations have recovered or are recovering under protection, and this may mean that some mammal-eating populations of Killer Whales are recovering as well. The same is not likely true of many fish-eating populations, however. </p>  <p><br/> Due to their dietary specialization, some populations of Killer Whales could be especially vulnerable to a reduction of their food supply. In British Columbia and Washington State, many Pacific Salmon stocks have significantly declined as a result of overfishing, habitat degradation, and reduced survival at sea. Declines in survival and reproductive rates of resident Killer Whales were found to correlate with a multi-year reduction in Chinook Salmon abundance in coastal British Columbia and Washington State (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ford <em>et al.</em> 2010). Mammal-eating Killer Whales along the west coast of North America likely experienced periods of reduced prey availability due to depletion of pinniped populations prior to 1970 (Ford and Ellis 1999). Depletion of Bluefin Tuna stocks in the Mediterranean Sea has almost certainly had a serious impact on the survival of Killer Whales near the Strait of Gibraltar (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006, Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> How global climate change and its impacts on the marine environment will affect the different populations and ecotypes of Killer Whales is uncertain (e.g., Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, in the Arctic, declining extent and duration of sea ice has given Killer Whales more access to marine mammal prey (Belugas, Narwhals, Bowhead Whales) that depend on ice for refuge from predation (Ferguson <em>et al.</em> 2010, Higdon <em>et al</em>. 2012, George <em>et al.</em> 2015). Similarly, in the Antarctic, the abundance and availability of Killer Whale prey is mediated through the presence of ice (<em>e.g</em>., Pitman and Durban 2012), which means that many species, including both Killer Whales and their prey, face an uncertain future.</p>","<p>Killer Whale populations   have been relatively well-studied in the North Pacific. In the Eastern Tropical   Pacific, a line-transect survey resulted in an estimate of 8,500 (CV=0.37) in   1986-1990 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). A catalogue of 86 individuals was   compiled for waters around the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, from   1972-1997 (Guerrero-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 1998). A shipboard line-transect   survey of the Hawaii EEZ in 2002 resulted in an estimate of 349 (CV = 0.98) Killer   Whales (Barlow 2006). The southern resident population that inhabits the   inland waters of Washington State and southern British Columbia numbered 77   whales in June 2017 (K.C. Balcomb, Center for Whale Research, pers. comm., 13   June 2017); it is depleted due to past live removals and is listed as   endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and Canada’s Species at Risk   Act. The northern resident population in British Columbia numbered 290 in   2014 and had been increasing at a mean rate of 2.2% per annum since 1974   (Towers <em>et al</em>. 2015). A   photographic catalogue of the west coast transient population in British   Columbia and Southeast Alaska included 272 individuals in 2012 (Towers <em>et al.</em> 2012). This population was   estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of about 2% in the two   decades ending in 2006 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2007). Bayesian mark-recapture modelling estimated that there were 300   offshore-type Killer Whales (95% CL 257–373) in the region from Alaska to   California in 2012 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2014). Shipboard line-transect surveys extending out to 300 nm offshore in   2005 and 2007 resulted in an estimate of 691 (CV=0.49) off California, Oregon   and Washington (Carretta <em>et al</em>.   2016); these estimates likely include whales from the aforementioned west   coast transient, southern resident, northern resident, and offshore   populations. A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of   Alaska resulted in an estimate of abundance for transient Killer Whales of   251 (CV=0.51) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007), while the AT1 transient   population (which inhabits Prince William Sound and waters of the Seward   Peninsula, Alaska) numbered only 7 animals in 2010 (Matkin <em>et al</em>.   2012). Over 700 unique individual resident Killer Whales were   photo-identified over the course of a field study during 1984-2010 in coastal   waters of the Gulf of Alaska (Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a subset of   pods within this population were regularly encountered, and those pods   increased in abundance at an average rate of 3.5% per annum during the study.   A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of Alaska   resulted in an estimate of 991 (CV=0.52) resident Killer Whales and 251 (CV=0.51)   transient Killer Whales (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/></p>   <p>The following figures are   available for Killer Whales in the Russian Far East, all representing   photo-identified individuals and therefore “minimum” counts (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014, Erich Hoyt, Whale and   Dolphin Conservation, pers. comm. 12 June 2017): Avacha   Gulf/eastern Kamchatka (1999-2013) – resident type 688, transient type 26   (note that rate of new discovery is very low indicating this may be close to   actual levels of abundance, and site fidelity is much higher than in the   Commander Islands); Commander Islands (2008-2013) - residents &gt; 800,   transients 18 (note that rate of new discovery is high so actual abundance is   certainly higher and about 80% of the identified individuals were encountered   in only one year); western Okhotsk Sea (from Udskaya Gulf to Sakhalin Gulf,   mainly Academiya Gulf) (2011-2013) – residents none, transients 55 (note that no dedicated study was carried out, only   opportunistic sightings along with beluga research; also this is the   population that has been subject to live-capture since 2010).<br/>   <br/>   Line-transect surveys have resulted in high estimates of abundance in several   regions in the North Atlantic, 3,100 (CV=0.63) in Norwegian waters in the   1980s (Øien 1990) and 6,618 (CV=0.32) in Iceland and Faroe Islands waters   also in the 1980s (Gunnlaugsson and Sigurjónsson 1990, Sigurjónsson <em>et al</em>.   1989). A long-term photo-identification study in coastal northern Norway   resulted in an abundance estimate of 731 (CI = 505-1059) in 2003 (Kuningas <em>et al</em>. 2014). In central and southern   European waters there are only two known populations of Killer Whales – one   in the Strait of Gibraltar with 39 individuals in 2011 (Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016) and the other a pod of   nine individuals regularly seen around western Ireland and northwestern   Scotland (Beck <em>et al</em>. 2013). Killer   Whales are not common in the waters off the eastern United States. Line-transect   surveys yielded an estimate of 133 (CV=49%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico in   the early 2000s (Waring <em>et al</em>.   2006).<br/>   <br/>   Several analyses of line-transect surveys have yielded abundance estimates   for Killer Whales around Antarctica (Hammond 1984, Kasamatsu and Joyce 1995);   however, some of the estimates have been considered biased by methodology and   survey coverage (Branch and Butterworth 2001). More recent analyses that   account for some of these biases resulted in an estimate of about 25,000 for   waters south of 60°S (Branch and Butterworth 2001); however, there are still   uncertainties related to coverage of areas in the pack ice, so true abundance   could be higher. Densities are known to vary locally within Antarctic waters,   ranging from very abundant to uncommon (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pitman   and Ensor 2003), and it has been recognized that Killer Whale densities are   higher closer to the ice edge and within the marginal ice zone where the   smaller, fish-eating Killer Whales can occur in aggregations of tens to   hundreds of animals (Berzin and Vladimirov 1983, Pitman and Ensor 2003). A   photo-identification study of type C Killer Whales (a small, fish-eating   form) in McMurdo Sound from 2001-2015 estimated a population of at least 370   animals including 70 that were resident in the Sound each year during the   summer; the remainder were mostly just passing through (Pitman <em>et al</em>. submitted). In the Antarctic   Peninsula area, a photo-identification study of the three different ecotypes   that occur there has to date (June 2017) identified at least 372 type A Killer   Whales (specialist predators of Minke Whales; R. Pitman unpublished data).   Photo-identification studies in the Prince Edward Island Archipelago (mainly   around Marion Island) from 2006-2009 estimated a local population there of   around 42 individuals (95% CI=35-50) that prey seasonally on Penguins and Elephant   Seals (Reisinger <em>et al</em>. 2011). In   other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, 119 (CV=0.20) Killer Whales have been   estimated in New Zealand waters (Visser 2000), and 30 were identified off northern   Patagonia, Argentina, during 1975-1997 (Lopez and Lopez 1985, Iñíguez 2001). No   abundance estimates have been made for type D Killer Whales in the Southern   Hemisphere.<br/>   <br/>   According to Forney and Wade (2006), although the available data are far from   complete, abundance estimates for sampled areas provided a minimum worldwide   abundance estimate of about 50,000 Killer Whales of all types. Those authors   noted that the total was likely higher, because estimates were not available   for many high-latitude areas of the northern hemisphere and for large areas   of the South Pacific, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Killer Whale is the most cosmopolitan of all cetaceans and may be the second-most widely ranging mammal species on the planet, after Humans (Rice 1998). Killer Whales may occur in virtually any marine habitat but are most common in cold-water areas of high marine productivity, particularly at higher latitudes and near shore (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Forney and Wade 2006). Sightings range from the surf zone to the open sea with no clear restrictions of water temperature or depth on their range. The distribution extends to many semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf.<br/></p>  <p>Although Killer Whales occur worldwide, reported densities are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower in the tropics than in the highest latitudes in the Arctic and Antarctic where there has been sampling (Forney and Wade 2006). Killer Whales tend to be more common along continental margins; however, there is some variation in this general pattern that appears linked to ocean productivity. Killer Whales appear to be less common in warm western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio Current, than in more productive eastern boundary currents, such as the California Current. However, they are also common in cold-water western boundary currents such as the Oyashio and Falkland Currents.<br/> <br/> The map shows the inferred range based on a very large number of observations at sea.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>During the period 1962-1977, at least 65 Killer Whales were live-captured in British Columbia and Puget Sound, Washington (Bigg 1982). In addition, from 1976-1988, 59 Killer Whales were captured alive off Iceland: eight were released, three died and 48 (average 3.7 per year) were exported (Sigurjónsson and Leatherwood 1988). Small numbers of Killer Whales have also been live-captured in Japanese waters (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Killer Whales are still in demand for display in aquariums and amusement parks, especially in China. Most recent captures and exports have been of animals in the Russian Far East (Fisher and Reeves 2005, Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014). Of 21 Killer Whales known to have been live-captured in the western Sea of Okhotsk from 2012-2016, at least 13 of them were exported to China between 2013 and 2016 (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). The eastern North Atlantic as well as the ENP populations are included in Appendix II of CMS. <br/> <br/> Further studies on subpopulation structure, abundance and life history are needed for most regions. Regional populations of Killer Whales can be small and highly specialized, and therefore vulnerable to over-exploitation, disturbance, prey reductions and habitat deterioration. Several small populations are already recognized as having a high risk of extinction. Many similarly small and threatened populations may exist worldwide but have not yet been adequately studied and described (e.g., Foote <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Neither the current range-wide population size nor the population trend has yet been satisfactorily quantified. No breeding grounds have been located. The species has to date been listed on the IUCN Red List as Endangered under Criterion D, mature population size below 250 individuals which would correspond to about 400-500 individuals in total. Until all the available data from sighting surveys in the Okhotsk Sea and northwestern North Pacific have been comprehensively analyzed to yield a reliable abundance estimate, the taxon remains listed as Endangered, based on a precautionary application of criterion D, even though it is possible that the number of mature individuals exceeds 250. The Eastern North Pacific Right Whale subpopulation is listed separately as Critically Endangered.","Little is known about habitat use by North Pacific Right Whales. By analogy with its congeners (<em>E. glacialis</em> and<em> E. australis</em>) a diet of mainly copepods is presumed. Satellite  telemetry and acoustic data indicate the importance of the  middle shelf  in the southeastern Bering Sea as a foraging habitat, and peak Right Whale call detections and abundance of the  copepod <em>Calanus marshallae </em>directly coincide (Baumgartner <em>et al.</em> 2013). Monsarrat <em>et al</em>.  (2016) fitted historical North Pacific Right Whale catch data to  environmental covariates such as depth, surface temperature, mixing  layer depth, and distance offshore, as part of an exercise to  characterize Right Whale habitat generally.  <p></p><p>The rarity of coastal records in winter in either historical or recent times indicate that the Right Whale's breeding grounds might have been offshore (Clapham <em>et al.</em> 2004); this is in contrast to southern and North Atlantic Right Whales, both of which form inshore breeding concentrations. However, the paucity of historical sightings in low-latitude coastal waters may reflect early depletion of the species on its feeding grounds. There is clearly some northward migration in summer and southward in winter (Clapham <em>et al.</em> 2004), but the location of the wintering grounds is unknown. </p><p></p>","Hunting of Right Whales in the North Pacific by the Japanese began as early as the late 1500s, and by Europeans and Americans in the 1830s, and by 1900 the population had been reduced to a tiny fraction of its original abundance. Although legally protected by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling since 1948 (and by earlier agreements since 1935) illegal hunting continued until 1971, during which Soviet whaling fleets killed 517 Right Whales in the eastern North Pacific, which may have been the bulk of the remaining population there (Ivashchenko and Clapham 2012, Ivashchenko <em>et al.</em> 2017). <p>  </p><p>There is currently no directed hunting but there have been cases of known and suspected entanglements and ship strikes in the Okhotsk Sea and Kuril Islands, involving at least four whales including one dead (Burdin <em>et al.</em> 2004). Effort is needed to ascertain the frequency of such occurrences, since the low observer effort may mean that most deaths pass unrecorded.</p>  <p>The eastern North Pacific subpopulation appears to be distinct and of extremely small size (only six confirmed females as of 2012) such that its viability may be tenuous. Of the two sightings of Right Whales in 2013 off the  coast  of British Columbia, the first record of this species in Canadian   waters in 62 years, one exhibited a severe but healed injury that was likely from entanglement (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; </p>Experience in the North Atlantic shows that Right Whales are vulnerable to collisions with ships. The projected increase in shipping through the southeastern Bering Sea as the Arctic Ocean becomes more ice-free is a potential threat to the very small eastern North Pacific subpopulation in terms of ship strikes, as well as noise and pollution. Proposed shipping lanes through the Bering Sea and Bering Strait would cross the area designated under the U.S. Endangered Species Act as Critical Habitat for the Eastern North Pacific Right Whale (IWC 2016). It is known that both ships and whales use Unimak Pass through the eastern Aleutian Islands which, like the Bering Strait, represents a choke point; it is not clear if Right Whales occur in the latter area. Efforts are underway to quantify and address the hazard posed by projected increases in shipping (IWC 2016). Overall, the relative remoteness of the area means that carcasses resulting from ship strikes or other anthropogenic causes could easily go undetected, and even a small number of strikes (e.g., less than one per year) could prevent the recovery of the eastern North Pacific subpopulation.    <p></p>","The Right Whale population in the North Pacific is only a small fraction of what it was prior to 19th century whaling. A preliminary estimate of 26,500-37,000 animals taken (including struck and lost) during the period 1839-1909 was given by Scarff (2001), of which 21,000-30,000 were taken during 1840-49 alone. Based on records of encounters of Right Whales by American whaling vessels plotted by Maury (1852) and tabulated by Scarff (1991), areas of highest abundance in summer were the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, southern Bering Sea, both coasts of Kamchatka, the Okhotsk Sea, and the northern Sea of Japan. However, the Maury records have been shown to be unreliable in some cases, and the central North Pacific is no longer considered to be an important portion of the historical range of this species (Josephson <em>et al.</em> 2008). Prior to that, there had been catches of Right Whales off both coasts of Japan since at least the 17<sup>th</sup> century (Omura 1986). There is no evidence of substantial prehistorical catches of Right Whales on the Pacific coast of America. There is pictographic evidence that they were taken off South Korea in neolithic times.<p>  </p><p>Brownell <em>et al. </em>(2001) calculated that 742 Right Whales had been taken in the North Pacific since the start of modern whaling (1911), of which many were killed illegally by the former USSR. Since then, new records of this whaling have come to light which show that 775 Right Whales were taken by Soviet whalers from 1935 to 1971; most of those catches were illegal, including 517 in the eastern North Pacific (Ivashchenko and Clapham, 2012, Ivashchenko <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>Today, Right Whales are known to occur in the Okhotsk Sea between Sakhalin Island and Kamchatka, as well as in the pelagic waters of the northwestern North Pacific. These whales are currently assumed to constitute a single population, but data on movements between the two areas are lacking.</p>  <p>Based on sightings of 28 Right Whales in 2,688 nautical miles of Japanese-Russian cetacean surveys in the Okhotsk Sea in August and September 1989, 1990, and 1992, Miyashita and Kato (1998) derived a preliminary population estimate of 922 whales (95% confidence interval (CI) 404-2,108) using line-transect analysis. Further Japanese surveys were conducted in the Okhotsk Sea in 1999, 2000, 2003, 2009, and 2010 (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017). A Russian survey in the northern Okhotsk Sea in August and September 2015 encountered five Right Whales (Ovsyanikova <em>et al</em>. 2015). The full set of surveys needs to be analysed before definitive conclusions about abundance and trend can be made.</p>  <p>There have been about a dozen sightings of Right Whales on the east coast of Japan in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2001). Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. (2017) report a total of 83 Right Whales observed in the northwest Pacific (west of 170°E) during surveys conducted every summer from 1994 to 2016. Most of these were offshore, between 42° and 52°N and 160° and 170°E.&#160; Hakamada and Matsuoka (2016) estimated the abundance of Right Whales in this area at 416 using 2008 data and 1,146 using data from 2011 and 2012. However, these estimates may be positively biased because only those survey years in which Right Whales were seen were used. Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. (2017) summarized all the sightings and effort from all surveys during 1982-2016 by 1 degree squares but noted that further work is needed to obtain a reliable abundance estimate.<br/></p>  <p>In the eastern North Pacific, the few Right Whales observed have usually been alone and in scattered locations. The only exception is an area of the southeastern Bering Sea where small groups of Right Whales were seen in several successive years (LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2001, Wade <em>et al.</em> 2006). Genetic identification indicated as minimum of 24 individuals but only 6 females (LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2012). Using photo-identification records from 1998-2013, Wade <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated a population size of 31 animals for this area, and genetic mark-recapture data produced a similar result. Marques <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated a total abundance of 25 (95 % CI: 13 – 47) Right Whales in the southeastern Bering Sea (an area of 950,000 km²) from acoustic detections. Three mother-calf pairs were seen in 2004 (Wade <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>There have been very few Right Whale sightings in the Gulf of Alaska in recent years despite the fact that the species once occurred commonly across this region. A vessel-based survey off Kodiak in the summer of 2015 failed to observe any Right Whales, although a few acoustic detections were made (Rone <em>et al.</em> 2017). Since 2010, international whale sighting surveys have been conducted each  summer in the North Pacific east of 170°E (not including the Bering  Sea) under the IWC's POWER programme (IWC 2016). During the surveys from 2010 through 2016, only one Right Whale was seen, in the northwestern Gulf of Alaska. However, the 2017 survey in the eastern Bering Sea recorded 18 right whales (a minimum of 12 individuals; Matsuoka unpublished data).</p><p><br/></p>",Unknown,"<p>Catch records from 19<sup>th</sup> century pelagic whaling and more recent Soviet catches show that Right Whales were widely distributed across coastal and offshore waters of the North Pacific, especially in the Gulf of Alaska south to about 50°N, the southeastern Bering Sea, the northwestern North Pacific, as well as the Okhotsk Sea and Sea of Japan (Townsend 1935, Ivashchenko and Clapham 2012, Josephson <em>et al.</em> 2012, Smith <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, it is apparent that the present range is reduced, especially in the eastern North Pacific.&#160; </p>  <p>Today, Right Whales are known to occur during the summer in the Okhotsk Sea, the northwestern North Pacific (west of 170°W and north of 35°N, including the coast of Kamchatka and the Commander Islands) (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017, Ovsyanikova <em>et al</em>. 2015), the southeastern Bering Sea, the Aleutian Islands, and the northern Gulf of Alaska (Brownell <em>et al.</em> 2001). During the winter, they occur (or at least occurred historically) southward to the Sea of Japan. There are rare recent records from the Taiwan Strait and the Ogasawara Gunto (Bonin Islands, Japan) in the west, and to Hawaii, California, and Baja California Sur (Mexico) in the east (Brownell <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p>Historical catch records of Right Whales reported from the central North Pacific by Maury (1852) are now known to be unreliable in terms of species identification (Josephson <em>et al.</em> 2008). Right whales have on rare occasions been recorded in the Hawaiian islands (Rowntree <em>et al.</em> 1980, Salden and Mickelsen 1999); one of those individuals was resighted in the Bering Sea (Kennedy <em>et al.</em> 2012). Whether Hawaii was, or is, a significant part of the species range, remains unresolved. The same uncertainty pertains to Right Whale sightings off Ogasawara, Taiwan, California, and Baja California. In 2015 one Right Whale was found entangled off the south coast of Korea and was released, the first record there since the last catch by whalers in 1974 (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2015). Two separate sightings of Right Whales were made in 2013 off the  coast of British Columbia, the first record of this species in Canadian  waters in 62 years (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><p>Unlike Right Whales in the Southern Hemisphere and North Atlantic, neither historical nor extant coastal breeding grounds have been identified for North Pacific Right Whales. Subpopulations on the Asian and American sides of the Pacific are regarded as discrete (Brownell <em>et al.</em> 2001, LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2012) </p>  <p></p>",The North Pacific Right Whale is no longer hunted. It was once the target of major commercial whaling.,Marine,"North Pacific Right Whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling by international agreements since the 1930s, but this has been fully respected in practice only since the 1970s. The species is in Appendix I of both Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.  Two areas of Critical Habitat (the southeastern Bering Sea and a small region off eastern Kodiak Island) have been designated for this species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

They are among the more commonly studied cetaceans in the Indian Ocean, especially in Shark Bay, Western Australia. However, information on distribution, population size, and trends in abundance and mortality from much of the species’ range is still very limited. As they are primarily coastal, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins often co-occur with fisheries, and bycatch is a major cause of concern for this species. Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are also at risk from high levels of noise and chemical pollution, industrial activity such as oil and gas development, and habitat reduction caused by land reclamation and coastal development (Curry and Smith 1997, Wells and Scott 1999, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003, Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2008). Furthermore, survey data suggest that Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins occur in relatively small populations or communities with limited geographic ranges, especially where they reside close to islands (Krützen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Natoli <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Fury <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Särnblad <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2012, Gray <em>et al.</em> 2018), which can exacerbate the impact of human activities and demographic stochasticity on this species. </p>  <p>Estimates of abundance from populations for which information on bycatch is also available indicate that human-caused mortality is frequently unsustainable (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em><em> </em>1992, Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2012, Preen 2004). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Based on the sum of existing abundance estimates, the total population size for the species over its entire range is likely well in excess of 40,000 individuals. Large parts of the range have never been surveyed (e.g. much of the Arabian Sea, Arabian/Persian Gulf, Pakistan, India, Red Sea, Somalia, Yemen, Mozambique, Indonesia, Philippines).</p>  <p>The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin was classified as Data Deficient in 2008. The species distribution overlaps the range of several other coastal cetacean species that are red-listed as Endangered (Irrawaddy Dolphin <em>Orcaella brevirostris</em> and Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa plumbea</em>) or Vulnerable (Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa chinensis</em> and Australian Humpback Dolphin <em>Sousa sahulensis, </em>Australian Snubfin Dolphin<em> Orcaella heinsohni</em> and the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise <em>Neophocaena phocaenoides</em>) and are subject to the same anthropogenic threats. However, compared to these other species, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is assumed to be under less immediate threat because it has a wider geographic range and probably larger numbers, greater behavioural plasticity and broader habitat preferences. Data are insufficient to present a robust case for listing the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin in a threatened category (CR, EN, or VU). However, its coastal distribution, inferred local declines, and intensity of threats throughout its range lead to the conclusion that Least Concern is not an appropriate category.</p>  <p>The Red List Guidelines (version 11, 2014) state that “the category Near Threatened is applied to taxa that do not qualify as threatened now, but may be close to qualifying as threatened, and to taxa that do not currently meet the criteria for a threatened category, but are likely to do so if ongoing conservation actions abate or cease.” Also, to qualify for Near Threatened, the taxon “should be close to qualifying for the Vulnerable category; estimates of population size or habitat should be close to the Vulnerable thresholds, especially when there is a high degree of uncertainty, or possibly meet some of the subcriteria; and this may be combined with biological susceptibility and threat.” Considering the above, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is listed as Near Threatened because: 1) it occurs in a relatively small and restricted near-shore range<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, 2) it is highly vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear and its range overlaps with intensive fisheries known to entangle and kill dolphins, 3) its near-shore habitat is subject to increasing anthropogenic threats resulting in habitat loss and degradation, and 4) it is experiencing mortality rates that are likely to be causing population declines in several areas. The species therefore comes close to meeting criterion A4 for Vulnerable. Population size is inferred and suspected to have declined by close to 30% throughout the range of the species, over three generations and in a time period encompassing the past, present and future. The causes of the reduction (gillnet entanglement and coastal habitat degradation) have not ceased. Generation length for Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, according to Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007), is 21.1 years, therefore three generations is 63.3 years. Thus, an annual decline of around 0.5% would result in exceeding the 30% decline in 3 generations. Gillnet fisheries and coastal development are increasing throughout the range of the species and bycatch is anticipated to remain stable or to increase in the future without urgent and intensive efforts which are unlikely to be forthcoming.</span></p>  <p>It is important to emphasize that numerous isolated populations of this species would likely qualify as threatened subpopulations, particularly those found around island groups in the Indian Ocean.</p>","<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins generally occur over shallow coastal waters on the continental shelf or around oceanic islands. In some locations, they occur relatively far from shore, but in the shallow waters of reef banks (Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2012). In comparison to other areas, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins off the coast of Bangladesh occur in relatively deep offshore waters at the head of the Swatch-of-No-Ground submarine canyon where they were detected at an average depth of 202m (SD=112, range=45-395) (Smith and Mansur 2013). In the Clarence River estuary and Richmond River estuary in northern New South Wales, Australia, dolphin distribution varied according to season and tidal state (Fury <em>et al.</em> 2008). Along the coast of Adelaide, South Australia, dolphins occur in shallow nearshore areas and temperate reefs in summer, shallow nearshore areas in autumn and deep waters further offshore in winter (Zanardo <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Coffin Bay, Thorny Passage Marine Park, South Australia, dolphins showed no distinct seasonal shifts in distribution patterns and areas of high probability of dolphin occurrence were located mainly within the inner area of Coffin Bay, associated with shallow waters (2–4 m and 7–10 m) and located within 1km of land (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2018a). Strong site fidelity and restricted ranging patterns are characteristic of some populations (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2018b).</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins sometimes occur in mixed groups with Common Bottlenose Dolphins, Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (<em>Sousa plumbea</em>), spinner dolphins (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>), Australian humpback dolphins (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>) and possibly other delphinids (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015; Koper and Plön&#160;2016). They feed on a wide variety of schooling, demersal and reef fishes, as well as cephalopods (Ross 1984; Amir <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2005; Yamazaki <em>et al.</em> 2008). In some locations, large predatory reef fishes can represent an important proportion of their diet (Belonidae and Carangidae), such as around the island of Mayotte, in the SW Indian Ocean (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2014). Group size is generally less than 30 (see Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, for a review), but in South Africa mean group size in Algoa Bay is 76, and groups of up to 600 individuals are commonly observed (Bouveroux <em>et al.</em> 2018, Melly <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>Bycatch is the dominant threat affecting Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins throughout their range. However, there are very few estimates of mortality rates or abundance over time to evaluate the severity of the impact. In Australia, the major threats include bycatch in trawls and gillnets as well as in shark nets set at popular coastal beaches to protect bathers (Hale 1997, Paterson, 1990). A total of 15 Bottlenose Dolphins (species unknown) were confirmed to have died from net entanglement in southern blue-fin tuna feedlots between 1994 and 2000 (Kemper and Gibbs 2001). Research by Mintzer <em>et al.</em> (2018) into the global use of cetaceans as bait in fisheries reported that this practice is much more widespread within Taiwanese fisheries than is presently recorded. From 1974 to 1986, the Taiwanese shark and tuna gillnet fishery exploited the waters off northern Australia, including the Arafua and Timor Seas and was responsible for the incidental catch of a variety of small cetaceans, with <em>Tursiops </em>spp<em>. </em>likely<em> aduncus</em> comprising 60% of the total cetacean catch (Harwood &amp; Hembree 1987). The annual mortality of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins may have exceeded 2,000 animals—severely impacting local population[s] (Young and Iudicello, 2007). As a result of this bycatch, the fishery was closed in 1986 (Young and Iudicello, <a style=""mso-comment-reference:GB_3;mso-comment-date:20190614T1311;mso-comment-parent: 1""></a><a style=""mso-comment-reference:GB_2;mso-comment-date:20190614T1310; mso-comment-parent:1""></a><a style=""mso-comment-reference:LU_1;mso-comment-date: 20190603T0957"">2007</a>). </p>  <p>Off western Kyushu, Japan, mortality of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in bottom-set gillnets was estimated at 12-14 individuals per year, which was considered unsustainable for the local population thought to number only somewhat more than 200 individuals (Shirakihara &amp; Shirakihara 2012). Photo-identification data collected off the coast of Bangladesh indicated that 28.2% of identified individuals had injuries related to entanglement gear (Mansur <em>et al.</em> 2012), and similar methods used in the coastal waters of Mayotte (Comoros archipelago, Mozambique Channel) showed that 19% of identified individuals bore signs of non-lethal interactions with coastal artisanal fisheries (Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2008). In Bangladesh, between August 2016 and April 2018, 31 small-scale gillnet fishing vessels participating in a Citizen Science Fishermen Safety Network reported fatal entanglements of 14 dolphins and porpoises, of which seven were Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, during 177 fishing trips (Wildlife Conservation Society 2018). Off the island of Zanzibar (Tanzania), 43 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin captures in artisanal drift gillnets were reported from 1995 to 1999. The magnitude and population-level impact of gillnet bycatch in Zanzibar was assessed in 2003-2004, and it was found that annual bycatch rates were unsustainable as they represented 9.3% of the estimated local population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Amir 2010). Bycatch was also evaluated recently in drift gillnets off Zanzibar using landing data (Temple <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2019), and there are reports of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin mortality in coastal artisanal fisheries off mainland Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique (Kiszka 2015, Kiszka <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2009). Bycaught dolphins are often used as bait in longline fisheries targeting sharks (Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2018, Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, an average of 34 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins per year were accidentally killed by bather protection nets around beaches between 1981 and 1989 (Cockroft 1990). This increased to an average of 45/year from 1990-1999, and from 2000-2009 the estimate was 27/year (Cliff &amp; Dudley 2011). In general, catches have steadily declined since the 1980’s due to better management of nets and the replacement of some shark nets (gillnets) with drumlines (baited hooks) in recent years (Plön, unpublished). However, the majority of bycaught animals are immature individuals and mature females, raising concern about population-level impacts (Plön, unpublished). In most areas limited data on bycatch or a lack of information on population size mean that it is not possible to determine whether annual catch rates are sustainable or not. However, the strong overlap in gillnet fishing effort and the coastal distribution of this species, combined with fairly small population sizes in many areas that have been surveyed, suggest that fishery bycatch is sufficiently high to cause population declines in many places.</p>  <p>The species’ near-shore distribution makes it vulnerable to environmental degradation, direct exploitation, and fishery conflicts (Curry and Smith 1997, Wells and Scott 1999; Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). Until hunting was outlawed in 1990, <em>Tursiops aduncus</em> was the target of a large-scale drive fishery in Taiwan’s Penghu Islands. Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins occur in southern Japan and due to confusion with the commonly hunted Common Bottlenose Dolphin it is not clear whether they were ever specifically targeted by Japanese coastal cetacean fisheries in the past (Kasuya 2017). Some Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are taken in the small cetacean fisheries in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997) and Indonesia (Mustika 2006). Socio-ecological interview surveys in southwest Madagascar in 1999 indicated extensive hunting of coastal dolphins by Anakao fishermen of the Vezo community (Andrianarivelo, 2001). Dolphin species most often taken were the Spinner Dolphin, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin and Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin. Vezo fishers hunted coastal dolphins for local consumption and sale of meat (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Andrianarivelo (2001) estimated that over 6,000 individual dolphins, predominantly <em>Stenella</em> spp. and <em>Tursiops</em> spp. were taken in drive hunts between 1985 and 1999 from a single village, Anakao, and there was a substantial increase in catches evident during 1995–1999 accounting for 57% of all catches (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2009). The trend suggested an increase in intensity of hunting and impact on populations, likely associated with a change in hunting technique (from harpoons to nets) in the mid to late 1980s, and depletion of other food resources (e.g. decrease in fish populations), and subsequent increased adoption of cetacean hunting and consumption throughout the 1990s (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Subsequent interview surveys conducted between 2010-2013 demonstrated continuing high levels of both hunting and by-catch reported for <em>Tursiops</em> spp. along the entire west coast of Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were one of the most common species targeted by a drive-hunt in Zanzibar that stopped in 1996 (Berggren <em>et al.</em> 2007, Stensland and Berggren 2007). Anecdotal evidence suggests that several species of delphinids are hunted in the Seychelles (despite national prohibition), including Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Kiszka 2015). Although illegal, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were recorded as hunted in a harpoon fishery in southern Myanmar with six carcasses documented as being sold in March 2006 at the Maungmagan market (Tint Tun 2006). This species is one of the more common small cetaceans that are used as bait to catch sharks. There is no current evidence of traditional use/trade for consumption or medicinal use across the species range in Australia although it may have happened in the past. </p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the cetacean species most commonly kept in captivity in Asia (Wang <em>et al.</em> 1999, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). Since the early 1960s, live-captures of <em>T. aduncus</em> for oceanarium display have occurred in many areas, including South Africa, Australia, Taiwan, Japan and Java (Best and Ross 1984, Tas’an and Leatherwood 1984, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1994, Cawthorn and Gaskin 1984, Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1984). In 1974, 58 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins were captured from Amami Oshima, Japan, for the Okinawa Expo and the aquarium which held them became the Churaumi Aquarium in Okinawa (Kasuya <em>et al.</em> 1984). In 2003, a live-capture export trade was initiated in the Solomon Islands and a minimum of 108 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were exported between 2003 and 2011 to Mexico, UAE, China, the Philippines and Singapore (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2013; Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2010). This level of removals from the local population(s) is probably unsustainable (Reeves &amp; Brownell 2009). In the mid 2000’s in Australia, 32 Bottlenose Dolphins, including both <em>T. aduncus </em>and <em>T</em>. <em>truncatus</em>, were held at Sea World, Surfers Paradise, Queensland, and four <em>Tursiops aduncus</em> were kept at Pet Porpoise Pool, Coffs Harbour, New South Wales (International Species Information System 2009). In China in 2014, 39 captive facilities housed 491 cetaceans, most of them<em> Tursiops</em> spp. most from Japan and not <em>T. aduncus</em> (Chinese Cetacean Alliance 2015). Twenty-three Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are held at Ocean Park in Hong Kong, and one in Sea World, Durban (<a href=""http://www.species360.org/"">www.Species360.org</a>, reported March-2019). </p>  <p>In South Africa, of the six dolphin species (n = 90) incidentally captured in shark net installations or stranded off the east and south coasts between 2005 and 2009, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins had the second highest levels of persistent organochlorines and approximately half of adult <em>T. aduncus</em> had PCB concentrations above the previously determined threshold (17,000 ng g<sup>−1</sup> lw) for impairment of immune functions in aquatic mammals (Kannan <em>et al.</em> 2000; Gui <em>et al.</em> 2016); however it is important to note that other small cetaceans often report levels much higher than this. Despite this, systematic health assessments conducted on animals incidentally caught in shark nets between 2010 and 2012 indicated that Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were generally in good health (Lane <em>et al.</em>, 2014). In Zanzibar, levels of organochlorine pesticides in Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were lower than those reported from other regions, but methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ether levels were higher (Mwevura <em>et al.</em> 2010). Along the coast of La Réunion, DDTs, PCBs, and methoxylated-PBDEs were commonly found in blubber tissues of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Dirtu <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2016). However, concentrations were low compared to other locations, including Zanzibar (Mwevura <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p>Several diseases appear to be increasing in occurrence in coastal small cetaceans, raising concern for the health of these animals. Since the early 2000s, there have been several dolphin mortality events in Australia that have included <em>T. aduncus</em> (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2016). In these events all the dolphins tested positive for the cetacean morbillivirus. &#160;There are reports of a lobomycosis-like disease and other poor skin conditions in Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins from Mayotte and Japan which is a concern for these locally restricted populations (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009, Van Bressem <em>et al.</em> 2013, Tajima <em>et al.</em> 2015). The etiology of the disease was not established, but it may be related to the degradation of their coastal habitat (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2009). The bacterial pathogen of the genus <em>Brucella</em>&#160;has also been reported from Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. Forty of 58 serum samples from <em>T. aduncus</em> from the Solomon Islands tested positive for antibodies to <em>Brucella</em> (Tachibana <em>et al.</em> 2006). This pathogen in dolphins can be a severe disease and cause abortions, male infertility, neurobrucellosis, cardiopathies, bone and skin lesions and death (Moreno&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;</p>  <p>Climate change, especially increases in sea surface temperature that are prevalent throughout coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, are negatively affecting coastal habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass beds used by Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. For example, in Shark Bay, Western Australia, an unprecedented marine heatwave in 2011 caused catastrophic losses of seagrass meadows along with mass mortality in invertebrate and fish communities. Long-term demographic data on Shark Bay’s resident Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin population revealed a significant decline in female reproductive rates following the heatwave (Wild <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the species most commonly targeted by dolphin-watching operators in the Indo-Pacific region and in some places where regulation is poor, the animals are harassed. Although dolphin-watching tourism is certainly not a threat to the species as a whole, changes in dolphin behavior have been observed in areas with intense dolphin-watching activity off Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, Japan (Matsuda <em>et al.</em> 2011) and in Menai Bay, Zanzibar (Christiansen <em>et al.</em> 2010) and around Mauritius (Webster <em>et al.</em> 2014). In Shark Bay, Western Australia, an increase in dolphin tourism coincided with a 14.9% decline in local dolphin abundance (95% CI=−20.8 to −8.23) (Bejder <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>The disturbance caused by marine construction and demolition, port development, reclamation, dredging, and other forms of habitat destruction and degradation, together with associated anthropogenic noise, is hard to quantify, but such activities and processes are widespread throughout the coastal range of this species. Individually and cumulatively, they may be causing population declines through increased mortality, impaired health, and/or reduced reproductive fitness as well as by habitat displacement.</p>","<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are among the best-studied species of small cetaceans in the Indian Ocean and in the western South Pacific (Solomon Islands). Although estimates of abundance (detailed below) are available for many local areas, the majority of their range has yet to be surveyed.&#160; Some available estimates are imprecise, lacking in sufficient details to evaluate their accuracy and context, and/or were generated sufficiently long ago (e.g. 20+ years ago) that, with increases in fishing intensity and coastal development, the present situation could be much different. In most locations studied, population sizes are small, typically in the low hundreds of individuals or fewer (&lt;100)<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. Exceptions include an estimate of between 1,700-2,200 individuals generated from data collected in 2005-2009 in Bangladesh, which represents an unknown portion of a larger super-population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins that extends farther west into un-surveyed waters in India; 2,000-3,000 dolphins documented to occur in Shark Bay, Western Australia; and a large population in the Algoa Bay region, South Africa estimated at about 28,000 individuals from data collected in the late 1990s (see details below).</p>  <p>In Australian waters, estimates of local populations indicate that this species is common mainly in inshore and nearshore waters. However, further genetic work is required to better define the distribution of the species, especially with regard to the taxonomic identity of particular populations to either <em>T. aduncus</em> or <em>T. truncatus</em>. Abundance estimates from surveys carried out between 2003 and 2006 for the Clarence River and Richmond River estuaries in northern New South Wales, were 71 (62–81 95% CI) and 34 (19– 49 95% CI), respectively (Fury <em>et al.</em> 2008). &#160;Abundance estimates in Jervis Bay ranged from 61 ±3.2 in summer 1998/99 to 108 ±7.1 in summer 1997/98, and from 143 ±8.1 in summer 1999/00 to 160 ±8.1 in summer 1998/99 in Port Stephens (Möller <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Moreton Bay, Queensland, a population size of 554-622 (95% CI: 510–598) was estimated from boat-based surveys in 2008-2010 (Ansmann <em>et al.</em> 2013), with a further 700 to 1,000 individuals believed to occur off Point Lookout in 1998-99 (Chilvers and Corkeron&#160;2003). In southern Australia, where Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are those identified as “<em>T. australis</em>” (Charlton-Robb, 2011), resident populations of 80–100 animals occur in Port Phillip Bay and 50-150 in the Gippsland Lakes (unpublished data cited in Charlton-Robb <em>et al.</em> 2015). Local population estimates for South Australia indicated that approximately 74 resident Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins inhabited the Port River estuary and Barker Inlet, Gulf St Vincent (Steiner and Bossley 2008). From 1989 to 2005, between 95 (SE ±45.20) and 239 (SE ±54.91) individuals occurred in Adelaide’s coastal waters in winter 2013 and summer 2014, respectively (Zanardo <em>et al.</em> 2016), and 306 (95% CI: 291–323) occurred in Coffin Bay between September 2013 and October 2015 (Passadore <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;Abundance estimates of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins, (likely to be the putative species ""<em>T. australis</em>"" based on their coastal distribution and small group size), was estimated&#160;using double-observer platform aerial surveys over an area of 42,438 km<sup>2</sup> within two gulfs of South Australia.&#160; A total of 3,493 (CV = 0.21; 95% CI = 2,327-5,244) individuals were estimated in summer/autumn, and 3,213 (CV = 0.20; 95% CI = 2,151-4,801) in winter/spring of 2011 (Bilgmann <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;&#160;A population of 63 (95% CI = 59 to 73) to 185 (95% CI = 171–200) Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins was estimated off Bunbury, Western Australia, during winter 2007 and in summer 2010, respectively (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sprogis <em>et al.</em>, 2016). In coastal and estuarine waters near Perth, Western Australia, total estimated abundances in the Swan Canning Riverpark estuary, Gage Roads, and Cockburn Sound/Owen Anchorage between June 2011 and May 2015 were 16, 172, and 103, respectively (Chabanne <em>et al.</em> 2017). Aerial surveys in 1989 and 1994 indicated that a population of 2,000-3,000 dolphins occurred in Shark Bay, Western Australia, most being Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins (Preen <em>et al.</em> 1997). In North Western Australia, 157 (95% CI: 137–186) individuals were estimated to inhabit Beagle Bay and 35 (27–48) to 60 (42–87) Cygnet Bay in 2012–2013 (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Darwin Harbor and two neighboring sites, Northern Territory, abundance estimates ranged from 20 (95% CI 17 to 23) in October/November 2013 to 38 (95% CI 28 to 47) in October 2012 (Brooks <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Between 1994 and 2001, a total of 169 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were identified off Mikura Island, Japan (Kogi <em>et al.</em> 2004), and 216 individuals (CV=2.1%) were estimated off Amakusa-Shimoshima Island, western Kyushu, Japan, in 2008 (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2012). Approximately 1,000 km south of Tokyo an estimated 200-300 animals occur around the main Ogasawara Islands (Mori 2005). In the Swatch-of-No-Ground (SoNG) submarine canyon, off the coast of Bangladesh, mark-resight abundance estimates generated for 2005-2009 were 1,701 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1,533–1,888), 1,927 (95% CI = 1,851–2,006), 2,150 (95% CI = 1,906–2,425), and 2,239 (95% CI = 1,985–2,524) individuals (Mansur <em>et al.</em> 2012). In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, abundance comparisons from two aerial surveys conducted in 1986 and 1999 in the southern-western area suggested an overall decline of 71% of small cetaceans over 13 years, where <em>T. aduncus</em> is estimated to account for 71% of the overall assemblage of dolphin species (Preen 2004). Surveys of Abu Dhabi waters conducted in 2014-2015 (55 boat-based surveys, 5,592 km of on effort transects) yielded an estimate of 1,834 (95% CI = 1,176-3,124) individuals (Díaz López and Methion 2016). Surveys of Dubai waters conducted in 2014 (56 boat-based surveys and 220 hours of effort) resulted in 8 sightings and 92 individuals being identified (A. Natoli, unpublished data).</p>  <p>In East Africa and around some islands of the western Indian Ocean, several abundance estimates are available. Between 1999 and 2002 off southwest Zanzibar, Tanzania the smallest estimate of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin abundance was 136 in 2001 (95%CI = 124-172) and the largest was 179 animals (95% CI = 167-212) in 2002 (Stensland <em>et al.</em> 2006). In southern Kenya, a population of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins was estimated using mark-recapture as ranging from 19 individuals (95% CI: 11–33) to a maximum of 104 dolphins (95% CI: 78–139) (Pérez-Jorge <em>et al.</em> 2016) based on photo-identification data collected between 2006 and 2009. Off the southwest coast of Mauritius, a resident population of <em>T. aduncus </em>was estimated to number &lt;100 individuals based on surveys conducted between 2008 and 2010 (Webster <em>et al.</em> 2014). Off the coast of Pemba in Tanzania, another small resident population was estimated to number 83 (CV 7.8%, 95% CI 72-97) individuals (Kasuga <em>et al.</em> in review) and off the island of Mayotte abundance was estimated from closed population models at 82 ±19 SE individuals from data collected between 2004 and 2009 (Pusineri <em>et al.</em> 2014). Along the coast of La Réunion, an abundance of 72 (SE=6.17, 95%CI = 61-85) was estimated based on photo-identification data collected along the west coast from 2009 to 2014 (Dulau <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2017).</p>  <p>In South Africa, there appear to be both coastal (with mostly small group sizes) and migratory (with large group sizes) populations of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins, but the boundaries between these are not well defined (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the number of individuals in the area between the Tugela River and Durban was estimated at 520 (160–970, 95% CI) in 1989 (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em><em> </em>1992). A maximum of 350 individuals was estimated in the area between Durban and Ramsgate (Cockcroft <em>et al.</em> 1991). Overall, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in the KZN area are likely fragmented into several populations (Natoli <em>et al.</em>, 2008). A migratory population in southeastern South Africa is estimated at more than 2,000 individuals and is characterized by large groups of hundreds of individuals (Natoli <em>et al.</em> 2008). An estimate of 28,482 (95% CI = 16,220–40,744; CV = 0.22) based on field work conducted in the mid 1990’s was calculated using POPAN mark-recapture analysis of photo-identified individuals in the Algoa Bay region of the Eastern Cape (<a name=""_Hlk3288225"">Reisinger and Karczmarski </a>2010). Due to the very low number of recaptures (131 out of 1,569 total captures), the estimation models fit the data poorly, which means that the point estimate, as well as the 95% CI, may not be accurate; however, the large number of identified individuals and small number of recaptures confirms that there was a sizeable population of this species in the wider Algoa Bay region at that time. Group sizes of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in Algoa Bay are consistently large for this species, being reported as typically ranging from 200-600 individuals (Ross 1982; Melly <em>et al.</em> 2017; Bouveroux <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is important to note that with intensifying fisheries and coastal development, the relatively favorable status of these dolphins in Algoa Bay could be very different now, 20+ years after the data used to generate the estimate by Reisinger and Karczmarski (2010) were collected.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins have a discontinuous distribution in warm-temperate and tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. They are found primarily in shallow coastal and estuarine waters and in shallow reef complexes (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species occurs from Australia in the east, throughout southeast Asia (including the Malay Archipelago and Cocos [Keeling] Islands) (Tom Jefferson pers. comm.), China (north to the Korean Peninsula) and southwestern Japan) and around the northern Indian Ocean rim (including in the Red Sea and Arabian/Persian Gulf) to the western range limit in eastern South Africa (Wells and Scott 2002, Möller and Beheregaray 2001, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins also occur in the coastal waters of many oceanic islands distant from major land masses including the Maldives (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2012), the Andamans (Malakar <em>et al.</em> 2015), New Caledonia (Borsa 2006), the Comoros and Mayotte (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2012), the Solomon Islands (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2015), La Réunion (Dulau-Drouot <em>et al.</em> 2008), Mauritius (Webster <em>et al.</em><em> </em>2014) and the Seychelles (Kiszka<em> </em>2015).</p>","<p>It is harvested for food in some places, and for international trade as display animals.</p>",Marine,"Specific conservation actions for this species are lacking from most of  the range of the species although they are generally legally protected  in most range states. Due to increasing pressure of dolphin watching  tourism in Mayotte, specific measures prohibiting swimming with this  species have been implemented. In Australia dolphin watching is  regulated and there are National Whale and Dolphin Watching Guidelines  in place. In other parts of the species range where there are dolphin  watching or swim-with-dolphins tourism these are either unregulated, or  there has been some effort to manage or regulate the activities but  guidelines are not followed. This species occurs in numerous Marine  Protected Areas (MPAs) throughout their range but these are usually  designed with a focus on other marine species and not specifically to  include key habitat for Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. <br/><br/>The  exception to this is an MPA declared by the Government of Bangladesh in  2014 covering 1,700 km² which encompasses almost all Bottlenose Dolphin  sightings made during intensive cetacean surveys of coastal waters in  Bangladesh between 2004 to 2019. Efforts are still underway to establish  conservation management in this MPA. One promising approach for  reducing Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin bycatch in Bangladesh is an  initiative that requires gillnet fishermen to attend their nets, release  entangled dolphins, and collect data from mortalities in exchange for  capacity building to improve their safety at sea.<br/>Various strategies  have been tested to mitigate the unintentional catch of dolphins in  coastal bather protection nets in South Africa. Devices have been added  to the nets to make the nets more conspicuous acoustically (for example,  air-filled floats, clangers), or to deter the dolphins with sounds  (such as pingers), but these were not successful (Cliff and Dudley  2011). In the past decade, some gillnets have been replaced with baited  hooks (called drumlines) which have lower dolphin bycatch (Cliff and  Dudley 2011). <br/><br/>In Australia bycatch action plans for several  fisheries were introduced in 2001 to reduce the bycatch of dolphins and  other marine animals and these actions are managed by the Australian  Fisheries Management Authority. Mitigation measures, such as the use of  pingers to warn animals away from nets, escape panels in purse seine  nets, and handling methods for animals brought aboard vessels have been  proposed. Pingers are currently used to warn cetaceans away from shark  nets installed to protect bathers in Australia (Department of  Environment 2019).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Another recent decline of approximately 70% in a large part of the species’ range (Yellow Sea, Korea) provides an index of decline (subcriterion b) that may apply throughout many unsurveyed portions of the range. Although the rate of decline in such areas can only be inferred, there is no evidence that threats differ substantially. The scale of threats is large enough over enough of the range to suspect and infer a decline of at least 50% over the last three generations (45 years; Moore 2015) (A2), over three generations into the future (A3), and over a three-generation period that includes both the past and the future (A4). The factor most responsible for such decline is incidental mortality in fisheries (subcriterion d), but the loss and degradation of habitat (including chemical pollution; subcriteria c and e) and vessel strikes (at least in the Yangtze River system; Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013) are contributing factors as well. The primary causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population size—bycatch in fishing gear and mortality from vessel strikes (both interpreted here as “exploitation”), decline in habitat quality, and possibly pollution—have not ceased, may not be well understood, and may not all be reversible.<br/><br/>As the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission concluded after a review of the species (at the time with no recognized species-level distinction between <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) in 2005 (IWC 2006), “human populations adjacent to the Finless Porpoise’s habitat are increasing in size and becoming more industrialised so the expectation should be that anthropogenic pressures will continue and intensify.” None of the threats has been seriously addressed or mitigated in any part of the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise’s range, even though threat levels are likely increasing. Partly because of their small size, phocoenids are exceptionally vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets (e.g., Jefferson and Curry 1994). Incidental mortality in fishing gear is either known or presumed to occur throughout the range of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1997, IWC 2006).<br/><br/>There is clear evidence of a declining trend in three major parts of this species’ range. In the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, a decline of nearly 70% was estimated over a period of 22 years, from 1976-1978 to 1999-2000 (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002, also see Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). There is also evidence of a rapid decline in recent decades in the Yangtze River and adjoining lake systems of China (Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2008, Wang 2009, Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2012) with a 60% decline in the six years between 2006 and 2012 (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2014); the subspecies there (<em>N. a. asiaeorientalis</em>) was classified as Endangered in 1996 and uplisted to Critically Endangered in 2013 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2013). Finally, there is recent evidence suggesting a decline of approximately 70% in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in the Korean portion of the Yellow Sea between the early 2000s and 2011 (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015), and there is no reason to believe this decline has been reversed.<br/><br/>There is sufficient information for separate assessment of at least two threatened subpopulations – the subpopulation in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, which likely qualifies for Endangered or Critically Endangered (Hashimoto et al. 2015), and the Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Japan) subpopulation, which likely qualifies for at least Vulnerable (Hashimoto et al. 2015).<br/><p></p>","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are found mainly in coastal waters, including shallow bays, possibly mangrove swamps, estuaries, and some large rivers. However, they can also occur in shallow waters (&lt;200 m deep) quite far from shore (up to 240 km). They appear to have a strong preference for waters with a sandy or soft bottom (Jefferson and Hung 2004).<br/> <br/> In Japanese waters, Finless Porpoises prefer shallow depths (&lt;50 m) and close proximity to the shore (&lt;5 km). In the shallow East China Sea, proximity to the shore does not appear to be as important (Amano 2009). </p>  Small fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (mainly demersal species) form the diet of Finless Porpoises (Jefferson and Hung 2004).","<p>Finless Porpoises, like other phocoenids (Jefferson and Curry 1994), are extremely susceptible to entanglement in gillnets, and large numbers have been, and continue to be, killed in many parts of their range.</p>  <p>In Japan, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises become entangled in a variety of types of fishing gear (Amano 2009). Changes in fishing methods and the use of acoustic deterrents may have reduced the incidental catch in some areas such as western Kyushu (Kasuya 1999, Amano <em>et al.</em> 2017), but substantial numbers are still being taken in gillnets and other fishing gear. A total of 114 specimens were collected in Japan during 1985–1992 from western and north-eastern Kyushu including parts of the western Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 1993): 84 (73%) of them had been killed incidentally in fisheries, 25 had been found dead on the beach or in the sea, and there was no information on the other five. Fishing gears that killed the 84 porpoises were bottom-set gillnets (58), surface gillnets (17), trap nets (7), trawl nets (1) and drifting (ghost) nets (1). Such fishing gears are common in Japan and probably kill Finless Porpoises off other coasts, although usually such catches go unreported. Shirakihara and Shirakihara (2013) estimated 238-270 Finless Porpoises are bycaught annually in Ariake Sound and Tachibana Bay.</p>  <p>In Korea (information is available only from the Republic of Korea), an official reporting system implemented in 2011 resulted in a count of 2,107 Finless Porpoises bycaught inshore, mainly along the west coast, in 2012 (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although reporting apparently has improved, there is still assumed to be substantial under-reporting for the following reasons according to Park <em>et al</em>. (2015): “First, each Finless Porpoise caught in a fish­ing net costs approximately $100 (100,000 Wons) [<em>sic</em>]. Therefore, the dead porpoise can be discarded because it has no signifi­cant value. Second, the bycatch of Finless Porpoises is usually reported only in large harbours, with deaths in smaller ports seldom reported (Kim <em>et al</em>., 2013). Therefore, it is likely that the impact of the bycatch of Finless Porpoises on its population is underestimated.”</p>  <p>Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that Finless Porpoises were the most frequently captured cetaceans in fishing gear along the Chinese coast and estimated that more than 2,000 were taken in 1994, mainly in trawl, gill, and stow nets. In the waters of western Taiwan, including the Matsu and Chinmen Islands (western Taiwan Strait), a considerable number of Finless Porpoises are taken in trammel nets, trawl nets, stow nets, and other gear (J. Y. Wang unpublished data). Given the numbers and types of net fisheries in Chinese coastal waters (e.g., Zhou and Wang 1994, Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999), there are serious concerns about the level of bycatch of both Finless Porpoise species. Illegal electric fishing became widespread in the Yangtze River during the 1990s, and it may kill porpoises outright and certainly contributes to the depletion of their prey (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2000).</p>  <p>In some parts of their range, there is an aversion to eating Finless Porpoises (Kasuya 1999, J. Y. Wang unpublished data). However, there is a long history of porpoises taken incidentally being sold for human consumption in at least some parts of Japan (e.g., Mizue <em>et al.</em> 1965) and on the Korean peninsula (IWC 2000). According to M. Amano (pers. comm.), consumption of Finless Porpoises no longer occurs in Japan. An analysis of the species composition of odontocete products in Korean markets during 2003–2004 estimated that the true catch of Finless Porpoises in Korean waters during this period was probably about four times the officially reported catch of 142 animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/> <br/> As coastal and riverine animals, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are also affected by habitat loss and degradation, boat traffic, and pollution. The extensive modification of coastlines for shrimp farming and rampant harbour (and other) development throughout East Asia means that there is less habitat for Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Porpoise habitat in the Yangtze River system has been degraded by water development, including the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams and about 1,300 smaller dams in tributaries (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2000). Sand mining is intensive in Poyang Lake, until recently a stronghold for Yangtze Finless Porpoises (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). Sand mining is also thought to have played a significant role in the severe decline of Finless Porpoises in the central and eastern Seto Inland Sea, Japan (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although pathology related to contaminant exposure has not been reported in Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises, pollution is considered a potentially serious threat (Kasuya 1999, Kannan <em>et al</em>. 1989, Iwata <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1995; Le <em>et al</em>. 1999, Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). A mass die-off of at least 249 Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises along the Saemangeum dike area of the western Korean Peninsula was reported by Park <em>et al.</em> (2012) who speculated that the cause was unusually low temperatures. However, there have been news reports of large (&gt;100) kills of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in local coastal fisheries, so it may be difficult to rule out human activities as a causal factor in such large-scale die-offs.</p>  <p>A survey of levels and drivers of human-caused mortality carried out in 27 fishing settlements along the middle-lower Yangtze channel identified three main categories of observed porpoise deaths: (1) interaction with fishing gear, (2) vessel strikes, and (3) unknown cause (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013). A total of 344 dated porpoise mortality events directly observed by informants between 1950 and 2008 were reported, including 75 porpoise deaths from 1989–1998 and 147 from 1999–2008. This apparent increase was said to be driven by the greater number of deaths attributed to vessel strikes (19 to 35) and unknown causes (31 to 94) in the more recent decade. Comparison of the reported mortality with the estimated abundance suggests that the fraction of individuals removed from the declining porpoise population in the Yangtze had quadrupled over the course of two decades. Turvey <em>et al</em>. concluded that entanglement in rolling hook long-lines was probably responsible for the greatest number of porpoise deaths in fishing gear and that vessel strikes and other anthropogenic factors, such as electrofishing, had become the dominant and increasing causes of mortality in the Yangtze.</p>  The causes of an apparent decline in Finless Porpoise numbers in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan are not fully understood, but include incidental mortality in fisheries as well as various forms of habitat degradation (IWC 2000, 2006). Parts of the coastal regions of the Inland Sea are highly developed and industrialized, so the associated threats of habitat loss (e.g., from reclamation and sand mining) and pollution are suspected to have had some (undetermined) level of impact (Kasuya <em>et al.</em> 2002).","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are small and cryptic and therefore difficult to survey. Estimates of abundance have been made for only a few areas (IWC 2006). Estimates from the early 2000s are available for five subpopulations in Japanese waters, distinguished on the basis of skull morphology and mtDNA variability (Yoshida <em>et al.</em> 1995, Yoshida 2002), as follows: 3,807 (coefficient of variation (CV) 16%) in Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 289 (CV 19%) in Omura Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 3,743 (CV 24%) in Ise/Mikawa Bay (Yoshida 2002); 3,387 (CV 33%) in Chiba/Sendai Bay (Amano <em>et al</em>. 2003); and 7,572 (CV 17%) in the Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Most of the estimates were summarized in IWC (2006). For the Inland Sea subpopulation, Kasuya <em>et al</em>. (2002) recorded a decline in sighting rate of 18-100% for 18 tracklines surveyed in 1976–78 and again in 1999–2000. The declines for 11 of the tracklines were statistically significant. Using abundance indices calculated by multiplying the density indices (no. individuals/cruise distance) and area size of each stratum, an overall decline of 69% is inferred over the 22 years between the two sets of surveys (T. Kasuya pers. comm. 2007, data from Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/> <br/> Surveys in western Korean waters (Yellow Sea) in the early 2000s estimated 21,532 (CV 39%) Finless Porpoises in offshore waters and 5,464 (CV 20%) in inshore waters (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) considered these estimates to be negatively biased (IWC 2006). More recent surveys resulted in density estimates of 0.122 individuals/km<span class=""A78"">² (offshore) and 0.151 ind./km² (inshore), both much lower than the corresponding estimates from surveys in 2004 (offshore, 0.565 ind./km²) and 2005 (inshore, 0.638 ind./km²) (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015). Park <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that these results indicated a decline in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in this region of approximately 70% between 2004/2005 and 2011.<br/> <br/> Based on surveys from 1984 to 1991, Zhang <em>et al</em>. (1993) estimated that there were about 2,700 porpoises in the Yangtze River, while Zhou <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated that only 700 remained in the lower reaches between Nanjing and Hukou between 1989 and 1992. Wang <em>et al</em>. (2000) concluded that Finless Porpoise abundance in the Yangtze River had declined considerably and that there could be fewer than 2,000 animals (although this was not based on a rigorous assessment). A two-vessel survey of the Yangtze mainstem in 2006 yielded an estimate of 1,225 (CV 0.13) which, when combined with earlier estimates for Poyang and Dongting Lakes, was interpreted as implying an overall number of about 1,800 in the Yangtze system (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). In some portions of the river where porpoises had been reported to be present in the past, none were seen during the 2006 survey (Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2012). Previous estimates of the annual rate of decline of Yangtze Finless Porpoises varied from 5 to 7.3% (see Wang 2009 for a review). However, a survey of the mainstem Yangtze in 2012 determined that only approximately 500 porpoises remained (Mei <em>et al.</em> 2014), indicating a roughly 60% decline in the main river in six years. However, Yangtze River cetacean surveys have been plagued by variable methods and coverage, and therefore decline rates must be viewed with some level of caution.<br/> <br/> There are no abundance estimates for Finless Porpoises in Chinese marine waters other than Hong Kong (IWC 2006), which in any event refer to for <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and not <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The type specimen was from the Yangtze River, Kiangsu [=Jiangsu] Province, China, ~129 km (80 miles) northwest of Shanghai (Pilleri and Gihr 1972).<br/> <br/> In general, this species occurs in a narrow strip of shallow (usually &lt;50 m deep) coastal water around the western Pacific Ocean from the Taiwan Strait to the waters of northern China, Korea and northern Honshu, Japan. (Note that a Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise was discovered recently in the waters of Okinawa Island, Japan (Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010), but it probably represents an extralimital stray rather than an extension of the species’ range.) The distribution also includes a few estuaries and rivers (e.g., the <em>N. a. asiaeorientalis</em> subspecies appears to be found exclusively in the Yangtze River system; Gao 1991, Gao and Zhou 1995).

Partly because of their small size, which limits their strength to break free once entangled, phocoenids are exceptionally vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets (e.g., Jefferson and Curry 1994), and incidental mortality in fishing gear has been documented throughout the range of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises. Fishing effort with gear documented to catch Finless Porpoises accidentally (including gillnets, trawls, stow nets, and seines) is intense in many areas where the species occurs or occurred. Although not quantified as rigorously as for some <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em> populations, regional declines (and possible local extirpations) of <em>N. phocaenoides</em> have been reported, presumably due to a combination of fishing pressure, coastal development and industrialization, pollution, and heavy vessel traffic (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1997, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2005, Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/> <br/>The data are insufficient to make a rigorous quantitative assessment of population trend for this species in any part of its range, but the scale of threats is large enough over enough of the range to suspect and infer a decline of at least 30% over the last three generations (about 45 years, assuming 15 years/generation as estimated for <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em> by Moore 2015) (<a name=""_Hlk486670028"">A2), over three generations into the future (A3), and over a three-generation period that includes both the past and the future (A4)</a>. The factor most responsible for such a decline would be incidental mortality in fisheries (subcriterion d, “exploitation”), but the loss and degradation of habitat (subcriterion c) and pollution (chemical and acoustic; subcriterion e) are likely contributing factors as well. None of the threats has been seriously addressed in any part of the species’ range, even though threat levels are presumably increasing.<br/> <br/> Therefore, the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise qualifies for Vulnerable under Red List criteria A2cde, <a name=""_Hlk486670084"">A3cde, and A4cde, </a>considering that the causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population size—bycatch, decline in habitat quality, and possibly pollution—have not ceased, may not be well understood, and may not all be reversible.","<p>Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises are found mainly in coastal waters, including shallow bays, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. They occur in waters &lt; 200 m deep and can be sighted up to 240 km from shore in some areas. It is uncertain which of the two currently recognized species of Finless Porpoises (possibly both) occurs farther offshore, especially in areas of sympatry.</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises appear to have a strong preference for waters with a sandy or soft bottom (Jefferson and Hung 2004).</p>  <p>Small fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (mainly demersal species) form the diet of Finless Porpoises (Jefferson and Hung 2004). <br/></p>  Higher numbers of Finless Porpoises are present in Hong Kong waters in winter and spring than in other seasons (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002). Seasonal differences in density and distribution, with higher densities in the winter months of November to January, have been observed along the coast of southern Maharashtra, India, and acoustic monitoring data from there have been interpreted to suggest both seasonal and diurnal patterns of occurrence in near-shore waters (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017). Minton <em>et al</em>. (2013) also observed a seasonal signal in their vessel surveys in Kuching Bay, with higher densities of Finless Porpoises observed in March, April, and May, which coincided with the occurrence of larger groups containing very small calves. Observations of porpoise behaviour in the bay were interpreted as suggesting that it is an important feeding and calving area (Zulkifli Poh 2013). Two stranded individuals had large shrimp in their stomachs (G. Minton, pers. comm., cited in IWC 2017).","<p>Finless Porpoises, like other phocoenids (Jefferson and Curry 1994), are extremely susceptible to entanglement in gillnets, and large numbers have been, and continue to be, killed in many parts of their range (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002b). Finless Porpoises are caught in nets in Iranian, Indian, Pakistani and Malaysian coastal waters, although there are no good estimates of the magnitude of such catches (e.g., see Collins <em>et al.</em> 2005, Jaaman <em>et al</em>. 2009, Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2010). In East Malaysia, Finless Porpoises are caught as bycatch in ‘fish stakes’ in Sabah (Jaaman <em>et al.</em> 2009) and one individual was found entangled in the line of a crab trap in Sarawak (G. Minton pers. comm. 2011), where cetacean bycatch is prevalent (Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016, IWC 2017). Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that Finless Porpoises were the most frequently captured cetaceans in fishing gear along the Chinese coast and estimated that more than 2,000 were taken in 1994, mainly in trawl, gill, and stow nets. In the Taiwan Strait (where the two species of Finless Porpoises are sympatric), a considerable number of both species are taken in trammel nets, trawl nets, stow nets, and other gear (J. Y. Wang unpublished data). In Hong Kong waters, porpoises are caught regularly by trawl nets and gillnets, but there are no estimates of bycatch levels (Parsons and Jefferson 2000, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2002b). Given the numbers and types of net fisheries in Chinese coastal waters, the apparently high bycatch of Finless Porpoises (Zhou and Wang 1994, Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999) is a serious concern. In Maharashtra, India, during 2014-2016, at least twenty Finless Porpoise carcasses washed ashore, a few of them known to have drowned in shore seine nets and gillnets (M. Sule, pers. comm<em>.</em>).</p>  <p>As a coastal species, the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise is also affected by habitat loss and degradation, boat traffic, and pollution. The extensive modification of coastlines for shrimp farming, causeways, and harbour (and other) development throughout Asia (including the Persian/Arabian Gulf) means that there is less habitat for Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003, Braulik<em> et al. </em>2010). Although pathology related to contaminant exposure has not been reported in Finless Porpoises, pollution is considered a potentially serious threat (Kasuya 1999, Iwata <em>et al</em>. 1994, Parsons and Chan 1998, Minh <em>et al</em>. 1999, Parsons 1999, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002b, Ramu <em>et al.</em> 2005). The number of reported Finless Porpoise strandings in Hong Kong has increased in recent years, partly due to increasing public awareness and reporting of local cetaceans, but also possibly due to escalating levels of human impacts (T.A. Jefferson pers. comm. 2017). In the Persian/Arabian Gulf, chemicals from recent wars exacerbate total pollution loads in coastal waters from the usual sources such as industry, agriculture and households (Braulik <em>et al. </em>2010). Vessel collisions, especially involving high-speed ferries, may be a particular problem for porpoises in Hong Kong (Parsons and Jefferson 2000).</p>  <p>The following summary of examples illustrates the problems faced by this species:</p>  <p></p><p>In Chinese waters (excluding the considerable fisheries operating in Taiwanese waters), more than 3.5 million gillnets were estimated to be in use in the early 1990s (Zhou and Wang 1994). In India, the use of gillnets reportedly had increased from about 18,000 in 1950 to more than 216,000 by 1980 and gillnets were also being used extensively in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar (Mohan 1994). Since the time of those reports, gillnetting effort certainly would have increased considerably in these and other regions because there are few (if any) restrictions on this kind of fishing gear anywhere in the range of the species. Porpoise habitat in Myanmar is heavily fished with gillnets and other types of gear capable of taking small cetaceans incidentally (Smith and Than Tun 2008). A drift gillnet fishery for elasmobranchs is of concern in the Bangladesh Sundarbans (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008). In East Malaysia, Finless Porpoise numbers are thought to have ‘greatly declined’ due to bycatch in fisheries (Jaaman <em>et al. </em>2009), and commercial fishing (gillnetting, trawling, purse-seining) is intensive off Peninsular Malaysia where bycatch of Finless Porpoises is known to occur even though it is not monitored regularly (L. Ponnampalam pers. comm. August 2017). Surveys in the coastal waters of Vietnam have resulted in very few sightings of cetaceans. In a study by Smith <em>et al.</em> (1997), no sightings were made of Finless Porpoises yet local whale temples contained many skulls of them as well as other cetacean species. A survey around Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam, in 2015 found evidence of Finless Porpoises being bycaught in trawl nets (L. Ponnampalam, pers. comm., August 2017). The impacts of war in the 1960s and 1970s, compounded by intense fishing (especially the use of gillnets) in recent years and ongoing, are likely at least partly responsible for the near absence of cetaceans from these waters. In Iran (Persian/Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman/Sea of Oman), bycatch in fisheries appears to be the greatest threat to marine mammals and removals from apparently small, localized populations of Finless Porpoises may be unsustainable (Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2010). Two major marine mammal die-offs occurred in the Persian/Arabian Gulf in the 1980s and 1990s, possibly related to major oil spills (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2005). Finless Porpoise sightings in Pakistan’s Indus Delta region were apparently decreasing in the 1970s (Pilleri and Gihr 1972, Pilleri and Pilleri 1979) and by the 1990s the species had nearly disappeared from this badly degraded area (see Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1997). </p>  <p>The Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise is one of several cetacean species that have greatly declined or disappeared from large parts of their range in Thailand, largely as a result of coastal habitat degradation and fishery bycatch (IWC 1994). </p>  No large-scale direct hunting of this species is known to occur. In some parts of their range, people apparently are averse to eating Finless Porpoises (Kasuya 1999, J. Y. Wang unpublished data) but in other areas they are consumed. Direct killing or capture of Finless Porpoises appears to be relatively rare (Reeves <em>et al. </em>1997) but development of intentional fisheries for marine mammals from incidental captures (and economic benefits from subsequent consumption and marketing) may have increased in parts of Southeast Asia as preferred marine resources have been over-fished (see Perrin 2002).","<p>Finless Porpoises are small and cryptic and therefore difficult to survey. Estimates of abundance have been made for only a few areas (Jefferson and Hung 2004, IWC 2006), mostly in regions where the Narrow-ridged species (<em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) dominates, if not exists solely. Numbers of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises in Hong Kong and adjacent waters were estimated to be at least 217 (coefficient of variation (CV) 21-150%) (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002a).</p>  <p>A vessel line-transect estimate of Finless Porpoises in Kuching Bay, Sarawak, Malaysia was 135 individuals (CV 31%, 95% confidence interval 74-246) (Minton <em>et al.</em> 2013). This represents a relatively small part of the species’ overall range (known or predicted) in western Borneo; there are no published abundance estimates for nearby areas (IWC 2017). A preliminary estimate of &gt;1,000 from vessel line-transect surveys is available from the Langkawi Archipelago, Peninsular Malaysia (L. Ponnampalam, pers. comm., August 2017).</p>  An estimate for a large area in the coastal waters of Bangladesh was 1,382 (CV 55%) but the density was very low compared to some of the reported densities of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in Japanese waters (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008).",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>The type specimen was supposed to have come from the Cape of Good Hope, but this location is believed to be erroneous; it is now generally accepted that the type locality is the Malabar coast of India (Rice 1998, Jefferson and Hung 2004).<br/> <br/> In general, Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises occur in a narrow strip of shallow (usually &lt;50 m deep) coastal marine waters (as well as some river mouths and estuaries) around the northern rim of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans from the Persian/Arabian Gulf (Preen 2004, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2005) eastwards around the rim of the Indian Ocean to the Indo-Malay region (Ponnampalam 2012) and to Java, Indonesia (but apparently not the Philippines) and northwards to the Taiwan Strait and central Chinese waters (Gao 1991, Gao and Zhou 1995). This is the more tropical and wide-ranging of the two species of Finless Porpoises. Records of this species from northern Chinese waters (e.g., Wang 1992) probably represent rare or extralimital events. Finless Porpoises are seen regularly (when sea conditions are favourable) in Sarawak, East Malaysia (Minton <em>et al. </em>2011), in at least parts of Peninsular Malaysia (e.g., they are the most frequently seen cetaceans around the Langkawi Archipelago according to Louisa Ponnampalam (pers. comm. 2017, J.Y. Wang unpublished data)), year-round (but with seasonal influxes) in Hong Kong (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2002a), and in parts of the western Taiwan Strait (J.Y. Wang unpub. data). They are also present along the East Kalimantan coastline of Borneo (D. Kreb pers. comm. 2011). In India, they are found in shallow waters along virtually the entire length of both the east and the west coasts, with sightings and strandings more commonly reported on the west coast (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017). One possible explanation for the difference is that the east coast has only pockets of preferred habitat, while more continuous or contiguous porpoise habitat is available along the west coast (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Given the paucity of dedicated cetacean survey effort in much of the species’ suspected range, the map includes the possible or projected range where oceanic features are consistent with the species’ known preferred habitat. As such, the species has not been recorded for all the states within the hypothetical range as shown on the map.

In Lake Victoria it is found in the open lake and in the dense interior of swamps and marshes (Goudswaard&#160;<em>et al. </em>2002) and in the Lake Tanganyika basin near rivers and deltas (Eccles 1992). Juveniles are found in the matted roots of papyrus (Witte and de Winter 1995). It can also live in streams and swamps which are completely dry for long periods of the year (Lockley 1949). It withstands desiccation by aestivating in cocoons until the next rains, breathing air by a small passage leading to the outside (Lockley 1949). The subspecies <em>Protopterus aethiopicus&#160;</em><em>congicus </em>is fluviatile and is confined to calm places with a muddy bottom. The principal diet of adults and sub-adults consists of molluscs but small fishes and insects are also eaten in small quantities. This species breeds during the flood season (Bailey 1994). One or several females spawn in burrows, which are dug and cleaned by the male who later guards the eggs and the young for nearly eight weeks (Witte and de Winter 1995).Young individuals of less than 35 cm TL feed almost wholly on insects (Witte and de Winter 1995). The maximum size is 200 cm TL, but they are commonly around 130 cm TL (Van Oijen 1995).","In the Lake Victoria basin the main threats are large-scale conversion of wetlands to agricultural land, harvesting of nest-guarding males, local overexploitation and low levels of Nile Perch predation restricting Lungfish to wetland refugia (Goudswaard&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2002).&#160;Sedimentation and the increased use of agrochemicals (pesticides and fertilisers) as a result of agricultural expansion are threats in the Malagarazi and Rusizi River basins.&#160;Mining activities and land-based pollution are additional threats in this region.&#160;It is also collected for the aquarium trade, although this may have a negligible impact on the population compared to other threats.<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>Protopterusaethiopicus mesmaekersi </em>may be threatened by transport and oil disposal by boats as well as intensive local fishing activities.

Humpback dolphins have one of the most specific habitat preferences and restricted distributions of any marine megafauna, and both of these characteristics are well known to reduce the resilience of species to environmental change and anthropogenic threats and to increase their extinction risk (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014, Purvis <em>et al</em>. 2000). Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins are concentrated in coastal waters within 2 km of shore and they are often sighted only a few hundred meters from land. This distribution places them in exactly the same location as the majority of small-scale fishing effort prevalent throughout their range in the same nearshore habitat. As a result, humpback dolphins encounter large numbers of coastal gillnets and are at high risk of entanglement. High and clearly unsustainable mortality rates have been reported from several areas and frequent encounters with fishing gear can be inferred from the high degree of scarring and injury—for example, 41% of individuals in Pemba, Tanzania bore gear-related scars (Braulik unpub. data). Although information on population size, threats and mortality is available only for portions of the species range, there are strong reasons to suspect and infer that the threats will be similar or possibly even more intense elsewhere.<br/><br/>The deaths of only 4.2 individuals per year from a population of 100 would result in a 50% decline (Moore 2015). The available evidence on the studied subpopulations in South Africa and all indications from elsewhere in the range suggest that mortality rates are consistently at or above the rate that would result in a 50% decline in 75 years (three generations). The species’ preferred habitat and small populations overlap in both space and time with several ubiquitous and pervasive threats that are increasing in severity, leaving no refuges for these dolphins. The threats are serious enough in a large enough proportion of the total species range that a range-wide decline of at least 50% over three generations spanning both the past and the future (about 75 years, from 1960 (the start of intensive mono-filament gillnetting in this region) to 2035) is suspected and inferred and the causes of the decline (bycatch and hunting [both considered here to constitute ‘exploitation’], decline in habitat quality and possibly pollution) have not ceased. Therefore, the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin qualifies for Endangered A4cd.<br/><br/>The factor primarily responsible for the decline is incidental mortality in small-scale coastal fisheries, but the loss, degradation and pollution of habitat in numerous coastal areas is a contributing and increasing factor. The threats have not been mitigated anywhere in the species’ range, even though threat levels are increasing virtually everywhere. All evidence suggests that threats and declines will continue and are likely to increase in the future and worldwide there are almost no examples where cetacean bycatch in small-scale artisanal fisheries has been successfully addressed. Alternative methods for small-scale fisheries to replace gillnets are not generally available. Therefore, the species also qualifies for Endangered 3cd as a decline of over 50% can be projected to occur over the next three generations (75 years from 2016 to 2091). It also qualifies for Endangered A2cd as a decline of over 50% is suspected over the last 75 years beginning with the expansion of the use of gillnets in global marine fisheries from around the end of the Second World War up to the present day.","Throughout their range, Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins occur in coastal habitats that include mangroves, rocky reefs, lagoons and shallow, protected bays. The over-riding habitat preference appears to be for water less than 25 m in depth. In Richards Bay, South Africa all encounters with humpback dolphins were in water shallower than 20 m. Dolphins used the area within 2 km from shore extensively and were rarely seen more than 3 km from land (Atkins <em>et al.</em> 2004). In Algoa Bay over 80% of sightings were within 400 m of the shore, average depth at sightings was 6.6 m, and there was a consistent preference for feeding near shallow rocky reefs throughout the year despite considerable changes in dolphin abundance (Karczmarski <em>et al</em>. 2000, Koper <em>et al</em>. 2106). In Zanzibar, distribution of humpback dolphin groups was restricted to a median distance of 830m (min-max: 200-1,550 m) from the shore and a median water depth of 11 m (min-max: 2-26 m) (Stensland <em>et al.</em> 2006). In Nosy Be, Madagascar the mean depth of sightings was 8.2 m with 95% of sightings in water less than 20 m deep (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Goa and the Gulf of Kutchchh, India most groups were sighted in water less than 10 m deep (Sutaria and Jefferson 2004), and similarly in Chennai, dolphins occurred in water between 10 and 25 m deep (Muralidharan 2013). In Oman and the Arabian Gulf, humpback dolphins generally occur in water depths of less than 20 m with an average depth recorded of 8.3m in 31 of 34 recorded sightings (Minton 2004, Minton <em>et al.</em> 2010). In some areas, such as the Musandam Peninsula and parts of Dhofar (Oman) they occur along rocky shores with a narrow continental shelf, but in such cases they occur very close (a few hundred meters at most) from the coast or within fjords. Humpback dolphins occur in channels within the mangroves of the massive Indus (Kiani and Van Waerebeek 2015; Pilleri and Gihr 1972) and Ganges-Brahmaputra deltas (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2006).","The habitat preference of humpback dolphins for shallow waters places them in some of the world’s most intensively utilized, fished, shipped, modified and polluted waters. The primary threat to the Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin throughout most, or all, of its range, is incidental mortality in fisheries (‘bycatch’), including in gillnets throughout its range and in shark control nets in South Africa. The bycatch threat likely emerged in the early part of the 20th century as the use of gillnets in global marine fisheries started to expand dramatically. Fish production increased at 3.2%/year from 1961-2009, and the increase in global landings began several decades earlier (FAO 2012). Marine mammal bycatch likely escalated with the gradual introduction of monofilament netting in the 1960s and 1970s (Klust 1973, Potter and Pawson 1991, Tarbit 1984). There are no known areas that offer a refuge for this species from the pervasive threat of incidental mortality in fisheries.<br/><br/>With the exception of the KwaZulu-Natal shark control program, there have been no on-board observer studies from which by-catch estimates could be generated. In virtually all countries around the Indian Ocean, fisheries, and particularly those that operate in the near-shore areas where these dolphins occur, are small-scale and artisanal, and involve small boats or canoes, that are frequently oar- or sail-powered. The fishing effort is concentrated within the preferred near-shore habitat of humpback dolphins. For example in Pemba in Tanzania approximately 90% of humpback dolphins sighted during recent surveys occurred less than 1 km from shore, and 95% of recorded fishing vessels occurred in exactly the same habitat. Of 27 photo-identified humpback dolphins in the same area, 41% had clear injuries from previous entanglements in fishing nets (Braulik, unpub). This demonstrates the degree to which most humpback dolphins must frequently encounter fishing gear and there is every reason to believe that this example from Pemba is the norm throughout the species range.<br/><br/>Substantial incidental mortality of humpback dolphins in coastal gillnets is reported from most countries within their range (IWC 2002). The best studied bycatch is for the KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa, where 203 humpback dolphins (50% in in Richard’s Bay) were captured in shark nets in the 30 years between 1980 and 2009. This corresponds to 4.2% annual mortality rate (Taylor supplemental spreadsheet “<em>Sousa plumbe</em>a Natal.xlsx”) assuming the population is potentially able to grow at 3%/year (Moore 2015). A high proportion (8%) of 109 distinctive, catalogued individuals were recognized among the shark net bycatch between 1998 and 2006 and while individuals naturally emigrate from the Richards Bay area, this points to mortality in shark nets as a driver of the permanent loss of individuals from the area which may also be negatively affecting the wider population (Atkins <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Mozambique, intense coastal fishing effort is considered to be the main threat to this species, and shark fishery gill nets and trawl nets have incidentally killed dolphins throughout the country (Guissamulo 2008). Incidental catch of humpback dolphins has been documented in gillnets off the south coast of Zanzibar in Tanzania (Amir <em>et al</em>. 2002). There are currently no estimates of the magnitude of the bycatch, but given that even two humpback dolphins taken per year would exceed 2% of the population, it is very likely that bycatch represents a threat to the dolphins in the area (Stensland et al. 2006).&#160; In Oman, the high incidence of stranded humpback dolphins was presumed to be the result of interactions with fisheries (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2002). The reported mortality rate due to fisheries interactions (both bycatch and directed take) in the southwest region of Madagascar was noted to be almost certainly unsustainable (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Although it is impossible to evaluate the magnitude in most areas, in all areas where it has been evaluated, the rate of incidental mortality of this species in fisheries appears to be high, unsustainable and causing rapid local population decline.<br/><br/>There are very few areas within the known range of humpback dolphins where anthropogenic alteration of habitat has not occurred. The destruction of inshore habitats is likely to be one of the greatest threats to humpback dolphins, particularly in the southern Africa region (Atkins <em>et al</em>. 2015, Plön <em>et al</em>. 2016) and in the Arabian/Persian Gulf and many other rapidly developing urban coastal areas (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004, Karczmarski 2000). Dredging, land reclamation, construction blasting, port and harbour construction, pollution, boat traffic, oil and gas exploration and development (including inshore seismic surveys), and other coastal development activities occur, or are concentrated within, humpback dolphin habitat and threaten their survival in ways that are challenging to quantify (IWC 2002). The continued presence of humpback dolphins in highly degraded habitats does not rule out that habitat degradation has had adverse behavioural or health effects (IWC 2002, Piwetz <em>et al</em>. 2015). This is a pervasive threat that is increasing throughout the species range and there is no reason to expect this trend to change in the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>In comparison to other marine mammals with wider and more oceanic distributional ranges, the exposure of <em>S. plumbea</em> to environmental contaminants and their bioaccumulation is likely to be very high (Jefferson and Karczmarski 2001). Many of the large urban centres and ports around the Indian Ocean, including Mumbai, Karachi, Dubai, Aden, Mombasa, Dar es Salaam, Maputo and Durban, release a toxic cocktail of untreated human and industrial waste into coastal waters, which are inhabited by humpback dolphins. Of six dolphin species in South Africa Sousa plumbea was found to be the most contaminated by total Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and concentrations of DDTs in S. plumbea were among the highest levels reported in delphinids globally, above the likely effect threshold for impairment of immune functions (Gui et al. 2016). Elsewhere the effects of such pollution on humpback dolphins have yet to be studied but may be severe (Gore <em>et al</em>. 2012). For example, in Pakistan very high levels of chemical pollution in creeks of the Indus delta are toxic enough to cause fish kills, and are likely to have adverse effects on cetaceans (Kiani and Van Waerebeek 2015). In Gadani, Pakistan up to 100 ships per year are scrapped and dismantled leading to the release of large amounts of heavy metals, asbestos, dioxins and other persistent organic pollutants in coastal water. These problems are widespread and increasing in many countries; their impact on coastal dolphins has not been evaluated but pollution is likely contributing to local declines in range and abundance and may have caused extirpation adjacent to major industrial centres.<br/><br/>Other threats that appear somewhat less serious (possibly because of lack of information) or only affect a certain portion of the species range include direct killing, boat traffic/harassment, and oil spills and exploration (Piwetz <em>et al</em>. 2015, IWC 2002). There is little evidence for intense hunting of humpback dolphins except for those in Madagascar (IWC 2002); in the southwest, dolphins were historically taken with harpoons but are now targeted with gillnets or in a drive hunts. Andrianarivelo (2001) estimated a minimum of 61 deaths of <em>S. plumbea</em> between 1985 and 1999 in Anakao related to the directed takes including drive hunts (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Given the relatively small populations sizes reported throughout the region, the reported mortality rate due to hunting is likely unsustainable and contributing to local population decline (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Dolphin hunting used to occur in Menai Bay in Zanzibar; the last hunt occurred in 1996, taking 23 individuals, assumed to be <em>S. plumbea</em> and <em>Tursiops aduncus</em>. This would represent an annual mortality close to 12% for a combined population estimate of 199 animals for the two dolphin species in the area. This was certainly unsustainable resulting in a negative impact on the status of the dolphins off the south coast of Zanzibar (Stensland <em>et al</em>. 2006). Humpback dolphins were hunted in former years in the Arabian Gulf, and there was some evidence that there was continued hunting of dolphins until the early 2000s in Oman from small, motorized boats using harpoons (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004), but this is now thought to have ceased. In Maputo Bay, Mozambique dolphins were also reported to be hunted for meat in intertidal shallows areas and estuaries (Guissamulo 2008).<br/><br/>Blast fishing using dynamite or other explosives is an intense threat to humpback dolphins in the few countries in which it occurs frequently; Tanzania (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2017b, Cagua <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Sri Lanka (Cornelis <em>et al</em>. 2008). This illegal activity is concentrated in near-shore areas that are also specifically humpback dolphin habitat.","Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin abundance has been estimated, using mark-recapture of photo-identified individuals, from several discrete locations in South Africa and the Southwest Indian Ocean, but there are no absolute abundance estimates from anywhere in the species range north of Kenya. The total population is estimated to be as low as tens of thousands.<br/><br/>All populations that have been quantitatively evaluated have been small, always fewer than 500 individuals and usually fewer than 200. Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal has a population composed of a small core of residents (5%) along with many transients (81%) passing through the area that probably range widely along the coast (Atkins <em>et al</em>. 2016). Abundance for the KwaZulu-Natal province was estimated as 160 (95% CI 134-229) in 1991-1992 (Durham 1994) and 74 in 1998 (95% CI 60–88) (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2002). No marked animals from Richards Bay were recorded in Algoa Bay, where Karczsmarski <em>et al</em>. (1999) estimated the total abundance at 466 (95% CI 447-485) animals during fieldwork conducted from 1991 to 1994. Populations in Plettenberg Bay were estimated at about 112 (95% CI 75-133) (Jobson 2006) and in Mossel Bay as 125 individuals (95% CI 61, 260) in 2011-2013 (James <em>et al</em>. 2015), although marked individuals are known to move between these areas. Although 52 marked individuals were identified in the area between False Bay and Mosselbay, no abundance estimates are available at this stage. All four populations evaluated in Mozambique, Tanzania and Kenya are estimated at approximately 100 individuals or fewer (Guissamulo and Cockcroft 1997, Guissamulo and Cockcroft 2004, Meyler <em>et al</em>. 2011, Stensland <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>In the early 2000s, in Oman and much of the Arabian Gulf this species was amongst the most commonly recorded coastal cetacean, with large reported group sizes, frequently more than 40 individuals and up to a hundred or more (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004), the situation has deteriorated considerably since that time. Now in the UAE and probably elsewhere in the region, each population is discrete and likely to number less than 100 individuals (A. Natoli, pers. comm). Pilleri and Pilleri (1979) conducted limited surveys in the Indus Delta of Pakistan and based on these made an educated guess that there were approximately 500 individuals in the entire delta. Indices of abundance for <em>S. plumbea</em> were recorded for the Gulf of Kachchh and the Goa coast of India, and the sighting rate was over six times higher in Goa (Sutaria and Jefferson 2004). The limited data presented above indicate that <em>S. plumbea</em> occurs in restricted habitat, is discontinuously distributed, and is not abundant anywhere in its range. There is no estimate of total species abundance, but Jefferson and Rosenbaum (2014) stated that the available estimates for specific populations suggest that range-wide abundance is probably no higher than the low tens of thousands.<br/><br/>Like most cetaceans, <em>S. plumbea</em> has a low reproductive rate. These dolphins occur in small, relatively discrete and localized populations that cannot sustain even a moderate level of anthropogenic mortality without suffering population declines. As an example and to place this in the context of the Red List criteria, assuming a 3% recruitment rate (Moore 2015), a discrete subpopulation of 100 individuals would decline by 30% over 75 years (three generations) if only 3.7 individuals were removed per year due to anthropogenic mortality. Similarly, removal due to anthropogenic mortality of only 4.1 animals per year from such a subpopulation would result in a 50% decline over 75 years (see Table 5 in Moore 2015). Extrapolation from single, small, isolated subpopulations with data-based estimates of mortality obviously requires consideration of whether the conditions of those subpopulations are representative of the global population.<br/><br/>Modelled population growth rates for the dolphins in Algoa Bay were -3 to +2% per year (Karczmarski 2000), but there are no quantitative estimates of population growth rate (rates of increase) for any of the other small populations across the range of the species. Consequently, trends must be inferred by evaluating the magnitude of mortality or the magnitude of declines in relative sighting rates or group size. In Algoa Bay over a sixteen year period, the mean humpback dolphin group size halved (Koper et al. 2016). Along the KwaZulu-Natal coast the rate of incidental capture deaths (‘bycatch’) of humpback dolphins in shark nets has been very high; 203 animals were caught between 1980 and 2009, which corresponds to an average of 6.8 animals per year (Atkins <em>et al</em>. 2013). Given the estimated maximum growth rate for this species of 3%/year (Moore 2015), a constant mortality rate of 4.2%/year would result in the observed number of deaths (with an abundance of 160 in 1992 (Durham 1994)). The annual rate of decline, assuming that the population is growing at a maximum potential rate, would be 1.3% resulting in a 63% decline in three generations. In the Arabian Gulf, aerial strip transect surveys between 1986 and 1999 recorded Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins as the second most commonly sighted cetacean after Tursiops aduncus (Preen 2004). The data from those surveys indicated a statistically significant decline in abundance of 70% for all cetaceans observed, including humpback dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and finless porpoises (Preen 2004). In Madagascar there was an observed decline in sighting rates of humpback dolphins in the southwest region (off Anakao) along with a decrease in mean group size between 2004 and 2013, likely as a result of hunting, bycatch and habitat degradation (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Although few quantitative data on population trends exist, because of the restricted distribution and the generally small size of subpopulations of this species, only 4-8 deaths per year in a given subpopulation of 100 individuals would be sufficient to cause a 50% decline in that subpopulation over three generations. The overwhelming level of threat due to intensive use of this species’ exclusively near-shore habitat by humans, and the consistently high reported mortality rates throughout the parts of the species’ range where monitoring has occurred, means that the global <em>S. plumbea</em> population size is almost certainly decreasing (Friedmann and Daly 2004, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2008).",Decreasing,"Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins are found in a narrow strip of shallow, coastal waters from False Bay, South Africa, in the west, through the coastal waters of South, East and North Africa, and the Middle East to approximately the southern tip of India and possibly further east. Distribution includes the Red Sea, the Arabian/Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Gulf of Aden, western Madagascar and several offshore islands including the Andamans, Mayotte, and Zanzibar. Significant portions of the species range have not been surveyed, particularly in many parts of northeast Africa and the middle east, (including Somalia, Yemen, Djibouti, Eritrea, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, etc.) where these animals are known to be present only from a handful of sighting or stranding records (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The level of knowledge about this species is greatest in South Africa, the Southwest Indian Ocean, Oman and the UAE. The species has a very narrow habitat niche and typically occurs less than 3km from shore and/or in water less than 25 m deep, and populations are usually, but not exclusively, found in locations with extensive shallows such as protected bays and estuaries. Known areas of <em>S. plumbea</em> concentration include Kleinbaai, Saint Sebastian, Pletternberg, Algoa, Richards and Mossel Bays in South Africa (James <em>et al</em>. 2015, Karczmarski 2000, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2013, Koper <em>et al</em>. 2016), Maputo Bay (Guissamulo and Cockroft 2004) and the Bazaruto Archipelago, Mozambique (Guissamulo and Cockcroft 1997), Nosy Be and the Nosy Iranja/Ampasindava Peninsula in Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015), the west coast of Unguja (Stensland <em>et al</em>. 2006) and Pemba Islands in Tanzania (Braulik, unpub. data), Shimoni in Southern Kenya (Meyler <em>et al</em>. 2011), much of the Arabian Sea coast of Oman (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2010), and Cochin in India (Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008). They are among the most common cetaceans in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004, Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, recent surveys in the United Arab Emirates in the Gulf suggest that each humpback dolphin population is small and discrete, probably consisting of less than 100 individuals (A. Natoli, pers comm). In India, they are distributed almost continuously along most of the west coast and they also occur in northwest Sri Lanka (Sutaria and Jefferson 2004). There are no sighting records from oceanic archipelagos such as the Lakshadweep and Maldive Islands (Sutaria and Jefferson 2004), or from eastern Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Humpback dolphins have not been recorded in the Union of Comoros (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2010b), however they do exist in very small numbers in the neighbouring island of Mayotte (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2010a). There is a hiatus in distribution of several hundred kilometres along the northern coast of Oman (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004, Minton <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is unclear if this results from the influence of recent human population expansion and associated development or has an ecological basis, however superficially the habitat appears suitable (Baldwin <em>et al</em>. 2004, Minton <em>et al</em>. 2010). Survey effort in early 2015 revealed a possible distribution hiatus along several hundred kilometres of the southern Tanzania coast where the continental shelf is very narrow and shallow habitat almost non-existent (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2017a). While additional survey effort will likely reveal more areas of concentration, it will likely also reveal areas of absence along exposed and deep coastlines, or areas of high human impact, and more discontinuities in distribution than are currently known or assumed.","Throughout the majority of their range, except perhaps South Africa, accidentally captured humpback dolphins are generally used for human consumption and other local purposes. They are reportedly eaten (termed ‘marine bushmeat’) in Madagascar (Razafindrakoto <em>et al</em>. 2004), Mozambique (Guissamulo 2008), Tanzania (Amir <em>et al</em>. 2002) and India (Kumarran 2012). The meat is sometimes used as bait for sharks (Amir <em>et al. </em>2002) or for crabs and fish (Kiani and Van Waerebeek 2015) and the oil is used in some areas as wood preservative for boats (Berggren and Coles 2009), for cooking or as medicine (Gore <em>et al</em>. 2012). A dolphin drive hunt in the southwest of Madagascar is exclusively to capture dolphins for human consumption (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). A hunt that occurred on Zanzibar killed many dolphins until the early 1990s but has now ceased. Although the dolphins are often utilized, reports of actual market sales are uncommon. Humpback dolphins were reported as being for sale at three different locations on the west coast of India (Goa, Malpe in Karnataka and Trivandrum in Kerala) (Kumarran 2012, Mohan 1994) and in Madagascar they were for sale in local villages (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2015). Non-consumptive uses of humpback dolphins include dolphin watching tourism. However, because of their low abundance and shy behaviour they are often not the primary target of the activity.",Marine,"For many countries and regions throughout their range Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphins are extremely poorly known, and although many threats exist, there have been very few effective conservation actions. One exception is KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa where since 1999 attempts have been made to reduce the large and unsustainable accidental capture of dolphins in the shark nets by using acoustic deterrents (pingers) and whale alarms (Cliff and Dudley 2011) but these have so far been unsuccessful (Atkins et al. 2013). Acoustic pingers were also trialed on gillnets in Tanzania.<br/><br/>Dolphins used to be hunted in Menai Bay in the south of Unguja Island, Tanzania, however since 1990s the hunt has been replaced by swim-with-the-dolphin tourism (Berggren <em>et al</em>. 2007). Similarly, in the southwest region of Madagascar there has been a focus on community engagement to mitigate marine mammal hunting and bycatch through the establishment of community-based nature-oriented tourism, local protection and enforcement, and social outreach campaigns, that have met with some success (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2014, Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2009).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small geographically isolated subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt; 1000 mature individuals. Anthropogenic mortality of only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals per year from a population of 100 individuals would result in 30%, 50% and 80% declines in population abundance after 3 generations, respectively (see Moore 2015 Table 5).</p>  <p>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the species’ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the species’ range in Australia (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012; Bejder<em> et al.</em> 2012; Cagnazzi<em> et al.</em> 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown<em> et al.</em> 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell<em> et al.</em> 2013). Additionally, the species’ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  Considering the available evidence and following a precautionary approach we considered this species as Vulnerable under IUCN criterion C2a(i) because the total number of mature individuals is plausibly fewer than 10,000, a projected continuing decline due to cumulative impacts; and each of the defined subpopulations studied to date is estimated to contain fewer than 1,000 mature individuals. Although the species may not meet any of the criteria for Endangered at this time, it is likely to do so in the near future considering It is possible that 1) number of mature individuals is less than 2,500, 2) the reductions in population size have been larger and pervasive enough to cause a net reduction for the entire species of at least 20% over a period of 2 generations and 3) that the number of mature individuals in each subpopulation across their range is ≤ 250 individuals.","<p>Within their geographical range Australian Humpback Dolphins are found primarily in coastal waters. Opportunistic data collected during aerial surveys designed to estimate the distribution and abundance of Dugongs (<em>Dugong dugon</em>) in the Great Barrier Reef indicated that Australian Humpback Dolphins were sighted on average 6.4 km (se = 1.26, Range 0-55.6 km) from the nearest point of land and 2.7 km (std. err. = 0.27, range = 0-8.1 km) to the nearest shallow area (either point of land or charted reef, less than 2m deep at low tide) (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997). In Queensland and in the Northern Territory humpback dolphins are found mostly within 10 km off the coast (Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). Accordingly, in Keppel Bay, Central Queensland, where up to 10 km offshore waters still remain below 10m in depth, Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were recorded on average 2.8 km (SD = 4.21, Range = 0-24 km) off the coast. In Western Australia, sightings obtained from recent exploratory surveys and ongoing studies seem to confirm a similar pattern, with the majority of the sightings obtained within 5 km off the coast (Brown and Hunt personal communication). In Papua New Guinea, the first tentative sightings of Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were made in the Kikori Delta region; close to the coastline and in waters 1.6-11.4 m deep (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p>While coastal waters are arguably the primary habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins, most survey work has been conducted close to the coast, thus the extent to which humpback dolphins use offshore waters is not yet fully understood. Observations of Australian Humpback Dolphins at least up to 55.6 km from land, indicate that this species may occasionally venture further offshore especially in sheltered and protected waters such as in the Great Barrier Reef where sand flats occur almost continuously from the mainland to the outer reefs (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997).</p>  <p>Along the Australian Coast Humpback Dolphins are more likely to be found in relatively shallow and protected coastal habitats such as inlets, estuaries, shallow bays, inshore reefs and coastal archipelagos rather than in open stretches of coastline. In Queensland and Northern Territory, humpback dolphins are mainly found in water less than 20 km from the nearest river mouth and in water less than 15-20 m deep (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). Few animals have been observed in waters up to 30-50 m deep, but remained in close proximity (within 5 km) to the coast (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). In both Queensland and Northern Territory humpback dolphins have been also recorded as far as 20-50 km upstream in large rivers such as the East Alligator River, Northern Territory, and in the Fitzroy and Brisbane rivers in Queensland (Cagnazzi 2010, Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). No studies on habitat use have been conducted in Western Australia. Preliminary surveys and ongoing studies in few locations indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins appear to utilize a wide range of near-shore habitats. For example, around the North West Cape, dolphins have been sighted in clear waters over Ningaloo Reef, and in turbid waters in Exmouth Gulf, and in depths ranging from 1 to 40 m deep (T. Hunt 2015, pers. comm., 19 February) </p>  <p>Among subpopulations there appear to be some differences in habitat selection suggesting high adaptability of this species to local environment characteristics. For example, in Cleveland Bay Australian Humpback Dolphins showed preferences for waters close to the coast and 2-5 m deep, followed by waters 1-2 m deep whereas in Keppel Bay (~630 Km south) humpback dolphins showed preference for waters 2-5 and 5-10 m deep, while In Port Curtis (~700 km further south) humpback dolphins showed preference for water 5-10 and 10-15 m deep. Within these regions humpback dolphins showed selection for various types of habitats including dredged channels, reefs, seagrass flats and mangroves.</p>  Across Australia, humpback dolphins have been observed feeding in a wide range of inshore-estuarine coastal habitats including rivers and creeks, expose banks, shallow flats, rock and coral reefs as well as over submerged reefs in waters at least up to 40 m deep (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012, Cagnazzi 2010, Parra 2006, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). The analysis of stomach contents of 6 humpback dolphins stranded in Queensland indicated they are opportunistic-generalist feeders, preying on a wide variety of fishes including both bottom-dwelling species (e.g., grunts, tooth ponyfishes, croakers, flatheads, and whitings) as<strong> </strong>well as pelagic species (e.g., cardinal fishes, gizzard shads, anchovies, false trevally and barracudas) (Parra and Jedensjö 2014). Among these, Grunt fish (<em>Pomadasys</em> sp.) were the most numerically important prey accounting for more than half (52.9%) of all prey items, followed by the cardinal fish (<em>Apogon </em>sp., 10.4%) and smelt-whiting (<em>Sillago </em>sp., 9.7%) (Parra and Jedensjö 2014)","<strong>Habitat Loss and Degradation<br/></strong>Several regions across Humpback Dolphins’ range in Australia have been substantially modified both inland, to allow mining, agricultural and grazing activities and along the coast to allow industrial ports; marinas, aquaculture and residential developments. Concurrently, several mining industries are undergoing major upgrades and extensions, while new extraction sites have been proposed to meet an increasing export demand of primary resources (carbon, oil, natural gas, woods, aluminium and uranium), particularly in northwestern Australia and along the central coast of Queensland (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Queensland Government 2012). As a result significant expansions of existing ports facilities are underway across the coastal range of Australian Humpback Dolphins (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) For example, by 2020 the port capacity along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Queensland, is expected to triple to support the predicted growth in Queensland’s annual coal production (Grech <em>et al</em>. 2013). The IUCN considered this unprecedented scale of development as a serious threat to biodiversity in the GBRWHA (Douvere and Badman 2012).<br/><br/>Activities associated with coastal zone developments such as land reclamation, dredging, seismic surveys, drilling, blasting, shipping and resource extraction may result in habitat loss and degradation for Australian Humpback Dolphins. For example, it has been estimated that in the Fitzroy River, Queensland, between 14 to 25% of Australian Snubfin Dolphin (<em>Orcaella heinsohni</em>) habitat (which largely overlaps with that of Australian Humpback Dolphins) will be directly modified if a planned industrial port development were to occur (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Besides their influence on dolphins’ habitat, these activities have the potential to cause disturbance of humpback dolphins’ normal activities through physical displacement and increasing underwater noise pollution (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014). Dredging involved in the construction, maintenance and expansion of ports is of particular concern as it may potentially displace dolphins from important habitats as a result of changes in fish distribution, increased vessel activities, declining water quality and underwater noise (Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Todd <em>et al</em>. 2015). Because most ports across the Australian Humpback Dolphins range are located in relatively shallow waters, they all require large volumes of dredging. For example, the Gladstone Western Basin project in Queensland involved the dredging of 22 million cubic meters of soil (Ports Australia 2014).<br/><br/>Additionally habitat loss and fragmentation from coastal zone developments and associated activities can influence the population genetic structure of biological populations through their isolation (Keyghobadi 2007). Given the small densities, strong population genetic structure and limited gene flow found among subpopulations of Australian Humpback Dolphins; loss of genetic variation may reduce the ability of individuals to adapt to a changing environment, cause inbreeding depression, reduce survival and reproduction and increase their probability of extinction (Andrews 2014, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><strong><br/>By-catch</strong><br/>Human-related mortality of humpback dolphins in Australian waters is thought to be largely attributable to by-catch in shark nets set for swimmers protection by the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) and in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries for Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em> Bloch 1970) and Threadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em> Macleay 1884) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> Shaw 1804) (Hale 1997, Paterson 1990). There are no estimates of the magnitude of these indirect takes or of their trend over the time.<br/><br/>Fisheries observers on gillnet vessels operating in northern Australian waters between 1981-1985 reported one Australian Humpback Dolphin among the cetacean species incidentally taken (Harwood and Hembree 1987). At least 18 Humpback Dolphins were collected from shark nets along the Queensland coast between 1968-2001 (Haines and Limpus 2002, Heinsohn 1979). Between 1997-2007 a further 13 humpback dolphins were reported caught in the QSCP shark nets and drumlines (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Shark nets have now been removed from most of the Queensland coast and captures of dolphins appear to be small at a state level (Gribble <em>et al</em>. 1998). For example, between 2008 and 2011 no humpback dolphin was reported caught in the shark nets, despite QSCP accounting for 73% of all cetaceans mortalities (Meager <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, given the low population sizes at which this species occurs, the death of even a few individuals per year at a local level could have detrimental consequences on the viability of local subpopulations.<br/><br/><strong>Water pollution</strong><br/>Sources of anthropogenic contaminants are likely to increase in the future across northern Australia, as a result of a widespread contamination by several new pesticides (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012), increasing annual runoff (Chiew and McMahon 2002), and rapid urban and industrial development. As coastal top predators, humpback dolphins may accumulate high concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants through bioaccumulation (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>The water discharge by many rivers across the Humpback Dolphin’s range in Australia is of poor quality, often with contaminant concentrations likely to cause environmental harm (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2012, Francey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Schaffelke <em>et al</em>. 2012). For example an assessment of the relative risk of pollutants from agricultural and land uses ranked most of the rivers in Queensland as relatively high priority (Waterhouse <em>et al</em>. 2012). Agricultural and industrial-sourced pollutants have been identified as the major threats to the coastal water quality especially along the Great Barrier Reef. As a result various contaminants, were detected in sediments samples as well as in several marine species known to be part of the humpback dolphin diet (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2005). Accordingly, a recent study detected high levels of organochlorine compounds (DDTs, PCBs, HCB) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in biopsy samples collected from humpback dolphins along the Queensland coast (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>Although exposure to contaminants may not directly cause the death of an animal, it may affect the dolphins’ health in numerous ways, including an increased susceptibility to diseases and impairment of metabolic functions (Bossart 2011, De Swart <em>et al</em>. 1996). The immunosuppressive effect of contaminants may play an important role in the death of humpback dolphins following large floods and major industrial coastal developments (DEHP 2012, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Underwater Noise</strong><br/>Sounds introduced into the marine environment by anthropogenic activities (e.g., dredging, pile-driving, underwater surveying, shipping) may have detrimental effects on marine mammals by interfering with their ability to communicate, echolocate, and/or mask other important natural sounds (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 1995, Nowacek <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>For example, impulsive hammering sounds can be loud, and levels as high as 165 dB re 1 mPa were measured 1 km from a hammer used for pipe installation (Bailey <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent study conducted in the Pearl River Estuary of China, near Hong Kong, to monitor the effects of the world's largest vibration hammer (OCTA-KONG) on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins has suggested that the vibration zone detectable by individual animal extends beyond 3.5 km. While Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins clicks do not appear to be adversely affected, the whistles were susceptible to auditory masking and a safety zone of 500 m radius was proposed (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Floods</strong><br/>Peak mortality of inshore dolphins In Queensland, including Australian Humpback Dolphins, followed sustained periods of elevated freshwater discharge (9 months) (Meager and Limpus 2014). In Queensland floods exceed their natural ranges of variation due to inland catchment modifications that result in a large amount of sediments, heavy metals, nutrients and pesticides being discharged into the estuaries and adjacent coastal areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Furnas 2003). Increases in freshwater discharge may also increase exposure to infectious pathogens such as toxoplasmosis; which has been observed and thought to be the cause of death of four Australian Humpback Dolphins (Bowater <em>et al</em>. 2003). Modelling studies estimated that in some areas the annual runoff in catchments across Australia could increase to up to 15% by the year 2030, due to the increased in rainfall associated with global warming (Chiew and McMahon 2002). Thus, the resilience and recovery capacity of the entire coastal ecosystem including humpback dolphins’ preferred habitat may be put under great threat.<br/><br/><strong>Cumulative threats</strong><br/>The cumulative impact of environmental factors and anthropogenic activities is arguably the primary threat to humpback dolphins (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011). The continuous alteration of coastal systems have greatly undermined the resilience of many wildlife communities, populations, and species living in estuaries, making them more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity events and anthropogenic stressors (Hobday and Lough 2011). The loss of habitat quantity and quality has been identified among the primary drivers of population declines of marine animals. The reduction of suitable habitat may force local populations of humpback dolphins to adjust to the remaining resources through a reduction in survival rate and population size, or emigration to more suitable areas (Andren 1994, Fahrig 1997, Jefferson 2000). Such effects are likely to be exacerbated when natural systems are simultaneously subjected to multiple stressors as a result of cumulative impacts and negative synergistic interactions (Crain <em>et al</em>. 2008, Halpern <em>et al</em>. 2008, Venter <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Recent studies on other inshore dolphin populations living in highly industrialized regions have reported negative population trends. In the Pearl River estuary, China, modelling of demographic data from strandings of humpback dolphins predicted that the population was declining at about 2.4% per annum (Huang et al. 2012), in the Yangtze River the population of Yangtze Finless Porpoise is declining at a rate of about 6% p.a. (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2012), while in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, the local isolated bottlenose dolphin population has declined at a rate of about 30% over the last 12 years (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2007). According to this evidence a reduction in the number of Australian Humpback Dolphins could be expected if the impacts of multiple port expansion, development projects, water pollution, vessel traffic and increasing frequency of natural catastrophic events are not properly addressed.","At present, there is no range-wide estimate of the abundance of Australian Humpback Dolphins. Estimates of abundance are available from several discrete locations across Australia (Supplementary Material: Table 1, see Fig. 1 for locations). Additionally, monitoring to estimate abundance is currently underway at several new locations in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Overall, available abundance estimates indicate that humpback dolphins occur in small subpopulations averaging 54-89 individuals and 0.1-0.19 individuals per km² (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the global number of “mature individuals” (i.e. individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction) of Australian Humpback Dolphins is challenging, because relevant demographic data are insufficient or non-existent. If we assume that the proportion of mature individuals (Nm) is similar to that estimated for the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>), which is 50% (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007), each subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) numbers &lt;105 mature individuals. Considering that all available abundance estimates for Australian Humpback Dolphins are low (typically less than 150 individuals; Table 1 in the Supplementary Material), the total number of mature individuals across their range is unlikely to exceed 10,000 individuals.<br/><br/><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>Estimates of population size trends across the species’ range are unknown. Surveys in Cleveland Bay, northeast Queensland, (1999-2002) showed low population sizes (34-54 individuals) and no clear trends, but indicated that even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates population trends will be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size were greater than 20% p.a. (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a). A longer multiyear study (2006-2011) in the Capricorn and Curtis Coast regions, Central Queensland, showed that abundance estimates declined throughout the study in Keppel Bay and Curtis coast region from 115 and 84 individuals in 2007 to 104 and 45 in 2011, respectively (Cagnazzi 2013). The decline in abundance estimates was associated with a large flood event in 2010 and the concurrent expansion of the Port Curtis port facilities (Cagnazzi 2013). Analyses of data collected until 2014 will clarify whether the observed decline is permanent or just a temporary shift in dolphin distribution.<br/><br/>Ongoing monitoring studies (2011-2014) in Bynoe Harbor, Darwin Harbor and Shoal Bay in the Northern Territory, have shown that the numbers of humpback dolphins in these areas are quite small (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) but have remained fairly stable throughout the years (Brooks and Pollock 2014). Estimates in Port Essington Harbor, Northern Territory, varied widely (48-207) among sampling periods (2008-2010). This variation was likely due to movements in and out of the study area, temporary emigration, temporal changes in behaviour, or temporal changes in detectability (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a).<br/><br/>Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small and localized subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt;1,000 mature individuals and that there could well be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. As with other cetaceans, the low reproductive rates of Australian Humpback Dolphins make them vulnerable to even low rates of anthropogenic mortality. For example, assuming a 3% recruitment rate (as estimated for <em>S. chinensis</em> and <em>S. plumbea</em> in Moore 2015) a discrete subpopulation of 100 individuals would decline by 30%, 50% and 80% over 75 years (three generations) if only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals were removed, respectively, per year due to anthropogenic mortality (see Table 5 in Moore 2015).<br/><br/>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the species’ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the species’ range in Australia (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell <em>et al</em>. 2013). Additionally, the species’ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Population Structure</strong><br/>Overall, the genetic data available suggest that Australian Humpback Dolphins exist as a metapopulation of small and relatively isolated subpopulations with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014, Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data). Analysis of population structure using both microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA sequence data from humpback dolphins from the Dampier Archipelago, and the North West Cape in north Western Australia (~300 km apart) showed significant levels of population structure with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014). Similarly, analysis of population structure among eight sampling locations (from tens to 1,500 kilo meters apart) along the east coast of Queensland indicated significant population differentiation and low levels of migration rates between most sampling locations (Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data).<br/><br/>The available evidence on abundance estimates (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) and population genetic structure indicates Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small, localized populations with limited gene flow. Abundance estimates suggest that there are fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. Additionally, no subpopulation studied to date is larger than 200 mature individuals (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Substantial numbers of humpback dolphins have been killed in localized areas along the east coast of Queensland in anti-shark nets set to protect bathers (Heinsohn 1979, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004) . Humpback dolphins are also known to die in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries primarily for |Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) and T|hreadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em>) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> (Anderson 1995, Hale 1997). Given the continuing vulnerability to bycatch in shark nets and gillnets, low densities in surveyed areas, and increased habitat degradation throughout their range (see threats section) it is likely that a continuing decline of at least 10% will occur over a period of 3 generations (about 75 years, assuming generation length is similar to that estimated for <em>S. chinensis </em>in Moore 2015).",Decreasing,"Australian Humpback Dolphins are found in tropical/subtropical waters of the Sahul Shelf from northern Australia to the southern waters of the island of New Guinea(Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). In Australia humpback dolphins are thought to be widely distributed along the northern Australian coastline from approximately the Queensland-New South Wales border (31°27´S, 152°55´E) to western Shark Bay, Western Australia (25°51´S, E113°20´E). However, no dedicated wide-scale surveys throughout this range have been conducted and at present, this continuous distribution is inferred primarily from localized studies; strandings, museum records and aerial surveys for other species (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004). Similarly, the extent of their distribution in the southern waters off the island of New Guinea is also still unclear due to the limited amount of marine mammal survey work carried out in this region. Recent surveys in the Kikori Delta region of Papua New Guinea reported a total of 7 groups of humpback dolphins (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014). Photographic records of these animals indicate that they are likely <em>S. sahulensis</em> but genetic studies are needed to solidly clarify which Sousa species occurs off the island of New Guinea. It is also uncertain if the species occurs in the deep waters (~30-90 m depth) over the continental shelf between Australia and Indonesian New Guinea (the Arafura Sea).<br/><br/>Most studies to date indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins occur mostly close to the coast (within 20 km from land) and in relatively sheltered offshore waters near reefs or islands (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Corkeron <em>et al</em>. 1997, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006b). Furthermore, stomach content analyses indicate Australian Humpback Dolphins feed mainly on fishes associated with coastal-estuarine waters (Parra and Jedensjö 2014). As most survey work has been conducted in coastal waters, this apparent coastal distribution and preference for inshore habitats might be biased.<br/><br/>For purposes of this assessment and in line with discussions on the distribution range for <em>S. sahulensis</em> at the IUCN Workshop to Assess/Re-Assess IUCN Red Listings for Indo-Pacific Genera of Coastal Small Cetaceans (San Diego, 20-21 May 2015), we assume Australian Humpback Dolphins occur 1) continuously across northern Australia and southern New Guinea and 2) up to the 30 m isobath (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Material). Given these assumptions we estimate their geographic range to be approximately 562,193 km² comprised of: ~405,091 km² for Australia (QLD: ~202,344 km², NT: ~98,769 and WA: ~ 103,978 km²) and ~157,102 km² for southern New Guinea. The lack of spatial information on the occurrence of Australian Humpback Dolphins throughout their inferred range precludes an accurate estimation of their extent of occurrence (EOO; i.e. area contained within the shortest continuous imaginary boundary which can be drawn to encompass all the known, inferred or projected sites of present occurrence of a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy) and area of occupancy (AOO; i.e. area within its 'extent of occurrence' which is occupied by a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy). Although both EOO and AOO are likely to be significantly less than the geographic range estimated here, the large extent of their potential distribution suggests that their EOO and AOO are very likely to be above 20,000 km².","<p>There is no robust evidence of traditional use for consumption or medicinal use across the Australian humpback dolphin’s geographical range. In the 1960-70s live-captures (at least 8 individuals) took place in Queensland, Australia, for oceanarium displays (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). A female humpback dolphin wild caught in 1968 and currently held at Sea World (Amity) is estimated to be over 48 years of age. Capture for the purposes of public display is no longer permitted under Australian law.</p>",Marine,"<p>As a recently described new species, Australian Humpback Dolphins have not been listed under any national and International listing. Previous conservation assessments as <em>S. chinensis </em>are summarized<em> </em>in Table 2. The most recent assessment of the conservation status of humpback dolphins (as <em>S. chinensis</em> ) in Australia, concluded the species should be listed as Data Deficient (Woinarski<em> et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>In 2012 The Australian Federal Government commissioned a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and conservation status of Australian tropical inshore dolphins (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2012) and a Draft Coordinated Research Strategy to address knowledge gaps and assess their national conservation status (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2012). These reports led to a technical workshop attended by researchers, statisticians and government and indigenous representatives to review the proposed research objectives identified in the draft research strategy, and agree on research priorities that would allow the assessment of the conservation status of Australian inshore dolphins at a national level. The resulting research strategy (DSEWPaC 2013) identified three specific research objectives applicable to Australian snubfin and humpback dolphins: (1) to conduct a broad-scale assessment of their extent of occurrence and area of occupancy (2) to conduct dedicated multi-year studies of their distribution, abundance and habitat use at selected sites across northern Australia with differing levels of threatening processes; and (3) to undertake a spatial and temporal risk assessment of current and projected threatening processes. Sampling and statistical methods to achieve these objectives have been recently described in Brooks<em> et al.</em> (2014). Following these advances, the Australian Federal Government released in 2014 the Whale and Dolphin Protection Plan, which includes a National Dolphin Conservation Plan. This plan aims to guide research and conservation assessment of Australian Humpback Dolphins and snubfin dolphins by supporting research into their ecology and major threats over the next three years.</p>  <p>Multiple-use marine protected areas in Western Australia (e.g. Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef Marine Park), the Northern Territory (e.g. Garig Gunak Barlu), and Queensland (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Dugong Protected Areas; Moreton Bay Marine Park) cover a substantial portion of the known and presumed habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins in Australian waters and may provide some protection for humpback dolphins. To improve the quality of water discharged into the Great Barrier Reef, in 2008, the Australian Government invested $200 million in The Reef Rescue initiative to help farmers in the Great Barrier Reef catchments to improve farming practices to reduce sediment and nutrient run-off.</p>  <p>In Australia, humpback dolphins have also been identified as a conservation value in Commonwealth waters around Australia in the North, North-west and Temperate East Marine bioregional plans (DSEWPaC 2012a, b, c). These plans were developed under section 176 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and are aimed at improving management and decision making in relation to Australian marine biodiversity and resources. Biologically Important Areas (i.e. areas where species of conservation value displays important behaviors such as breeding, foraging, resting and migration) for the conservation of humpback dolphins were identified using available information at the time and expert scientific knowledge about species’ distribution, abundance and behavior in these regions.</p>  National Guidelines for Whale and Dolphin Watching and for interaction with seismic explorations provide some protection for inshore dolphins (DOE 2005, 2008). Strategies to reduce the entanglement and death of Australian Humpback Dolphins in nets set by The Queensland Shark Control Program for protection of bathers include the use of acoustic alarms, mixed use of nets and drumlines, overall reduction in the number of nets, and establishment of mammal rescue squads (DPI 2001, Gribble<em> et al.</em> 1998).",Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

One off incidents may also have affected some populations such as oil spills (D. Simic <em>in litt. </em>2014).&#160;Habitats have been further degraded by the removal of bankside vegetation and changes in hydrology resulting from dam construction, and siltation. Moreover, population declines in areas such as the Sundarbans may be directly or indirectly related to climate change; with the possible effects of climate change including frequent tropical cyclones, a decline in preferred nesting habitat due to lack to suitable trees (effected by salt water intrusion due to sea level rise and reduced freshwater influx), and lower density of prey species due to environmental changes such as saltwater intrusion and cyclone (Chowdhury <em>et al. in prep.</em>). The Sundarbans are further threatened with a proposed 1,320 Megawatt power station to be built 14 km away (Fowlie 2013). Hunting and collection of eggs and chicks have been recorded and although their contribution to population declines is probably minimal this requires clarification<strong> </strong>(Neumann-Denzau 2008); indeed the species is easily caught at the nest making it prey to opportunistic human hunters, with 56% of interviewed fisherman having collected the species (adult, chick or egg) (S. Chowdhury <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","The species appears to have declined dramatically and is now known from comparatively few sites, occurring at low densities everywhere. The population may now number as low as 1,000 individuals (J. C. Eames <em>in litt.</em> 2007), and so is placed in the band 1,000-2,499 individuals. This equates to 667-1,666 mature individuals, rounded here to 600-1,700 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Heliopais personatus</em> is patchily distributed from north-east <strong>India</strong>&#160;and <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, through <strong>Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong>, <strong>Cambodia</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong> to Peninsular <strong>Malaysia</strong>, Sumatra and Java (one record), <strong>Indonesia </strong>(BirdLife International 2001). Populations are apparently in steep decline throughout its range such that its population is now thought to number in the low thousands at most, and possibly fewer than 1,000 mature individuals<strong> </strong>(J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2007). The lastest record from Sumatra dates from 2009, the first sighting in Indonesia for 16 years (M. Iqbal <em>in litt. </em>2016). Elsewhere it continues to be recorded from the Sundarbans of Bangladesh<strong> </strong>(Mansur <em>in litt</em>. 2005) and it was recently recorded in Bharatpur district, India<strong> </strong>(Verma and Mathur 2006);  there are recent records from Cambodia (Goes <em>et al. in prep.</em>), Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia. Kachin state, Myanmar is the least known part of its range; the area probably supports the largest remaining population and it was recorded as still relatively common during wetland surveys in the early 2000s<strong> </strong>(J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2007). Its movements are poorly known; it appears to occur as a migrant in parts of the range, but breeding has been reported recently from Cambodia, Myanmar and Bangladesh<strong> </strong>(Neumann-Denzau 2008), and birds are recorded in most seasons in the Sundarbans and Myanmar. No empirical estimates exist for the current rate of decline, but as a species reliant on undisturbed wetlands declines are anticipated across its range given the pressure on riverine and mangrove habitats. Threats in Myanmar (now assumed to be the species's stronghold) remain largely unknown, but several major river systems that have until now remained in a largely natural state, are now threatened by dam development and heavy immigration<strong> </strong>(W.

97168578,22104,Trichechus senegalensis,Vulnerable,A3cd; C1,2015,2015-07-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is data limited with little new quantitative information since the previous assessment. Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat. We infer a high probability that a 30% or greater reduction in population size will result within a 90 year three generation period (Vulnerable A3cd).<br/><br/>Using survey information from Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Senegal and Cameroon, and inferring what is known about Manatee habitat in other range states and Manatee density data for <em>T. manatus</em>, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 Manatees in Africa. A continuing population decline of at least 10% in a&#160;90 year three generation period,&#160;is anticipated based on continuing and increasing anthropogenic threats (Vulnerable C1).<br/><br/>The African Manatee therefore qualifies for listing as Vulnerable.","<p>West and Central Africa contain a variety of suitable habitats for Manatees ranging from large and small rivers, coastal estuaries, freshwater and saltwater lagoons, shallow quiet coastal bays, lakes and reservoirs. Like <em>T. manatus</em>, <em>T. senegalensis</em> inhabits practically every accessible habitat (Powell 1996, Dodman <em>et al.</em> 2008). They have been observed or recorded from coastal areas, estuarine lagoons, large rivers that range from brackish to fresh water, freshwater lakes and the extreme upper reaches of rivers above cataracts. In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012).

However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A.

These impacts are ongoing and unlikely to be stopped and reversed in the foreseeable future. <br/> <br/>The genetic structure of the species indicates that the populations at various sites are largely isolated and the species thus qualifies as fragmented.  <br/>Population surveys indicate a steep decline in the total number of animals, from 148 animals per hectare of suitable habitat in the 1960s (when suitable habitat comprised hundreds of hectares, thus likely well over 10,000 mature animals) to about 2,500 mature animals in total in 2002-2003; at an estimated generation time of 15 years (by analogy with other <em>Terrapene</em> species and observed growth rates in captivity), this is a reduction of over 70% of mature animals in three generations. The species may also qualify under criterion C1, but more robust population studies are needed to confirm this.","The Cuatro Cienegas basin is an hourglass-shaped intermontane basin of about 50 km long and 8 to 24 km wide (about 600 sq. km), its floor being at 720 m altitude. Much of the central part of the basin is marshy (maximum 60 cm water depth), with dry sandy slopes leading up the rocky valley slopes. Many of the marshes and ponds are spring-fed. A number of deep (up to several metres) ponds occur within the marshy area, and retain crystal-clear water throughout the year. About half the bottom is covered by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (mainly <em>Chara</em>), the other half is bare sediment. Waterlilies grow in the shallow parts, and thick stands of cattails (<em>Typha</em>) and <em>Eleocharis</em> fringe the ponds. Water temp is about 27 to 29°C. Ponds may be separated from dry nesting areas on the slopes by substantial distances (several 100 m) of flat marshy grassland. (Webb and Legler 1960). In contrast to other <em>Terrapene</em> species, <em>T. coahuila</em> is fully aquatic. Within the Cuatro Cienegas basin, <em>T. coahuila</em> occurs mainly in the shallow marshy areas, but has also been encountered in the river and clear deep pools (Dodd 2001).
<br/>
<br/><em>T. coahuila</em> is largely a resident species that does not disperse widely, as indicated by both natural history studies of this aquatic species in a desert environment, and the significant differences in genotypic composition of the populations at different sites in pairwise comparisons, indicating limited gene flow between sites (Howeth in litt. 24 Jan 2007).
<br/>
<br/><em>T. coahuila</em> feeds on almost equal proportions of aquatic and wind-blown insects and their larvae (54%) and plant matter (46%) (review by Dodd 2001).
<br/>
<br/>Male Coahuila box turtles can reach up to 16.8 cm CL, females remain a little smaller (Dodd 2001). The size and age at maturity have apparently not been reported.
<br/>
<br/>Average clutch size in captive animals varies between 3.8 and 5.0, and several clutches are produced per year (Tonge 1987, Cerda and Waugh 1992). The maximum reproductive output per female is about 11 eggs per year, but for about one-third of examined females it is as low as 6.8 eggs/year (Brown 1974 in Dodd 2001).","The Cuatro Cienegas basin has been extensively altered in its hydrology by digging canals and groundwater pumping for local and regional agricultural irrigation, and for drinking water (Howeth in litt 24 Jan 2007, Flores-Villela in litt. 25 Jan 2007, Hendrickson in litt. 27 Feb 2007). The western side of the basin is experiencing particularly rapid aquatic habitat loss; Laguna Grande was completely dry in 2006.  According to current residents of Cuatro Ciénegas, and Dr. Dean Hendrickson, this was the first time anyone had seen it dry (this encompasses at least 50 years, conservatively) (Howeth in litt 24 Jan 2007). <br/> <br/>In 2002, surveys of box turtle sites by a team including Brown (who studied the species 34 years previously) located the marshes where Brown worked in the 1960s. The survey indicates that the species has disappeared from about 40% of its former extent of occurrence, while remaining wetland areas within the area of occurrence have become less suitable (or unsuitable) as habitat for <em>T. coahuila</em> as a result of desiccation and altered vegetation structure (Howeth in litt 24 Jan 2007). <br/> <br/>Roads, railroads, pipelines and other infrastructure for industrial, logistic, tourism and recreational purposes have impacted the ecosystem, and some of these environmental impacts continue. In the last decade it is known there has been tourist development, and farming expansion continues (Reuters 2007). Roads and fires have created direct-mortality impacts (Howeth in litt. 24 Jan 2007). There is a potential threat from the global pet trade (at least partly met by captive breeding, see Conservation Actions). Hybridization is not an issue for <em>T. coahuila</em>, in contrast to its sympatric turtle species.","The only available population estimate is that of Brown (1974), who calculated a density of 148 <em>Terrapene</em> per hectare of marsh during 1964-66. By the beginning of the 1990s it was believed to be uncommon, and a mark-recapture study in 2002-2003 of about two thirds of suitable <em>T. coahuila</em> habitat marked about 750 turtles with 50 to 80% recapture rates, extrapolating to a total population size at the order of about 2,500 adult animals (Howeth in litt. 26 Feb 2007).",Decreasing,"Restricted to the Cuatro Ciénegas basin, Coahuila, Mexico (Iverson 1992, Dodd 2001).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Turtles in general are protected from exploitation under Mexican wildlife and natural resource legislation.

Such development must be managed and their impacts minimized as much as possible. Conservation efforts should be focused on halting habitat loss, especially in the western portion of the basin where the remaining population shows high levels of genetic distinctness (Howeth in litt., 24 Jan 2007). <br/> <br/><em>Ex situ</em> conservation breeding has been sufficiently successful that several zoo assurance colonies now exist, and small numbers of surplus animals have transferred to dedicated hobbyists, eliminating any need for collection and smuggling of wild animals to meet very limited hobbyist demand. <br/> <br/>An updated population status report and further biological research and status monitoring are priority actions.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Adults often undertake considerable spawning migrations. Lake populations migrate to tributaries. Individual females spawn with several males. Males assemble at spawning grounds and follow ripe females, often with much splashing, to shallow riffles. Males may exhibit courting or sneaking tactics in spawning sites. Courting males follow females to spawning site and, during the spawning act, one male swims head to head with the female. Sneaking males, waiting in the spawning site, then join the couple and try to fertilize eggs. Up to 130 males have been reported to be involved in a single spawning act. Females deposit 2-3 portions of non-sticky eggs into excavations made in the gravel. Feeding larvae drift a short distance from spawning site to shallow shoreline habitats.

Though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S. (Maine to Georgia) and several more in Canada (St. Lawrence, St. John). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> occurs in most major river systems from the Mississippi River to the Suwannee River in Florida and in marine waters of the Central and Eastern Gulf of Mexico south to Florida Bay. <br/> <br/>As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. All U.S. Atlantic sturgeon fisheries have been closed since 1997, although Canada maintains active commercial fisheries in the St. Lawrence River and in the Saint John River. The current number of mature individuals most likely numbers considerably more than 10,000. Area of occupancy for this subspecies is very large (&gt;1,500 river km spread over 3,000 km of coastline). Substantial subpopulation mixing may occur, particularly as sub-adults, and re-colonization of seriously depleted stocks may occur from adjacent healthy populations. Throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, sturgeon breeding habitats have been adversely impacted by dams, siltation, channel maintenance (dredging) and water pollution.  Although habitat and water quality concerns still occur in several locations, the vast majority of formerly occupied habitats remain available to this species. The subspecies is assessed as Near Threatened based on past population declines and because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery. <br/> <br/>Records for <em>A. o. desotoi</em> fisheries during the period 1887–1985 indicated that peak Florida harvest occurred in 1900–1902 (124 mt/year) followed by precipitous decline into the 1920s.  From 1923–1971 harvest was fairly stable at about 7 mt per year; declined to 2.3 mt through the 1970s; and fell further to only 0.3 mt until fisheries were closed in 1986 (Barkuloo 1988). <em>A. o. desotoi</em> continues to be threatened by habitat disturbances such as dam construction, dredging, dredge spoil disposal, groundwater extraction, irrigation and other surface water withdrawals, and flow alterations. Contaminants, primarily from industrial sources, also contribute adversely to individual fish health and population declines. With a relatively small and widely scattered population, continued habitat disturbances and contaminant threats, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> is assessed as Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>Overall, the Atlantic sturgeon <em>A. oxyrinchus</em> is considered Near Threatened based on the population declines suffered in the past and uncertainties about overall health of the population and the lengthy time required for recovery.","The Atlantic sturgeon is a large anadromous species. <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> is recorded to live for up to 60 years and reach a size of 4.3 m and 368 kg (Vladykov and Greely 1963), though most mature fish are considerably smaller. Spawning occurs in fresh or slightly brackish water when water temperatures reached 13–18˚C. Migrations into coastal tidal rivers begin as early as February in the southern portion of the range and continue through June and July in northernmost waters. In the mid-Atlantic area, Atlantic sturgeon males mature at 6–10 years and females at 10–20 years (ASMFC 1990). Maturation occurs earlier in southern waters and later in Canada. Spawning periodicity ranges from 2–6 years. Based on tagging studies ocean migrations of up to 1,450 km have been recorded (Dovel and Berggren 1983).","Atlantic sturgeon were an important item of commerce to early American and Canadian colonists and large quantities of meat, roe, oil and isinglass were exported to Europe late 17th and 18th centuries. As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. <br/> <br/>Competition, predation, diseases and parasites were evaluated in the 1998 status review by USFWS-NMFS and determined not to be limiting factors for Atlantic sturgeon stocks. Throughout the 20th century, sturgeon breeding habitats have been adversely impacted by dams, siltation, channel maintenance (dredging) and water pollution. Although habitat and water quality concerns still occur in several locations, the vast majority of formerly occupied habitats remain available to this species. Continued application of existing U.S. laws (e.g., Clean Water Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, etc.) should result in improvements sturgeon breeding and nursery habitats. With management measures in place the current population trend for Atlantic sturgeon is increasing. <br/> <br/><em>A. o. desotoi</em> continues to be threatened by habitat disturbances such as dam construction, dredging, dredge spoil disposal, groundwater extraction, irrigation and other surface water withdrawals, and flow alterations. Contaminants, primarily from industrial sources, also contribute adversely to individual fish health and population declines. Tissue and egg samples of Gulf sturgeon have shown elevated levels of pesticides and heavy metals. Organochlorines such as DDT and its derivatives DDD and/or DDE and toxaphene appear in most samples, sometime in concentrations exceeding U.S. Federal Drug Administration action levels for human consumption. High concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons (both from petroleum products) were detected in most Gulf sturgeon samples from numerous Florida rivers. Arsenic and mercury were detected in 92% and 87% of sturgeon samples and cadmium occurred in 42% of samples (Bateman and Brim 1994).","Atlantic sturgeon were an important item of commerce to early American and Canadian colonists and large quantities of meat, roe, oil and isinglass were exported to Europe late 17th and 18th centuries. As flesh and roe (caviar) gained popularity in North American, the species was heavily exploited, particularly during several decades of the late nineteenth century. The largest fishery was in the Delaware River and Bay which by 1890 supported over 1,000 fishermen and produced 2,300 metric tons of sturgeon product. Several dozen other rivers supported sturgeon fisheries and by the late 1890s, total Atlantic Coast U.S. landings reached 3,200 mt. Severe over-fishing of mature sturgeon in the U.S. led to a crash of the stocks and harvest was reduced by over 90% by the early 1900s and 99% by the 1920s. Throughout the 1970s to mid-1980s, prior to declaration of fishing moratoria, annual U.S. harvest of Atlantic sturgeon ranged from 50–100 mt with most fish being taken from the Hudson River (NY), coastal New Jersey and the Carolinas (ASMFC 1990). <br/> <br/>In 1998, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a comprehensive ""Status Review of Atlantic Sturgeon"" in response to a petition to list this species as threatened or endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The assessment found that, though Atlantic sturgeon populations are currently depressed from historic levels, breeding populations still exist in at least 14 Atlantic Coast rivers in the U. S. (Maine to Georgia) and several more in Canada (St. Lawrence, St. John). The number of mature individuals in this range-wide population was not estimated but most likely it numbers considerably more than 10,000. Area of occupancy is very large (&gt; 1,500 river km spread over 3,000 km of coastline).  Substantial subpopulation mixing may occur, particularly as sub-adults, and recolonization of seriously depleted stocks may occur from adjacent healthy populations.   <br/> <br/><em>A. o. desotoi</em> population estimates have been completed for the Apalachicola, Suwannee, Yellow and Choctawhatchee rivers in Florida, Pascagoula River in Mississippi, and the Pearl and Bogue Chitto rivers in Louisiana and Mississippi. The Suwannee River supports the most viable subpopulation among coastal rivers of the Gulf of Mexico and was estimated at 7,650 individuals older than age two (Sulak and Clugston 1999). The subpopulation estimate for Gulf sturgeon older than age two in the Choctawhatchee River ranges from 1,700–3,000 fish, while subpopulation estimates  in the Apalachicola, Pascagoula and Pearl rivers range from 50–350 fish (Lorio 2000). The number of mature individuals in this range wide population were not estimated but most likely number less than 10,000. Eggs and larvae of Gulf sturgeon have been collected in the Bouie, Escambia/Conecuh, Choctawatchee, Apalachicola and Suwanee rivers (Critical Habitat Ruling). <br/> <br/>Stabile <em>et al</em>. (1996) analyzed <em>A. o. desotoi</em> subpopulations from eight drainages along the Gulf of Mexico for genetic diversity. They noted significant differences among Gulf sturgeon stocks and suggested they displayed region-specific affinities and may exhibit river-specific fidelity. These authors identified five regional or river-specific stocks: (1) Lake Ponchartrain and Pearl River; (2) Pascagoula River; (3) Escambia and Yellow rivers; (4) Choctawhatchee River; and (5) Apalachicola, Ochlockonee, and Suwannee rivers.",Increasing,"<em>A. oxyrinchus</em> occurs in the Atlantic coastal waters of Canada and the United States with spawning rivers in both countries. <br/> <br/><em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> historically ranged along the Canadian and U.S. Atlantic Coast from Labrador to Florida.

Though the subspecies was previously listed as also occurring in Mexico, a review of the literature fails to support that contention. A single ""sturgeon"" was reported seen (but not captured) in the Rio Grande River which separates Texas and Mexico. The Gulf sturgeon’s current area of occupancy is spread over 2,500+ river km and 1,500+ km of coastline. However, construction of dams, sills and other water control structures throughout the 20th century severely restricted inland migrations of Gulf sturgeon in many waterways from St. Andrew Bay to the Bogue Chitto River. <br/> <br/>For more information see <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer"">NatureServe’s Explorer database</a>.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"All U.S. Atlantic sturgeon fisheries have been closed since 1997. Canada maintains active commercial fisheries in the St. Lawrence River (Quebec) for subadults of <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em>, and in the Saint John River (New Brunswick) for larger fish. Also, a single fisherman is licensed on the Shubenacadie River in Nova Scotia. The St. Lawrence fishery was limited in 1997 to a quota of 6,015 fish - about 60 tons (Caron and Trembly 1997). Other regulations here include a maximum size limit of 1.5 m during a season extending from 1 May to 30 September. <br/> <br/>Peak landings on the Saint John River were 44 metric tones (mt) in 1988 but have declined in recent years to 10–14 mt. Only nine licensed fishermen remained in the St. John fishery in 1997. They were authorized to fish no more than 2,800 m of gill net with minimum mesh size of 33 cm. Minimum allowable size of sturgeon on the St. John is 120 cm and the season is closed during 1–30 June to protect spawners. Canadian authorities have expressed to U.S. authorities that these harvest levels are sustainable and do not damage the stocks (USFWS and NMFS 1998). A private aquaculture activity also occurs in New Brunswick with eggs and progeny produced from wild-caught adult sturgeon. Except for a few hundred live juveniles, most international trade in <em>A. o. oxyrinchus</em> in the late 1990s has been meat (2–34 mt/year) from Canada to the U.S. (CITES data). <br/> <br/>No commercial or sport fishing for Atlantic sturgeon is allowed in territorial waters of the U.S. Atlantic Coast. The management authority for this species is the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and their amendment to the 1990 Fishery Management Plan (ASMFC 1998) requires (1) no possession allowed in the 15 Atlantic states until at least 20 year-classes reach breeding age (30–40 years); (2) annual reporting of by-catch and by-catch mortality; (3) urges habitat monitoring and improvements as well as research and genetics analysis; and (4) places certain restrictions on sturgeon culture for market production and restocking.  In addition to the ASMFC action, the Secretary of Commerce has closed all U.S. Atlantic coastal EEZ waters to harvest of Atlantic sturgeon. <br/> <br/>The recent USFWS-NMFS joint status review for Atlantic sturgeon determined that listing this species as threatened or endangered under the U.S. ESA is not warranted at this time. Atlantic sturgeon are widespread and several subpopulations could be considered relatively abundant. However, because of uncertainties about overall stock health and the lengthy time required for population recovery, USFWS has designated Atlantic sturgeon as a ""candidate species"" for possible future ESA listing and NMFS lists it as a ""species of concern"". <br/> <br/>In 1991, <em>A. o. desotoi</em> was listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Since then considerable work has been accomplished to better define life history and behavior and to determine habitats important to each life stage, population status, genetic assessment and fish culture. A recovery and management plan for Gulf sturgeon was completed in 1995 (USFWS and GSMFC 1995). This plan identifies state and federal actions necessary to rebuild populations to levels that would allow de-listing of the subspecies. In 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service officially designated ""critical habitat"" for this species, including 2,783 river kilometers and 6,042 square km of estuarine and marine habitat. <br/> <br/>With federal protection under the ESA and intensive permitting and consultation requirements for all water-related projects and discharges - especially in areas designated to be critical habitat - it is believed that <em>A. o. desotoi</em> population declines will be halted and reversed.<br/><br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The Gulf is also at risk from potential oil spills from shipping tankers, which can result in a dramatic loss of marine habitats (Mancy 1993).","To date there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for <em>S. safina</em>, and the species is only known from its type locality.

This produced a severe bottleneck that significantly reduced genetic variability. For most of the twentieth century, numbers continued to decline mostly as a consequence of human invasion of habitat and adverse fishing interactions. This resulted in the fragmentation of the species into many subpopulations and the disappearance of several of them. There is evidence for recent small increases in Mediterranean Monk Seals at each of the main three identified subpopulations, but their numbers remain very small. The number of mature individuals in the eastern Mediterranean (the largest subpopulation) is likely fewer than 250, and 100-200 occurring in the other known subpopulations.<br/><br/>Monk Seals continue to be exposed to a number of substantial threats, including habitat loss and deterioration, displacement and persecution. Unpredictable threats from disease and toxic algal blooms (red tides) also pose a threat to the remaining small population, as exemplified by the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco when more than 200 animals died in one mass-mortality event in 1997.<br/><br/>With the advantage of new data being available for this species, it is now thought that the previous assessment (Critically Endangered A2abc: Aguilar and Lowry 2008) was an overestimate of the scale of decline in the global population over the previous 33 years, since most of the reduction in population size likely happened more than three generations ago. Endangered (EN C2a(i)) would have been a more appropriate assessment at that time. It is clear that the population size has been reduced to below the IUCN threshold for EN under criterion C: currently the population contains 350-450 mature individuals, with less than 250 mature animals in the largest subpopulation. There is evidence of recent small increases in each of the main three subpopulations, however it is not clear when this increasing trend began or whether this trend is likely to continue into the future. Continuing decline in population size is therefore retained as a precautionary approach for this assessment. It is important to monitor the situation over the next five years to establish whether the population is genuinely increasing and whether this increase is likely to continue into the future. Maintaining and adding to conservation measures that are already in place for this species will help to secure its future. The species is here listed as Endangered (EN C2a(i)), and reassessment of its status in five years’ time is recommended.","Mediterranean Monk Seals are medium-sized phocids that reach 2.3-2.8 m in length (Gilmartin and Forcada 2002). Based on seals examined after a mass mortality at Cabo Blanco, average adult lengths were estimated at 2.42 m in females and 2.51 m in males. Pups up to 3 months of age averaged 1.08 m with a range of 0.74-1.38 m (Samaranch and Gonzalez 2000). In the eastern Mediterranean, newborn pups averaged 102.6 cm in length (i.e., total length from the snout to the end of the hind flippers; N = 8, SD = 10.74) and 15.5 kg in weight (N = 3, SD = 1.5; Dendrinos 2011). Adults weigh from 240-300 kg, and newborns 15-26 kg (Boulva 1979, Gilmartin and Forcada 2002), with records of a male reaching 400 kg and a pregnant female reaching 302 kg (Sergeant <em>et al</em>. 1978).<br/><br/>Adult females moult an average of 134 days after parturition, and sometimes begin the moult prior weaning their pup (Pastor and Aguilar 2003). In males, the process of developing the mature pelage pattern is gradual; it involves at least two annual moults and can be completed by the age of 4 years (Badosa <em>et al</em>. 2006). Mediterranean Monk Seal pups at the Cabo Blanco region moult on average 64 days after birth in the case of females and on average 82 days in the case of males; the molt occurs partly in the water and takes an average of 15 days to be completed (Badosa <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the eastern Mediterranean in contrast the first molt occurred 19-57 days postpartum (N = 16; Mean 37.5 days, SD = 9.85; Dendrinos 2011).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals once hauled out on open beaches (Johnson and Lavigne 1999b, Johnson 2004) but today they use marine caves with sea entrances for hauling out, resting and pupping throughout their range. In recent years in areas where conservation measures are in place and/or human activity is low, such as the protected areas at Cabo Blanco (Gilmartin and Forcada 2002, Fernandez de Larrinoa <em>et al</em>. 2007, P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.), the Desertas Islands Nature Reserve (Pires and Neves 2000) and the island of Gyaros (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2008), Monk Seals are frequently observed to haul out on open beaches. On some occasions even births on open beaches have been recorded in these areas.<br/><br/>Most marine caves used by Mediterranean Monk Seals for resting and pupping possess a set of common geophysical characteristics, that include an entrance above or below water level, an entrance corridor, and a dry surface/area, where the seals haul out (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2007b). Seal preferences regarding the use of a cave as a resting or pupping site are influenced by these parameters (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2004). Cave selection (i.e., usage frequency and intensity) may also be influenced by changes in the internal morphology of a cave, as has been seen to occur at Cabo Blanco (González <em>et al</em>. 1997) or the state of the tide (only in the Atlantic populations, as tides in the Mediterranean are negligible) (Pires <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>A major difference in the terrestrial habitat of Mediterranean Monk Seals occupying the area of Cabo Blanco and the rest of their range is the number of marine caves used by the species. Whereas in Cabo Blanco, the entire Monk Seal population uses a small number (&lt;5) of marine caves for resting and pupping (Marchessaux and Muller 1987, Francour <em>et al</em>. 1990, González <em>et al</em>. 1997, Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012) in the archipelago of Madeira (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2004) and in the eastern Mediterranean this number is much higher (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004; MOm 2007, 2008, 2009). In a study that covered 250 km of coastline inhabited by Monk Seals in the Cilician Basin region of southern Turkey, 282 caves were searched. Of these, 39 showed evidence of Monk Seals, including three that were used for pupping and 16 that were actively being used at the time of the survey (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004). Similarly, in Greece more than 500 caves have been found to be occupied by the species and more than 100 to be used for pupping (MOm 2007, 2008, 2009). Monk Seal activity in the marine caves in the eastern Mediterranean is highest in autumn and winter and coincides with the pupping season of the species (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004, Dendrinos 2011).<br/><br/>In the Cabo Blanco region prior to the mass die off in 1997, most pups were born from summer to early winter, with a small peak of births in October; 84% of the births took place in only two caves separated by 1.1 km (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 1999, Pastor and Aguilar 2003). Following the mass die-off a change in the reproductive parameters of the colony was registered (González <em>et al</em>. 2002): currently births are recorded from April to November, with a clear peak in September (Cedenilla <em>et al</em>. 2007). In all other parts of the species range, pupping appears to be even more synchronous. In the archipelago of Madeira most pups have been recorded in the months October and November (i.e., 38 out of 48 recorded from 1989 to 2012; Pires <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. Pires pers. comm). The same pupping season was recorded for 11 pups born at Turkey’s Cilician Basin and for more than 220 pups born in Greece from 1990 to 2014 (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1999; Dendrinos 2011).<br/><br/>Pups begin to catch fish toward the end of their lactation period (Pastor and Aguilar 2003). Pups are weaned when they are about four months old, with up to five months reported (Pastor and Aguilar 2003, Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fostering and milk stealing are not uncommon and have been recorded at Cabo Blanco (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2007), Madeira (Pires 2004), and in Greece (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2012). At the Cabo Blanco colony, in 26.6% of the suckling episodes observed in mother–pup pairs of known identity, pups suckled from females other than their mothers. Some females nursed more than one pup, at least occasionally, and in some cases a pup was fostered long-term by an unrelated female (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Pups enter the water and begin diving during their first week and from that point onwards spend 55-74% of their time at sea (Dendrinos 2011). Three pups tagged with time depth recorders spent more time at sea and diving at night than during the day; most dives were to the bottom for relatively long periods, probably indicating foraging. The mean depth of dive was 11.6 m and its mean length was 149 seconds (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the Northern Sporades Islands in Greece, two rehabilitated weaned pups dived on average to greater depths and even managed to dive to a depth of 200 m (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2007a).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is 11.2 years (Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Female Mediterranean Monk Seals probably become sexually mature at 3-4 years of age. One female at Cabo Blanco became pregnant at 2.1 years and gave birth at 3.1 years, the youngest age known for this species (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). Females can give birth in successive years. Although birthing is not strictly seasonal, individual females have been documented to give birth close to the same time in successive years, within a 15 day span (Pastor and Aguilar 2003). The annual reproductive rate in Mediterranean Monk Seals at Cabo Blanco prior to the mass die-off was extremely low, at 0.25-0.43 pups to each sexually mature female (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2000). Since the mass die-off event the population appears to be recovering and currently annual reproductive rates average 0.76 pups/adult female (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). Females caring for pups will go to sea to feed for up to 17 hours, with an average time of 9 hours (Gazo and Aguilar 2005). Females tend to forage longer further into nursing.<br/><br/>Prior to the mass mortality event, pup survival at Cabo Blanco was extremely low; just under 50% of the pups born annually managed to survive their first two months, and most mortalities occurred in the first two weeks. This very low survival rate was associated with mortality caused by severe storms, and high swells and tides, but impoverished genetic variability and inbreeding might also have been factors (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 2000). Currently, annual pup survival has increased considerably and numbers 65% (54-76%, depending on weather conditions; P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). In Greece annual pup survival appears to be even higher (Dendrinos 2011); this is most likely due to the fact that lactating females and their pups have a higher number of suitable caves to choose from when seeking refuge from severe weather conditions.<br/><br/>Compared to most other pinnipeds, little is known about the diving capacities and behavior of Mediterranean Monk Seals. The maximum depth and duration of diving for one lactating female were 78 m and 15 minutes, respectively (Gazo and Aguilar 2005) and 100 m for an adult male (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). However, diving behaviour of Monk Seals at Cabo Blanco appears to be constricted by the topographic features of the marine environment in the region, as Monk Seals in the Mediterranean Sea (which is much deeper than the Cabo Blanco region) have been recorded to dive much deeper. Maximum dive depths for a rehabilitated male and a female juvenile Monk Seal were 196 m (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2007a) and 205 m (MOm unpublished data), respectively. Neves (1998) observed two types of diving in shallow near-shore waters, which are thought to be associated with “spot resting” and “transit feeding”. When “spot resting”, seals dove as though headed into a current for 8-12 minutes, surfaced at about the same location, and usually repeated this pattern for approximately three hours. Underwater observations by divers indicate that while doing this seals rest at the bottom of the sea (R. Pires pers. comm). Transit feeding dives lasted 5-7 minutes, during which the seal moved continuously along a shoreline apparently foraging. A similar behaviour has been observed in Turkey, where adult Monk Seals dove for approximately 6.5 minutes and rested at the surface for approximately one minute (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2002). Monk seals in the eastern Mediterranean have been recorded to travel long distances, for example ~288 km in three months with a maximum straight distance travelled of ~78 km (Adamantopoulou <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Stomach content analysis of dead Monk Seals has revealed that they have a heterogeneous diet consisting of bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. In Greece, Monk Seals are known to eat more than 70 prey species (50% cephalopods, 48% fishes, 1.5% non-cephalopod molluscs, 0.4% crustaceans; Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011). The common octopus (<em>Octopus vulgari</em>s ~34%) and bony fish from the family Sparidae (~28%) were identified in Monk Seal stomachs most frequently (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the Atlantic, at the Desertas Islands off Madeira, visual observations of Monk Seals with prey at the surface included seals eating Golden-grey Mullet (<em>Liza aurata</em>), Parrot Fish (<em>Sparisoma cretense</em>), Barred Hogfish (<em>Bodianus scrofa</em>), Salema (<em>Sarpa salpa</em>), Cuttlefish (<em>Sepia officinalis</em>) and Crabs (<em>Pachygrapsus</em> spp.). Other prey reported includes Eels (<em>Anguilla</em> spp.), Limpets (<em>Patella</em> spp.) and Rays (<em>Raja</em> spp.) (Neves 1998). In Cabo Blanco, stomach content analyses indicated that 71.3% of prey items by weight were cephalopods and 68.3% were Octopus. Fish species were mainly from the families Sparidae, Scianidae and Haemulidae (Muñoz Cañas <em>et al</em>. 2012). Collectively, results from stomach content (Marchessaux 1989, Neves 1998, Salman <em>et al</em>. 2001, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011, Muñoz Cañas <em>et al</em>. 2012) and stable isotope analyses (Pinela <em>et al</em>. 2010, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2014b) studies suggest that Monk Seals forage primarily on the continental shelf along the coast.","The Mediterranean Monk Seal is one of the most endangered pinniped species, and one of the most endangered Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) mammals on Earth (Isaac <em>et al</em>. 2007, <a href=""http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=27"">EDGE</a> web site).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals have a long history of interaction with humans that includes exploitation for subsistence needs, commercial harvest, and persecution as a competitor for fisheries resources or because it produced actual and perceived damage to fishing gear (Johnson and Lavigne 1999b, Stringer <em>et al</em>. 2008). Once abundant, Monk Seals were written about and illustrated in the literature and depictions of classical antiquity (Johnson 2004). Along the coast of northwest Africa, they became the target of a commercial harvest for skins and oil by the Portuguese as early as the 15th century (Isräels 1992).<br/><br/>Reasons for population decline declines in the 20th century include: increased human pressure displacing seals from their habitat; destruction/alteration of suitable habitat; continued mortality due to deliberate aggression by fishermen to eliminate a competitor, even in countries and areas where the species is legally protected; fisheries by-catch; and a mass die-off at the Cabo Blanco Monk Seal colony.<br/><br/>Habitat deterioration, destruction, and fragmentation have played a significant role in the plight of the Mediterranean Monk Seal. Once an open beach dweller, the species has been persecuted by humans for centuries and forced to occupy increasingly marginal habitat. The gradual process from occupying open beaches to being displaced and forced into increasingly marginal habitat (i.e., smaller and more unsuitable marine caves) has been thoroughly documented (Johnson and Lavigne 1999a). This threat is still in place today, particularly in the eastern Mediterranean (MOm 2007, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013). An alarming decline in pupping success has been recorded in the most important pupping location of the species in southern Turkey (where up to seven pup births have been recorded) due to increased human activity (i.e., industrial development, including the construction of a thermal and nuclear power plant and a marine terminal). Critical Monk Seal habitat has been affected by increased tourism activities throughout Turkey, even in protected areas such as the Olympos Beydagları National Park, and the Kas, Kekova Specially Protected Area. Tourists and scuba divers in these areas appear to frequently visit Monk Seal shelters. Although some resting activity of Mediterranean Monk Seals continues, no pupping activity has been recorded in these caves (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2009). With human populations and coastal activities increasing around the Mediterranean, so do potential threats to the species habitat.<br/><br/>Interactions with fisheries are of great conservation concern, throughout the species range (Güçlüsoy and Savas 2003, Güçlüsoy 2008, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hale <em>et al</em>. 2011, González and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2013). Deliberate killing of Monk Seals mainly by fishermen was responsible for one-third of all mortalities of 79 stranded animals in Greece (1991-1995) and is considered the single most important source of mortality for this species in the eastern Mediterranean (Androukaki <em>et al</em>. 1999). Deliberate killing, hunting, and capturing live animals for exhibition purposes were the main cause for the population reduction of the species in Turkey until 1980 (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals have been entangled in a wide variety of fishing gear including set-nets, trawl nets, and long-lines (Johnson and Karamanlidis 2000) and entanglement remains a major source of mortality in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, especially for sub-adult animals (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013). Adverse fishing interactions are also considered as one of the probable causes for the lack of recovery of the Cabo Blanco population after commercial sealing ended in the region. Currently, illegal industrial and artisanal fishing is one of the main threats to the survival of the colony, mainly for sub-adult seals (González and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2013). In comparison, the effect of negative seal-fisheries interactions in the archipelago of Madeira is considered to be lower. Traps, purse seines, and illegally used gill nets are the main fishing gear posing a threat to the species in the region (Hale <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, concurrent with the recent expansion of the species’ range to the island of Madeira, signs of animosity towards the species by fishermen have been recorded, that potentially could pose a future threat (R. Pires pers. comm).<br/><br/>A <em>Morbillivirus</em> was isolated from Mediterranean Monk Seals after the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco in 1997. The virus most closely resembled a Dolphin <em>Morbillivirus</em> that was previously implicated in the 1991 mass mortality of Striped Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea (Osterhaus <em>et al</em>. 1992, van de Bildt <em>et al</em>. 1999). However, although this virus was already circulating in Monk Seals prior to the mass mortality, there is some doubt as to whether it was responsible for the deaths that occurred. Indeed, the active virus was found in pups that went into a rehabilitation center because their mothers had died, and none of them showed clinical signs and all survived the event without specific treatment. Dinoflagellate-produced saxitoxins were found in tissues from animals that died during the die-off and the suddenness of death of the animals and the general clinical symptoms suggest that the cause of death was from the toxins rather than a <em>Morbillivirus</em> epidemic (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1998). Toxic algal blooms (red tides) are favored by oceanographic conditions near Cabo Blanco and were reported from nearby Morocco during a 25-year period leading up to the mass mortality. Toxic algal blooms are unpredictable and following the catastrophic loss of Monk Seals in 1997 must be considered a serious threat to the species in the region (Reyero <em>et al</em>. 2000, UNEP 2005).<br/><br/>Potentially, limited availability of food sources, genetic inbreeding, and pollution could constitute a threat to the survival of the species. Currently, not enough information is available to fully evaluate the magnitude of these threats, however there is no indication that they are significantly affecting the population at present.<br/><br/>In southern Turkey an important monk seal colony almost disappeared in the 1990s, when industrial-scale fishing in the area reduced the available fish sources and negative interactions of artisanal fishermen with monk seals (i.e., deliberate killings) increased. However, a series of regulations enforced to protect fish sources alleviated the problems and helped the local monk seal population to resume pupping in the area (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Genetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2007, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2014a) have shown that, as a consequence of severe population bottlenecks and population/habitat fragmentation, all sub-populations have suffered a dramatic decrease in genetic variability over the last few centuries. The genetic diversity of Mediterranean Monk Seals is among the lowest found in pinnipeds; it is comparable to Hawaiian Monk Seals and Northern Elephant Seals. The potential consequences of the loss of genetic variability and genetic inbreeding are still hard to evaluate for the Mediterranean Monk Seal, however potential consequences of genetic inbreeding include congenital defects leading to stillborn pups, something that has been recorded in several small Monk Seal populations (Bareham and Furreddu 1975, Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2004, MOm, unpublished data). Additionally, low fitness and increased susceptibility to disease may be an effect of genetic erosion that can compromise a population and lead to extinction.<br/><br/>Contaminant burdens have always been suspected to be a threat to the Mediterranean Monk Seal and thus monitoring pollutants has been considered a high priority (Boulva 1979, Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, information is only available on organochlorine pollutants, which were analysed in the blubber of individuals collected during the 1990s from the Cabo Blanco and the Greek subpopulations. Residue levels were found to be very low in the former subpopulation and moderate to high in the latter (Yediler <em>et al</em>. 1993; Borrell <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2007); currently, efforts are underway to more fully evaluate the effects of pollution on the Mediterranean Monk Seal through the analysis of more recent samples from the eastern Mediterranean (Marsili <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zaccaroni <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals are at an unknown, but suspected high, level of risk from oil tanker and other ship accidents, spills, and groundings. This results from increased tanker traffic in the area, and a greater chance for accidents, disturbance, and collisions near important habitat. Four accidents or spills have occurred near Monk Seal habitat in the recent past, including a supertanker that spilled oil off Morocco in 1989 (Isräels 1992), an oil spill in the Madeira Islands in 1990 (UNEP 2005), and the grounding of a bulk carrier near Cabo Blanco in 2003 (UNEP 2005). None of these spills or accidents had any known impacts on Monk Seals, but they highlight the threat of significant impacts from a major maritime accident near an important Monk Seal site (UNEP 2005). In contrast, a ship accident that occurred at Çavuş Island near Bodrum in southwest Turkey in 1996 directly affected Monk Seals and their habitat (Kiraç 1998). A clean-up operation lasting until 1997 effectively restored the habitat to its original quality. In response to this accident regulatory measures have been taken in Turkey to reduce the threat from oil spills (Kiraç and Guclusoy 2007).<br/><br/>More recently, the arrival of Lessepsian fishes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, such as the toxic Pufferfish (<em>Lagocephalus sceleratus</em>), could have a negative impact on Monk Seals in the region. The Pufferfish has been implicated in the death of a Monk Seal at Cyprus (A. Gücü pers. comm). Additional risks to Mediterranean Monk Seals come from political instability in some parts of their range, the challenge of implementing effective conservation for a species in a complex multi-national environment, weak enforcement of agreements and international laws, collapse of occupied pupping caves, and reduction of the carrying capacity of the environment as a consequence of fishing overexploitation (Aguilar 1999).","The once abundant Mediterranean Monk Seal has disappeared from most of its former range, with the majority of the decline in the global population seen over the last century having occurred more than three generations ago.<br/><br/>Conservation measures introduced over the last 30 years have helped to stem the decline, and there is now evidence of recent small increases in all known subpopulations. However at present it is not clear whether these increases are likely to continue into the future. The Mediterranean Monk Seal population remains very small and still faces many threats (see the Threats section below). It is regarded as one of the most endangered pinniped species in the  world, with approximately 600-700 animals in the population (an estimated 350-450 of these are mature individuals). The population has also been fragmented into 3–4 subpopulations:<br/><ul><li>The largest subpopulation is located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and numbers 350-450 individuals (including mature and immature individuals). It is estimated that 300–400 live in Greece (MOm 2007, 2008, 2009) and about 100 in Turkey (Güçlüsoy <em>et al</em>. 2004). Based on data from the closest extant relative of the Mediterranean Monk Seal (i.e., the Hawaiian Monk Seal) the number of mature individuals in the eastern Mediterranean is likely fewer than 250.</li></ul><ul><li>Approximately 220 seals currently inhabit the second largest subpopulation at the Cabo Blanco area. Recent monitoring efforts have individually identified at least 116 adult and sub-adult Monk Seals in this subpopulation (i.e., &gt;3 years old; Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012). Maximum counts of seals hauled-out at one time was 146 in 2009, and 159 individual adult seals were identified at the end of 2013 (CBD Habitat, P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm). In the early 1990s this subpopulation was estimated at about 317 seals but a mass mortality event in 1997 reduced numbers to nearly a third (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1999, Forcada and Aguilar 2000). Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated that there were 85 adult seals at Cabo Blanco in 2007.</li></ul><ul><li>The third subpopulation is located in the archipelago of Madeira and numbers approximately 40 seals (Pires <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. Pires pers. comm). Once restricted to the remote Desertas Islands (Neves and Pires 1999), Monk Seals have recently recolonized the main island of Madeira (Pires 2011), where suitable habitat for the species still exists (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2003). There are even strong indications of pupping on the island (R. Pires pers. comm).</li></ul><ul><li>The number of Mediterranean Monk Seals that might still survive at the Mediterranean coasts of eastern Morocco (and perhaps Algeria) is unknown (Mo <em>et al</em>. 2011).</li></ul>The subpopulations at Cabo Blanco in the Atlantic (Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012) and at the island of Gyaros in the eastern Mediterranean (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2013) are the only large extant aggregations of the species that still preserve the structure of a colony; the other subpopulations in the eastern Mediterranean are composed of loose groups of extremely reduced size (usually less than 20 individuals).<br/><br/>Monk Seals continue to be exposed to a number of substantial threats, as exemplified by the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco when more than 200 animals died in one mass-mortality event in 1997 (Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012). Such unpredictable threats could rapidly impact any or all of the subpopulations in future.",Increasing,"Mediterranean Monk Seals were once widely and continuously distributed in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and in the North Atlantic waters from Morocco to Cabo Blanco, including the Canary Islands, Madeira Islands and the Azores (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2006). A few individuals have been recorded in Senegal, the Gambia and the Cape Verde Islands at the southern end, as well as in Portugal and Atlantic France at the northern end of the species' distribution (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2006), but the origin of these individuals is unknown.<br/><br/>Today the distribution of the Mediterranean Monk Seal is highly fragmented and consists of 3–4 isolated subpopulations. In the Mediterranean Sea, the stronghold of the species is at islands in the Ionian and Aegean Seas (Adamantopoulou <em>et al</em>. 1999), and along the coasts of mainland Greece, Cyprus, and western and southern Turkey (Güçlüsoy <em>et al</em>. 2004; Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009; MOm 2007; Nikolaou pers. comm). In the Turkish Black Sea, Mediterranean Monk Seals are believed to be extinct since 1997 (Kiraç and Savas 1996, Kiraç 2011); some individuals still survive in the Sea of Marmara (Inanmaz <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the North Atlantic, two subpopulations exist: one at Cabo Blanco (also known as Cap Blanc) at the border of Mauritania and Western Sahara (Gonzáles and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2012, Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012), and one at the Archipelago of Madeira (Pires <em>et al</em>. 2008). An unknown number of Monk Seals might still survive at the Mediterranean coasts of eastern Morocco (and perhaps Algeria) (Mo <em>et al</em>. 2011), but without ongoing systematic monitoring and conservation actions the status and fate of this subpopulation is in question.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence for Mediterranean Monk seals is approximately 5,000,000 km² and the area of occupancy is 315,000 km².","In the past, Mediterranean Monk Seals were hunted by humans for their fur, oil, meat and for medicinal use. Evidence suggests that the species was severely depleted during the Roman era (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2006). Today there is no commercial exploitation of this species.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Mediterranean Monk Seal is legally protected throughout its range through numerous national laws and regional and international treaties, as well as European Union regulations. Legislative measures and research, management, and conservation actions to effectively protect important Mediterranean Monk Seal populations are currently in place in the following areas: the Desertas Islands Nature Reserve in the Madeira Archipelago, the National Marine Park of Alonnisos, Northern Sporades Islands, the marine protected area in Northern Karpathos–Saria and the 3-mile no-take zone at the Island of Gyaros in Greece, the no-fishing area of the Cap Blanc Peninsula and the participative reserve that has been created to protect the pupping caves of the Cabo Blanco Monk Seal population. In Turkey similar actions are carried out in five coastal locations in the country: Foça, Karaburun, Alaçatı-Sigacik, the Bodrum Peninsula, and the Cilician coasts (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Additionally, the species is explicitly mentioned in 102 Natura 2000 sites within the European Union (82 sites in Greece, 10 in Italy, five in Spain, three in Portugal, and two in Cyprus). According to the Council’s Directive 92/43EEC “on the conservation of natural habitats of wild fauna and flora” the Mediterranean Monk Seal is considered as a species of community importance. Based on the above Directive, Natura 2000 sites are legally considered by EU member states as Protected Areas.<br/><br/>Throughout the range of the species, widespread action has been taken to sensitize the local human population towards Monk Seal conservation, to protect breeding caves, to restrict fishing gear and relocate the most adverse fishing practices, to develop monitoring programs and intervention protocols, and to increase on-site capability to rehabilitate sick and injured individuals, particularly pups. Numerous agreements, conventions, and treaties (on a regional, national, and international level) are in force to protect Monk Seals, and many workshops and conferences have brought together scientists and managers to discuss Monk Seal conservation issues and problems. Furthermore, numerous international bodies and fora, including the Regional Activity Center for Specially Protected Areas and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, have put forward initiatives and proposals in order to ameliorate existing threats and mitigate pressures from relevant sectors (i.e., fisheries, bycatch, etc.). Isräels (1992) summarized 30 years of this conservation history, and provided details on accomplishments and failures to meet objectives. Currently, there is a UNEP/Mediterranean Action Plan (first issued in 1978 and revised in 1988) in force for the conservation and management of Monk Seals in the Mediterranean and an Action Plan for the recovery of the Monk Seal in the eastern Atlantic under the Migratory Species of Wild Animals Convention (Bonn Convention) (González <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the context of the plan a list of actions have been implemented, such as the establishment of mechanisms to coordinate and finance the conservation, the population monitoring and study, habitat protection and environmental education.<br/><br/>In Greece, the “National strategy and action plan for the conservation of the Mediterranean Monk Seal in Greece, 2009-2015” (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2009) describes in detail actions that have to be carried out in the country by 2015 in order to safeguard the future of the species. Similarly, in Turkey the National Monk Seal Committee has drafted a “National Action Plan for the Conservation of Mediterranean Monk Seal <em>Monachus monachus</em> in Turkey” that has been approved by the Turkish Ministry of Forest and Water Works (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Recently a new Regional Strategy for the Conservation of the Mediterranean Monk Seal has been adopted also by the UNEP parties (Notarbartolo di Sciara 2013).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is therefore listed as Endangered. This species may warrant a downlisting in the future but this will depend on a robust understanding of the threats on the status of the breeding population.","It breeds below c.900 m in mountainous areas, along clear flowing rivers with tall riverine forest, mainly within the temperate conifer-broadleaf forest zone. It is largely confined to primary forests, with an abundance of potential nest-holes. During a study on the Russian breeding grounds, river size, mountain slope, human population, estimated forest cover and water clarity all failed to explain the observed distribution, but the species showed a marked preference for the middle reaches of rivers (Solovieva <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). On passage and in winter it feeds along large rivers and tracking of several birds over multiple years suggests winter site fidelity (Barter <em>et al. </em>2015). Flocks of up to 20 individuals have been noted on passage or in winter (Duckworth and Chol 2005). In Russia, they moult on a range of water bodies within the breeding range and north and east of breeding range, including rivers, estuaries and the sea&#160;but the stable isotope analysis confirmed that the species is predominately confined to freshwater habitat&#160;(Solovyeva&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2014b). A satellite tracking study of individuals breeding in the Lesser Xingan Mountains&#160;found migration to last on average 42 days, stopping at several sites on route. This study was however based on a very small sample size and so may not necessarily be representative of the population as a whole (Dong-Ping <em>et al.</em> 2014). &#160;<p></p>","In the 1960s and 1970s, its decline in Russia coincided with economic development of the taiga. Primary forests in the valleys of all large rivers were greatly altered, but large-scale deforestation in river valleys is now prohibited; however, the new Russian Forest Codex (2007) requires a water protection zone (no deforestation) of only 100 m for large rivers (50 m on each side), and 50 m (25 m each side) for rivers shorter that 100 km, which is likely to significantly reduce suitable breeding habitat for this species, which nests up to 150 m from rivers (D. Solovieva <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008). Logging of river sources and adjacent slopes has led to reduced spring water levels and changes in fish abundance; since logging began on the Avvakumovka River in 2004, spring water levels and merganser populations have undergone continuous declines (D. Solovieva <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008). Other major threats within the breeding range include illegal hunting (Solovyera 2013), drowning in fishing nets (a major cause of mortality at Russian breeding sites in 2003-2007 [D. Solovieva <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008]), disturbance from motor boats during the breeding season, river pollution and natural predators. Increased hunting of waterfowl for sport together with poor regulation of the spring hunting season (which is intended to coincide with passage migration and avoid targeting locally breeding birds) is a significant and increasing threat; large numbers were reportedly shot in the Kievka River basin, southern Primorye, in spring 2008 (D. Solovieva <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008). Threats in its breeding range in China include dam construction, deforestation, illegal hunting, human disturbance and the use of poisons and/or explosives for fishing (Peiqi Liu <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008)<strong></strong>. Fine-meshed nets were a significant threat to the post-breeding congregations at Song Jiang He in Jilin Province, China, but illegal fishing at the site has been reduced and only large-meshed nets are used in legal fish-farming (Peiqi Liu <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008)<strong></strong>. The site remains threatened by industrial pollution (Peiqi Liu <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008)<strong></strong>. The proposed Korean Grand Canal project, which aimed to canalise 3,134 km  of the Korean peninsula's rivers and radically alter the Han and  Nakdong rivers (which currently support an estimated 30-50 birds in  winter), was suspended in June 2008 (Moores  2008), and an alternative scheme, the Four Rivers Project, was proposed in December of that year, with an environmental impact assessment and launch of construction in 2009 (Moores <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010),&#160;despite environmental arguments against the project.&#160;In South Korea, the species is impacted by increased river turbidity due to construction and dredging, bridge-building activities, river-bank strengthening and road-widening schemes (Moores <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Some of these activities are associated with the Four Rivers Project on several stretches of river used regularly or irregularly by the species<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>. Other significant aspects of habitat modification will include the deepening of rivers and the removal of boulders and islands, which are used for roosting. Many stretches of river are expected to be rendered unusable for the species owing to habitat degradation and disturbance (Moores <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). The species has low genetic diversity (Solovyeva and Pearce 2011). High levels of heavy metals, especially As and Hg, were reported in females and their eggs after wintering in the Yangtze catchment (Solovyeva<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2012). Poor egg hatchability recorded within Sikhote-Alin population could be a result of pollution on the wintering grounds.<p></p>","In Russia, c.1,643 pairs nest in Sikhote-Alin (Solovyeva <em>et al. </em>2014), with just 11 pairs estimated to nest north of the Amur river. In China, 155 pairs breed in the Changbai Mountains &#160;and 11 pairs in Lesser Xingan&#160;(Solovyeva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). In North Korea, breeding occurs at&#160;Mayang Chosuji reservoir&#160;and&#160;116 pairs are estimated to breed in the Changbai Mountains&#160;(Chong and Morishita 1996,&#160;Solovyeva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;Pair densities were found to be highest on the Fuerhe River in the Chinese Changbai Mountains (0.918 pairs/km)&#160;and on the Pavlovka River in Sikhote-Alin (0.63 pairs/km) (Solovyeva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;The total world population is therefore estimated at 1,936 pairs (Solovyeva <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2014). There are, however, other estimates of perhaps several thousand pairs (B. Hughes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2010).

A total of 300 individuals (including one flock of 80 birds) were recorded on a stretch of river not more than 3 km long, at Song Jiang He in Jilin Province, China, representing a post-breeding congregation prior to migration (Peiqi Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007, 2008). Surveys of c.1,000 km of rivers and 11 reservoirs in south-east China in the winters of 2006 and 2008 found a total of 71 individuals (31 and 40 respectively) (Cao and Barter 2008), and wintering birds at four sites in northern Jiangxi during 2002-2007 included a peak of 88 on a 22-km stretch of Xinjiang River (Yu Chang-Hao <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Seventy one over wintering individuals were found in eastern Jiangxi (Cao &amp; Barter 2013) but the whereabouts of the majority of the wintering population is still unknown (Cao and Barter 2008, Cranswick 2011). In the winter of 2007/2008, 1-2 birds were reported from Yalujiang River, north-east of Dandong City, Liaoning province (Bai Qing-Quan 2008), indicating that a few birds winter within the species's breeding range in north-eastern China and probably represent some of the most northerly wintering individuals in China. In 2012 a new wintering site was discovered in&#160;Chongqing, a municipality in southwest China (W. Qian <em>in litt.</em> 2013) and in 2013 a ringed bird was identified in&#160;Taoyuan county, southern China (Zeng <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix II.

Solovyeva <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008), and Changbai Shan Nature Reserve (China). An artificial nest programme in Russia, involving the provision of over 200 nest boxes (Partnership for the east Asian-Australasian flyway 2008), has shown positive results, increasing habitat capacity along rivers with logged flood-plains (D.

Due to its very limited dispersal capabilities, habitat specialization, small population size that is fully restricted to an urbanized estuary, and limited ability to escape predators, it is intrinsically susceptible to disturbance and population decline. The main driver of historical declines that were first detected in the 1980s is not fully understood, but probably includes historical scallop fishing activity, which caused the destruction of its habitat as well as mortality as bycatch. Beyond the closure of this fishery, declines continued mostly due to benthic habitat degradation from predation on ascidians by the introduced Northern Pacific Seastar (<em>Asterias amurensis</em>) and pervasive pollution, siltation and turbidity. Upon recognition of these declines, this species was listed by the Australian government (national) under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and under the Tasmanian government (state) Threatened Species Protection Act, which prohibits capture of this species except under scientific permits, and mandates the development and funding of recovery plans. A multi-institution effort currently conducts robust monitoring surveys across its entire range, a captive breeding project is underway, artificial spawning substrate has been installed in certain sites, and the public is engaged through active outreach. There have been some observed successes related to these efforts, but analyses using data from recent surveys and reconstructed abundance indices do not indicate that the population has either increased or decreased over the past 18 years, though some subpopulations have independently declined or increased. Beyond these species-specific actions, the Derwent Estuary Program, which is a multi-stakeholder effort operating under the Derwent Estuary Conservation Action Plan, regularly monitors water quality, pollutant loads and extent of contamination. On-the-ground actions have led to improvements, but the estuary remains below the national standard for pollutants and sediment quality.

It feeds on small invertebrates including amphipods, other small crustaceans and polychaete worms (Bruce<em> et al.</em> 1997, Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Handfish species do not have a pelagic larval stage, and dispersal of propagules is very limited (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). Females attach small clusters of 60 to 250 large eggs by filaments to stalked ascidians (<em>Sycozoa</em> spp.) and sometimes seagrass, sponges, hydroids or polychaete worm tubes, and parental care is provided until they hatch (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 1997, Last and Gledhill 2009). Newborns directly recruit to the benthos upon hatching and data are limited on hatchling mortality (Wong and Lynch 2017). Maximum standard length is 12 cm, but occurs more commonly from 6 to 7.5 cm (Last and Gledhill 2009).

A scallop fishery that was active throughout the historical range of this species from the 1800s until collapsing in the Derwent estuary by 1925 and in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel by 1967, also likely contributed (Edgar and Samson 2004, Last and Gledhill 2009, Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2015). </p>  <p>In addition, the Derwent Estuary has been recognized by multiple entities as one of the most polluted estuaries in Australia due to port and urban development as well as heavy metal contamination (Bloom and Ayling 1977, Coughanowr and Whitehead 2013, Ramakrishnan 2016). Besides industries associated with a busy port, this estuary is also home to paper production, zinc smelting and boat building, which are all sources of contaminated wastewater runoff. These stresses have led to declines in sensitive habitats within the estuary, including tidal flats, saltmarshes, seagrasses and kelp forests (Coughanowr <em>et al.</em> 2015). The effects from nutrient and sediment loading have been observed to change algal cover and sediment grain size at Ralphs Bay with the site becoming dominated by ‘ephemeral’ algae and covering the soft sediment microhabitat, shelter and spawning substrates that this species relies on (Green <em>et al.</em> 2012, Wong 2015, Wong and Lynch 2017). In addition, the impact of chain moorings, which are common across the Derwent Estuary, on nearby substrate quality further degrades its preferred habitat (Wong and Lynch 2017, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2018). Historical declines in bivalve populations may also reduce the availability and/or quality of the preferred micro-habitat of this species and the potential for increased predation by flathead fish (Platycephalidae) and rays in certain areas may directly impact certain subpopulations (Edgar and Samson 2004, Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Threats also include the possibility of a catastrophic pollution event, especially in areas of the estuary where ports, heavy industry and intense urbanisation are present (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Given the extremely limited mobility of this species, warming of waters due to climate change is also likely to become a stressor (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). </p>","Intrinsic life history characteristics that include very limited dispersal capabilities, small and highly localized population and limited ability to escape predators contribute to the susceptibility of this species to population decline (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017).<span style=""""> Due to their low dispersal capabilities and relatively low reproductive rate,&#160;handfish species occur in isolated subpopulations&#160;(T. Lynch pers. comm. 2018); therefore, this species is&#160;considered severely fragmented since more than half of the individuals are in small and isolated patches.</span>&#160;This species experienced a large population decline during the late 20th century, and now only several micro-subpopulations remain that are spread over about 30 km in the Derwent estuary near Hobart (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). It was once considered to be common, but increasing rarity was first recognized in the late 1980s (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Wong and Lynch 2017). In the 1980s and 1990s, a few isolated populations existed in Frederick Henry Bay, which is outside the Derwent Estuary. Surveys conducted in that area last recorded it in 1999, and despite additional survey effort, it has not been detected since, suggesting local extinction has occurred (Green <em>et al.</em> 2012). Elsewhere outside the estuary, the species was last recorded in Great Oyster Bay between 1909 and 1957, in the Huon estuary in the 1940s, and despite substantial sampling effort over the past half century, it has not been recorded in eastern Tasmania or the Bass Strait (Last and Gledhill 2009). <span style="""">The remnant of its global population is now considered to be fragmented and restricted to 9 sites within the Derwent Estuary&#160;</span>and each of these sites represent separate, isolated subpopulations, with some limited potential for connectivity between adjacent sites (Wong and Lynch 2017). When populations were larger in the past, individuals probably made small movements of up to 150 metres, and up to 500 metres for spawning purposes (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). <br/><br/>Although significant trends in its global population have not been detected from data collected during surveys conducted over the past 18 years, this species has a much lower abundance in the present than 30 or more years ago and at least one site has declined in the past decade (Wong and Lynch 2017). The largest declines began sometime after 1980, i.e. as much as 38 years ago<span style="""">&#160;(G. Edgar pers. comm. 2018).&#160;</span>In addition, recruitment appears to have been low (Green <em>et al.</em> 2012) and only one high density subpopulation, which is located in the Derwent Estuary, is now known to exist (Wong and Lynch 2017). According to analyses conducted in 2009, an estimated 1,500 to 2,700 total mature individuals remained, and this is known to have further declined since (Commonwealth of Australia 2015). All known extant sites for the species were first surveyed in 2015 and repeated in 2016 (Wong and Lynch 2017).&#160;Besides the population surveys conducted across its known global range in the Derwent Estuary in 2016, additional exploratory surveys conducted in the&#160;<a name=""_Hlk498863484"">D’Entrecasteaux Channel&#160;</a><a name=""_Hlk498862480"">recorded two separate individuals within Flathead Bay, which documents that a small, but poorly known, population persists outside the Derwent Estuary</a>. Surveys were also conducted in nearby bays in preferred habitat, but no fish were observed. In the 2015 surveys, 80 total individuals were observed, and 90 were observed in 2016. The total number of fish at each of the nine sites in 2016 ranged between 3 and 19 individuals and the highest density was recorded at Mary-Ann Bay at 30.2 ± 10.1 individuals per hectare and lowest density at Ralphs Bay at 3.19 ± 1.70 individuals per hectare (Wong and Lynch 2017). Mary-Ann Bay is also the site with the highest numbers of ascidians, which is the spawning substrate of this species (Lynch&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and sites with low ascidian numbers commonly record low to no fish (Green&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Between the two consecutive survey years, similar densities were found at most sites, except Bellerive and Tranmere recorded a small increase in observations and less were observed at Howrah Beach. From 1998 to 2016, or over the past 18 years, estimated densities across all the sites did not show any significant trend&#160;<a name=""_Hlk498931021"">(Wong and Lynch 2017</a>). The subpopulation at Ralphs Bay declined exponentially from 50 fish per hectare in 2005 to 3.19 fish per hectare by 2016 (Green&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Lynch <em>et al. </em>2016, Wong and Lynch 2017), which represents about a 94% decline over the past 11 years. The subpopulation at Primrose Sands collapsed between 1999 and 2005 (87 individuals to zero), and may be locally extinct (Green 2007, Commonwealth of Australia 2015, Lynch&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Wong and Lynch 2017). The relatively wide variation in fish densities across the subpopulations suggest that this species can persist in low or high densities that can vary both annually and seasonally (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Most of the nine Derwent subpopulations have a density between 10 and 20 fishes Ha<sup>-1</sup> (Wong <em>et al</em>. 2018). The minimum overall population size in the Derwent is 850 mature individuals and the D'Entrecasteaux Channel subpopulation has about 100 individuals, which results in a global estimated total population size of at least 950 individuals <span style="""">(G.

Ongoing research to improve population estimates is expected in the future, but based on what is currently known, it is inferred that, over the past three generations, there has been at least a 50% global decline. It is suspected the decline may be as much as 90%.&#160;</span>",Decreasing,"This species is patchily distributed and restricted to the lower Derwent Estuary in Tasmania, Australia. In the past, it once also occurred in disjunct populations across southern and eastern Tasmania from Coles Bay to the D'Entrecasteaux Channel (Last <em>et al.</em> 2007, Last and Gledhill 2009), but is now considered extant in only 9 sites within the Derwent Estuary (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016, Wong and Lynch 2017, Wong <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two individuals were recently documented in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel in Flathead Bay, but further research is needed to establish the viability of this subpopulation (Wong and Lynch 2017).

It is also listed under the State Government of Tasmania Threatened Species Protection Act (Last and Gledhill 2009). Capture is totally prohibited for this federally and state-protected species, and punishment for poaching includes heavy fines and/or imprisonment (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Scallop dredging is no longer permitted within the range of this species (Department of the Environment and Heritage 2004). <br/><br/>At least three recovery plans have been developed, one for the 1999-2001 time period, the second for 2002-2006 and the third for 2015-2020 (Commonwealth of Australia 2015, Wong and Lynch 2017). A robust monitoring survey is in place to track population trends across its entire range and conservation actions currently include building capacity for a captive breeding project, deploying eco-friendly moorings in critical handfish habitat, and engaging the local community through talks, outreach and publications (Wong and Lynch 2017, Wong <em>et al</em>. 2018). A multi-institutional collaboration involving volunteer divers (Reef Life Survey, the University of Tasmania Dive Club), researchers (CSIRO, the University of Tasmania), managers (Tasmanian Government, Derwent Estuary Program, Department of the Environment) and industry (Aquenal Pty Ltd., Veolia Pty Ltd) has implemented conservation efforts with some success. This includes education of the public as well as the placement of over 1,500 plastic rods at Sandy Bay, Battery Point and Ralphs Bay to provide artificial vertical substrate for deposition of handfish egg masses (Green <em>et al.</em> 2012, Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>In addition, private organisations, government and collaborative programs (e.g., the Derwent Estuary Program) have made significant efforts to mitigate recent and past pollution in the estuary. Under the Derwent Estuary Conservation Action Plan, water quality, pollutant loads and extent of contamination are regularly monitored and communicated via ‘State of the Derwent Estuary’ reports (Coughanowr and Whitehead 2013, Coughanowr <em>et al</em>. 2015). These actions have resulted in about a 90% reduction in organic inputs and about a 50% reduction in heavy metals, as well as substantial improvements in stormwater treatment, but pollution loads remain well above, and sediment quality well below, national standards (Coughanowr and Whitehead 2013, Coughanowr <em>et al</em>. 2015, Ramakrishnan 2016).&#160;<p><em>Ex-situ </em>conservation efforts are possible considering this species is known to survive in aquaria and eggs could be harvested from the wild to support such a program (Edgar <em>et al</em>. 2017). Establishing captive bred populations is currently a priority at both the local and national level (Wong and Lynch 2017). Further underwater surveys are urgently needed for all shallow-water handfishes, especially where there are knowledge gaps for their status/existence in suitable habitat along the Tasmanian southeast coast. Further searches are also needed at historical sites previously visited by divers (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2017). Implementation of protected areas in estuarine environments has been recommended in this region (Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2000), but no area-based conservation safeguards have been implemented (Edgar 2011, G.

123790805,15419,Orcaella brevirostris,Endangered,A2cd+3cd+4cd,2017,2017-08-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Irrawaddy Dolphins occur in south and southeast Asia, limited to shallow coastal waters (usually associated with freshwater inputs), three large river systems, two brackish lagoons or marine appended lakes, and one sound. Where the species has been studied: (1) subpopulation sizes are very small (in the range of 10s to low 100s of individuals) with the single exception of Bangladesh that had a abundance estimated at 5,800 individuals (coefficient of variation (CV) = 40%) in 2007; (2) there have been significant range declines in several areas; and (3) threats, especially incidental mortality in fisheries (bycatch) and habitat degradation, are well documented, severe, pervasive, and potentially increasing. The fragmented distribution of the species in coastal waters near river mouths and in deep pools of large rivers means that the species is exposed to intensive anthropogenic threats because human activities are generally concentrated in these areas. Where the species has been studied, including in Bangladesh, stranding records and reports from local fishermen suggest that incidental mortality in fishing gear, particularly gillnets, is not sustainable. Three riverine Irrawaddy Dolphin subpopulations (Mekong, Ayeyarwady, and Mahakam), one in Songkhla Lagoon, and one in Malampaya Sound are listed as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List.<br/><br/>Moore (2015) estimated that the generation time for a pristine population of Irrawaddy Dolphins (i.e., one with a stable age structure and abundance at carrying capacity) is 20 years (range 16-23) and the best estimate of maximum annual rate of increase is 3.8% (range 2-6%). Moore (2015) also estimated that based on these parameters, three generations (i.e., 60 years) of human-induced mortality rates of 4.4%, 5.0%, and 6.5% per year would lead to declines in population size of 30%, 50%, and 80%, respectively, corresponding to IUCN Red List classifications of Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN), and CR, respectively, under criterion A (population size reduction). For example, the deaths of only 4.2 individuals per year from a population of 100 would result in a 50% decline, therefore meeting the criteria for EN (Moore 2015).<br/><br/>The available evidence from studied subpopulations and indications from elsewhere in their range suggest that mortality rates of Irrawaddy Dolphins are consistently at, or above, the rate that would result in a 50% or greater decline in three generations. Examples based on recovered carcasses (see the <em>Threats</em> section below) in the best known Irrawaddy Dolphin subpopulations (all freshwater) indicate a minimum annual mortality of 9.3% for Chilika Lagoon (a mean of 10.3 individuals per year between 2003-2009 in a population estimated at 111 dolphins (Sutaria <em>et al</em>. 2017); 5.7% for the Mahakam River (4.0 individuals per year between 2005 and 2016 in a population estimated at 70 individuals in 2005 (Kreb <em>et al</em>. 2007, and unpub. data)); 3.2% for the Mekong River (3.0 individuals per year in 2001-2005 in a population estimated at 93 dolphins (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2013)); and 4.3% in the Ayeyarwady River (2.8 individuals per year in 2002-2016 in a population estimated at 65 individuals (Lin in Thomas and Gulland 2017)). Although only the estimates for Chilika Lagoon and the Mahakam River surpass the 5.0% human-induced mortality threshold calculated by Moore (2015), these mortality rates reflect only deaths that were documented and reported and there is a high probability of undetected/unreported deaths, especially in remote areas. Actual mortality rates are almost certainly much higher in most areas. Although the aforementioned examples were freshwater subpopulations, which may be more vulnerable than coastal subpopulations, expert opinion and less comprehensive data sets on Irrawaddy Dolphin mortality in coastal waters suggest that other subpopulations are experiencing similarly high levels of human-caused mortality. For instance, a cetacean stranding network in Bangladesh recorded roughly five Irrawaddy deaths per year between 2007 and 2016, despite the network covering only a very small portion of the species’ range in inland and coastal waters. Irrawaddy Dolphins also appear to be the most frequently by-caught cetacean in coastal fisheries in Sarawak (Peter et al. 2016b).<br/><br/>Irrawaddy Dolphin habitat overlaps strongly with severe threats from growing human activities. The primary factor responsible for population declines in both their freshwater and marine habitat is incidental mortality in small-scale fisheries, especially gillnets. Habitat loss and degradation is also a major contributing threat in many freshwater areas, especially from existing and planned dams in the Mekong and Ayeyarwady rivers, and in coastal estuarine habitat from declining freshwater flows, increasing commercial vessel traffic and pollution. Rigorous data on annual mortality needed to distinguish between VU and EN listings (4.4% and 5.0%, respectively) are not available and, with the exception of a few well studied subpopulations, the data are unlikely to become available in the foreseeable future. However, it is probable that the high mortality and small size of the studied populations will be found to apply to those areas where data are currently non-existent or limited. The severity and pervasiveness of the primary threats give reason to suspect that an EN listing is appropriate according to a population size reduction of ≥50% over the past 60 years, future 60 years, and a time period encompassing 60 years in both the past and the future. Considering the strong evidence that fatal entanglements in fishing gear will only increase in the future along with increasing fishing effort from small-scale fisheries; alternative fishing techniques for replacing gillnets while meeting local fishery needs are not available; and dam construction and coastal development in priority Irrawaddy dolphin habitat are increasing in both magnitude and range, the case for a ≥50% reduction in the next 60 years is particularly compelling.<br/><br/>The Irrawaddy Dolphin qualifies as EN A2cd+3cd+4cd. Criteria A2, A3, and A4 refer to a population size reduction of ≥50% over the past 60 years, future 60 years, and a time period encompassing 60 years in both the past and future, respectively; c refers to declines in the area of occupancy and quality of habitat, and d refers to levels of exploitation which in this case is non-deliberate bycatch in fisheries. The EN classification of the species is reinforced by the fact that five subpopulations have been assessed as CR, as well as the ongoing intensity of bycatch and habitat deterioration throughout the species’ range, without any substantial mitigation.","Irrawaddy Dolphins occur in varied habitats. In rivers, they occur almost exclusively in relatively deep (10-50 m) pools located at confluences or above and below rapids. In coastal waters, Irrawaddy Dolphins most commonly occur in areas affected by freshwater inputs and they may enter the lower reaches of rivers (Smith 2017). In the Rajang River in Sarawak, Malaysia, Irrawaddy Dolphins were observed both in the lower reaches of the river and as far as 86 km upriver (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the coastal areas of Sarawak, Irrawaddy Dolphins were statistically more likely to be observed within 6 km of shore, with a mean water depth of 4.2 m (standard deviation (SD) = 2.4) and salinity of 31.2 ± 2.3 ppt with their distribution shifting inshore during high tide and offshore during low tide (Peter<em> et al.</em> 2016a). In Malampaya Sound, Philippines, 76% of sightings occurred in waters shallower than 6 m (Dolar<em> et al.</em> 2002) with a mean salinity of 28.3 ppt (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2004a). In Chilika Lagoon, 75% of 517 dolphin groups occurred in waters 0.6-2.5 m deep, with a maximum depth of 5.2 m for all groups, while salinity ranged from 1-22 ppt (Sutaria 2009). In coastal waters of Bangladesh, sighting locations had a mean depth of 7.5 m (range 2.7-16.0 m) and a mean salinity of 16.1 ppt (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2008). In Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia, Irrawaddy Dolphins occur in slightly deeper (mean 14.6 m; n = 94; SD = 9.3; range = 2-46 m) and higher salinity (mean 26 ppt; n = 35; SD = 3.1; range = 21-33 ppt) waters (D. Kreb pers. comm. 2017). Irrawaddy Dolphins have been observed in the same areas as Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises (<em>Neophocaena phocaenoides</em>) in coastal waters of Bangladesh and Myanmar (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2008, Smith and Tun 2008), and their range overlaps those of both Finless Porpoises and Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>) in coastal areas of Borneo (Kamaruzzan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011). Irrawaddy Dolphins also co-occur with Ganges River Dolphins (<em>Platanista gangetica</em>) in a relatively small portion of their range in the Sundarbans mangrove forest (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2006). In waterways of the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Irrawaddy Dolphin distribution shifts downstream and upstream according to high and low freshwater flow, respectively, and is conditionally dependent (P &lt; 0.05) on low salinity, moderate to high water depths, high temperature and increasing numbers of channel conﬂuences (Smith<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><span lang=""EN-GB"">","As mentioned above, the patchy and fragmented distribution of Irrawaddy Dolphins in both coastal waters and rivers renders them particularly vulnerable to threats from human activities concentrated in the same areas. The most severe threat to most subpopulations is incidental mortality from entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets. Habitat loss, particularly from dams in riverine populations, and degradation from declining or altered freshwater flows affecting estuarine populations, is a looming conservation threat with the potential for extirpating subpopulations and further fragmenting the already patchy distribution of the species. Irrawaddy Dolphin habitat in both freshwater and estuarine systems is also being degraded by pollutants (oil, pesticides, industrial wastes, coal dust, etc.), siltation from poor land practices, and in some areas noise (e.g., Kreb <em>et al</em>. 2010, Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016a, Thomas and Gulland 2017). Live captures for aquarium display as well as hunting may have affected some populations in the past. In the Mekong River Basin, Irrawaddy Dolphins were also killed by wartime bombing and by explosives used to catch fish (Baird and Mounsouphom 1994).<br/><br/>Irrawaddy Dolphins are caught accidentally in fishing nets in all areas where they have been studied (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007). The most detailed information on such bycatch comes from the Mekong River where of 15 confirmed human-caused deaths documented between 2001 and 2005, 13 (87%) were due to gillnet entanglement (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fewer carcasses have been recovered since 2008, but six (four adults and two neonates) were recovered in 2016 (Hang in Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>In the Mahakam River between 2005 and 2016, an average of four carcasses were recovered every year, of which 16% were calves, 9% juveniles and 75% adults. About two thirds of these deaths were attributed to entanglement in large-mesh (10-17.5 cm) gillnets (Kreb in Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>Of 49 Irrawaddy Dolphin deaths recorded in Bangladesh from February 2007 to December 2016, two thirds were judged to be due to entanglement, mostly in gillnets, based on net and rope marks, entangled gear attached to the carcasses, and reports from fishermen (Alom in Thomas and Gulland 2017). Mortality has also been recorded in drift gillnets targeting elasmobranchs in coastal waters of Bangladesh (Smith et al. 2008) and bottom-set gillnets targeting crabs in Malampaya Sound (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2004a). Fishermen in some areas report that dolphins are released if found still alive (Smith and Hobbs 2002, Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016b) but in the case of drowned animals, the oil may be used for medicinal purposes or the flesh eaten (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2004a).<br/><br/>In Chilika Lagoon, India, 72 dolphin carcasses were found between 2003 and 2009 (Sutaria <em>et al</em>. 2017) but the causes of death were not specified. Between 2002 and 2016, 42 dolphin deaths were recorded in the Ayeyarwady in Myanmar, 29 of these inside the Ayeyarwady Dolphin Protected Area (Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>Interview surveys of 210 fishermen in Bangladesh and 27 fishermen in Sarawak, Malaysia confirmed that gillnets, and occasionally set-bag nets and longlines, are responsible for the majority of dolphin deaths (Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016b, Alom in Thomas and Gulland, 2017). Fishing with electricity has been reported as a threat to the Ayeyarwady subpopulation (Smith and Tun 2007) but details of the dolphin mortality attributed to this destructive fishing practice are unclear.<br/><br/>Dams have degraded some channels inhabited by Irrawaddy Dolphins in the Mekong River Basin and more dams have been proposed in the river’s mainstem (Stone 2016, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017). Four major hydropower projects are of extreme concern to dolphins in the Mekong River: Don Sahong dam, currently under-construction in Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the proposed Sambor, Stung Treng, and Lower Sekong dams in Cambodia. Since construction began on the Don Sahong dam in 2014, the tiny group of dolphins in the transboundary pool between Laos and Cambodia had declined from five to three animals in 2017 and all are now restricted to the Anlung Cheuteal deep pool upstream from the construction site. If built, the other three proposed dams are almost certain to cause further loss of core habitat and fragmentation of the Irrawaddy Dolphin population in the Mekong (Ryan in Thomas and Gulland 2017). In particular, experts believe that construction of the Sambor and Stung Treng dams, to be located in the middle of their core habitat in the Mekong mainstem, would lead to the extinction of Irrawaddy dolphins in the Mekong. These dams threaten not only dolphins but also fisheries and therefore human livelihoods (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007). A high dam proposed for the headwaters of the Ayeyarwady River, Myanmar, in Myitsone just below the confluence of the Mali Hka and N’Mai Hka tributaries, provides reason for concern about effects on the population of Irrawaddy Dolphins downstream (<a href=""https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/the-myitsone-dam-on-the-irrawaddy-river-a-briefing-3931"">https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/the-myitsone-dam-on-the-irrawaddy-river-a-briefing-3931</a>).<br/><br/>Deforestation and gold, sand, and gravel mining are causing major changes to the geomorphic and hydraulic features of rivers and marine-appended lakes where Irrawaddy Dolphins occur (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007). Increased sedimentation resulting from deforestation in surrounding watersheds has resulted in declining water depths in Songkhla, Chilika, and Jempang Lakes. The last of these water bodies adjoins the Mahakam River and previously supported dolphins throughout most of its breadth. Now it is no longer suitable habitat for the species (D. Kreb pers. comm). Between 1992 and 1997, the maximum depth of Chilika Lagoon declined from 3.4 to 1.4 meters and the accumulation of sediments led to shrinkage of the opening channel and a dramatic decline in salinity. A new channel dredged in the northern portion of the lake in 2000 is thought to have mitigated at least some of the problems caused by sedimentation (Pattnaik et al., 2007). Maintenance dredging now maintains waterflow in and out of the lake, although the opening of the lake to the sea is continually shifting, followed by shifts in dolphin distribution (D. Sutaria pers comm). The lake is also affected by high levels of heavy metal contamination (Banerjee <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Habitat loss and population fragmentation in several areas have resulted from the proliferation of fixed fishing gear. In the early 2000s, about 27,000 Sai nong or sitting traps and 13,000 Sang sai or barrier traps created more than 8,000 linear kilometres of barrier in multiple rows in the middle and southern portions of Songkhla Lake. These fishing structures were left in place year-round and restricted dolphin movements such that their habitat was substantially reduced and the potential for demographic interaction with dolphins from the Gulf of Thailand was eliminated (Smith et al. 2004b). No new information on the situation in Songkhla Lake has become available but there is no reason to believe it has improved in any way, and the Songkhla Lake subpopulation of Irrawaddy Dolphins is in imminent danger of extirpation.<br/><br/>A 2014 study of six Irrawaddy Dolphin populations in Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India found varying degrees of presence of cutaneous skin nodules, thought to be caused by a fibropapilloma, with the highest prevalence (13.6%) in Chilika Lagoon, where the two most serious cases were observed, and in Kuching, Malaysia. The progression of this disease may be associated with environmental pollutants (Van Bressem <em>et al</em>. 2014), and as such may be an indicator of habitat deterioration in the areas where it is detected.","No range-wide survey has been conducted for this species, nor is there a synoptic estimate of the total number of Irrawaddy Dolphins from local or regional surveys. Statistically rigorous abundance estimates are available for only a few portions of the range. As summarized in Smith (2017) and Thomas and Gulland (2017), listed from largest to smallest, these are: 5,383 (CV = 40%) in open estuarine waters of Bangladesh (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008); 451 (CV = 10%) in waterways of the Sundarbans mangrove forest in Bangladesh (continuous with the estuarine waters in Bangladesh mentioned above; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2006); 423 averaged over five years of line-transect surveys along the Trat coast in the Gulf of Thailand (Hines <em>et al</em>. 2015); 233 (CV = 22.5%, 95% confidence limits (CL) = 151–360) in Kuching Bay, Sarawak, Malaysia (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2013); 189 (CV = 23%, 95% CL = 122-292) for the Bintulu-Similajau coastline in Sarawak (C. Peter and G. Minton, unpub. data through 2015); 111 (CV = 8%) in Chilika Lagoon, India (Sutaria and Marsh 2011); 77 (CV = 8%; 95% CI = 71-84, D. Kreb, unpub. data) in the Mahakam River in 2016; and 58-72 in the Ayeyarwady River (Smith and Tun 2007). In the Mekong River estimates dropped from 93 individuals in 2007 (95% CL = 86–101; Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2013) to 85 in 2010 (95% CL = 78-91; Ryan <em>et al</em>. 2011), to 80 in 2015 (95% CL 64-100; Phan <em>et al</em>. 2015). The most recent estimate for Malampaya Sound in the Philippines decreased from 77 individuals in 2001 (CV = 27%; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2004a) to 35 in 2012 (CV = 22.9%; 95% CI = 22-55; Whitty 2016). Additionally, an estimate of minimum abundance of Irrawaddy Dolphins in Koh Kong, Cambodia (contiguous with the population on the Trat coast in Thailand), was 69 individuals (95% CI = 53-85) based on the number of photo-identified individuals (47) corrected by the proportion of unmarked individuals (46.9%; Smith <em>et al</em>. 2016). A population of roughly 50 individuals has been documented in Balikpapan Bay, Kalimantan, Indonesia (D. Kreb, unpub. data).<br/><br/>For each of the five of the subpopulations classified as Critically Endangered (CR), and a sixth subpopulation in Chilika Lake, India, the number of reproductively mature individuals is estimated to be less than 50. Limited research and data from additional locations in Borneo, where other presumably isolated subpopulations have been documented, indicate that in contrast to the larger subpopulation in Bangladesh, most parts of the species’ range where suitable habitat occurs likely host very small local subpopulations, such as those in the Sesayap River and estuary in Kalimantan (estimated at 40-96 individuals with seasonal fluctuation; Kreb unpubl. data) and Cowie Bay in Sabah (estimated at 31 individuals; Woan <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Decreasing,"Irrawaddy Dolphins have a discontinuous distribution in coastal waters of the tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific, and are predominantly associated with freshwater inputs (Stacey and Arnold 1999, Smith 2017). Coastal and estuarine populations occur from Borneo and the central islands of the Indonesian Archipelago north to Palawan, Philippines, and west to the Bay of Bengal, including the Gulf of Thailand. There are also freshwater subpopulations in three large rivers: Ayeyarwady in Myanmar (up to 1,400 km upstream from the river mouth), Mahakam in Indonesia (with a suspected current range between 90 km to 500 km upstream from the river mouth and the area of highest density between 180 and 280 km from the mouth), and Mekong in Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic (a range of less than 200 km between Kampi pool, near Kratie, Cambodia, and Khone Falls, Laos, some 690 km from the river mouth). Within the extent of Irrawaddy Dolphin occurrence in these rivers, their area of occupancy is concentrated in deep pools associated with confluences and above and below rapids. Three other subpopulations inhabit marine-appended brackish water bodies: Chilika Lagoon in India, Songkhla Lagoon in Thailand, and Malampaya Sound in the Philippines.<br/><br/>Although the map accompanying this assessment implies a continuous distribution throughout the coastal areas of the species’ range, subpopulations are known to be fragmented and patchily distributed, with long stretches of coastline where the species is now absent, either due to lack of freshwater inputs or likely local extirpation.&#160; For example, while Irrawaddy Dolphins are present in the coastal waters of the Trat Province, Thailand, they appear to be absent in the neighbouring provinces of Chanthaburi and Rayong in the upper Gulf of Thailand (Hines et al. 2015). Similarly, while populations were documented in Kuching Bay and Similajau in Sarawak, Malaysia, the species was not observed during repeated cetacean surveys off the coast of Miri and the Baram River, where the species is known to have been present historically (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pilleri and Gihr 1974).","Hunting or trade is not known to be a major factor explaining population declines of Irrawaddy Dolphins with the exception of Ton Le Sap in Cambodia where intensive hunting by the Khmer Rouge was reported during the 1970s and the species is now extirpated from the lake. Live captures for aquarium display, including export (e.g., to Japan), have taken place in some areas (e.g., Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia) but are not believed to be frequent at present.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The Irrawaddy Dolphin is listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) as well as the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).<br/><br/>The Action Plan for the Conservation of Freshwater Populations of Irrawaddy Dolphins (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2007) noted that multiple-use protected areas will play a key role for conserving freshwater subpopulations of Irrawaddy Dolphins. Protected areas could be a particularly effective conservation tool due to the fidelity of the species in freshwater systems to relatively circumscribed areas, as this can facilitate management. The Action Plan also provided details on strategies for mitigating bycatch that included (1) establishing core conservation areas where gillnetting is banned or severely restricted; (2) promoting net attendance rules and providing training on the safe release of entangled dolphins; (3) initiating a program to compensate fishermen for damage caused to their nets by entangled dolphins that are safely released; (4) providing alternative or diversified employment options for gillnet fishermen; (5) encouraging the use of fishing gears that do not harm dolphins by altering or establishing fee structures for fishing permits to make gillnetting more expensive while decreasing the fees for non-destructive gears; and (6) experimenting with acoustical deterrents and reflective nets.<br/><br/>In some countries conservation progress is underway. In Myanmar, the Department of Fisheries is collaborating with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) to implement the Management Plan for the Ayeyarwady Dolphin Protected Area (ADPA) (Thomas and Gulland 2017). In the Mekong River, a River Guard Program administered by the local governments in relevant provinces and supported by WWF-Cambodia has stationed 68 River Guards at 16 different outposts along the Mekong from Kratie to the Cambodian-Lao border to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations designed to protect fisheries and dolphins (Samnang in Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>In the Mahakam River, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, conservation efforts have focused on training fishermen to rescue dolphins when they are entangled and raising awareness among communities and government authorities. A local non-governmental organization also encourages alternative livelihoods, for example aquaculture and nature-oriented tourism. Since 2002, there have been eight successful releases of dolphins entangled in nets and three dolphins have been rescued from swamp areas when they were unable to return to the main river. The designation of a protected area (24,000 ha core, 51,000 ha total) is currently in progress and will include core dolphin habitat as well as freshwater swamps (Kreb <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kreb in Thomas and Gulland 2017).<br/><br/>In Bangladesh three wildlife sanctuaries for freshwater dolphins have been in place since 2012 in the eastern Sundarbans. While primarily designed to protect Ganges River Dolphins rather than Irrawaddy Dolphins, the sanctuaries include areas where both species regularly co-occur. In 2014, the Government of Bangladesh declared a 1,738 km² marine protected area in the Swatch-of-No-Ground submarine canyon and adjacent estuarine waters. This includes 233 km² of priority habitat for Irrawaddy Dolphins.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The rate of decline is probably underestimated because a period of only 25 years was considered and other sources of non-natural mortality, including other fisheries, were not incorporated into the analysis. The causes of the suspected population decline have not ceased. On the contrary, fishing effort has increased, at least in some areas in Brazil. In 2012, the Brazilian Government established regulations for gillnet fisheries that included maximum allowable net lengths and several categories of no-fishing areas. However, there is evidence that the level of Franciscana mortality in southern and southeastern Brazil remains high. The numbers of Franciscanas killed in Brazil in gillnets and found washed ashore each year remains in the order of several hundred which is not different from the numbers observed in years that preceded the regulations (e.g., Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2016; Cremer <em>et al.</em> 2016, E.R. Secchi, unpubl. data). The bycatch is also high in Uruguay and Argentina, where estimates of annual mortality are a few hundred Franciscanas (Capozzo <em>et al.</em> 2007, Negri <em>et al.</em> 2012, Szephegyi <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/></p>","Although sometimes described as a ‘river dolphin’, the Franciscana does not occur in freshwater habitats. The species is generally found in turbid coastal waters, but also inhabits clear waters as well as marine areas associated with islands and rocky shores (Pinedo <em>et al</em>. 1989, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2009). Franciscanas are found mainly in the marine environment and only occasionally in estuaries (Santos <em>et al</em>. 2009) and one inland bay (Cremer and Simões-Lopes 2008). They are relatively common in the Uruguayan part of the La Plata River estuary (Praderi 1986). Franciscanas are primarily coastal, inhabiting waters beyond the surf zone and out to the 30 or 50 m isobath, depending on the region. For example, in FMAs III and IV they occur in waters up to 50 m deep (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2010), while in FMAs I and II they appear to be restricted to waters inshore of the 25 or 30 m isobath. Franciscana density decreases with distance from the coast, although the rate and degree of the decrease vary according the width of the continental shelf (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, D. Danilewicz, unpub. data).<br/><br/>Franciscanas apparently do not migrate, although seasonal inshore–offshore movements have been documented in some areas (Bordino <em>et al</em>. 1999, Bordino 2002). Movements of 70-90 km along the coastline have been recorded for satellite-tagged individuals in Argentina (Wells <em>et al</em>. 2013). Predation by both large sharks and Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) has been documented (Praderi 1985, Ott and Danilewicz 1996, Santos and Netto 2005).<br/><br/>Franciscanas feed on several species of shallow-water fish (e.g., sciaenids, engraulids, gadids, batrachoids, trichiurids and carangids), cephalopods, and crustaceans (Brownell 1989, Di Beneditto and Ramos 2001, Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2002, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002, Troina <em>et al</em>. 2016). Their coastal marine habitat is typically characterized by continental run-off with high discharge of high-nutrient river flows (e.g., Patos Lagoon [Lagoa dos Patos] in RS and the La Plata River [Río de la Plata] in Argentina and Uruguay). Juvenile sciaenids, the most important prey of Franciscanas, are typically associated with continental runoff and the influence of subtropical shelf waters (Crespo 2009).","The main threat to the species is incidental mortality in gillnet fisheries (there are no reports of direct exploitation of Franciscanas), which has been observed since at least the mid 1960s (Van Erp 1969). In the 1960s, the bycatch in Uruguay alone (at two villages) was as high as 1,500-2,000 animals (Brownell and Ness 1969, Pilleri 1971), but changes in the fisheries’ target species resulted in a significant decrease in the bycatch in the 1980s (Crespo <em>et al.</em> 1986, Praderi 1997). Bycatch estimates in the early 2000s totaled at least 2,900 animals per year in all management stocks combined (e.g., Ott <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b), but these numbers are thought to be underestimated to an unknown extent, primarily due to: (1) captures in other non-monitored types of fisheries (e.g., active gillnetting, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 1997; trawling, Szephegyi <em>et al.</em> 2015); (2) under-reporting of bycatch by fishermen; and (3) dolphins captured sometimes falling from the net during retrieval (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b). Annual bycatch is believed to be higher in FMA III with estimates of 1,300 animals/year (Ott <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b, 2004) and much higher in some years (Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013), followed by FMA IV: 500-800 individuals/year (Bordino and Albareda 2005), FMA II: &gt; 700 /year (Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2002, IWC 2005), and FMA Ib: &gt; 110/year (Di Beneditto 2003). These annual mortality estimates suggest that bycatch levels continue to be unsustainable (Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2012; Crespo <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zerbini <em>et al.</em> 2010, Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/> <br/> Stomach contents of Franciscanas from Rio Grande do Sul have included many kinds of debris: discarded fishing gear such as pieces of nylon net (17% of 36 stomachs), ""cellophane"" (or some other type of synthetic packaging material), and plastic fragments (6%) (Bassoi 1997). This problem has also been reported in northern Argentina, where cellophane, fishing debris, and plastic were found in 45%, 32% and 16% of the examined stomachs, respectively (Bastida <em>et al</em>. 2000, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002). The effects of such debris ingestion on health status of individual Franciscanas have not been assessed, and the subpopulation or population-level implications are uncertain. Debris ingestion is a new threat that did not exist, at least in Uruguay, in the early 1970s (R.L. Brownell, Jr., pers. comm., August 2017).<br/> <br/> Other known or potential threats include various forms of habitat degradation (e.g., overfishing; destruction of the benthic community and bycatch of small sciaenid fish—main Franciscana prey—by trawling; and chemical and acoustic pollution) (e.g., Bassoi and Secchi 2000, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2002, Laílson-Brito <em>et al</em>. 2007, Yogui <em>et al.</em> 2010, Holz 2014).","Based on genetic, morphological, distribution, and population parameters, Secchi <em>et al</em>. (2003a) proposed four provisional management units (Franciscana Management Areas, or FMAs) with the following ranges:&#160; FMA I - coastal waters of Espírito Santo (ES) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) States, Brazil; FMA II - São Paulo (SP), Paraná (PR), and Santa Catarina (SC) States, Brazil; FMA III - coastal waters of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, southern Brazil, and Uruguay; and FMA IV - coastal waters of Argentina, including the provinces of Buenos Aires and Rio Negro (only occasional in as far south as Chubut).<br/><br/>Since the study of Secchi <em>et al</em>. (2003a), new genetic and morphological data have indicated the potential for subpopulation structure throughout the range of the Franciscana (Lázaro <em>et al</em>. 2004; Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010; Véras 2011; Barbato <em>et al</em>. 2012; Costa-Urrutia <em>et al</em>. 2012; Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014; Negri <em>et al</em>. 2015; Gariboldi <em>et al</em>. 2015; Ott <em>et al</em>. 2015), leading to the development of new sub-divisions within each FMA (Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, because (1) the degree of differentiation within the various FMAs was highly variable, (2) some studies were based only on mitochondrial DNA data, and (3) there is currently no consensus on threshold levels of gene flow above which management units should be adopted, recent refinements in Franciscana subpopulation structure were limited to regions where the greatest levels of genetic difference were observed (Anonymous 2015). In this sense, FMA I was considered an Evolutionarily Significant Unit and split into two distinct management units (FMA Ia and FMA Ib, Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014), a division also supported by well-known gaps in the distribution of the species, one between SP and RJ and another in ES (Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2012). In addition, the boundary between FMA II and FMA III was moved about 250 km to the north and currently lies at the central coast of SC State (Ott, 2002, Véras 2011, Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ott <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>There is no range-wide abundance estimate for the species, but estimates have been calculated for a portion or the whole of individual FMAs. <br/><ul><li>Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. (2012) conducted aerial surveys in ES (FMA Ia) and RJ (FMA Ib) in 2011. No on-effort sightings were recorded in FMA Ia, despite relatively large survey effort, suggesting that the population of Franciscanas in ES is small, a hypothesis further supported by the very low genetic diversity of this stock (Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014). Abundance of Franciscanas in FMA Ib was estimated at nearly 2,000 individuals (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.46), indicating that this is the smallest and the one with the lowest density among all FMAs for which estimates are available. <br/></li><li>Abundance in FMA II was estimated at 8,500 individuals (CV 0.34) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2010) in 2008/9. This estimate is considered to be biased low because habitat offshore of the 30 m isobath was not surveyed. Within FMA II, there are also abundance estimates for Baia da Babitonga (Babitonga Bay) in SC, where a possibly isolated population of Franciscanas occurs (Cremer <em>et al</em>. 2012). Boat-based line transect surveys estimated 50 animals in the early 2000s (CV 0.29, Cremer and Simões-Lopes 2008) and 55 individuals in 2011 (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2011), indicating no evidence for a change in the number of Franciscanas within Babitonga Bay over a 10-year period.</li><li>Recent surveys in FMA III have been conducted only within the Brazilian portion (RS State) and the estimates were 6,800 (CV 0.32) in 2004 (Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2010) and nearly 10,000 dolphins (CV 0.20) in 2014 (D. Danilewicz <em>et al</em>., unpub. data). Because the survey methods and data analysis between these two estimates differed, it is not appropriate to conclude that the higher estimate in 2014 represents an increase in abundance in RS. Surveys to estimate Franciscana abundance have never been conducted in Uruguay. <br/></li><li>Aerial surveys conducted in Argentina (FMA IV) in 2003-2004 estimated a population of nearly 15,000 individuals (CV 0.42, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010). This estimate is believed to be negatively biased because it was not corrected for perception bias and because density estimated for offshore areas (depths greater than 30 m) was not extrapolated to non-surveyed areas.</li></ul>Population viability analysis using estimates of abundance, fisheries-related incidental mortality, and rates of population growth from the early 2000s suggested that levels of bycatch were not sustainable in all FMAs and that Franciscanas in FMAs II, III and IV would decline by at least 30% in 25 years (Secchi and Fletcher 2004, Secchi 2006). These analyses led to the previous Red List classification of the Franciscana as Vulnerable. The modelling exercise conducted by Secchi and Fletcher (2004) and Secchi (2006) is considered to underestimate the risk of decline of Franciscanas, because estimates of bycatch were believed to be biased low in some areas. In fact, most recent data on bycatch (see the <em>Threats</em> section below) indicate that the numbers caught annually in FMAs II and IV are roughly twice as high (e.g., Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bordino and Albareda 2004, IWC 2005) as the values used in the projections by Secchi (2006). Abundance estimates obtained from the mid 2000s to early 2010s suggest that bycatch levels are still unsustainable in FMAs Ib, II, and IV where the annual removals range from 3-6% of the estimated population sizes (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2010, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no estimates of bycatch or abundance for Franciscanas in FMA Ia.",Decreasing,"Franciscanas inhabit shallow coastal waters (and they sporadically enter the estuary of the La Plata River [Rio de la Plata]) of subtropical and temperate regions of the western South Atlantic Ocean (Crespo 2009, Secchi 2014). They are found only along the east coast of South America (Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina), from the northern Golfo San Matias, central Argentina (<em>ca</em> 42°10'S), to Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil (18°25'S) (Siciliano 1994, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species is not distributed continuously throughout its range. Surveys (including beach and aerial surveys, museum specimens, interviews with local people) indicate that Franciscanas are extremely rare or absent in two northern areas: (1) between central and southern Rio de Janeiro State comprising nearly 300 km of coastline and (2) in southern Espírito Santo State comprising approximately 150 km of coastline (Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2002, Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2012). The reasons for these gaps are unclear, but the species’ preference for shallow and productive waters (Brownell 1989, Pinedo <em>et al</em>. 1989, Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2009) suggests that depth and the narrowness of the continental shelf influence habitat selection (Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002).",,Marine,The Franciscana is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Remnant populations are faced with a suite of “largely intractable threats” (Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014) that either affect them directly, or contribute to the rapid and widening deterioration of their inshore habitats (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). Although there are no empirically derived abundance estimates for either the species as a whole or any of the putative populations, the available information indicate that these dolphins occur in very low and declining numbers throughout most or all of their range. Most populations for which any data are available are extremely small and several appear to be isolated. Available published estimates indicate that the total species’ population size plausibly falls well below 3,000 individuals, suggesting that the number of mature individuals is less than 1,500 (following Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Declines have been observed or are suspected for every known population, and continued declines are considered inevitable given the ongoing expansion of all identified threats throughout the species’ known range. Bycatch in fisheries, the principal cause of the declines, has been identified or suspected everywhere the species has been studied. Directed killing has also been identified or suspected in several areas, and major threats to habitats (including ports) are increasingly prevalent (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007; Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2004, 2015; Collins 2015). Ecosystem impacts that compromise vital rates may also have deleterious effects, including increasing the susceptibility of populations’ to environmental stochasticity (Moore 2015, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). Appropriate management interventions that limit habitat loss and mortality from bycatch and hunting are limited or entirely lacking across the range, and in the absence of targeted and sustained conservation management efforts, long-term prospects appear grim.<br/><br/>The available data for other species in the genus can be used to infer that <em>S. teuszii</em> has a low reproductive rate and thus a low intrinsic potential for population increase (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014, Moore 2015, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007). Given the small apparent population sizes, any mortality over and above natural rates is likely to lead to appreciable declines in abundance. Moore (2015) estimated that given an inferred generation time of 25 years (as estimated for <em>S. plumbea</em> and <em>S. chinensis</em>), an average annual adult mortality rate of 5.3% would lead to an 80% decline over 75 years (three generations). Limited data for some areas (e.g., Congo) clearly demonstrates that non-natural mortality (particularly captures) is high and when considered alongside the scale of anthropogenic pressures, a population reduction of more than 80% over three generations is highly likely.<br/><br/>The available information, much of it characterized by high levels of uncertainty, suggests that the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin merits classification as Critically Endangered (CR) under criteria A3cd+4cd. For the A criterion, a reduction of more than 80% in the total population over three <em>S. teuszii</em> generations (~75 years) is suspected, with declines likely to have begun with the rapid expansion of West African coastal fisheries during the 1980s, and bycatch likely to increase as new areas are targeted and fishery pressures increase. The reduction has not ceased, nor have its causes – nor is there any reason to think they will in the foreseeable future. The inference and suspicion of the large decline in population size are based on the declining quality of the species’ habitat (subcriterion c) and its vulnerability to mortality in artisanal fisheries (subcriterion d).","Atlantic Humpback Dolphins occur exclusively in shallow (&lt;30 m) waters that are frequently (but not exclusively) nearshore (Weir and Collins 2015). Recorded sightings are typically coastal, but the species may also occur some distance from mainland shores where suitable habitats are present (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir and Collins 2015). Preferred habitats appear to be strongly influenced by tides and include areas of sandbanks, deltas, estuaries and mangrove systems (Maigret 1980, Ross <em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011, Weir and Collins 2015). They also occur on some exposed coastlines, although the available evidence suggests that densities in these areas are lower (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2010, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). Work completed by Weir (2015) suggests that in the area of the Rio Nuñez Estuary (Guinea) different <em>S. teuszii</em> groups “may vary in their site fidelity, habitat use and movements, and consequently in their home ranges.”<br/><br/>They have been recorded some distance up rivers but there is no evidence that they ascend beyond the limit of marine intrusion (Maigret 1980, Van Bree and Duguy 1965, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir and Collins 2015). Maigret (1980) described a sighting at Foundiougne, in the main channel of the Saloum River, some 33 miles (53 km) from the estuary mouth, an area within the influence of tides (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Guinea Bissau, they have been recorded 30 km upstream from the mouth of the Rio Grande de Buba and 20 km upstream from the mouth of the Rio Cacine (Leeney <em>et al</em>. 2015b, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2000). A skull was collected in Gabon ca. 1949 at Kango, a village 95 km from the Gabon Estuary mouth and at the limit of saline intrusion; collection details are scant and the skull’s true origin is unconfirmed (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Vande weghe 2005). More recent surveys in the Gabon Estuary, including as far upstream as Kango, yielded no sightings of <em>S. teuszii</em> (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2004). They are not known to enter the coastal lagoons that are a prevalent feature of equatorial West African coasts. For more detailed discussion of habitat preferences, see Weir and Collins (2015).<br/><br/>Knowledge of the feeding ecology of <em>S. teuszii</em> is incomplete, as few stomach samples have been examined and direct observations of feeding are rare (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004). It is however clear that <em>S. teuszii</em> diets consist largely of coastal, estuarine and reef-associated fishes, many of which are characteristically vocal (Cadenat and Paraiso 1957, Cadenat 1959, Ladich 2000, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir 2009). Examination of the gut contents of net-entangled animals has provided direct evidence of S<em>. teuszii</em> diets and thus overlap with important fisheries. In Senegal the stomachs of net-entangled animals contained Sompat grunt (<em>Pomadasys jubelini</em>), bongo shad (<em>Ethmalosa fimbriata</em>) and mullet (<em>Mugil</em> spp.) (Cadenat 1956, Cadenat and Paraiso 1957, Maigret 1980). The stomach of a humpback dolphin entangled in the line of a fishing trap in Guinea Bissau contained snapper (<em>Lutjanus goreensis</em>), Atlantic emperor (<em>Lethrinus atlanticus</em>) and West African spadefish (<em>Chaetodipterus lippei</em>), (Sequeira and Reiner 1992). Initial analysis of otoliths and other remains recovered from the stomachs of humpback dolphins killed in coastal gillnets in the Republic of Congo indicates a diet of predominantly Longneck and Cassava croakers (<em>Pseudotolithus typus, Pseudotholithus senegalensis</em>), as well as unidentified flounders (<em>Paralichthodes</em> spp., <em>Pseudorhombius</em> spp.) and grunts (<em>Pomadasys</em> spp.). The full stomach of one of these animals, an adult, contained 29 royal threadfin (<em>Pentanemus quinquarius</em>) and a mantis shrimp (<em>Squilla mantis</em>; Collins 2015).<br/><br/>Accounts of observed predation are few. In Mauritania single humpback dolphins were twice observed among pods of common bottlenose dolphins (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>) fishing cooperatively with Imraguen fishermen for mullet (<em>Mugil cephalus</em>, <em>Liza aurata</em>) (Busnel 1973). Duguy (1976) reported <em>S. teuszii</em> at the Banc d’Arguin chasing mullet in the channels between the Tidra and Nair islets. In Angola, <em>S. teuszii</em> were seen to feed primarily on South African mullet (<em>Liza richardsoni</em>i). Also observed were the capture of an Atlantic bonito (<em>Sarda sarda</em>) and herding of sardines (<em>Sardinella</em> spp.) although it was unclear if they were prey (Weir 2009).<br/><br/>Foraging has been linked to rising (flood) tides (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2004; Weir 2009 and references therein). In the Saloum Delta tides were thought to provide access to inner reaches of mangrove channels (referred to locally as ‘bolons’) and mangrove edges (Maigret, 1980). In the Banc d’Arguin the link between tides and foraging was less evident, although daily movements into channels inshore were coupled with flood tides (Maigret 1980), and Duguy (1976) reported <em>S. teuszii</em> chasing fish in tidal channels between the Tidra and Nair islets. In the Bijagós Archipelago (Guinea Bissau), <em>S. teuszii</em> were most frequently observed during low tide, suggesting that they fed when fish were concentrated in “gullies and creeks” (Spaans 1990, Weir 2009).). In Angola animals performing longer dives (&gt;1 min) were presumed to be in pursuit of demersal fishes and benthic prey (Weir 2009); tail-up behaviours consistent with dives on demersal prey were also observed in deeper waters of the Rio Nuñez estuary (Weir 2015). Foraging has been observed at river confluences within the Rio Grande de Buba (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Saloum Delta preferential feeding areas include Djinack Creek, Bandiala, and Sangomar Point (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Observations in Guinea, although limited, suggest that <em>S. teuszii</em> observed in the shallow waters west of the Île de Taïdi spent relatively more time foraging than those in the deeper waters of the outer Río Nuñez estuary (Weir 2015). <em>S. teuszii</em> observed off Flamingos, Angola, spent approximately half of their daylight time engaged in travel and foraging. Dolphins foraged preferentially around rocks and reefs, as well as at the mouths of rivers, including the typically dry Flamingo River (Weir, 2009). These tendencies may be shared in Gabon (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2004). Feeding activity in some areas is coincident with observations of larger aggregations, including the largest group sizes (20-40) recorded (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2004, Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004 and references therein; Van Waerebeek<em> et a</em>l. 2015).<br/><br/>Information on reproduction is extremely scant. In the Saloum Delta, births were thought to occur in March and April, based upon observations of juveniles (Maigret 1980). This pattern was also suggested for Guinea Bissau (Krömer <em>et al</em>. 1994, as cited in Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004). No neonates have been examined, but lengths at birth may be similar to those in <em>S. plumbea</em> (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). In Congo, a lactating female caught in a net during May (2013) measured 2.50 m (T. Collins unpub. data). The species is suspected to be sexually dimorphic (males larger at maturity and with a more prominent dorsal hump), but the current sample size (~20 animals) is too small to assess statistically (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated a generation length of 18.4 years for <em>S. teuszii</em>, although Moore (2015) provided a figure closer to 25 years for <em>S. chinensis</em> and <em>S. plumbea</em>. The data required to estimate generation length and other <em>S. teuszii</em> vital rates remain unavailable.<br/><br/>Migrations and movements are poorly understood. Localized movements have been linked to feeding opportunities facilitated by tides (e.g., Dupuy 1983, Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2003, Weir 2009). Cadenat (1949) stated that in the Saloum Delta they are “observed daily on the dropping tide between Pointe Jackonsa and the mouth of the Djiombos” (Maigret, 1980; Dupuy, 1983), a tendency that helped to optimize encounters in later surveys (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Movements on larger scales are rarely documented, but have been inferred. Fishermen’s accounts from the Baie du Lévrier and sightings at the Banc de Corbine suggested movement north of the Banc d’Arguin (Maigret 1980); sightings between Nouamghar and Nouakchott may indicate occasional movements south (Robineau and Vely, 1998). Maigret (1980) mused that animals from the Saloum Delta moved as far north as “Yenne” (Yene Kao, ~100 km north of Saloum), and as far south as the Gambia River Estuary (~15 to 25 km). Landings of <em>S. teuszii</em> on the Petit Côte of Senegal provided some support for this idea (Cadenat 1956, Cadenat and Paraiso 1957), although capture locations were unknown (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>., 2004). More recent observations of <em>S. teuszii</em> groups passing between Barra and Buniada Points indicate routine movement between Senegal and The Gambia (Murphy <em>et a</em>l. 1997), and a dolphin photographed crossing this border at Djinack (October 2000) provided the rationale for the species’ Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) listing (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2003; 2004).<br/><br/>Larger migrations between the populations at Dakhla Bay and the Banc d’Arguin (<em>ca</em> 450 km), and the Banc d’Arguin and Saloum-Niumi (<em>ca</em> 750 km) regions are likely to be atypical, if they occur at all, given the distances involved (Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2003), although Robineau and Vely (1998) believed it “inconceivable” that the Dakhla animals were isolated. Contemporary records led Maigret (1980) to hypothesise that Saloum Delta animals swam north to Mauritania during the May-December period; a stranding ‘midway’ between Saloum Delta and the Banc d’Arguin provided minor support (Robineau and Vely 1998), but Van Waerebeek<em> et a</em>l. (2003) rejected the idea given the availability of a larger dataset. These include bycatch and interview data, indicating year round occurrence in the Saloum Delta. There are no records between Dakar and St Louis, and very few from south of Nouakchott (Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004). Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. (2004) suggested that movements between Saloum-Niumi and the Bijagós Archipelago are probable, “considering the relatively limited distance (ca. 280 km)”. Recent sightings near the Tristão Islands (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2015) and in the Rio Nuñez suggest this connectivity extends into Guinea (Weir and Collins 2015) and Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. (2015) have since proposed a single 'Guineas stock', which combines the former 'Rio do Jêba-Bijagos' (Guinea-Bissau) and 'South Guinea' stocks (<em>sensu</em> Van Waerebeek<em> et al</em>. 2004) into one.<br/><br/>Beach-based observations by dedicated observers indicate routine movements of <em>S. teuszii</em> across the Gabon/Congo border within the Mayumba-Conkouati transboundary protected area (each containing 60 km of protected beach); it remains unclear if these animals range further afield (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2010). The very small population at Flamingos (Angola) appears to be both resident and highly localized in its occurrence (Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). Records elsewhere suggest opportunities for transboundary movements (e.g., Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014, Bamy <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zwart and Weir 2014). Inferring demographic exchange (or the lack of such exchanges) between populations through analyses of genetics and/or photographs is not possible at this point, given a lack of samples or photo-identified individuals from almost all areas. If their distribution was once continuous (or less fragmented than it now appears to be), localized movements of the kind observed at Saloum-Niumi and between Congo and Gabon may have been sufficient for ensuring step-wise exchanges (and thus gene flow) between adjacent sub-groups (sensu Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The nearshore habitats of <em>S. teuszii</em> greatly increase its susceptibility to many anthropogenic threats. High human population densities, widespread poverty and habitat degradation (and destruction) associated with development are considered important determinants of the species’ distribution and status (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fisheries within the range of <em>S. teuszii</em> are extensive and are a major source of income and protein (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2015, Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004, Kaczynski and Fluharty 2002, Weir<em> et al</em>. 2011). Bycatches of <em>S. teuszii</em> in artisanal gillnets have been reported from most areas and for as long as the species has been studied, including the first records for some areas (e.g., Busnel 1973; Cadenat 1949; Campredon and Cuq 2001; Collins <em>et al</em>. 2010; Murphy <em>et al</em>. 1997; Robineau and Vely 1998; Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2000, 2004). This includes unverified fishermen's accounts of <em>S. teuszii</em> bycatches in Sierra Leone (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Recent work in Conkouati Douli National Park (Republic of Congo) provides some indication of the substantial bycatch risk. A programme of intensive monitoring, enforcement, and cooperative (incentivized) reporting, identified 19 dolphin bycatches across all artisanal landing sites (n=14) on a 60-km stretch of protected beach over five years of work. Of these, 10 were <em>S. teuszii</em>, and the testimony of fishermen showed that all were caught in gillnets less than 1 km from shore (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although alarming mortality figures have been reported for other areas, including the Banc d’Arguin (Campredon and Cuq 2001, Robineau and Vely 1998) and the Saloum Delta (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004), the monitoring of bycatches is generally non-existent or limited to very few landing sites (e.g., Debrah <em>et al</em>. 2010, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2010). These figures are considered unrepresentative of the true toll, but bycatches are considered the principal cause for their range-wide decline and the greatest immediate threat for most populations (Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014; Clapham and Van Waerebeek 2007; Collins <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2013; Debrah <em>et al</em>. 2010; Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1997; Northridge 1984; Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007; Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004; Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/>&#160;<br/>Accounts of the deliberate capture of <em>S. teuszii</em> are rare (e.g., Cadenat 1949, 1956, 1957; Duguy 1976; Maigret 1980; Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004), but directed captures likely occur in some areas (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007; Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2015). Maigret (1994) believed that there were no traditional marine mammal fisheries in West Africa, but there is evidence that the opportunistic use of bycatches may develop into “directed entanglement” or “non-target-deliberate acquisition” (respectively, Clapham and Van Waerebeek 2007, Robards and Reeves 2011). The scale of this practice is unknown, but appears to be part of a developing global trend in the utilization of “marine bushmeat” and reflective of general fisheries declines (Alfaro-Shigueto and Van Waerebeek 2001, Brashares <em>et al</em>. 2004, Clapham and Van Waerebeek 2007, Leeney <em>et al</em>. 2015a, Robards and Reeves 2011, Uwagbae and Van Waerebeek 2010, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004). Debrah <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted that the sale of cetaceans and sea turtles contributes to the economic viability of gillnet fisheries in Ghana. This included the killing of live entangled animals, and the supply of dolphin meat to markets for shark bait (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir and Pierce 2013). Captures may be concealed, given legal prohibitions (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003), hindering the acquisition of reliable data from surveys in some areas (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2010, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>A related concern is the pervasive spread of migrant fishermen across western Africa over the past few decades (e.g., Bakhayokho and Ke´be´ 1991, Binet <em>et al</em>. 2012, Campredon and Cuq 2001, Cormier-Salem 2000, Duffy-Tumasz 2012, Leeney<em> et al</em>. 2015b). Migrant fishermen (including those who move within states) may not abide by local injunctions, taboos or laws, and are often better resourced and more aggressive in their exploitation of local resources (Campredon and Cuq 2001, Binet <em>et al</em>. 2012, Leeney <em>et al</em>. 2015b). They have been implicated in the captures of <em>S. teuszii</em> in areas adjacent to the Banc d’Arguin (Campredon and Cuq 2001). Fishermen from Senegal, Guinea (Conakry), and Sierra Leone exploit the waters of Guinea Bissau, which has a limited artisanal fishing tradition; captures of dolphins and manatees, and declines of nesting sea turtles have been reported, raising concern for <em>S. teuszii</em> (Almeida e Silva <em>et al</em>. 1999, Campredon and Cuq 2001, Leeney <em>et al</em>. 2015b, Maigret 1994, Powell 1990).<br/><br/>Fisheries declines in general may affect populations of <em>S. teuszii </em>in a variety of ways, including reductions in the prey base and increased artisanal fishing effort, leading to greater risk of capture (Weir and Pierce 2013). Industrial fisheries compound this problem by competing for increasingly scarce resources, as well as fishing in zones set aside for artisanal fishermen and dolphins. For instance, trawlers fishing illegally within Conkouati Douli National Park (Republic of Congo) force artisanal fishermen to set their nets closer to shore (for fear of losing their nets in trawls), raising bycatch risks for coastal species (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Coastal developments and their varied cumulative effects represent largely understated, unquantified and poorly recognized threats for <em>S. teuszii</em> (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). The species appears to be timid, and avoidance by dolphins of research boats making close approaches is seemingly prognostic of their susceptibility to disturbance (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir 2015). Anthropogenic noise is an identified threat for cetaceans in general (e.g., Weilgart 2007), and for humpback dolphins specifically; noise from shipping and other industrial activities are considered threats to <em>S. chinensis</em> in Taiwan (Wang <em>et a</em>l. 2007) and Hong Kong (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Port developments are particularly prevalent, and preferred sites frequently overlap with the habitats of coastal dolphins; the scale of some ports suggests that they present effective physical barriers, and thus have potential for disrupting longshore movements throughout their operation. Indirect or “non-lethal” disturbances are likely during construction, and may become more permanent if maintenance (e.g., dredging) and urban development occurs at port sites (Jefferson<em> et al</em>. 2006, 2009). Animals seeking to avoid disturbance might be forced into less optimal areas, with unknown but presumably negative consequences for population health and fecundity, problems that can be exacerbated by coincident ecological constraints (e.g., Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Environmental contamination is a potential threat in some areas and may increase as development accelerates. The habitat preferences of <em>S. teuszii</em> increase the potential for exposure to terrestrial sources of pathogens and pollution (Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). Phosphorite mining in coastal Togo contaminates inshore sediments with trace elements, including cadmium (Segniagbeto and Van Waerebeek 2010, Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Oil exploration and development are underway in many marine areas within the species’ range. Spills and chronic pollution associated with some of these facilities may be detrimental to dolphin health but remain completely uninvestigated in <em>S. teuszii</em>.","There are no global abundance estimates for <em>S. teuszi</em>i. Assessments for the stocks described by Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. (2004) were derived from survey work that was typically localized, sporadic and of limited duration. Varied survey methods were used that do not allow rigorous abundance estimation or comparison. The few associated “guesstimates” are subjective and based on the experience of a limited number of researchers; these provide a crude index of abundance at best.<br/><br/>Populations at the northern (Dakhla Bay, Western Sahara) and southern (Namibe, Angola) extremities of the range appear to be very small, which may indicate the limits of habitat suitability (Weir 2009). Beaubrun (1990) described the Dakhla Bay population as “miniscule”, and sightings in the same area by Notarbartolo di Sciara<em> et al</em>. (1998) reinforce this impression. This population is likely limited to “a few tens of individuals” (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Recent sightings verified with photographs suggest that the subpopulation is still extant (Weir and Collins 2015). The Banc d’Arguin (Mauritania) and Saloum-Niumi (Senegal/The Gambia) populations have been estimated repeatedly at ~100 animals since the mid-1970s (Maigret 1980; Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2004). Incidental sightings from the southern Banc d’Arguin suggest that the species is sighted relatively frequently (Antonio Araujo, Fondation Internationale du Banc d’Arguin, pers. comm. January 2014). However, the stock has never been considered large by those who have completed assessments (Maigret 1980, Robineau and Vely 1998). In the Saloum-Niumi region, encounter rates and group sizes recorded during more recent surveys indicate a small population “unlikely [to] exceed low hundreds, maybe less” (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em>&#160;2000, 2004).<br/><br/>Data and sighting records for Guinea Bissau suggest the continued occurrence of a significant population of <em>S. teuszii</em> into at least the late 1990s (Powell <em>et al</em>. 1996; Spaans 1990; Van Waerebeek <em>et a</em>l. 2000, 2004). Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. (2004) ventured a guess of “at least several hundred, if not more”. A more recent review of sightings records indicates that <em>S. teuszii </em>is still widely distributed in Guinea Bissau (Leeney <em>et al.</em> 2015b), but sightings appear to be declining in regularity (P. Campredon, IUCN country program for Guinea Bissau, pers. comm. 11 May 2015). Recent sightings in the Rio Nuñez (northern Guinea) suggest that distribution across the Guinea Bissau/Guinea border may be continuous (Weir 2015, Van Waerebeek <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>Recent surveys in Cameroon yielded a single humpback dolphin sighting, despite extensive beach- and boat-based survey effort. A recorded encounter rate of 0.39 sightings per 100 km suggests that abundance there is very low (Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014). Boat surveys in Gabon have also yielded low sightings rates. Sporadic surveys between 2003 and 2006 yielded five sightings at an average rate of 0.15 sightings per 100 km. Recent surveys in the Gamba/Sette Cama region of Gabon yielded three sightings of <em>S. teuszii</em> with an encounter rate of 0.13 sightings per 100 km (Collins<em> et al</em>. 2010, Minton 2015). However, sightings rates during shore-based work in Congo are much higher (though are not comparable), and suggest that the coasts of southern Gabon and a limited area in the adjacent Republic of Congo harbour a total population in the high tens or low hundreds (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2013). Most of the Angolan coast is unsurveyed, but localised survey effort demonstrated that a small group of 10 individuals was resident in the Flamingos area (Weir 2009). A limited number of surveys on the Angolan side of the Congo River mouth between 2007 and 2009 failed to yield any sightings (WCS 2011).<br/><br/>The absence of robust estimates precludes any quantitative assessments of trend. However, the evidence of recent work in some areas and a consensus of expert opinions indicates that most populations of <em>S. teuszii</em> are small and that all have experienced significant declines in recent decades (IWC 2011, Collins 2015). The principal cause of these declines are bycatches and directed takes although habitat loss is also likely a contributing factor (Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014; IWC 2011; Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007; Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, 2015; Weir <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Limited research effort for each putative <em>S. teuszii</em> population has either identified significant mortality or yielded strong evidence to infer it. Of particular concern are recently reported dolphin bycatches and suspected declines in Guinea Bissau, which together with neighbouring Guinea, is believed to harbour the largest extant population (Leeney <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<br/><br/>The prior IUCN Red List status assessment concluded that “considering the relatively small numbers observed, and even taking account of the many areas of the species’ range where there has been little or no assessment, the total population probably numbers only a few thousand” (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2008). A review by Collins (2015) reinforces general inferences of small total population size. Considering the relatively small numbers observed, and even taking account of the many areas of the species’ range where there has been little or no assessment, the available information suggests that the species’ total abundance is below 3,000 individuals (Collins 2015). If it is assumed that 50% of these are mature (following Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007), the likely number of mature animals in the total population is likely less than 1,500.",Decreasing,"Atlantic Humpback Dolphins are endemic to the tropical and subtropical nearshore waters of western Africa (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1997, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir and Collins 2015), ranging from Dahkla Bay (Rio de Oro) in Western Sahara (23°52'N, 15°47'W) to Tombua (Namibe Province) in Angola (15°46’S, 11°46’E). Each of the 19 states between (and including) Western Sahara and Angola are presumed to be part of the species' natural range. The current distribution is uncertain given incomplete research coverage, including an absence of survey effort in many areas. However the species has been recorded in 13 of these countries to date, including Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo and Angola (Bamy <em>et al</em>. 2010, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2010, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2015, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011, Weir and Collins 2015, Zwart and Weir 2014). There are no confirmed records for Sierra Leone. Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, mainland Equatorial Guinea or the Democratic Republic of Congo. The species is not known to occur around any of the larger offshore islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including Sao Tome and Principe or Bioko (Fernando Póo) and Annabon (Pagalu) (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Areas of known occurrence</strong><br/>Research in a few relatively well studied areas suggest that the species is patchily distributed and generally uncommon. Areas of regular occurrence in West Africa include the Banc d’Arguin (Mauritania), the river deltas of the Saloum-Niumi region (Senegal and The Gambia), the estuaries and islands of Guinea Bissau and the estuaries of northern Guinea. In Central Africa areas of localised density appear to be limited to Gabon (particularly the coasts of Wonga wongue, Ozuri-Loango and Mayumba) and the northernmost half of the Republic of Congo. Recent work suggests that densities are very low in the Gulf of Guinea states north of Gabon (e.g., Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2014, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2015). There have been recent sightings and/or records in Guinea, Benin, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and the Republic of Congo (Collins 2010, Minton 2015, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2015, Zwart and Weir 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Areas of known absence/gap areas<br/></strong>Research indicates that the species does not routinely occur between Dakhla Bay (Western Sahara) and the Banc d’Arguin (separated by over 400 km) and the Banc d’Arguin and Saloum-Niumi regions (separated by over 700 km). This suggests that the distribution of <em>S. teuszii</em> may be discontinuous across this wider region, with highest densities in optimal habitats and occurrences on intervening coasts rare (e.g., Maigret 1980, Ross <em>et al</em>. 1994, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1997, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Zwart and Weir 2014, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Areas of unknown occurrence</strong><br/>Many areas, including within countries with confirmed records of the species, have received little or no systematic cetacean or coastal research. The presence of humpback dolphins in these areas is thus unknown and uncertain. This includes the coasts of Liberia and Sierra Leone, Equatorial Guinea, The Democratic Republic of Congo and much of the coastline of Angola (including Cabinda).<br/><br/>Distribution gaps in some areas are likely to be the result of increasing anthropogenic pressure in once pristine regions (Van Waerebeek and Perrin 2007, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). For instance several sightings and bycatches were reported from the ‘Petite Côte’ region in Senegal (between Dakar and the Saloum Delta) during the 1950s (e.g., Cadenat and Paraiso 1957), but neither areas were reported to yield sightings between 1975 and 1980 (Maigret 1980) and only one catch (in Fadiouth/Joal 1997) was later identified by Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. (2004) despite extensive survey effort.&#160; No records of <em>S. teuszii </em>have been reported in Ghana where there is an active dolphin fishery and extensive monitoring over many years at several fisheries landing sites; this suggests that the species has either been extirpated or is extremely rare (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1999, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2009, Debrah <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Future work in poorly surveyed or unknown areas may well lead to new records. However they are unlikely to be frequent and the evidence from other parts of the range suggests that if humpback dolphins occur they will not be abundant (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2015, Collins 2015).<br/><br/>Accurately mapping the current distribution of this species is very difficult task given uneven and inconsistent effort across most of the range. The map provided with this account uses the 30 m depth contour as a limiting bound, and provides a very broad approximation of suitable habitats and (perhaps) an original range. The text provided in this account provides a more accurate description of current distribution, and should be used as the primary reference.","The sale of dolphin meat (of a variety of species) for either human consumption or bait has been documented or suspected from almost every <em>S. teuszii</em> range state. Evidence for the consumption and sale of <em>S. teuszii</em> specifically has been reported from Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone (unverified interview data), Togo (suspected), Nigeria, Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo. Many instances involve the secondary (i.e. non-targeted) use of dolphin bycatch, but it is clear that the species has been, and is currently, directly and increasingly, targeted for food in many areas (Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014, Bamy <em>et al</em>. 2010, Cadenat 1956, Clapham and Van Waerebeek 2007, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2013, Lewison and Moore 2012, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2010, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2015, Weir and Pierce 2013). Leeney <em>et al</em>. (2015a) report that “42% of fishermen interviewed in Guinea-Bissau stated that they had accidentally caught a dolphin at least once and 37% of interviewees had eaten dolphin meat.”",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conserving the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin requires the proactive and urgent implementation of practical conservation measures (Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014, IWC 2011, Maigret 1994). Of utmost concern will be confronting the causes of localised declines, particularly fisheries bycatch, directed hunts and habitat loss (Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). Inshore gillnet fisheries are considered the most significant threat, and explicit fisheries management measures to reduce bycatch need to be identified and implemented. Addressing fundamental ecological and biological data gaps is also vital, particularly for improving conservation and management decisions, especially in areas of development. This should include efforts to generate robust and comparable abundance estimates for areas of described occurrence and areas that are under sampled. Surveys for this species can be challenging, but the biggest limitations to date have been an absence of sufficient resources and local capacity to conduct needed work (Ayissi <em>et al</em>. 2014, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2010, Maigret 1980, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The scale of coastal development and associated anthropogenic pressures suggests that identifying and protecting critical habitats (hotspots and foraging sites and areas between) will be pivotal for the conservation of this species. Nine range states (Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Cameroon, Gabon and Republic of Congo) and two states within the wider range (Equatorial Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo), have Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that incorporate proven or potential <em>S. teuszii</em> habitats (Hoyt, 2012; Weir et al., 2011). Their effectiveness varies; artisanal fishing and associated bycatches within these MPAs are known issues (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hoyt 2012, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2003, Weir and Pierce 2013), and financing and lack of management capacity are common problems (e.g., Gallegos <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bennett and Dearden 2014). Explicit consideration of <em>S. teuszii</em> (and other threatened taxa) should be included in threat assessments (such as impact assessments) associated with coastal and estuarine industries (e.g., DEFRA 2011, BBOP 2012, IFC 2012) and where necessary additional and appropriate research undertaken to improve information gaps. If appropriately directed, mitigation actions associated with these projects could improve management of MPAs and/or other critical habitats (e.g., Bull <em>et al</em>. 2013, Pilgrim and Bennun 2014).<br/><br/>Significant conservation concerns for <em>S. teuszi</em>i have been raised for decades (e.g., Cadenat and Paraiso 1957, Maigret 1980, Van Waerebeek 2003, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2004, Weir <em>et al</em>. 2011). In 2003, the IUCN Species Survival Commission’s Cetacean Specialist Group identified <em>S. teuszii</em> as a high priority for research and conservation (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). In 2010 a range of specific research and conservation objectives for Atlantic humpback dolphins were also identified by the Small Cetacean Sub- Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee (IWC 2011). They represented a balanced consensus of scientific opinion and included deliberate consideration of earlier strategies, including the CMS Action Plan for the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (CMS 2008, Perrin and Van Waerebeek 2007). Immediate action is clearly required if additional losses, local extirpations, and potentially even the extinction of the species, are to be avoided in the next few decades.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Furthermore, the species meets criterion A for Vulnerable under the subcriteria A2, A3 and A4 because a reduction of at least 30% over three generations (60 years) is suspected in the past (A2), in a time period including both the past and the future (A4), and in the future alone (A3) based primarily on (c) a decline in habitat quality and (d) actual and potential levels of exploitation (in the form of bycatch in nets). In all three cases, the causes of the reduction have not ceased, are not well understood and may be irreversible.</p>  Although the species may not meet any of the criteria for Endangered at this time, it is likely to do so under C2a(i) in the near future because: 1) the number of mature individuals is or will be fewer than 2,500, 2) the reductions in population size either have been or will be large and pervasive enough to cause a net reduction for the entire species of at least 20% over a period of 2 generations, and 3) the number of mature individuals in each subpopulation across the range either is or will be ≤ 250 individuals.","<p>Studies to date indicate that Snubfin Dolphins occur mainly within shallow, protected coastal and estuarine habitats (Parra <em>et al. </em>2002, 2006b; Parra 2006, Allen <em>et al. </em>2012, Palmer <em>et al. </em>2014b, Brown <em>et al. </em>2016). A study conducted in far northern Queensland indicated that Snubfin Dolphins occurred mostly in waters less than 15 m deep, within 10 km of the coast, and no more than 20 km from the nearest river mouth (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006b). In Cleveland Bay, Snubfin Dolphins preferred shallow water &lt; 2 m deep and shallow areas with seagrass beds (Parra 2006). Similarly, in Keppel Bay the dolphins’ core area of use coincided with the Fitzroy River estuary (Cagnazzi <em>et al. </em>2013b). Within this range, Snubfin Dolphins used shallow (2–5 m), shallow subtidal (5–10 m), and moderate-depth (10–15 m) habitat more frequently than expected by chance. In contrast, intertidal (0–2 m) and deeper water (15–20 m) were used less frequently than expected by chance (Cagnazzi <em>et al. </em>2013b). Boat-based surveys conducted between Keppel Bay and Cleveland Bay further strengthen the importance of riverine-estuarine systems to Snubfin Dolphins in Queensland. The only resident population of Snubfin Dolphins along 800 km of coastline between Cleveland Bay and Keppel Bay was found at the mouth of the Proserpine River in the Whitsundays (Cagnazzi 2017). </p>  In the Northern Territory, most records of Snubfin Dolphins are from estuaries, tidal rivers and coastal areas within 20 km of river mouths. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, Snubfin Dolphins occur up to 20 km offshore, likely because of the consistently shallow waters of the Gulf, being less than 10 m deep in many regions 20-30 km offshore. Some Snubfin Dolphins have been recorded up to 30–50 km upstream in larger tidal rivers and at least as far as 10 km offshore (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a,b). Studies in Western Australia also indicate Snubfin Dolphins mainly occur in shallow coastal areas (Brown <em>et al. </em>2016).","<strong>General<br/></strong>The biological features discussed above render the Snubfin Dolphin particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic threatening processes, including habitat degradation and modification, accidental captures in gillnets and shark exclusion devices, direct catches, vessel strikes, noise pollution, chemical pollution, prey depletion, disease and climate change. The impact and extent of anthropogenic threats varies across regions, with some subpopulations facing greater threats than others. The most pervasive threats across the species’ distribution are habitat degradation and modification, incidental capture in fishing gear and shark control nets, water pollution, climate change and the cumulative impact of these threats.<br/><br/><u><strong>Current threats affecting the population now, and likely to affect the population in future</strong></u><br/><br/><em><strong>Habitat degradation and modification<br/></strong></em>Habitat loss and degradation has been identified among the primary drivers of population declines of large marine animals (Lotze and Worm 2009). Habitat degradation and modification consists of human activities associated with land reclamation, dredging, seismic surveys, drilling, blasting, shipping, and resource extraction that can result in habitat loss and degradation for Snubfin Dolphins. These activities are known to cause local changes in the composition, structure, and function of the coastal and estuarine habitats, through direct removal of habitat (seagrass, mangroves), physical disturbance, sedimentation, increasing commercial and recreational vessel traffic, increasing noise and chemical pollution, and introduction of viral and bacterial pathogens. Such stressors, when combined with the continuing intensification of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a result of climate change, and the associated fluctuations in sea levels, are likely to reduce the quality of Snubfin Dolphin habitat. For example, recent extensive diebacks (7,400 ha) of mangrove forests in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia and in Mangrove Bay (40 ha) in north Western Australia were associated with prolonged drought, high temperatures, and a low sea-level event (Duke <em>et al</em>. 2017, Lovelock <em>et al</em>. 2017). The individual, as well as the cumulative, effects of the above threats are a cause of concern for the long-term viability of Australia’s inshore dolphin populations (Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, DOE 2015, Parra and Cagnazzi 2017).<br/><br/>The coastal zone along Snubfin Dolphins’ range, particularly in northwestern Australia and along the central coast of Queensland, has been substantially modified both inland, to allow mining, agricultural and grazing activities, and along the coast to allow industrial ports, marinas, aquaculture and residential developments (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Queensland Government 2012). For example, by 2020 the port capacity along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) is expected to triple to support the predicted growth in Queensland’s annual coal production (Grech <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2015). IUCN considered this unprecedented scale of development as a serious threat to biodiversity in the GBRWHA (Douvere and Badman 2012).<br/><br/>Activities associated with coastal development, such as land reclamation, vessel traffic and construction, may result in the physical loss and degradation of habitat for cetaceans (Jefferson et al. 2009, Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013). The reduction of suitable habitat may force local populations of Snubfin Dolphins to adjust to the remaining resources through a reduction in survival rate and population size, or emigration to more suitable (though probably suboptimal) areas (Andren 1994, Fahrig 1997, Jefferson 2000). Dredging involved in the construction, maintenance and expansion of ports is of particular concern (Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Todd <em>et al</em>. 2015). Because most ports across the Snubfin Dolphins’ range are located in relatively shallow waters, they all require large volumes of dredging. For example, the Gladstone Western Basin project in Queensland involved the dredging of 22 million cubic meters of soil (Ports Australia 2014).<br/><br/>In addition to their impacts on dolphin habitat, these activities may disturb cetaceans through physical displacement and increased underwater noise (Jensen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rako <em>et al</em>. 2013). For example, in the Fitzroy River, Queensland, it was estimated that two proposed port developments would have overlapped with 14% (49 km²) of the representative range and 17.7% (41 km²) of the core area used by Snubfin Dolphins (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). The impacted area likely would have been substantially larger considering the indirect effects of the construction activities on the nearby habitats and the long-term consequences of daily operating activities on the entire area as result of seabed ‘reclamation’, percussive pile driving, dredging, increased vessel traffic and a decline in water quality (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<br/><br/>Additionally, habitat loss and fragmentation from coastal zone developments and associated activities can influence the population genetic structure of biological populations through their isolation (Keyghobadi 2007). Given the low densities, population genetic structure and limited gene flow found among populations of Snubfin Dolphins, a further loss of genetic variation may reduce the ability of individuals to adapt to a changing environment, cause inbreeding depression (reduced survival and reproduction) and increase their probability of extinction (Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2007, Andrews 2014, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>Incidental capture</em></strong><br/>Entanglement or bycatch of dolphins in recreational and commercial fishing gear is one of the most serious threats to marine mammal populations and species around the world (Read <em>et a</em>l. 2006, Read 2008). Snubfin Dolphins are susceptible to entanglement, especially in gillnets, which are often found closer to the mouths of rivers, creeks and estuaries where Snubfin Dolphins are more likely to be found (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parra and Jedensjö 2009). Snubfin Dolphins have been killed in localized areas along the east coast of Queensland in anti-shark nets set to protect bathers (Heinsohn 1979, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) has been in operation since the early 1960s across many Queensland beaches, using nets, drum lines, or a combination of both to reduce the perceived risk of shark attack. Between 1967 and 1987, 520 dolphins were caught in Queensland shark nets. The Snubfin Dolphin was the most frequently bycaught species in nets north of Mackay (Paterson 1990) with the maximum average of about 10 Snubfin Dolphins per year (assuming that all dolphins caught were Snubfin). In 1992, following the introduction of new methods to minimise by-catch, the number of Snubfin Dolphins caught in the shark nets between 1992 and 1995 declined to a maximum of 1.3 per year (Gribble <em>et al</em>. 1998). At present, 13 shark nets and 149 drum lines are operating in Queensland. Between 1997 and 2011, a total of 11 Snubfin Dolphins were caught in the QSCP corresponding to about 1.8 per year (Meager <em>et al</em>. 2012). Most captures of Snubfin Dolphins in shark nets occurred in the Cairns, Townsville, and Mackay areas, suggesting the potential for local stock depletion (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Snubfin Dolphins are also known to die in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries (Hale 1997, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002). In southern Papua New Guinea bycatch in gillnet fisheries and at least occasional direct catches (of which there are anecdotal records, Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2017) are considered the most significant threats to Snubfin Dolphins. During a 15-day field trip to the Kikori Delta in 2015, five Snubfin Dolphins were confirmed as having been bycaught in large-mesh gillnets (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of Snubfin Dolphin bycatch throughout the species’ range, it is clear that even small numbers are unsustainable and would result in rapid local population declines.<br/><br/><strong><em>Water pollution and climate change</em></strong><br/>Sources of anthropogenic contaminants are likely to increase in the future across northern Australia, as a result of the widespread use of several new pesticides (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012), increasing annual runoff (Chiew and McMahon 2002), and rapid urban and industrial development. The water discharge by many rivers across the Snubfin Dolphin’s range in Australia is of poor quality, often with contaminant concentrations expected to cause environmental harm (Francey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2012, Schaffelke <em>et al</em>. 2012). Accordingly, a recent study detected high levels of organochlorines (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in biopsies collected from Snubfin Dolphins on the Great Barrier Reef along the Queensland coast (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Although exposure to contaminants may not directly cause the death of an animal, it may affect its health in numerous ways, including increased susceptibility to disease and impairment of metabolic functions (De Swart <em>et al</em>. 1996, Bossart 2011).<br/><br/>In Queensland, floods normally exceed their natural ranges of variation due to inland catchment modifications that result in large amounts of fresh water discharge, sediment, heavy metals, nutrients and pesticides being discharged into the estuary and adjacent coastal areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Furnas 2003). The effects of a flood on dolphins generally are temporary until natural conditions are re-established (Fury and Harrison 2011). However, it has been suggested that peaks in dolphin mortality (Holyoake <em>et al</em>. 2009, Meager and Limpus 2014), such as those recorded in Queensland in 2011 (DEHP 2012), occur when floods are sustained for long periods. Modelling studies estimated that the annual runoff in catchments on the east coast of Australia could increase by up to 15% by the year 2030 (Chiew and McMahon 2002). Altered coastal conditions and projected increases in cyclone severity, floods, storm surges, and sea surface temperature could affect dolphin habitat and food resources (Lawler <em>et al</em>. 2007, Meager and Limpus 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>Cumulative impacts</em></strong><br/>The ongoing alteration of coastal systems has greatly undermined the resilience of many biotic communities, populations, and species living in estuaries, making them more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity and anthropogenic stressors (Hobday and Lough 2011). Such effects are likely to be exacerbated when natural systems are subjected to multiple stressors as a result of cumulative impacts and negative synergistic interactions (Venter et al. 2006, Crain et al. 2008, Halpern et al. 2008). Recent studies on other inshore dolphin populations living in highly industrialized regions have reported negative population trends. In the Pearl River estuary, China, modelling of demographic data suggested that Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>) have declined at about 2.4% per year (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2012), in the Yangtze River the population of Yangtze Finless Porpoises (<em>Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis</em>) has been declining at a rate of about 6% per year (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2012), while in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, the local isolated Bottlenose Dolphin (<em>Tursiops </em>sp.) population declined by about 30% over a 12-year period (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2007). By analogy, a reduction in the number of Snubfin Dolphins is likely given the multiple impacts of port expansion, development projects, water pollution, vessel traffic and increasing frequency of natural catastrophic events.","<strong>Population Abundance<br/></strong>At present, there is no range-wide estimate of the abundance of Snubfin Dolphins. Estimates of abundance from mark-recapture studies of photo-identified individuals are only available for a few selected populations across Australia (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Available abundance estimates indicate that Snubfin Dolphins occur in small populations of typically fewer than 150 individuals. Places where abundance has been estimated in Queensland include Cleveland Bay (310 km²) with estimates ranging from 64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 51-80) to 76 (95% CI 65-88) (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a) and Keppel Bay with estimates of 71 (95% CI 61-80) to 80 (95% CI 68-93) (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Available abundance estimates in the Northern Territory are of 19 (18-20) to 70 (49-90) in the Darwin region (1,086 km²) (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2017) and 136 (95% CI 58-317) to 222 (95% CI 146-336) in Port Essington (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a). An estimated 133 (95% CI 127-148) Snubfin Dolphins inhabit waters of Roebuck Bay and 48 (95% CI 41-58) to 54 (95% CI 51-60) the waters of Cygnet Bay, Western Australia (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>There is no quantitative information on trends in abundance across the species’ range. Studies in Cleveland Bay indicated that even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates, population trends would be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size were greater than 20% per year (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a). A multiyear study (ongoing since 2006) in Keppel Bay, Central Queensland, showed that between 2006-2010 abundance estimates of Snubfin Dolphins remained stable at around 70-80 individuals (Cagnazzi 2013), before starting to decline slightly in 2011 to about 68 (64-72) individuals in 2013 (Cagnazzi unpub. data). The decline in abundance estimates was associated with a period of extensive summer flooding that has been affecting this region every summer since 2010. Even though the negative trend is small and the 95% CIs of the estimates overlap, the decline has been consistent since 2011. Indices of abundance, including proportion of marked individuals observed in recent surveys (2014-2016) in the same area, showed a substantial variation across years with the lower estimates being 100 (68-147) in 2014, 163 (132-200) in 2015 and 103 (74-144) in 2016 (Cagnazzi unpub. data).<br/><br/><strong>Population Structure</strong><br/>Genetic analyses conducted on biopsies collected across two nearby populations in the Kimberly, Western Australia (i.e., Roebuck Bay and Cygnet Bay ~ 250 km apart) showed significant levels of population structure at both mitochondrial and nuclear markers (Brown et al. 2014). Contemporary migration rates per generation (20 years) between these two sampling locations were low (&lt; 10%, m &lt; 0.1). Similar results were obtained for three sampling locations in Central Queensland (Cleveland Bay, Keppel Bay, Whitsundays) that are 250-400 km apart (Parra et al. unpublished data). No genetic information on population structure is available from the Northern Territory of Australia or from Papua New Guinea. Overall, the available genetic data suggest that Snubfin Dolphins exist as a metapopulation of small, largely isolated population fragments with limited gene flow.<br/><br/><strong>Summary</strong><br/>The limited data presented above indicate that the Snubfin Dolphin has a restricted and discontinuous geographical distribution, occurs mainly over a narrow strip of shallow coastal waters, occurs in relatively small subpopulations, and the subpopulations are relatively isolated with limited gene flow among them. No subpopulation studied to date is larger than 250 mature individuals (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation has &lt;1,000 mature individuals and that there could well be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals across the range.<br/><br/>Similar to other small cetaceans, Snubfin Dolphins are long-lived (at least 28-30 years), have slow rates of increase (0.037, range 0.02-0.06), late maturity (reproductive maturity at 8-10 years of age) and low reproductive rates (one calf every 2-5 years) (Moore 2015), making them particularly vulnerable to even low rates of human-caused mortality. For example, based on model estimates of intrinsic growth rate (0.037) and generation time (20) for Snubfin Dolphins, Moore (2015) estimated that human-caused mortality rates of 4.4%, 5.0% and 6.5% would lead to declines of 30%, 50% and 80% in population size after three generations. These threshold mortality rates correspond to Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN) and Critically Endangered (CR) under the A criterion (population size reduction).<br/><br/>Although there is little quantitative data on Snubfin Dolphin population trends, a declining population can be inferred throughout many parts of the range given the species’ high vulnerability to human-caused mortality (e.g., from bycatch in gillnets and shark nets), its restricted distribution and reliance on coastal and riverine waters, the low estimates of abundance in surveyed areas, and the increasing habitat degradation and destruction throughout its range.",Decreasing,"Australian Snubfin Dolphins (hereafter referred to as Snubfin Dolphins) inhabit coastal, shallow waters of the tropical and subtropical zones of Australia and southern Papua New Guinea (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2017, Parra and Cagnazzi 2017). The distribution map accompanying this assessment depicts the inferred distribution as a continuous band throughout coastal waters within the 20 m isobath in countries where these dolphins are known or believed to occur. Although distribution is considered continuous across the range, the occurrence of Snubfin Dolphins along the northern Australia coast and southern Papua New Guinea is poorly documented (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002). Gaps in occurrence of several hundred kilometres are apparent along the east coast of Queensland (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<br/><br/>In Australia, Snubfin Dolphins have been reported from Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012), across the northern coastline (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2011) and the Gulf of Carpentaria, and south along the east coast to as far south as the Brisbane River (Paterson <em>et al</em>. 1998, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002). Sightings south of Roebuck Bay in Western Australia and south of Keppel Bay in Queensland are rare and considered extralimital.<br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea, Snubfin Dolphins are known to inhabit the Kikori Delta from Morigio Island east to Baimurru. It is likely that they also occur further east to Karema, which is situated at the headwaters of the Purari River. No Snubfin Dolphins have been sighted around the Daru region or west of Morigio Island, although only limited opportunistic surveys were undertaken (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2017).<br/><br/>There are currently no confirmed records of Snubfin Dolphins from other regions of the Pacific Islands. Anecdotal sightings of Snubfin Dolphins have been reported from the Solomon Islands (Bass 2010). However, these records were provided during interviews to investigate the status of Dugongs (<em>Dugong dugon</em>) in the Solomon Islands, therefore the identification (at both species and genus levels) is highly uncertain.","There is no evidence of traditional use or trade for consumption or medicinal use across the Snubfin Dolphin’s range in Australia. There are anecdotal reports of deliberate catches in southern Papua New Guinea, particularly from the Daru and Baimurru regions (Beasley <em>et al. </em>2014, 2017).",Marine,"<p>Globally, this species was listed on the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened in 2008. It is listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In Australia, Snubfin Dolphins are included on the list of migratory species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act of 1999 and are listed as Near Threatened in The Action Plan for Australian Mammals 2012 (Woinarski <em>et al. </em>2014) </p>  <p>The Australian Government invested $2 million over three years (2014-15 to 2016-17) for the implementation of a Whale and Dolphin Protection Plan. The National Dolphin Conservation Plan has promoted the conservation of dolphins in Australian waters by supporting research into inshore dolphin conservation, including investigating key threats and determining the conservation status of priority species such as the Snubfin Dolphin and the Australian Humpback Dolphin (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>). To identify the primary research objectives to inform the conservation and management of Australia’s tropical inshore dolphins, an expert workshop was held on April 9-10, 2015 in Canberra. The resulting Inshore Dolphin National Research Strategy (DOE 2015) identified the following research objectives applicable to Snubfin and Humpback Dolphins: 1) provide for access to and analysis of standardised national tropical dolphin data to assess distribution and underpin management and conservation, 2) conduct long-term monitoring project to determine trends, mitigate impacts from threats, and support adaptive management and conservation of tropical inshore dolphins, 3) identify, map and assess threats to tropical inshore dolphins, understand related impacts, and mitigate risks, 4) improve knowledge of genetic connectivity dispersal and movement at national, regional and local scales, 5) foster collaborative and national approaches to effectively gather mortality, life history and dietary information from stranded and by-caught specimens, 6) foster community participation in data collection on tropical inshore dolphins and develop a continuous improvement approach to methods and related programs. Guidelines on sampling and statistical methods to achieve some of these objectives have been recently described in Brooks <em>et al. </em>(2014). The highest-priority enabling objective was 1) Indigenous Engagement<strong>: </strong>Foster effective and informed partnerships with Australia’s Indigenous communities to enable sustainable conservation management of tropical inshore dolphins.</p>  <p>Multiple-use marine protected areas in Western Australia (e.g., Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef Marine Park) and Queensland (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Dugong Protected Areas; Moreton Bay Marine Park) cover a substantial portion of the Snubfin Dolphin’s known and presumed habitat and may provide some protection for this species.</p>  <p>Snubfin Dolphins were identified as having conservation value in Commonwealth waters around Australia in the North, Northwest, and Temperate East Marine bioregional plans (DSEWPaC 2012c,b,a). These plans were developed under section 176 of the EPBC Act and are aimed at improving management and decision making in relation to Australian marine biodiversity and resources.</p>  National Guidelines for Whale and Dolphin Watching and for interaction with seismic surveys provide some protection for inshore dolphins (DOE 2005, 2008). Strategies to reduce the entanglement and death of Snubfin Dolphins in nets set by the QSCP for protection of bathers include the use of acoustic alarms, mixed use of nets and drumlines, overall reduction in the number of nets, and establishment of mammal rescue squads (Gribble <em>et al. </em>1998, DPI 2001). However, continued deaths indicate that more effective strategies are required.",Australasian,,false,false,Global
123794774,82031425,Sousa chinensis,Vulnerable,A3cd+4cd,2017,2015-06-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The only available population trend estimate for <em>S. chinensis</em> is an estimated 2.46% annual decline in the size of the subpopulation in HK/PRE (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2012), where there are a number of marine parks and reserves in place for dolphin protection, and where the Hong Kong authorities have put more effort into impact assessment and management than in any other part of the species’ range (see Jefferson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). The situation elsewhere appears to be more dire, with fisheries bycatch being a nearly-universal threat. Population reductions of at least 3.7% per annum (see below for information that human-caused mortality rates of 3.7% would lead to a 30% decline in abundance over three generations) can therefore be inferred over most of the species’ range, due to known incidental mortality from intensive fishing effort using entangling gears, and ongoing habitat loss and degradation due to coastal development. Vessel collisions and environmental contamination appear to be factors as well, in at least some parts of the range. The above inference is supported in several areas by direct and/or indirect evidence, including documentation of bycatch, the intensive use of gillnets and other fishing gears known to entangle small cetaceans, interviews with fishermen who use entangling gears, and the abandonment of areas of previous occupancy (see Xu <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/><br/>The Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin therefore qualifies for Vulnerable&#160;A3cd+4cd, based on an inferred population size reduction, where subcriterion c is interpreted as quality of habitat, and subcriterion d (actual or potential levels of exploitation) includes fisheries bycatch. We can infer a population reduction of greater than or equal to 30% over three generations (75 years), from approximately 1960 in the past to 2035 in the future. This takes into account that the main causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population size, bycatch and habitat destruction/degradation, have not ceased and are not well understood throughout most of the species’ range. Other than in Hong Kong (and to a lesser extent Taiwan), there have been virtually no conservation actions taken to address these threats, and available evidence suggests that they will continue and may even escalate in the future. The assessment of <em>S. chinensis</em> as Vulnerable based on criterion A3cd+4cd&#160;applies, regardless of whether or not the Bangladesh/eastern India animals are included, because it is based on population trends, rather than absolute numbers or a declining range.","Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins occur in tropical to warm-temperate coastal waters, including open coasts and bays, coastal lagoons, over rocky reefs, mangrove swamps, estuarine areas, and areas with sandbanks and mudbanks (Ross <em>et al</em>. 1994, Jefferson and Karczmarski 2001, Parra and Ross 2009). They are rarely encountered in waters more than about 20-30 m deep, or more than a few kilometres from shore (see Jefferson and Karczmarski 2001, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2007, Parra and Ross 2009). Maximum water depths reported for areas where extensive studies have occurred are: 22-23 m (Bangladesh – Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2015), 25 m (Taiwan – Wang <em>et al</em>. 2007), 37.2 m (HK/PRE – Hung 2014), and 9.1m (Kuching, Malysia - Minton <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). They sometimes enter rivers and inland waterways of mangrove forests, but they rarely move more than a few kilometres upstream and usually remain within the range of tidal influence. In at least China and southern Asia, they are rarely found far from estuaries or mangrove habitats (Jefferson and Karczmarski 2001, Wang <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Hong Kong and the PRE, where they have been most-intensively studied, their entire habitat is influenced by freshwater flow from the Pearl River (China’s second largest). Within Hong Kong, they prefer somewhat deeper-water channels for feeding, and occur in higher densities along island shores and natural rocky coastlines (Hung 2008).<br/><br/>Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins&#160;appear to be opportunistic feeders, consuming a wide variety of nearshore, estuarine, and reef fishes. They also eat cephalopods in some areas, but crustaceans are rare in their diet (Jefferson and Karczmarski 2001, Parra and Ross 2009). In Hong Kong waters, they are known to feed on at least 24 species of fishes and one cephalopod. The most common prey species in Hong Kong are the croaker Johnius sp., the lionhead <em>Collichthys lucida</em>, and anchovies <em>Thryssa</em> spp. (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2004). Dolphins often follow trawlers in the Pearl River Estuary, and appear to feed on species that evade or are stirred up by these nets (Jefferson 2000, Hung 2008). In the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh, they are frequently observed preying on fish that fall out of set-bag nets and gillnets when they are being pulled to the surface (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Matang, western Peninsular Malaysia, humpback dolphins are often observed preying on marine catfishes, particularly the Sagor catfish (<em>Hexanematichthys sagor</em>), often consuming larger catfish individuals by eating only the body and leaving behind the catfish head with sharp dorsal and pectoral spines (Kuit <em>et al</em>. 2014). Predation on Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins&#160;is almost unknown, and the estuarine waters where the species most often occurs generally have lower densities of potential predators, including large sharks and killer whales <em>Orcinus orca.</em><em><br/></em><br/>Reproductive biology has only been studied in detail in HK/PRE (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012), and to a lesser extent in Xiamen (Wang 1965, 1995). Typically a single calf is born after a gestation period of slightly less than a year (Parra and Ross 2009). In Hong Kong, calving occurs throughout the year, but there is a significant peak in births from March to June, near the start of the wet season (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012). The average calving interval among a sample of 60 females studied through long-term photo-identification was five years, which is quite long for dolphins (Jefferson<em> et al</em>. 2012). Newborns calves are on average 101 cm in length, and sexual maturity occurs at ages of about 9-10 years for females, and a few years later for males (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Physical maturity is reached at ages of about 14-17 years, and the oldest known individual was 38 years of age, although it is suspected that some dolphins may live into their forties (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Apparent survival for adults and juveniles was estimated to be 0.85 (95% CI 0.725-0.919) in coastal waters of Bangladesh (Smith <em>et al</em>., 2015). Age-specific mortality rates have been estimated for the HK/PRE subpopulation, and for adults from 10-25 years of age ranges from about 0.03-0.15 (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins&#160;throughout most of their range occur most commonly in groups of 2-6 individuals (Parra and Ross 2009). However, aggregations of several dozen have been observed, especially when they are following fishing vessels, in Hong Kong (Hung and Jefferson 2004). Group sizes in the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh, are considerably larger than those recorded elsewhere, with a median estimated size of 19 individuals (n=55) and groups of at least 81 and 205 documented (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Langkawi Archipelago, western Peninsular Malaysia, humpback group sizes range from 1-152 individuals, although group sizes are usually observed between 4-20 animals (Ponnampalam and Jamal Hisne 2011, Ponnampalam<em> et al</em>. 2014). Group sizes are also large in Kuching—up to 45 with mean of 18 (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2016). Social organization, in the few places where humpback dolphins have been studied, is largely characterized by a fission/fusion society of mostly short-term associations—e.g., Hong Kong/PRE (Jefferson 2000, Dungan <em>et al.</em> 2012), Zhanjiang/Leizhou area (Xu <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the Beibu Gulf area (Chen 2013). However, there is some evidence that humpback dolphins in Taiwanese waters have stronger social bonds and more stable association patterns (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may be related to the very small subpopulation size and restricted habitat there.<br/><br/>Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins&#160;are not known to undergo large-scale migrations, although seasonal shifts in abundance have been identified in the HK/PRE area (Jefferson 2000, Hung 2008). Ranging patterns of individuals have been studied in only a few locations, using photo-identification data. In Hong Kong, individual movements tend to occur over relatively small areas of 39-339 km², with an average of about 135 km², much smaller than the subpopulation’s overall range of several thousand km² (Hung and Jefferson 2004, Hung 2008). Similar patterns were found for Xiamen, with an average range of 84 km² (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2011) and the Zhanjiang/Leizhou area, with an average estimated range size of 169 km² (Xu <em>et al</em>. 2015).","<strong>Major Threats</strong><br/>Most Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins&#160;inhabit coastal or estuarine waters of countries with&#160;intensively exploited resources&#160;and competing economic and food-security priorities. Range-wide, incidental mortality in fishing gear (especially in gillnets and trawls) is probably the greatest threat to this species, followed by habitat loss and degradation (Ross <em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, Jefferson and Karczmarski 2001, Parra and Ross 2009, Jaaman <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).<br/><br/>Of 407 Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin&#160;individuals in a photo identification catalogue compiled from photographs taken during 2010-2013 in Bangladesh, 15.0% of the individuals exhibited scars, wounds and mutilations that were almost certainly associated with entanglements in fishing gears while 8.6% exhibited marks that were possibly caused by entanglements in fishing gear. This information combined the extensive spatial overlap between fishing gears indicate that the population is probably threatened with increases in the intensity of fisheries using entangling gears&#160;(Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>Based on a photo-identification catalogue, &gt;30% of the Eastern Taiwan Strait subpopulation (<em>S. c. taiwanensis</em>) exhibited injuries caused by fishing gear, with three individuals photographed with fishing gear attached to their bodies, and one dolphin found dead with fresh injuries caused by fishing gear. This is from a Critically Endangered subpopulation where human-caused mortality needs to be reduced to &lt;1 individual every seven years to ensure long-term survival (Slooten <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Of 10 strandings of humpback dolphins in Hong Kong documented between 1995 and 2004 where the cause of death could be identified, net entanglement was determined to be responsible for three and vessel collision for four (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Specific threats and their impacts have been studied most extensively in Hong Kong. Based on data from strandings, the greatest direct sources of human-caused mortality in Hong Kong appear to be incidental catches in fishing gear (most commonly pair trawls) and vessel collisions (Jefferson 2000, Parsons and Jefferson 2000, Jefferson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). It should be noted that a trawling ban went into effect in Hong Kong in 2013, but illegal trawling still occurs and gillnetting is still legal. By-catch is a nearly-universal threat to the species, and is recognized as the main type of exploitation affecting them.<br/><br/>Vessel collisions may be a significant threat in some areas, especially in Chinese waters (Parsons and Jefferson 2000, Araujo <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Within the Pearl River Estuary, high-speed ferries that travel among major cities reach speeds of 30-40 knots, and there is growing evidence that this threat is a major reason for the declining numbers of dolphins in this area (Hung 2008, Sims <em>et al</em>. 2012, Jefferson unpub. data).<br/><br/>Environmental contamination may also be a threat, at least for subpopulations in highly-industrialized areas like China. However, it is more difficult to assess the relative impacts of this threat compared to others such as bycatch, because pollutants generally do not kill dolphins outright. Concentrations of organochlorines (mainly DDTs, PCBs, and HCHs) in cetaceans from Hong Kong coastal waters are significantly higher than those found in cetaceans in many other parts of the world (Parsons and Chan 1998, Minh <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999, Gui <em>et al</em>. 2014) and it has been suggested that the reproductive success of Hong Kong’s humpback dolphins (including neonatal survival) is being affected (Parsons 2004, Jefferson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). In HK/PRE, DDTs have consistently been the organochlorines found in the highest concentrations, occurring at levels known to cause health effects in other species. Despite being illegal in Hong Kong and China, these chemicals are still being introduced into coastal ecosystems (Parsons 2004, Ramu <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2006, Wu <em>et al</em>. 2013, Gui <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). A number of more recently recognized environmental contaminants (e.g., flame retardants, HBCDs, PBDEs, perfluorinated compounds) have also been identified in Hong Kong humpback dolphins, with unknown long-term effects (Lam <em>et al</em>. 2009, Yeung <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Primary threats in the Eastern Taiwan Strait subspecies (which is currently assessed as Critically Endangered) are habitat loss from marine development, noise and behavioral disturbance, fisheries interactions (especially by-catch), chemical pollution, and reduction of freshwater flow to estuaries (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In the Langkawi Archipelago and Matang Coast&#160;in western Peninsular Malaysia, the main threats are (i) prey resource depletion due to overfishing (both areas have intensive trawl fisheries), (ii) entanglement in artisanal fishing nets, (iii) water pollution from land-based sources (solid waste of various forms), high levels of pathogenic bacteria in the water (Ghaderpour <em>et al.</em> 2014), and (iv) vessel/boat collisions. There are major overlaps between the dolphins’ habitat and fishing activities, water transportation and tourism in both areas (L. Ponnampalam, pers. comm.).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Minor Threats or Those Affecting Only Parts of the Range</strong><br/>In 1960-1962, 36 humpback dolphins were killed in Xiamen waters to evaluate the potential for developing a commercial fishery to provide skin for making leather; however, this fishery was not developed (Wang 1965, 1995, Jefferson and Hung 2004). Currently, <em>S. chinensis</em> is not known to be hunted directly in significant numbers, although directed catches and the sale of humpback dolphin meat has been documented in southern Myanmar.<br/><br/>In Hong Kong, large volumes of sewage discharge and the close proximity of contaminated mud pits means that there is considerable potential for trace metal contamination in local dolphins (Parsons 1997). Indeed, mercury levels were high enough (max: 906 µg kg-1 dry weight) to be considered potentially health-threatening (Parsons 2004, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2006). The disposal of contaminated mud from Hong Kong's dredging and reclamation projects poses an indirect risk to humpback dolphins via their consumption of contaminated prey (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2000). Humpback dolphins inhabit the waters of several coastal ports in Asia that host large volumes of ship traffic, such as Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong. Therefore, they may be highly contaminated with butyltins (BTs) (Tanabe<em> et al.</em>&#160;1998, Tanabe 1999, Parsons 2004). Such port cities often have shipyards, where butyltin from wet paint or paint flecks enters the environment.<br/><br/>Marine construction can cause behavioural disturbance (e.g., construction of the Hong Kong/Zhuhai/Macau Bridge and Hong Kong’s Chek Lap Kok international airport including planned third runway expansion, as well as the associated infrastructure for both projects) (Würsig <em>et al</em>. 2000, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hung 2014). While disturbance effects can be temporary, the most serious concerns are related to activities that may cause injury or mortality, such as percussive pile-driving during pier and bridge construction, and underwater explosives used for channel modification. Reclamation and other types of land-formation can result in the permanent loss of habitat.<br/><br/>Excessive vessel traffic, including high-speed ferries that travel at speeds up to 30-40 knots, has changed humpback dolphin distribution and behaviour in Hong Kong and may potentially interfere with their acoustic communication (Sims <em>et al</em>. 2012, Piwetz <em>et al</em>. 2012, Hung 2014). Long-term monitoring in Hong Kong has shown that mitigation measures, such as bubble curtains, monitored dolphin exclusion zones, acoustic decoupling of noisy equipment, vessel speed limits, no-dumping policies, and silt curtains can reduce impacts, when guided by good science and applied wisely (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Other threats mentioned for subpopulations in Chinese waters, but that are currently thought to be less problematic than the ones described above, include mariculture/aquaculture activities, dynamite fishing, and harassment by dolphin-watching ecotourism operations (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Assessment of subpopulation structure has not been well studied in this species, with many different stocks or ‘population units’ having been hypothesized to occur, without confirmation in most cases. In particular, along the Chinese coastline, <em>Sousa</em> is known to occur in about 6-8 areas of the coast, and there is some evidence suggesting distinct units. However, for the most part, survey effort in intervening sections of the coast is sparse, and empirical studies to examine stock structure using morphological and/or molecular methods have been limited and sometimes of poor quality. Up-to-date comparisons of photo-identification catalogues from different studies are generally lacking. The exception is for the west coast of Taiwan, which is known to have a distinct subpopulation (now considered to be a subspecies) of <em>S. chinensis</em>, from both lack of photo-ID matches and distinct colour pattern differences in relation to mainland study sites (Wang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, 2015, 2016).<br/><br/>Population assessments have been carried out in only a few parts of the species’ range and most have only begun in the last 10-15 years. There is no overall estimate of total population size. By far, the largest known subpopulation (putative) is in the Hong Kong/Pearl River Estuary (hereafter called HK/PRE), which based on line-transect estimates was estimated to contain 2,637 animals in 2005-2008 (CVs range from 19-89%) in mainland Chinese waters, and an additional 82 or so animals in Hong Kong in 2013 (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hung 2014, Jefferson unpublished, Table 1). The HK/PRE subpopulation is the only one with long-term, quantitative data on trends, and the portion of the subpopulation in Hong Kong waters has declined by about 50% in the last 10 years, although this is probably at least partially due to range shifts (Hung, 2014; Jefferson, unpublished). Modeling of demographic parameters from stranding data predicts that the HK/PRE subpopulation may be declining at about 2.46% annually, resulting in potential times to local extinction of as short as around 80 years (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2012). There is also some evidence of a possible decline in line-transect survey sighting rates of dolphins in the western PRE, from 2007/08 to 2010/11 (South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute 2011); however, a robust analysis of abundance trends for the entire subpopulation from empirical survey data is currently unavailable.<br/><br/>Abundance has been estimated for several other locations in Chinese waters, mostly using photo-identification and mark/recapture methods. Abundance for all of the Chinese sites add up to 4,730 animals (Table 1). Estimates of abundance do not exist for suspected small subpopulations in the Dongshan/Shantou, Quanzhou Bay, Ningde, and southern Hainan Island areas (X. Wang <em>et al</em>. 2012, Wu <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are only a handful of abundance estimates available for areas outside of China, including three sites in Malaysia and Thailand (Table 1). Many of these estimates are several years old, and so current numbers may be reduced.&#160;<br/><br/>From photo-identifications of 468 individuals in Bangladesh during 88 sightings, abundance estimates were generated of 132 (95% CI 115-153), 131 (95% CI 124-137), and 635 (95% CI 531-761) for three winter seasons, respectively. The considerable increase in the third season estimate can be explained by the large number of new dolphins identified for the first time during the third year despite the similar intensity and spatial coverage of effort. A robust mark-resight analysis indicates that these abundance estimates are for only a portion of a larger ‘superpopulation’ of unknown size that occupies a more extensive area in both Bangladesh and India (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). However, as discussed above, these animals may turn out to be a species other than <em>S. chinensis</em>. Finally, although not a population estimate per se, groups of dolphins numbering 100-150 have been sighted off Langkawi, Malaysia, and to date, at least 120 individuals have been catalogued (Kimura <em>et al</em>. 2013, Ponnampalam <em>et al. </em>2014). Approximately 200 km south of Langkawi, along the coastline of Matang, Malaysia, at least 110 individual humpback dolphins have been catalogued in an ongoing research project there (Kuit and Chong 2016).<br/><br/>Although the information available is quite sparse, population parameters relevant to the IUCN assessment process have recently been re-examined for <em>S. chinensis</em>, and new estimates have been calculated based on the best available information (Moore 2015), updating the earlier estimates provided by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007). A generation time (T0) of 25 years was estimated, and it was determined that human-caused mortality rates of only 3.7% would be needed to lead to a 30% decline (corresponding to Vulnerable) and 4.1% to result in a 50% decline (corresponding to Endangered) in abundance in three generations (Moore 2015).<br/><br/>The available abundance estimates for <em>S. chinensis </em>(reviewed below) range from a few dozen individuals to over 2,500 for the few areas of the species’ range that have been studied so far (less than one-third of the total range). The sum of the abundance estimates currently available is 5,056 individuals (5,692 if one includes estimates from Bangladesh). There is reason to believe that the relatively-large subpopulation in the Pearl River Estuary, estimated at about 2,600 individuals in 2007, may be exceptional in terms of its size. That subpopulation is the best-studied of the species, and it likely includes about 60-75% or 1,560-1,950 mature individuals (see Jefferson 2000, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012). This means the total species population would have to number&#160;number 13,333-16,666 individuals for it to include 10,000 mature humpback dolphins. This appears unlikely, due to the fragmented range, with this species generally occurring only in association with freshwater inputs, the much-lower subpopulation estimates in other areas where the species has been studied, and probably exclusion of humpback dolphins from Bangladesh and eastern India from the total population estimate.<br/><br/>Several subpopulations have been suggested to be depleted and facing unsustainable anthropogenic threats, e.g., Eastern Taiwan Strait (Wang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Araujo <em>et al</em>. 2014), HK/PRE (Jefferson<em> et al</em>. 2009, Huanget <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Hung 2014), and Xiamen (Jefferson and Hung 2004, Chen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008). However, declines in abundance have not been confirmed through consistent, long-term monitoring, except in Hong Kong (see Hung 2014). Unfortunately, detecting significant declining trends in many humpback dolphin subpopulations may be unlikely before they go extinct, due to their small subpopulation sizes and lack of high-precision survey data (see Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>In Hong Kong, an area where humpback dolphins have been intensively studied for over 20 years and management efforts have been more attentive than in most areas (see Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009), numbers have declined by about 50% in the last decade. Although much of this decline is evidently due to distribution shifts, based on evidence from documented mortalities and the abandonment of areas previously occupied by humpback dolphins coincident with coastal development, some portion of this decline may also be explained by an actual reduction in total abundance (Huang <em>et al.</em> 2012 have modelled a 2.46% annual decline in size of the putative HK/PRE subpopulation). This in turn supports the inference that declines of at least this magnitude are probably occurring in other parts of their range over three generations (about 75 years), especially where subpopulations face similar or greater threats. Although many areas of the range of <em>S. chinensis</em> are not subjected to the same levels of habitat degradation from coastal development as humpback dolphins in HK/PRE, rates of fatal entanglements in gillnets are likely to be especially high in other countries of their range where coastal waters are subjected to particularly high levels of small-scale fisheries to support growing human populations.<br/><br/>Thus, although no overall population trend for the species can be determined, a declining population can be inferred throughout their range, due to intensive threats, especially entanglement in fishing gears, known to kill humpback dolphins, and degradation and loss of critical habitat.",Decreasing,"<p>Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins have been considered to occur in shallow, coastal waters from central China (the northernmost records are from near the mouth of the Yangtze River) in the east, southward throughout Southeast Asia, and westward around the coastal rim of the Bay of Bengal to at least the Orissa coast of eastern India (Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014; see map). However, as mentioned above, humpback dolphins along the coast of Bangladesh (and possibly along the coast of eastern India) were recently found to be phylogenetically distinct. The species regularly occurs in enclosed seas, such as the Gulf of Thailand, and they appear to have their highest densities in and around estuaries (Jefferson and Karczmarski 2001, Parra and Ross 2009). Their distribution is apparently fragmented, with relatively long stretches of coastline between river mouths often having very low or zero densities.&#160;The range maps shows potential habitat within the known range &lt; 30 m in depth.&#160;It appears the only places where they range reasonably far offshore are limited to waters of the continental shelf &lt;30-40 m deep. Due to the uncertain taxonomic status of humpback dolphins from Bangladesh, eastern India and Sri Lanka, at this time the confirmed range of <em>S. chinensis</em> should only be considered to extend west to the Bangladesh/Myanmar border <a>(see map).</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;Specific range limits within the Indo-Malay archipelago also need to clarified.</p><p>There is evidence from several sources suggesting that range contraction has occurred, at least in southern and central China, where fishermen reported seeing humpback dolphins nearly continuously along the mainland coast several decades ago, but where today only about 6-8 areas of regular occurrence are thought to occur (X. Wang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Wu <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160; This means that in some areas, fragmented subpopulations may now occur in what was once occupied by one or more larger, continuous population units</p>","<p>There are few records of direct exploitation or trade in products of this species.&#160; One Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin carcass was recorded during a visit to a fish market in Maungmagan, southern Myanmar, along with 13 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins <em>Tursiops adun</em>cus, and three spinner dolphins <em>Stenella longirost</em>ris. These dolphins were believed to have been caught in a directed harpoon fishery (Tun, 2006). Significant numbers of Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins&#160;have been captured for the aquarium industry, mostly from the Gulf of Thailand, and the impacts of these captures remain unknown (see Smith, 1991). Similar live-captures could be a future threat for humpback dolphin subpopulations in Chinese waters.<em></em></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p><em>Sousa</em><em> chinensis</em> is listed in Appendix I of CITES. Throughout most parts of its range in Southeast and South Asia, conservation actions have been either extremely limited or non-existent. There is active management in Hong Kong (by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, and other government entities), where since about 1993 the species has been protected by the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance, Marine Park Ordinance, and the Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance. The dolphins have been the subject of long-term monitoring and extensive environmental impact assessment for over 20 years (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hung 2014). The establishment of several marine parks form an integral part of the management strategy in Hong Kong, although it is also recognized that other measures are needed for the long-term conservation of the overall subpopulation (Jefferson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Management is less active in Taiwan, but there has been recent progress in monitoring and environmental impact assessment (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010). In mainland Chinese waters, the species is a Protected Species of the First Order, though in most areas there is little actual management of threats, beyond the establishment of marine protected areas (Chen <em>et al.&#160;</em>2009), which generally appear to be inadequately managed and in fact are little more than ‘paper parks’. Therefore, recommendations for the establishment of national nature reserves as the main conservation measures for these dolphins in China must be viewed with some degree of skepticism, without details on how the borders were established and the protective measures provided and their effectiveness.</p>  <p>In 2014, the Government of Bangladesh signed into law the country’s first Marine Protected Area (MPA) spanning about 1,700 km<sup>2 </sup>and encompassing more than 50% of the total number of humpback dolphin sightings made in waters offshore of the Sundarbans mangrove forest between 2004 and 2012. Efforts are currently underway to establish conservation management in this new MPA through fishing closures for entangling gears and modifying fishing practices. Efforts are also being made to generate interest in expanding the MPA into a larger bi-national MPA that includes adjacent coastal habitat in India supporting a portion of the ‘superpopulation’ in Bangladesh described above (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2015). One promising approach for reducing humpback dolphin bycatch in these waters is an initiative that requires gillnet fishermen to attend their nets, release entangled dolphins, and collect data and biological samples from mortalities in exchange for measures taken to improve their safety at sea </p>  <p>In 2015, research data on Langkawi <em>Sousa</em> was used to make recommendations in the drafting of the Langkawi Plan (Revision) 2030 (by the Department of Town and Country Planning) for speed limit zones in the main ferry travel routes in and out of Langkawi. However, actual on-the-ground conservation action based on this recommendation has yet to take place.</p>  <p>More conservation-oriented research is needed throughout the range of Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins to design effective management programs. There is a vital need to identify and mitigate the main threats facing demographically-isolated subpopulations and reduce their impacts to sustainable levels. Particular attention should be given to addressing bycatch and protecting critical habitat in areas where there are strong competing interests for human development (Parra and Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Where marine protected areas are established for humpback dolphin conservation, it is essential that they be managed using the best available scientific information, and that the major threats to animals in those area be eliminated or at least effectively reduced to sustainable levels.</p>  <p>A key outstanding question is the taxonomic identity of humpback dolphins in Bangladesh and eastern India. Further investigation is needed on the genetic identity of these animals with comparisons made among samples obtained from previously unsampled areas and the analysis of additional genetic markers. Due to their apparent phylogenetic distinctiveness, once the taxonomic identity of this form has been confirmed, it should be assessed separately.&#160;<em></em></p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

130482064,2475,Balaenoptera borealis,Endangered,A1abd,2018,2018-06-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The cause of the population reduction in Sei Whales (commercial whaling) that occurred in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is reversible and is understood and has been brought under control. For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The three-generation time period for applying criterion A is 70 years. Following the end of large-scale whaling in the late 1970s, some recovery of the population is inferred based on standard assumptions about the population dynamics. Recent abundance estimates for Sei Whales from the North Pacific are consistent with the inferred rate of recovery. There is little direct evidence of recovery in the Southern Hemisphere where the greatest declines occurred, but there has also been little monitoring effort there, and the recovery predicted by the population model is assumed. The species has been listed as Endangered, but plausible projections of the population size indicate that the global population of&#160;mature animals&#160;may have recovered to around 30% of the 1948 level by 2018. The corresponding extent of reduction, at 70%, is at the borderline between Endangered and Vulnerable under criterion A1. In view of the Red List rule that taxa should remain in a higher category of threat for five years after ceasing to meet the criteria for that category, the species remains classified as Endangered, but should be re-evaluated in five years, at which time it can be reclassified to Vulnerable unless new data cast doubt on the predicted recovery.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Sei Whales exhibit a greater variety in diet than some other large whales such as Blue Whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), but tend to feed on only one type of prey at a time. Whale stomachs examined in the northeastern Atlantic contained copepods and euphausiids (Jonsgård and Darling 1977). Of 21,713 stomachs examined from pelagic catches in the North Pacific during 1952-71, 82.7% contained copepods only and 12.6% contained euphausiids only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977). Sei Whale stomachs analysed in the eastern North Pacific off California contained euphausiids and anchovies (Rice 1977) and off British Colombia they fed primarily on copepods in some years and euphausiids or fish in other years (Flinn <em>et al</em>. 2002). Stomachs of Sei Whales taken by Soviet operations in the western North Pacific included copepods and euphausiids, as well as Anchovy, Sardine, Saury, Walleye Pollock, Mackerel, Capelin, and squid (Shuntov and Ivanov 2015). Some of these prey items plus euphausiids were also found in stomachs of Sei Whales taken in Japanese operations in the northwest Pacific in 2009 (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2012). Of 31,494 stomachs examined in the Southern Hemisphere during 1961-66, 54.3% contained euphausiids only, 30.5% contained copepods only, and 14.4% contained amphipods only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977).<br/><br/>Studies have shown a clear differentiation between Sei Whale and Bryde’s Whale habitats in the western North Pacific, where each species favoured different ranges in sea surface temperatures and related covariates, Sei Whales being found in areas with lower sea surface temperatures (Sasaki <em>et al.</em> 2013, Murase <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, in other parts of the world Sei and Brydes Whales have been found to be sympatric in the same season (Gallardo <em>et al</em>. 1983).&#160;</p>  <p></p>","<p>Sei Whale exploitation by modern whaling was particularly intensive in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Pacific from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, following the depletion of Blue, Fin (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) and Humpback (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) Whales. Sei Whale stocks were seriously depleted during this period. Exploitation in the North Atlantic occurred over a longer period and was less intensive, except in the eastern North Atlantic, where the population appears not to have recovered from early modern whaling. Commercial exploitation ceased in the North Pacific in 1975, in the Southern Hemisphere in 1979 and in the North Atlantic in 1989 (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2016). Catches by Japan under scientific permit resumed in the North Pacific in 2002. From 2004-2013, the annual take was 100 animals and was increased to 134 per year from 2017. The IWC Scientific Committee has advised that this level of take will not harm the stock (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>There are records of ship strikes and entanglements involving Sei Whales (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009, Henry <em>et al.</em> 2014), but it is unclear whether they constitute a significant source of mortality. Because of the Sei Whale’s offshore distribution, most ship strikes could go unnoticed.<br/><br/>Rice (1961, 1974) reported a pathological condition in several North Pacific Sei Whales that resulted in deterioration or loss of baleen; however, the current frequency of this condition, and its impact (if any) on the population, are unknown.<br/><br/>An unusual mass mortality of at least 343 Sei Whales that occurred in southern Chile in March 2015 is still under investigation but may have been caused by a harmful algal bloom associated with a developing El Niño event, the frequency of which can be expected to increase as the Pacific Ocean warms (Häussermann<em> et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p></p>","<p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes three stock divisions for Sei Whales in the North Atlantic: Nova Scotia (including the waters off the east coast of the U.S.A.); Iceland-Denmark Strait; and Eastern (including the waters of Spain, Portugal, British Isles, Faroes, and Norway), but the divisions were chosen on largely arbitrary grounds (Donovan 1991). The West-Greenland-Labrador Sea area is not assigned to a stock division, but Sei Whales are present there. Genetic comparisons of Sei Whales from different North Atlantic locations found no evidence for population structure but did not rule it out (Huijser <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>About 17,000 Sei Whales were recorded caught by modern whaling in the North Atlantic (Allison 2017). In addition, a proportion of the approximately 13,000 unspecified large whales caught in the North Atlantic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries would have been Sei Whales, given that the specified catch in the same areas in the following years included Sei Whales. Sei Whales appear to have been depleted in the eastern North Atlantic, with nearly 10,000 recorded taken in Norwegian and British waters prior to 1940 (not counting unspecified whales), but fewer than 250 since then. The species seems to be virtually absent there now: Norwegian surveys of northeast Atlantic waters in 1987, 1989, and annually from 1995–2009 have yielded only two Sei Whale sightings (NAMMCO 2010).<br/> <br/> A summer 2007 survey of the European Atlantic (an area west of British Isles, and Biscaya, northwestern Spain) yielded an estimate of 366 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.33) Sei Whales (Macleod <em>et al</em>. 2009). No Sei Whales were seen in surveys on the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, Sei Whales are still abundant in the central North Atlantic (Iceland-Denmark Strait IWC stock area), especially southwest of Iceland south to 50°N in summer. The only survey with reasonably complete coverage and designed specifically for the purpose of estimating Sei Whale abundance was in 1989, and yielded a population estimate of 10,300 (CV 0.27) (Cattanach <em>et al</em>. 1993). Areas of Sei Whale summer abundance seem to shift markedly between years, more so than for other baleen whale species (Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. 2004). Sei Whales were among the most commonly sighted whales in a 2004 summer survey in the mid-Atlantic Ridge region, with a total of 53 sightings (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2008). The 2007 Trans-NASS survey yielded an estimate of ~5,000 (CV ~0.5) Sei Whales but covered a smaller area than the 1989 survey (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2010). Surveys of U.S. and southern Nova Scotian waters during 2010-14 yielded an estimate of 919 (CV 0.31) Sei Whales averaged (with inverse variance weighting) over spring, summer, and fall, or 849 (CV 0.42) whales in summer only (Palka <em>et al</em>. 2017). These estimates are similar to the estimate of 870 Sei Whales obtained by Chapman and Mitchell (1977) from data collected in this area during 1966-69. About 1,200 Sei Whales were taken off Nova Scotia during 1962–72. Surveys of Atlantic Canadian waters in 2007 yielded just two Sei Whale sightings, too few to estimate abundance (Lawson and Gosselin 2009). Chapman and Mitchell (1977) estimated the abundance in the Labrador Sea-West Greenland area at 965.&#160; <br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>The last stock assessment of North Pacific Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was in 1974 (IWC 1977). The “exploitable” population (animals of legally catchable size) was estimated to have declined from 42,000 in 1963 to 8,600 in 1974 (Tillman 1977). Over 40,000 Sei Whales were caught during this period, out of a total of about 70,000 taken in the North Pacific since the start of modern whaling at the beginning of the 20th century (Allison 2017). A 75% reduction in Sei Whale catch rates at California whaling stations during the 1960s is consistent with an ocean-wide decline (Rice 1977).<br/><br/>From sighting surveys conducted under the IWC POWER programme in July and August 2010-2012, Hakamada <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated 29,632 (CV 0.24) Sei Whales in the area east of 170°E. To this can be added an estimate of 5,086 (CV 0.38) obtained from national surveys west of 170°E in the same months in 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016), giving a total of about 35,000 Sei Whales.<br/> <br/> Assuming that the population was about 50% “exploitable” when commercial whaling ceased in 1975, the recent abundance estimate (2008-12, see above) would correspond roughly to a doubling of the population over the 35-year intervening period, representing a recovery rate of about 2% per year. Thus, the older and newer abundance estimates appear to be broadly compatible (see Supplementary Materials), but the relatively simple analysis of catch and whaling effort data by Tillman (1977) is no longer an accepted method to obtain abundance estimates.<br/> <br/> Sei Whales appear to have been reasonably common in the eastern North Pacific, with over 2,800 taken off Vancouver Island, Canada between 1948 and 1967 (Allison 2017) and 384 whales taken by Californian whalers between 1958 and 1971 (Rice 1977). The estimated abundance for the U.S. west coast was only 56 whales from surveys in 1996 and 2001 (Barlow 2003), but this has increased to 519 whales (CV 0.40) from surveys in 2008 and 2014 (Barlow 2016).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>The IWC arbitrarily divides Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales, along with other Southern Hemisphere baleen whales, into six longitudinally defined management areas. Sei Whales in all six areas have been classified as Protection Stocks by the IWC since 1978. Over 200,000 Sei Whales were recorded taken by modern whaling in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905–1979. The largest catches were during 1960–72, when they exceeded 5,000 in every year, and exceeded 20,000 in each of the 1964/65 and 1965/66 seasons. Most catches were taken in summer by pelagic fleets operating south of 40°S, but winter catches were also taken from land stations in Brazil, Chile, and South Africa (Allison 2017). The catches by the former Soviet Union were grossly underreported at the time: 33,000 Sei Whales were reported taken during 1950-78, but subsequently records totalling nearly 60,000 were found and are included in the above figures (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The last assessment of Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was conducted in 1979 (IWC 1980). Some extra information on these assessments is given by Horwood (1987). Based on catches/sightings per unit effort from Japanese catch and scouting vessels, the “exploitable” stock size (whales of legal size, approximately 2/3 of total population), excluding Area II (South Atlantic sector), was estimated to have declined from about 64,000 in 1960 to about 11,000 by 1979. The population assessment method failed to produce an estimate for Area II, because nearly all the catch for this area was taken in just two seasons (1964/65 and 1965/66), yet the abundance indices suggested a more continuous decline during the 1960s and 1970s (IWC 1980). This suggests that whales move between management areas, and that these areas do not correspond to demographically distinct populations.<br/> <br/> Other available evidence also suggests a severe and rapid decline in Sei Whale stocks during the 1960s and 1970s. The catch and sighting rates from winter whaling operations off Brazil and South Africa show very sharp declines. Abundance indices from the Brazilian whaling ground for Sei Whales during 1966–81 (da Rocha 1983) declined by about 90% during 1966–72. Catch and sightings indices off Durban, South Africa for 1965–74 (Best 1976) declined by over 95%. Tag-recapture data from pelagic whaling suggested an approximately six-fold decline between 1962 and 1976 (IWC 1980).<br/> <br/> IWC (1996) gives a total population estimate for Sei Whales south of 30°S in summer of about 10,000 in 1983 based on a combination of International Decade of Cetacean Research (IDCR) and Japanese Scouting Vessel (JSV) sightings data. It is difficult to know how much reliance to place on this estimate because no variance is given, but it is consistent with a severe decline. No more recent data covering a wide area are available, except for the area south of 60°S, which is outside the main range of Sei Whales. In the absence of dedicated surveys in Sei Whale habitat, and corresponding abundance estimates, it is not possible to verify whether there has been any increase in Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales since the cessation of whaling.<br/> <br/> Because of the erratic local appearance of Sei Whales, recovery is hard to detect from observations collected in limited areas. No recovery of Sei Whales in Brazilian waters has been detected since their depletion (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997, Andriolo <em>et al</em>. 2010), but Iñíguez <em>et al. </em>(2010) reported on a possible slow recovery of Sei Whales in the southwestern Atlantic based on land and aerial sightings in Argentina. <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Generation time and maximum rate of increase</strong></em><em></em><br/>The generation time for Sei Whales is estimated to be 23.3 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The three-generation time window for applying the IUCN Red List decline criterion A is 1948–2018.<br/><br/>For assessment purposes, the IWC Scientific Committee has used a natural mortality rate of about 0.06, an age at first reproduction declining with stock depletion from 12-13 years to 10-11 years, and an annual pregnancy rate increasing with stock depletion from 0.27 to 0.37-0.39 (IWC 1977, 1980, Horwood 1980). Assuming a maximum annual pregnancy rate of 0.40, a minimum age of first reproduction of 10 years, and no juvenile mortality, the maximum rate of increase is 2.7% per year. Horwood and Millward (1987) also conclude that the maximum rate of increase for Sei Whale populations is less than 3% per year. Newer data on life history parameters have been collected in the northwestern Pacific during 2004-2015 and are awaiting analysis (IWC 2017).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Population assessment</strong></em><br/>Because the available published assessments for this species are not up to date, an updated population assessment is conducted here to enable assessment of the population reduction over the period 1948-2018 relative to the Red List A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, a conventional population assessment model was used to provide an illustration of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (“recruitment”) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately. Based on the above information, fitted population sizes for the aged 1+ population size were 12,000 in 1989 in the North Atlantic, 35,000 in 2011 in the North Pacific and 10,000 in 1983 in the Southern Hemsiphere.<br/><br/>The results are provided in the Supplementary Materials, which constitute an integral part of this assessment. Results indicate severe depletion from 1948 to a minimum in the 1970s, followed by gradual recovery such that the global population of mature animals in 2018 is predicted to be around 30% of the 1948 level and to be increasing.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Sei Whale is a cosmopolitan species, with a mainly offshore distribution. The species occurs in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere, but there are no confirmed records in the northern Indian Ocean (Rice 1998, Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/> <br/> Sei Whales migrate between tropical and subtropical latitudes in winter and temperate and subpolar latitudes in summer, staying mainly in water temperatures of 8-18°C. Their winter distribution seems to be widely dispersed and is not fully mapped (Horwood 1987, 2017). Sei Whale sightings in the tropics and subtropics can be hard to confirm due to difficulty differentiating them from Bryde’s Whales.<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Atlantic the summer distribution seems to be quite variable from year to year; however, Sei Whales typically occur north of an arc running from south of Nova Scotia in the west, to the northwestern British Isles and Trondheim (Norway) in the east. They occur as far north as the Davis Strait and the northern end of the Denmark Strait, and to about 70°N in the Norwegian Sea. Occasional incursions into other areas have been noted (e.g., the Gulf of Maine, Schilling <em>et al</em>. 1993). Peaks of catch rates in early and late summer suggested a northward and southward migration through the former Nova Scotia whaling ground (Mitchell 1975). Sei Whales have been scarce in Norwegian and British waters in recent years despite significant catches there in the past. Sei Whales were caught in limited numbers, mainly in late summer, off northwestern Spain (Aguilar and Sanpera 1982). There are very few records from the Mediterranean (Notarbartolo di Sciara and Birkun 2010).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known, but some animals occur off the central eastern seaboard of the U.S.A., and they are occasionally seen in winter as far south as the Caribbean Sea and Cap Blanc, Mauritania (Rice 1998, Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2012). Satellite tagging has shown Sei Whale migration from the Azores to the Labrador Sea and to the Canary Islands (Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Winter catches of Sei Whales in an area north of the Cape Verde Islands by the illegal catcher boats Sierra and Tonna in the late 1970s may indicate wintering grounds there (Best 1992).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Pacific, the Sei Whale summer distribution is mainly north of 40°N, including the offshore North Pacific, the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. They are common only in the southernmost part of the Bering Sea, and have never been recorded in Bering Strait or the Arctic seas. They do not penetrate far into the Okhotsk Sea. Although they are rare in summer south of 40°N in the offshore central and eastern North Pacific (IWC 2018a) the presence of some Sei Whales in Hawaiian waters in both summer and fall has been confirmed (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known. Surveys in February-March 1993-95 south from Japan to the Philippines, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands found no Sei Whales (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996). However, Sei Whales were caught in winter off the Ogasawara Islands during 1923-49. Although Sei and Bryde’s Whales were not routinely distinguished at the time, Omura and Fujino (1954) found that, of a sample of “Sei” Whales examined in detail, those caught during November-April were true Sei Whales whereas those caught in May were Bryde’s Whales. Sei Whales were marked around the Northern Mariana Islands and to the northeast in January-February 1972 and some of them were recaptured in summer in the northeastern and northwestern North Pacific (Masaki 1977). Sei Whales were also sighted on a January-April survey of the waters off Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in 2007 (Fulling <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Surveys of the Eastern Tropical Pacific during 1986-2003 showed that Sei Whales were probably rare during the months surveyed (July to November) but there were problems distinguishing them from Brydes Whales (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <em><br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em></em><em></em><br/>The summer (January–February) distribution in the Southern Hemisphere is mainly in the zone 40–55°S in the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans, and 45–60°S in the South Pacific (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), with occasional catches recorded in the high Antarctic (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>Sei and Bryde's Whales were distinguished in Peruvian whaling records from 1973; after that date, Sei Whales were caught or seen on the Peruvian grounds (3°-9°S) mainly, but not exclusively, in the austral winter (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1982, 1984).<br/><br/>Sei and Brydes Whales do not seem to have been distinguished in the records of whaling stations in Chile, because only Sei Whales are featured in their catch and sighting records (Maturana 1981, Allison 2017) but Gallardo <em>et al</em>. (1983) found both Sei and Brydes Whales present in summer (February) in most of the range of Chilean whaling operations (32°–38°S). Subsequently, Sei Whales have been observed feeding off Chile (~42°S) during the summer (Galletti <em>et al</em>. 2005). This species is also regularly observed in the Magellan Strait in summer (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sei Whales are also regularly sighted in the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas (South Atlantic) with peak occurrence between February and April (Frans and Augé 2016).<br/><br/>Sei Whales were also caught in the austral winter off Costinha, northeastern Brazil (7°S) during 1947-77. Sei and Brydes Whales were distinguished only from 1967; after that date, Sei Whales represented about 90% of the catch of the two species combined (Williamson 1975; da Rocha 1983).<br/><br/>The catches of ""Sei"" Whales recorded off Angola, the Congo, Gabon, and countries in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century were probably mainly Bryde's Whales (Weir 2010). Platform-of-opportunity surveys of cetaceans in these waters during 2004-09 resulted in only one Sei Whale sighting out of over 3,000 cetacean sightings, including 88 sightings of Brydes Whales (Weir 2011). Catches off western South Africa (Saldanha Bay) and eastern South Africa (Durban) peaked in spring and autumn, and are suggestive of populations on migration routes (Horwood 1987). One specimen is known from the northwest cost of Java, Indonesia (Flower 1865). The overall winter distribution in the Southern Hemisphere remains poorly known<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, but winter sightings of Sei Whales including newborns close to the Vitória-Trindade Seamount Chain in Brazil suggest that Trindade Island and Martin Vaz Archipelago may represent a wintering ground for this species (Heissler <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>","<p>Commercial hunting of Sei Whales ceased in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, but catches under Special Permit resumed in the North Pacific in 2004 at the level of 100 per year (increased to 134 per year in 2017; IWC 2018b). The products are sold on Japanese domestic markets.

This species is included in CITES Appendix I although Iceland has held a reservation against this listing since 2000. Japan has no reservation on the Appendix I listing for North Pacific Sei Whales, and the continued catches are currently the subject of a compliance investigation by the CITES Secretariat (CITES 2017b).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is strongly migratory, with inland populations moving south or to the coast after breeding (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species breeds from May onwards, nesting later further to the north depending on the timing of the thaw (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It usually nests solitarily on smaller waters but may nest in loosely colonial groups on larger waters (e.g. several pairs nesting a few metres apart on the same lake) (Snow and Perrins 1998). On migration, large flocks of 200-1,200 individuals may form, with similar concentrations occurring on rich marine fishing grounds during the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is most commonly observed singly, in pairs or in small scattered flocks during this season however (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on freshwater pools or lakes in open moorland, blanket bogs or open and wet peatland habitats (Campbell 1987, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). It will nest on pools as small as 10-20 m long or on lakes up to 5 ha in area, showing a preference for those in treeless areas that have well-vegetated margins and low islets or promontories on which to nest (Snow and Perrins 1998). It generally avoids waters with dense floating or emergent vegetation and steep rocks above the water, and if feeding conditions are inadequate in the pool chosen for breeding the species may fly to the coast or to lakes with higher abundances of fish in order to feed (Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season, the species frequents inshore waters along sheltered coasts, occasionally occurring inland on lakes, pools, reservoirs and rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, frogs, fish spawn, aquatic insects, annelid worms and plant matter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a small depression or a mound of plant matter, built in shallow water up to 10 m from the shore or very near the water's edge, on islets or small promontories (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Nesting pairs will often re-use the same site in successive years (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong></strong> <br/><p></p>","<p>Highly vulnerable to oil spills, especially in wintering areas where large concentrations form (e.g. on rich fishing grounds) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Climate change is likely to result in a large shift in the North American summer range, possibly resulting in a decrease in the amount of suitable habitat. The Red-throated Loon has been found to be frequently caught as bycatch in studies in the Baltic (Schirmeister 2003, Zydelis <em>et al.</em> 2013) and in the northwest Atlantic (Warden 2010). A small study in the German Baltic found 370 drowned birds over 12 winters (HELCOM 2013). This species also has a strong reaction to disturbance from ships and helicopters, resulting in an altered population distribution and habitat fragmentation. It is considered to be a species at relatively high risk of collision with wind turbines and other offshore infrastructure due to nocturnal flight behaviour and low manoeuvrability (Garthe and Hüppop 2004).</p><p></p>","The global   population is estimated to number c.200,000-600,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015), while national population estimates include: c.50-10,000 wintering   individuals in Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000   wintering individuals in Russia (Brazil 2009).

After mating (from June onwards) males migrate long distances prior to their flightless moult, most travelling in small groups to inshore or offshore coastal waters<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988). Females and juveniles leave the breeding grounds in September<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious when not breeding<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988) with males forming large congregations during the flightless moulting period<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) and large flocks of several hundred to a thousand<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998) or occasionally over 100,000 individuals occurring during winter<strong></strong> (Scott and Rose 1996). Non-breeders often oversummer on the wintering grounds<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on Arctic dwarf heath<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005) or boggy tundra on pools, small lakes, streams<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and slow-flowing rivers<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for freshwater habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) with low banks<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), small islets<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys<strong><sup> </sup></strong>or among mossy bogs<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover<strong></strong> (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). It generally avoids areas with steep slopes or wetlands enclosed by forest<strong></strong> (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) the majority moult and overwinter at sea<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) on shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) (optimally 5-15 m) (Scott and Rose 1996) with abundant benthic fauna<strong></strong> (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. barnacles and shrimps)<strong></strong> (Johnsgard 1978), worms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), echinoderms, isopods, amphidods<strong></strong> (Kear 2005) and insects<strong></strong> (e.g. midges and caddisflies <strong></strong>[del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992])<strong></strong> as well as small fish<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and fish eggs<strong></strong> (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as seeds, roots and tubers<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) close to water<strong></strong> (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) or placed further away in dwarf heath<strong></strong> (Kear 2005).  <p></p>","<p>Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten this species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while development associated with oil drilling sites can cause additional, low-level impacts through human disturbance and the degradation of food resources (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). Some large populations border oil fields and proximity to drilling and transport puts the population at high risk of oil pollution (Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). However, one study found that although the 1996 Sea Empress oil spill in Carmarthen Bay resulted in a rapid and drastic reduction in Common Scoter numbers in the area, complete recovery occurred after three winters with no observable long-term effects (Banks <em>et al</em>. 2008).  </p><p>Climate change is thought to negatively impact the species at present and in the future through habitat loss and ecosystem degradation. Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for this species, and remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in Siberia (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005). In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher <em>et al</em>. 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Eutrophication in the Baltic Sea resulting from agricultural run-off, could also cause the loss of key prey items, e.g. bivalves (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>  The risk of bycatch is thought to affect a majority of the population, as reported in the Gulf of Gdańsk (Stempniewicz 1994), and the commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat, through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Further threats to food resources include the loss of benthic habitats caused by sand and gravel extraction, although Skov <em>et al.</em> (2011) suggest that in the present-day Baltic region, this is occurring at insufficient levels to be responsible for declines in waterbirds. Hunting is contributing to mortality in some parts of the species’ range, but not thought to drive significant population decline. In Denmark, c.2,800-5,200 Common Scoters are harvested per year (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006) but no data is available for other countries, although hunting of Common Scoters is legal in some EU countries (HELCOM 2013b). Interaction with wind farms could pose a potential threat to the species. While Stewart <em>et al</em>. (2007) showed that duck densities were more adversely affected by wind farms than other groups of species, Dürr (2013) found the opposite, stating that collision rates between ducks and wind turbines are low compared to other species groups. Avian influenza is present in the population, but as yet there is no evidence that it has caused significant mortality events (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gudmundsson <em>et al.</em> 2010). High-speed ferries have been suggested as a major cause of Common Scoter disturbance by a study in the Kattegat Sea, Denmark (Larsen and Laubek 2005).<p></p>  <p></p>","The total population has been estimated to number 1,600,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006), which probably includes c.1,070,000 mature individuals, assuming that they account for around 2/3 of the population.&#160;The European population is estimated at 107,000-131,000 pairs, which equates to 214,000-263,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species breeds in <strong>Iceland</strong>, eastern Greenland (<strong>Denmark</strong>) and northern <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, across Scandinavia and northern parts of western and central <strong>Russia</strong> (e.g. Collinson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006).

It is therefore highly susceptible to stochastic events, and remains at risk of mammalian introductions and avian and reptile predators. <p></p>","This species breeds during summer; females lay eggs between early May (perhaps late April) and early July, incubating a single egg until as late as early August, with the first chicks hatching in early June and the latest chicks fledging in early October (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008, J. Bried and N.V. Neves <em>in litt.</em>)<strong></strong>. Its diet is poorly known, but thought to consist of small fish and squid, and it generally feeds on prey of a higher trophic level than <em>H. castro</em> (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>.<br/><strong> <p></p></strong>","<p></p>  <p>The two known breeding islets are currently free of introduced mammalian predators. They are, however, only 1km offshore of the inhabited island of Graciosa, and the large number of summer tourists to one of the islets means the introduction of rodents is a possibility (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2016). Further to this, a cargo ship containing livestock ran aground on one of the breeding islets in 2000, leading to concerns over pollution and rodents escaping ashore (Bolton <em>et al</em>. 2008). Madeiran Wall Lizards, introduced to the Azores in the 19th Century, have been noted predating large chicks on Praia Islet (Neves <em>et al.</em> 2017). The predation appears to be a recent behavioural change and may currently only be carried out by a few individuals. As the majority of the global population of Monteiro's Storm-petrel breed on the islet, as such, this novel source of chick predation has the potential to cause significant declines (Oliveiro <em>et al. </em>2016, Neves <em>et al</em>. 2017). High predation rates of adults by the native Northern Long-eared Owl <em>Asio otus</em> have been reported, which, given the small global population of <em>H. monteiroi</em>, may prevent population expansion (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, this natural predation is unlikely to drive significant declines. Inter-specific competition for natural nesting cavities with Cory’s Shearwaters is known to result in increased mortality for the smaller petrel species (Bried and Neves 2015), the impact of this has not been evaluated (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2016). There has, however, been a six-fold increase in the number of nesting attempts using artificial nests on Praia Islet between 2000 and 2011, with the number of attempts made in natural nests not changing over the same period (Bried and Neves 2015). Further to this, overall breeding success between 2000 and 2007 was significantly higher in artificial nests (Bried and Neves 2015). This will likely reduce the impact of competition for nesting cavities, as the artificial nests cannot be excavated by Cory’s Shearwaters (Bried and Neves 2015).</p>  Light pollution is likely to disorient a small number of fledglings each year, though this has not been documented for Monteiro's Storm-petrel as yet (Oliveiro <em>et al.</em> 2016) and the colonies are not adjacent to areas of considerable light pollution. Hence, the current threat is unlikely to exceed a negligible impact. Both of the known breeding islets lie within 2 km of the main shipping route for large passenger ferries and container ships docking on Graciosa, which can potentially cause disturbance, habitat degradation and mortality. Historically, this species was heavily hunted for food, with early 16th and 17th century accounts from the Azores of a small black and white seabird that was killed nightly by the thousands (Bolton <em>et al. </em>2008). This threat, however, is highly unlikely to return on this scale.","The population was estimated at 300 pairs in 1999 (Bolton <em>et al</em>. 2008). Recently, the Praia islet population size was updated to 178 breeding pairs, resulting in a global population size estimated at 328-378 pairs (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2016). Although the estimate for the population other than Praia islet is now a decade old, the population is not thought to have declined since. The Praia population increased in response to the installation of artificial nest boxes. Thus, the population is best placed in the band 250-999 mature individuals. This equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",Stable,"The species breeds on three islets (Praia, Baixo and Baleia) situated off Graciosa Island, and other two very small islets (Alagoa) located off Flores Island Azores, <strong>Portugal</strong>. Breeding is suspected on further islets (including some stacks off Corvo Island) in the Azores, but proof is still lacking (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008, J. Bried <em>in litt.</em> 2010, Oliveira<em> et al.</em> 2016). It is thought to remain in the vicinity of the Azores during the non-breeding season, a suggestion which is supported by the analysis of carbon isotopes (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Although unlikely to occur elsewhere, identification amongst Madeiran Storm-petrel <em>H. castro</em> is difficult (W. Bourne <em>in litt.</em> 2012).

Accounts from the 16th and 17th centuries of a small black and white seabird, which appear to match the breeding cycle of this species, indicate that it may have once been far more abundant (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008); however, there are no recent trend data.&#160;<em><p></p></em>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong>Bern Convention Appendix II.

Recent work to reduce interspecific competition for nest cavities with rabbits and other larger procellariiform species through the installation of nest boxes has met with considerable success, leading to a large increase in annual productivity (Bolton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Nest boxes had higher productivity than natural nest sites, probably due to the greater degree of protection they provided from inclement weather and interspecific competition for nest space (Bried <em>et al.</em> 2009).

New species of the <em>Bachia bresslaui</em> group have been described in areas that have been inundated following the construction of dams.",This species is known from seven records across two localities. It is semi-fossorial and difficult find (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2011).,Unknown,"This species is endemic to Brazil. It is known from two localities in the plateau of the Chapada dos Parecis, located in an ecotone between the Cerrado and the southern rim of the Amazon.

156932432,22563,Tursiops truncatus,Least Concern,,2019,2018-05-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is among the most common cetacean species globally. These dolphins are distributed worldwide in all three major ocean basins and the Mediterranean Sea. They occur in tropical and temperate inshore, coastal, shelf, and oceanic waters. The sum of available abundance estimates is around 750,000, however the vast majority of the species’ range has not been surveyed therefore actual abundance is considerably higher.</p>  <p>Coastal populations of Common Bottlenose Dolphin are often small and resident and many of them are threatened by human activities. This species is bycaught in fishing gear throughout their range but quantitative data on bycatch rates are lacking in most areas. Several populations of Common Bottlenose Dolphin are of particular conservation concern, including the Fiordland subpopulation in New Zealand which is classified as Critically Endangered (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013) the Mediterranean subpopulation which is classified as vulnerable (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the Black Sea subspecies which is classified as endangered (Birkum 2012).&#160;</p>  <p>Some additional discrete resident populations face serious threats from a variety of sources that are resulting in significant population declines, and some of these (e.g., potentially the Gulf of California, Amvrakikos Gulf, or Slovenia populations) may be assessed as separate subpopulations on the Red List in the future. Despite all of this, the Common Bottlenose Dolphin is still one of the most widespread and abundant cetacean species, and to date there is no evidence that the threats are resulting in a global population decline. This species was listed as Least Concern on the Red List in 2008 and it remains Least Concern in this updated assessment.</p>","<p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins are found in a wide range of habitats from coastal to pelagic waters (Wells and Scott 1999). Where distinct ecotypes are known, the inshore form frequents estuaries, bays, lagoons and other shallow coastal regions, occasionally ranging far up into rivers. The offshore form tends to be less restricted in range and movement. Some Common Bottlenose Dolphins are residents around oceanic islands (Baird 2016). In many inshore areas Common Bottlenose Dolphins maintain definable, long-term, multi-generational home ranges, but in some locations near the extremes of the species’ range they are migratory. Off the coasts of North America, they tend to inhabit waters with surface temperatures ranging from about 10°C to 32°C (Wells and Scott, 1999). Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphins are common over the shelf of this semi-enclosed basin; they sometimes occur far offshore (Birkun 2006).<br/> <br/> Common Bottlenose Dolphins are commonly associated with many other cetaceans, including large whales and other dolphin species (Wells and Scott 1999). Mixed schools with Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins have been observed, for instance, in the Taiwan Strait (J. Wang pers. comm.).<br/> <br/> Bottlenose Dolphins consume a wide variety of prey species, mostly fish and squid (Barros and Odell 1990, Barros and Wells 1998, Blanco <em>et al</em>. 2001, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2001). They sometimes eat shrimp and other crustaceans.</p>","<p>In many places Common Bottlenose Dolphins are found in coastal waters, bringing them into contact with human activities. Conservation problems are known or suspected for at least: (a) the Critically Endangered Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation in New Zealand (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013), (b) the Endangered Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin subspecies (Birkun 2012), (c) the Vulnerable Mediterranean Sea subpopulation (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2012), and the dolphins in (d) Sri Lanka (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989); (e) Peru, Ecuador, and Chile (Read <em>et al</em>. 1988, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1990, Sanino <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010); (f) Taiwan (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1999 pers. comm.); (g) Japan (Kasuya 2017) and (h) Gulf of California, Mexico (Segura-García <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Dolphin catches for bait, for human consumption, or to reduce competition with fisheries have been reported worldwide (Wells and Scott 1999, 2018). In a global review of the use of cetaceans as bait in fisheries, Common Bottlenose Dolphins were among the most frequently used (Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2018). They were reported as being used for bait in Ghana, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela and Spain. In Peru, some coastal artisanal fisheries from at least one port take <em>Common Bottlenose Dolphins</em> for bait, using harpoons, while about 57% of Common Bottlenose Dolphins caught in gillnets as bycatch are discarded at sea; the extent to which such takes occur elsewhere along the Peruvian coast is not known (Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species is taken opportunistically by harpoon in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997). In Taiwan, Common Bottlenose Dolphins comprised a major part of the small cetaceans taken by harpoon in the past (J. Wang, pers. comm.). Although little evidence has been collected and reported since the 1990s, illegal hunting of cetaceans still occurs in Taiwan as evidenced by periodic news reports of police confiscations of cetacean parts. Directed hunting of cetaceans, including Common Bottlenose Dolphins, for local consumption occurs in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975) and in West Africa (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is reported to be one of several species targeted by hunters in Indonesia (Mustika 2006). <br/> <br/> The only Mediterranean area with quantitative historical information is the northern Adriatic Sea, where Common Bottlenose Dolphins likely have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, largely as a consequence of historical killing in extermination campaigns to reduce competition for fish, followed by habitat degradation and overfishing. The extermination campaigns were conducted until the early 1960s (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008, Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). For the northwestern Mediterranean, the available information suggests similar trends (Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). There continues to be substantial incidental mortality in fishing gear, and overfishing of dolphin prey, disturbance by marine traffic, and high levels of contamination by pollutants are of concern in much of the Mediterranean Sea (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Drive hunts of small cetaceans, including Common Bottlenose Dolphins, exist in the Faroe Islands and Japan. Up to 308 are taken annually in the Faroe Islands drive hunt (dating back to 1803), often with Long-finned Pilot Whales (Reyes 1991, Bloch 1998). Drive and harpoon hunts in Japan catch Common Bottlenose Dolphins for human consumption and to remove perceived competition with commercial fisheries (Wells and Scott 1999, Kasuya 2017). Average catch from 1995–2004 was 594 per year (Kasuya 2017). Since 2000, the catch at Taiji in Japan has declined to fewer than 200 Common Bottlenose Dolphins per year, after a peak of 1,670 in 1987 (Kasuya 2017).<br/> <br/> The Endangered Black Sea subspecies was hunted extensively to obtain commercial products including oils, lubricants, food, meal, glue, and leather goods (Tomilin 1957, Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). An estimated 24,000 - 28,000 were taken in the Black Sea off Turkey during 1946–1983. However, the total number killed was certainly much greater (probably by tens of thousands) as these figures do not include, or only partially include, catch statistics from other Black Sea countries (Birkun 2006, 2012).<br/> <br/> The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is the most common cetacean species in captivity worldwide (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Live captures of Common Bottlenose Dolphins for public display, research, and military applications have occurred in several parts of the species' range. There is no worldwide estimate of the scale of these removals, but more than 1,500 were live-captured in United States, Mexican, and Bahamian waters through 1980 (Leatherwood and Reeves 1982, Fisher and Reeves 2005). Up to 1983 at least 198 Common Bottlenose Dolphins were reported to have been live-captured for European aquaria (Collet 1984). More recently, eight were collected illegally in the Dominican Republic in 2002 (Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2010) and live-capture efforts in Senegal in 2003 led to the death of at least five dolphins (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2008). At least 238 Common Bottlenose Dolphins were live-captured in Cuba in 1986–2004 (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2006), and 15 in the Solomon Islands in 2013 (Oremus <em>et al</em>. 2015). Some Common Bottlenose Dolphins captured during drive hunts in Japan are collected alive for marine parks in Japan and internationally (Butterworth <em>et al</em>. 2013). The cumulative live-capture removals of Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphins, not counting mortality during capture operations, is estimated to be from several hundred up to around 1,000 since the mid-1960s for military, academic, and display purposes, including swim-with-dolphins programs (Birkun 2002). Live-captures through 2002 took 10-20 animals annually from a small area in the Kerch Strait, Russia (Birkun 2002, 2006, 2012). According to Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) statistics, at least 92 individuals were removed from the Black Sea region during 1990-1999 (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003), and Russia reportedly exported at least 66 for travelling shows from 1997-2005 (Fisher and Reeves 2005). <br/> <br/> Incidental mortality of Common Bottlenose Dolphins is known to occur throughout the species’ range in set gillnets, drift gillnets, purse seines, trawls, and longlines, and on hook-and-line gear used in commercial and recreational fisheries, but the level of mortality is poorly documented from most range states (Wells and Scott 1999, Wells <em>et al.</em> 2008). Set gillnet, purse-seine and drift gillnet fisheries off Peru continue to take an unknown but potentially large number annually (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2017b, Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al</em>. 2010), and some of those taken as bycatch or directly were being sold in fish markets at least through 2007, as determined by molecular evidence (Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2010). Prior to 2001, the estimated annual incidental mortality of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific purse seine fishery for tuna ranged up to almost 200 per year, but during 2001-2016, the average mortality declined to 2.9 per year (Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission data, M. Scott pers. comm.). Incidental catches in Chinese fisheries reached several hundred per year in the 1990s (Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999). Bottom trawls and sink gillnets in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. take on average 27 offshore Common Bottlenose Dolphins annually, pelagic longlines take 12 Common Bottlenose Dolphins on average each year (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017), and shrimp trawls take an unknown number each year (Greenman and McFee 2014). Common Bottlenose Dolphins were the third most frequently caught cetaceans in gillnets in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997). Taiwanese coastal and distant-water longline fisheries for tunas and sharks take Common Bottlenose Dolphins incidentally, as do a variety of Taiwanese gillnet (including driftnets and trammel nets) and purse-seine fisheries in coastal and distant (e.g., Western Tropical Pacific) waters (Wang and Yang 2002, J. Wang pers. comm.). <br/> <br/> Annual Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin incidental mortality in bottom-set gillnets from 1946 through the 1980s was roughly estimated as being in the hundreds. The scale of this mortality almost certainly increased in the 1990s-2000s owing to the rapid expansion of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (Birkun 2006, 2012). According to Öztürk (1999) at least 200 Bottlenose Dolphins may have been taken incidentally per year in Turkish fisheries in a variety of fishing nets, especially bottom-set gill nets.&#160;</p>  <p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins in coastal areas are exposed to a wide variety of threats in addition to direct and incidental takes (Vollmer and Rosel 2013). Threats that are cause for concern include: 1) the toxic effects of xenobiotic chemicals; 2) reduced prey availability caused by environmental degradation and overfishing; 3) direct and indirect disturbance and harassment (e.g., boat traffic and commercial dolphin watching and interactive programs); 4) marine construction, including demolition, dredging, and land reclamation, and 5) other forms of habitat destruction and degradation (including anthropogenic noise). Although these and other threats are technically challenging to quantify by comparison with removals, their cumulative impact is likely to result in population declines. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to an increasing number of Unusual Mortality Events involving Common Bottlenose Dolphins remains to be determined (Spradlin <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>The Critically Endangered Fiordland (New Zealand) Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation faces threats from boat-based tourism, increased freshwater discharge from hydroelectric power generation, and reduced prey availability from environmental degradation and overfishing (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>  <p>Environmental contaminants likely impact health and reproductive success of the Common Bottlenose Dolphins in parts of its range. Lahvis <em>et al</em>. (1995) correlated concentrations of PCBs and DDT in the blood of inshore Bottlenose Dolphins with decline in immune system function. Males in some areas such as Florida accumulate levels of PCBs more than an order of magnitude greater than the threshold for adverse health effects identified by Kannan <em>et al</em>. (2000). A risk assessment relative to PCB burdens suggested elevated probabilities of first-born mortality at several sites in the U.S. (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2002, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005). Jepson <em>et al.</em> (2016) reported that Common Bottlenose Dolphins in Europe had mean PCB concentrations that greatly exceeded all known marine mammal PCB toxicity thresholds. The spatial patterns of PBDEs and the ΣDDTs/ΣPCBs detected in Common Bottlenose Dolphin blubber have been shown to vary significantly with adjacent watersheds and land use associations in the southeastern United States (Adams <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>The <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> oil spill in 2010 was one of the worst environmental catastrophes in the history of the United States. The oil spill adversely impacted the health, reproduction, and survival of Common Bottlenose Dolphins along much of the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lane <em>et al</em>. 2015). For the stock in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, where oiling was heavy, the spill resulted in an estimated 30,347 lost cetacean years (the difference between baseline and injured population size, summed over the modeled time period) (95% CI: 11,511-89,746), and models suggested the time to recovery of the population would be 39 years (95% CI: 24 to 80) (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2017). Similar recovery timelines were predicted for other nearby stocks. There is concern that planned large-scale diversions of fresh water from the Mississippi River into Barataria Bay may hamper the recovery of this stock.</p>  <p>&#160;Common Bottlenose Dolphins sometimes forage around fish-farm cages or take fish from gillnets (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001, Read <em>et al</em>. 2003), commercial trawling gear, crab traps, or recreational fishing gear (Wells and Scott 1999). This can result in incidental mortality through entanglement, hooking, and ingestion of gear (Powell and Wells 2011, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2008, Baird 2016, Stolen <em>et al.</em> 2013). Common Bottlenose Dolphins conditioned to receive food items are more likely to be injured by human interactions than unconditioned dolphins, leading to decreased survival and potentially to consequences at the population level (Donaldson <em>et al</em>. 2010, Christiansen <em>et al</em>. 2016). Developments in recreational fishing line technology include microfilament braided twine that is more damaging to dolphin tissues than simple monofilament (Barco <em>et al</em>. 2010). Dredging and demolition associated with marine construction have been demonstrated to at least temporarily displace Common Bottlenose Dolphins from their normal range (Buckstaff <em>et al.</em> 2013, Pirotta <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Morbillivirus has been responsible for several documented epizootic events involving deaths of hundreds to thousands of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Rowles <em>et al</em>. 2011). During an outbreak along the U.S. Atlantic coast in 1987-88, more than 740 Common Bottlenose Dolphins died between New Jersey and Florida. During 2013-2015, more than 1,800 Common Bottlenose Dolphin carcasses were recovered during a morbillivirus event along the Atlantic coast from New York to Florida (NOAA/NMFS 2015). In each of these cases, it should be noted that only a fraction of the actual mortality is generally documented as stranded carcasses, so the number of deaths from the disease are likely much higher (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is not known if anthropogenic factors increase susceptibility to the disease.</p>","<p></p><p>Abundance of Common Bottlenose Dolphins has been estimated for several parts of the species' range. Summing available estimates, a minimum world-wide abundance estimate would be 750,000, acknowledging that most of the range of the species has not been surveyed for abundance estimation, and some of the estimates included in the summation are out of date.<br/> <br/> <a name=""_Hlk523388145"">Recent surveys by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017) have estimated 97,964 Bottlenose Dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico <strong>(</strong>5,806 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.39) in oceanic waters beyond the shelf edge, 51,192 (CV = 0.10) on the outer continental shelf, 39,734 in coastal waters, and 1,232 in bays, sounds, and estuaries. There are approximately 110,000 Common Bottlenose Dolphins off the east coast of North America (including 77,532 (CV = 0.40) in offshore waters, 31,212 in coastal waters, and 1,209 in bays, sounds, and estuaries. For both regions, current estimates are not available for most of the bays, sounds, and estuaries (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Recent stock assessment reports for U.S. Pacific waters indicated that there are 453 (CV = 0.06) Common Bottlenose Dolphins in coastal California waters, and 1,924 (CV = 0.54) in the offshore waters of California, Oregon, and Washington (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). These stock assessments include abundance estimates for individual stocks in Hawaiian waters: Kauai/Niihau, 147 (CV = 0.11), Oahu, 594 (CV = 0.54), 4-Islands, 153 (CV = 0.24), Hawaii Island, 102 (CV = 0.13), and Hawaii Pelagic, 5,590 (CV = 0.59) (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Surveys of the Eastern Tropical Pacific resulted in an estimate of 243,500 (CV = 0.29) (Wade and Gerrodette 1993), but this estimate should be considered with caution given the fact that it is more than 25 years old. No recent abundance estimates for Common Bottlenose Dolphins in Japanese waters are available (Kasuya 2017). Japanese surveys prior to 1993 resulted in estimates of 168,000 (CV = 0.26) in the Northwestern Pacific west of 180ºE, including 36,791 (CV = 0.25) in Japanese coastal waters (Miyashita 1993). In the eastern Sulu Sea, Dolar <em>et al.</em> (2006) estimated 2,628 Common Bottlenose Dolphins 1994-1995 (CV = 0.40). </a></p>  <p>A large-scale survey (SCANS-III) of European Atlantic waters from the Strait of Gibraltar in the south to 62°N in the north and extending west to the 200 nm limits of most European Union Member State Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) was conducted in 2016 (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). The final surveyed area excluded offshore waters of Portugal and to the south and west of Ireland (surveyed by the Irish ObSERVE project), and included coastal waters of Norway north to Vestfjorden. In total, 27,700 (CV = 0.23) Common Bottlenose Dolphins were estimated (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). As part of the ObSERVE aerial surveys of the Irish EEZ, 8,700 km of line transect aerial surveys were conducted in Beaufort sea state ≤4 in both the summer (May-June 2016) and winter (November-February) of 2016/2017. There were clear seasonal differences in habitat use and abundance of Common Bottlenose Dolphins, which showed an approximate 2.5 fold increase in density during winter (0.626 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) compared to summer (0.257 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>). The summer abundance estimate was 87,330 (CV = 0.21) (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Scottish waters, abundance was estimated as 195 (95% highest posterior density intervals (HPDI): 162–253) from the Moray Firth to Fife and 45 (95% HPDI: 33–66) in the Hebrides, leading to the conclusion that 200-300 Common Bottlenose Dolphins inhabit the inshore coastal waters of Scotland (Cheney <em>et al</em>. 2013). A community of 420 dolphins (95% confidence interval (CI) = 331–521) was documented in the Normano-Breton Gulf of the English Channel (Louis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Photo-identification surveys of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the Shannon Estuary of western Ireland in 2010 resulted in an abundance estimate of 107 (CV = 0.12; 95% CI = 83 to 131)) (Berrow <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>Total abundance for the Mediterranean Sea Common Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation, listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, is unknown but thought to be in the low 10,000’s and decreasing (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). Surveys of 86,000 km<sup>2</sup> of the northwestern Mediterranean off Spain in 2002 estimated 7,654 (CV = 0.45) Common Bottlenose Dolphins (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 2004). Based on surveys in 2000-2003 an estimated 584 (CV = 0.28) individuals occur in the Alboran Sea of Spain (Cañadas and Hammond 2006). Abundance estimates for other parts of the Mediterranean Sea include 148 (95% CI = 132 to 180) in the Amvrakikos Gulf, western Greece (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008), 1,676 (95% CI = 804-3,492) in the Pelagos Sanctuary of the western Mediterranean (Lauriano <em>et al</em>. 2014), 517 (95% CI = 406-658) in the Balearic Islands (Gonzalvo <em>et al</em>. 2014), and 42 (95% CI = 42.0 to 43.1)<strong> </strong>off northeastern Tunisia (Benmessaoud <em>et al.</em> 2013). A decline in the resident Common Bottlenose Dolphin population inhabiting the Kvarnerić area of the northern Adriatic Sea, Croatia during 1995-2003 appears to have been reversed, with about 200 individuals currently using the area (Pleslić <em>et al.</em> 2013). Bottlenose dolphins near Lampedusa Island, Italy, have increased significantly since 1998 to 249 (95% CI = 162 to 449) (Pulcini <em>et al</em>. 2014). Mediterranean Bottlenose Dolphins exhibit subpopulation structure, based on behavior, toxicology, diet, and genetics (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2005, Natoli <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p>The total population size of the Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin subspecies, currently listed as Endangered, is unknown. However, there are abundance estimates for parts of the range suggesting that population size is at least several thousand individuals (Birkun 2006, 2012).</p>  <p>Off South America, 83 (95% CI = 73 to 112) Common Bottlenose Dolphins were estimated in Bahía San Antonio, Argentina in 2006-2008 (Vermuelen and Cammareri 2009). Further to the south in Patagonia, in Golfo San José and adjacent areas, Common Bottlenose Dolphin abundance has declined since the 1970s from at least 53 to 34 dolphins (CV = 0.20) and range shifts have been observed; the causes of these changes could not be conclusively determined (Coscarella <em>et al</em>. 2012). Investigations into possible short-term declines in Common Bottlenose Dolphin abundance due to bycatch in Patos Lagoon, Brazil, found the population to be stable over the period 1998-2012, with an estimate in 2012 of 78 animals (95% CI = 70-86) (Fruet <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015). &#160;</p>  <p>Off New Zealand, the Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation is listed as Critically Endangered, with only 205 (95% CI: 192-219) individuals in 2008, of which 123 were mature (Currey <em>et al. </em>2009). Elsewhere in New Zealand, there are an estimated 211 Common Bottlenose Dolphins (95% CI = 195 to 232) in the Marlborough Sounds (Merriman <em>et al</em>. 2009) and 92 (95% CI = 80 to 111) near Stewart Island (Brough <em>et al</em>. 2015). Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand showed a 7.5% annual rate of decline from 1997-1999 to 2003-2006 (Tezanos-Pinto <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>  <p>Around the island of São Tomé, off the west coast of Africa, Common Bottlenose Dolphins were the most commonly sighted cetaceans during a total of 226 surveys between 2002 and 2006, and in 2012. In total, 140 individuals were photo-identified, and the high rate of discovery of new individuals suggested that these were part of a much larger population (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2013). In 2011-2013, during 13,694 km of visual survey transects in continental shelf and slope waters off Northwest Africa, between Tangier and Conakry<em>, T. truncatus</em> were (after the Common Dolphin <em>Delphinus delphis</em>) the second-most frequently encountered cetaceans, accounting for 9.6% of total sightings (Djiba <em>et al.</em> 2015). In offshore waters of the Western Indian Ocean, Bottlenose Dolphins, the majority of which appeared to be <em>T. truncatus</em>, were among the most common cetaceans observed (Ballance and Pitman 1998).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"Common Bottlenose Dolphins occur worldwide through tropical and temperate inshore, coastal, shelf, and oceanic waters (Leatherwood and Reeves 1990, Wells and Scott 1999, Reynolds <em>et al</em>. 2000). They range poleward of 45° in northern Europe (as far as the Faroe Islands 62°N 7°W; Bloch and Mikkelsen 2000) and southern New Zealand (Brough <em>et al</em>. 2015), and the species was recently reported as far south as 53-55<sup>o</sup>S in South America (Olavarría <em>et al</em>. 2010, Goodall <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the eastern Pacific they have been seen as far north as British Columbia (50<sup>o</sup>N) but their typical range is up to 41<sup>o</sup>N (Halpin <em>et al</em>. 2018). Common Bottlenose Dolphins are rare in the Baltic Sea (best considered extralimital there) and are vagrant to Newfoundland and Norway (Wells and Scott 1999).

160756767,6909,Dugong dugon,Vulnerable,A2bcd+4bcd,2019,2015-07-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Marsh <em>et al.</em> (2011) made a crude estimate of the Dugong’s extent of occurrence (EOO) as 860,000 km<sup>2</sup> based on potential habitat (waters &lt;10 m deep in its known range). This spans approximately 128,000 km of coastline across at least 37, and up to 44, countries and territories. Although the Dugong still occurs at the extremes of its range, Husar (1978) and IUCN (2009) list the Dugong as extinct in the waters of several islands including: the Maldives, the Lakshadweep Islands, Mascarene Islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues, and Taiwan (Husar 1978). Although this species may only have been vagrant at some of these islands (e.g. Taiwan, Hirasaka 1932), there is historical evidence of substantial Dugong populations off Mauritius and Rodrigues Islands; these populations were harvested in the 18th century (Cheke 1987). Cheke quotes historical accounts of a dugong fishery on Rodrigues in the 1730s. There is also anecdotal evidence that the area of occupancy (AOO) of the Dugong has declined in many parts of its range, especially along the coasts of east Africa and India. <br/><br/>The only reference site is the urban coast of Queensland between Cooktown and Brisbane, Australia where a 40 year time series of catch rates in nets set for bather protection indicates that the Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) in 1999 was only 3% of that in 1962 (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2005). This CPUE is considered an index of Dugong decline in the region from all causes during this period. This decline and modern aerial survey estimates of Dugong abundance were used to backcast the population in the region in the early 1960s (which would be expected to have been lower than that at the time of European settlement as a cottage commercial industry for Dugong oil had existed at several locations along this coast since the 1850s). The extrapolation suggested that the region supported 72,000 (95% CI 31,000, 165,000) Dugongs in the early 1960s compared with an estimated 4,220 (95% CI 2,360, 8,360) Dugongs in the mid 1990s. The seagrass habitat in the region is currently insufficient to support 72,000 Dugongs, a result which suggests that the habitat had also declined or that the shark net CPUE has overestimated the decline (see Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2005). If the magnitude of this decline was robust and typical of the entire range of the Dugong, the Dugong would qualify for being classified as Critically Endangered at a global scale. However, there are sites in Australia that support large populations of Dugongs (e.g. Shark Bay, Torres Strait) where it is unlikely that such a decline has occurred (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, unpublished). <br/><br/>The major causes of the Dugong’s decline along the urban coast of Queensland are still present in most of the Dugong’s range as follows: gill netting, subsistence hunting, habitat loss from extreme weather events that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change, human settlement and agricultural pollution. The magnitude of these threats is likely to be greater in most other parts of the Dugong’s range than in Queensland. The Queensland coast supports a low human population density relative to most other parts of the Dugong’s range and has a well- developed system of marine parks and pro-active management. Nonetheless there is evidence of ongoing decline in Dugong numbers (Sobtzick <em>et al</em>. 2012) along the urban coast of the Great Barrier Reef Region largely attributed to habitat loss associated with extreme weather events. <br/><br/>Marsh <em>et al. </em>(2011) undertook a regional assessment of the Dugong and concluded that the East African population was likely ‘Endangered’; Red Sea and Gulf of Aden ‘Data Deficient’; Arabians Gulf ‘Data Deficient’; Indian sub-continent and Andaman and Nicobar Islands ‘Endangered’; continental South East Asia ‘Endangered’; archipelagic East and South East Asia ‘Data Deficient’; Western Pacific Islands ‘Data Deficient’; and Palau and the Japan (Ryukyus) as Critically Endangered. The most recent assessment of the Australian population (Woinarski <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014) concluded it was ‘Near Threatened’. The Dugong’s confirmed range states include a mix of developing and developed countries and territories including countries and territories with a very high Human Development Index (HDI), countries with a high HDI, countries with a medium HDI and three countries with a low HDI (Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011). The outlook for Dugongs in countries with a very small Dugong population and/or a low HDI must be poor. These countries include Brunei, Cambodia, China, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Madagascar, Mayotte, Mozambique, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Viet Nam and Yemen. Nonetheless, four countries/territories with a very high HDI (Australia, New Caledonia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) support substantial populations of Dugongs (hundreds or thousands; Marsh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), although even among and within these countries/territories the prospects are uneven. Because of the uncertainty associated with the assessment of the status of the Dugong, we suggest that the classification should remain as Vulnerable.","Habitat requirements for Dugongs include coastal areas, shallow to medium deep, warm waters (15-17°C minimum with behavioural thermoregulation), seagrass beds supporting sub-tropical and tropical species of seagrass, particularly low fiber species (Hines <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Dugongs show great variability in movement patterns and migration, depending on the study area and the influence of seasonal temperature or rainfall on regional ecosystems. Long-distance movements by Dugongs along the Queensland coast are well-documented (Sheppard <em>et al.</em> 2006), even though Dugongs do not appear to undertake regular migrations and individual movements are individualistic (Sheppard <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Gredzens <em>et al. </em>2014). Cope <em>et al. </em>(2015) used pedigree analysis based on individual genetic markers to infer the movements of Dugongs between locations in southeast Queensland including Moreton Bay and Hervey Bay. They found that approximately 30% of assigned parents had at least one offspring found in a different locality, implying recent movement of the parent or offspring. This analysis suggested markedly more movement between localities than detected through repeated direct sampling of individuals (Seddon <em>et al.</em> 2014) or through telemetry (Sheppard <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).","Threats to Dugongs vary between different populations as detailed in Marsh <em>et al.</em> (2011) and Hines <em>et al.</em> (2012).&#160;Major threats include:<ul><li>Incidental capture in fishing gear (e.g. gill nets), shark nets for bather protection, IUU fishing especially if meat is subsequently sold (see Pilcher <em>et al. </em>2014, for a detailed rapid assessment based on questionnaires to provide information on conservation hotpots for Dugongs in 18 countries in four geographic areas: Pacific, Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Africa, with 6,153 respondents)</li><li>Hunting: legal (i.e. culturally sanctioned) and illegal</li><li>Boat strikes and boating activities (e.g. acoustic pollution)</li><li>Damage/modification/loss of habitat caused by human settlement on coasts, shipping, trawling destructive fishing, natural processes (e.g. cyclones and tsunamis)</li><li>Threats to seagrass (including untreated sewage disposal, coastal dredging and reclamation, inshore commercial trawling, agricultural pollution)</li><li>Chemical pollution (e.g. oil spills and heavy metal loads)</li><li>Climate change (extreme weather events and high temperatures)</li></ul>The major drivers for incidental capture in fishing gear and illegal hunting are poverty and declining fish stocks. Dugongs are legally protected in most of their range. However, enforcement is typically weak or non-existent. The imperative of artisanal fishers to break the law is increased by the opportunity to sell both Dugong meat (Robards and Reeves 2011) and valuable commodities such as swim bladders and shark fins (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2011). Artisanal coastal and riverine fisheries are vital to the livelihoods and food security of coastal peoples, especially in the tropics (Batista <em>et al. </em>2014), including most Dugong range states. On a global scale, such fisheries catch the same amount of fish for human consumption as commercial fisheries, yet employ some 25 times the number of fishers (over 12 million people; Chuenpagdee <em>et al.</em> 2008, Batista <em>et al.</em> 2014). Gill nets are significant threat to many marine mammals including dugongs (Read <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2010, Pilcher <em>et al.</em> 2014). Some Dugong declines coincide with the introduction of monofilament nylon gill nets (Muir and Kizka 2012). However, it is often very difficult to convince the fishers or the fisheries managers to take the capture of Dugongs seriously. When Dugong population sizes are low, their capture in fisheries is a rare event, which becomes rarer as the Dugong population declines. Coastal development represents another important driver. Significant seagrass loss leads to Dugongs having reduced food resources, delayed reproduction and starvation (Marsh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). The impact of chemical and noise pollution on Dugongs is unquantified. (Marsh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>Climate change is projected to lead to altered coastal environmental condition and increases in severe tropical storms and flood events that could affect both Dugongs and their seagrass habitats exacerbating the effects of the other drivers listed above (see Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011 for details).","Five countries/territories (Australia, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Qatar and the United Arabian Emirates) support substantial subpopulations of Dugongs (thousands) with tens of thousands of Dugongs in northern Australia/Papua New Guinea alone (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, unpublished). The percentage of mature individuals is likely to vary between various subpopulations, but is likely to be somewhere between 45% and 70% (Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011). Genetic information on Dugong stocks is mostly limited to the Australian region. Recent work based on mitochondrial DNA (Blair <em>et al.</em> 2014) shows that the Australian Dugong population is not panmictic. The Australian population still has high genetic diversity, indicating that recent population declines are not yet reflected in the genetic makeup of the population. Seddon <em>et al. </em>(2014) used microsatellite markers to demonstrate low, but significant, population differentiation within a regional in southern Queensland. Further data (D. Blair unpublished data) using the same genetic markers indicate considerable differentiation between southern and northern Queensland populations. Preliminary population-genetic and phylogeographic studies on Dugongs outside Australia are ongoing. These studies suggest strong regional differentiation. Australian populations are largely distinct from those elsewhere; populations in the Western Indian Ocean (Red Sea, Persian/Arabian Gulf, East Africa) are rather uniform and with limited genetic diversity; Madagascar might harbour a distinct lineage. The situation for the Indo-Malay Region is unclear but possibly more than one historical lineage occurs there. Thailand (Palmer 2004, L. Parr unpublished data) and Australia (McDonald 2005, Blair <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) are home to distinct matrilines that possibly diverged during Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, but are now able to mix geographically within those regions",Decreasing,"Dugongs inhabit coastal and island waters between East Africa and Vanuatu between latitudes of about 27° north and south of Equator. Spanning approximately 128,000 km of coastline (860,000 km<sup>2</sup>) across at least 37 and and possibly occur in an additional seven states and territories (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, N. Pilcher pers. comm).<p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Archaeological evidence confirms exploitation of Dugongs by early humans. As long as 6,000 years ago, Dugongs on the small island of Akab in the United Arabian Emirates were hunted for food (Méry <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Excavations in the Torres Strait, Australia, has revealed that Dugong hunting in this region dates back at least 4,000 years and possibly up to 7,000 years (Crouch <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wright 2010) and that the harvest has been substantial for at least 400–500 years (McNiven and Bedingfield 2008).&#160;Although hunting is now legally banned in most countries, there are important exceptions for the subsistence use by traditional peoples. In Australia, the Dugong hunting rights of ‘Native Title Holders’ (indigenous people who can prove continuous connections to their traditional land and sea country) have been consistently upheld by the courts in a series of landmark decisions since 1993. Dugong hunting still has considerable cultural significance to coastal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across northern Australia, and Dugong meat is considered by these groups to be the one of the highest value traditional foods. Some subsistence Dugong hunting is also allowed in the Pacific states of Papua New Guinea (restrictions apply), Vanuatu and New Caledonia (restrictions apply), where Dugongs are still of great cultural and dietary significance.Commercial exploitation of Dugongs occurred intermittently at various places along the coast of Queensland, Australia, from 1847-1969 (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Numerous products are still obtained from Dugongs and used for food, folk medicine, cooking/lubrication, aphrodisiacs, amulets/charms/jewellery, carvings, religious artefacts, leather products and other (Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Trade in Dugong (and all other sirenian) products is regulated or banned by the Convention for Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Dugongs are currently listed on CITES Appendix I.",Marine,"Dugongs are covered under three international conservation conventions: The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (also known as CMS or the Bonn Convention). Dugongs are also included in the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI), goal five (Threatened Species). Additionally, the Convention on Wetlands (the Ramsar Convention) protects some important Dugong habitats.<br/><br/>To date, there has been little effective management intervention to reduce anthropogenic impacts on the Dugong, apart from legislative protection which is almost ubiquitous throughout its range. Protected area initiatives aim to protect Dugongs in many range states (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2011) and are most developed in Australia. Most of the marine protected areas outside Australia with the potential to protect Dugongs are ‘paper parks’ where laws and regulations exist but are not implemented. Strategic Action Programmes/Strategic Plans/Action Plans to protect Dugongs have been developed by countries in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region (Gerges 2002), Indonesia (de Iongh <em>et al.</em> 2009a, 2009b) and South Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP; Gillespies 2005). However, effective enforcement of conservation regulations is a problem throughout most of the region because of poverty, lack of resources and personnel. The most pressing need is for alternative sustainable livelihoods that address poverty and provide incentives for conservation. The most promising initiative is the UNEP Dugong, Seagrass &amp; Coastal Communities Initiative (see <a href=""http://www.cms.int/en/publication/dugong-seagrass-and-coastal-communities-initiative"">http://www.cms.int/en/publication/dugong-seagrass-and-coastal-communities-initiative</a>).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
160983555,41755,Physeter macrocephalus,Vulnerable,A1d,2019,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The cause of the population reduction in this species (commercial whaling) is reversible, understood, and is not currently in operation. For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. <em>Physeter macrocephalus</em> is globally widespread (thus not qualifying as threatened under criterion B), and does not have a global population that warrants listing under criteria C-D. Empirical trend data for this species globally are unavailable. However, commercial whaling at a large scale for this species in the North Pacific and Antarctic within the last three generations (82 years) certainly resulted in a global decline during this period. Commercial whaling for this species has ceased and therefore this population is evaluated under the A1 criterion rather than under the A2-4 criteria. A peer-reviewed publication (Whitehead 2002) provides a model-based estimate of global trend that can be used to evaluate the population under the A1 criterion. The results from that study gave a 6% probability for Endangered, a 54% probability of meeting the Vulnerable category, and a 40% probability of falling into the Near Threatened category. The results suggest little chance that the population would meet the criteria for Endangered or for Least Concern. There is credible and realistic evidence for either the Vulnerable or Near Threatened category. Given that the results give greater probability for at least the Vulnerable category (60%), and that this is the more precautionary category, the species is classified as Vulnerable.","The habitat of the Sperm Whale is the open sea. More specifically, Sperm Whales can be found in almost all marine waters deeper than 1,000 m that are not covered by ice, except in the Black Sea and possibly the Red Sea (Rice 1989; Whitehead 2003). In some areas, particularly in the western North Atlantic, sperm whales, especially males, can occur in shallower waters (e.g., Scott and Sadove 1997). Females and young are usually restricted to waters at latitudes lower than about 40-50º and to areas where sea surface temperatures are greater than about 15ºC (Rice 1989). Sperm Whales are generally more numerous in areas of relatively high primary productivity (Jaquet <em>et al</em>. 1996), although there are some exceptions, such as the Sargasso Sea and the central North Pacific gyre (Barlow and Taylor 2005).<br/><br/>The Sperm Whale is an animal of extremes in size (up to 18 m), sexual dimorphism (mature males have three times the mass of mature females), ecological imprint (sperm whales take roughly the same amount of biomass from the oceans as humans), and many other attributes (Whitehead 2003). The commercial value of the animal (a function of its size and the quality of Sperm Whale oil) drove two massive worldwide hunts: the technologically primitive “open-boat” hunt from 1712-~1920 (Starbuck 1878; Best 1983), and modern whaling using engine-driven whaling ships and harpoon guns from ~1910-1988 (Tonnessen and Johnsen 1982). The complex social structure of sperm whales may have been affected by whaling, lowering potential population growth rates, which are very low anyway (Whitehead 2003). On the positive side, Sperm Whales are very widely distributed (see above), and their primary prey, deep-water squid, are not yet major targets of fisheries.<br/><br/>The generation time (mean age of mothers) for Sperm Whales can be calculated if one assumes a set of population parameters, specifically age at first birth, mortality rate of mature females, and reproductive rate of mature females. There is uncertainty about these parameters, so two calculations were made using different assumptions:<br/><br/>a) Applying the population parameters most recently used for Sperm Whales by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (International Whaling Commission 1982): age at first birth = 10 years; female reproductive rate in unexploited population = 0.20/year; female adult mortality = 0.055/yr): generation time = 27.3 years.<br/><br/>b) The estimates of mortality used by the International Whaling Commission are particularly problematic, and Sperm Whales likely have age-specific survival and reproductive rates. Thus it may be more realistic (Whitehead 2002) to use the well-established mortality schedule of Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 1990) and an age-specific pregnancy rate taken from the sperm whale data presented by Best <em>et al</em>. (1984; pregnancy rate for mature females = 0.257-0.0038xAge in years): generation time = 27.5","The greatest threat to Sperm Whales, extensive commercial whaling, has ceased. However, a number of other threats of various dimensions remain.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales have had a long history of local whaling going back at least to the 1500s and intense commercial whaling beginning around 1712 and continuing to 1988. The “modern” highly mechanised phase was particularly intense around 1950, and at its peak killed around 25,000 whales per year, dramatically depleting the global population. In recent decades, some tens of whales were taken each year from small boats in Indonesia (Reeves 2002), although none have been taken in the last two years (H. Whitehead pers. comm.), and 10 are taken annually by Japan under IWC Special Permit (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets, has been a particular problem in the Mediterranean Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2006), but Sperm Whales die from entanglement in nets and lines in many other areas and in a variety of fisheries as well (e.g., Haase and Félix 1994; Barlow and Cameron 2003). Considering the widespread distribution of Sperm Whales, observations of occasional takes in relatively small scale gillnet fisheries (e.g. Barlow and Cameron 2003) suggest much larger takes in unobserved, unregulated high seas driftnet fisheries such as were common before the 1989 adoption of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly. <br/><br/>Sperm Whales sometimes take fish off fishing gear (most often demersal long-line gear), an activity known as “depredation.” Depredation of long-line catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., South East Alaska, Chile, South Georgia and several other southern ocean island areas, North Atlantic). This interaction has resulted in a few reported entanglements and deaths (e.g. Salas 1987; Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004), and has incurred hostility from some fishermen (National Marine Fisheries Service 1998; Donoghue <em>et al</em>. 2003), including shooting of whales (González and Olivarría 2002).<br/><br/>Sperm Whale tissues have high levels of some contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000); however, any population-level effects on health are unknown. The effects of noise on Sperm Whales are also uncertain. Some evidence suggests that they are highly sensitive to noise (e.g., Watkins <em>et al</em>. 1985; Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1994) while other studies have found little or no effect (e.g., Madsen and Møhl 2000; Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002). To date, all published studies of Sperm Whales and noise focus on short-term behavioural effects. Avoidance of sonar (Dawson pers. comm.) and seismic surveys (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1994; but see Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002) has been observed but no mortality has been documented.<br/><br/>Whaling on Sperm Whales has at various times focussed almost exclusively on one sex or the other. Removals of large numbers of males may have had lingering effects on pregnancy rates in some subpopulations (Best 1979; Clarke <em>et al</em>. 1980; Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997) and large males are noticeably uncommon on some breeding grounds (Whitehead 2003). The removal of large numbers of females from social groups, and of older females in particular, may have lingering, socially disruptive effects. Furthermore, recovery might be inhibited via temporary or permanent loss of social cohesion and of socio-ecological knowledge such as is known to occur in other large-brained, long-lived social mammals (e.g., elephants, Poole and Thomsen 1989). <br/><br/>Maximum rates of increase for Sperm Whale populations are very low, possibly on the order of 1% per year (Whitehead 2002). Population growth/recovery can be expected to be low in the species.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales face other threats at a more regional level. These include collisions with ships (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001), for instance off the Canary Islands (André and Potter 2000) and in the Mediterranean (Pesante <em>et al</em>. 2002), and ingestion of marine debris in the Mediterranean (e.g., Viale <em>et al</em>. 1992). <br/><br/>Causes for optimism: On the one hand, the Sperm Whale is not being heavily whaled at present and seems relatively secure from this threat in the short and medium term. When not being actively hunted, the Sperm Whale has rather little interaction with humans: most of its habitat is far from land, and few of its food sources (principally deep-water squid) are of currently harvested (Clarke 1977). Some populations, for instance the animals in the western North Atlantic that were little affected by modern whaling, seem healthy with reasonably high population densities and evidence of satisfactory reproduction (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1998; National Marine Fisheries Service 2000).<br/><br/>Causes for concern: on the other hand, the Sperm Whale, with a maximum rate of increase of around 1% per year (Whitehead 2002), is not well adapted to recover from population depletion. Furthermore, the population model considers only one anthropogenic threat, whaling, and thus posits that the Sperm Whale population has recovered since about 1980 (Fig. 1 in linked PDF document), when large-scale commercial whaling was rapidly coming to an end. This recovery is purely theoretical, and may not be occurring as sperm whales carry high levels of some chemical contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000), ocean noise is increasing (Gordon and Moscrop 1996), interactions with fisheries continue to result in sperm whale deaths (International Whaling Commission 1994), and the lingering, socially disruptive effects of whaling may be inhibiting recovery of this highly social species (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). Some regional populations of sperm whales are declining or are apparently not recovering from depletion. Even in the absence of whaling, the Mediterranean population appears to have declined over the past 20 years, with bycatch in driftnets a likely principal cause (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The southeastern Pacific Sperm Whale population, very heavily whaled during the period 1950-1980, has an extremely low recruitment rate (probably below replacement), perhaps because of the social disruption caused by intense whaling (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). The population of mature and maturing males in the Antarctic was also heavily whaled over the same period, but should have repopulated from less heavily exploited breeding populations at lower latitudes following the end of large-scale commercial whaling. However, systematic surveys of Sperm Whales in the Antarctic showed no substantial or statistically significant increase between 1978 and 1992 (Branch and Butterworth 2001).","The only recent quantitative analysis of sperm whale population trends (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material, which constitutes an integral part of this assessment) suggests that a pre-whaling global population of about 1,100,000 had been reduced by about 29% by 1880 through “open-boat” whaling, and then to approximately 360,000 (67% reduction from initial) by the 1990s through modern whaling, although much uncertainty is associated with all these estimates (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). There is no direct evidence that any part of the population has increased since the end of large-scale whaling in about 1980, although for most areas there is also no direct evidence that they have not. In some areas there is concern that populations are continuing to decline (see below).<br/><br/>The species has a huge geographic range (Rice 1989) and a global population size in the 100,000's (Whitehead 2002; Fig 1). Although there is considerable uncertainty about sperm whale population parameters and levels of exploitation, Whitehead (2002) estimated historical trajectories of sperm whale abundance incorporating many, but not all, sources of uncertainty (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). That model was modified slightly (to produce an endpoint in 2003) and run to estimate the decline in global sperm whale population size between 1921 and 2003 (i.e. over approximately 3 generations; 82yr; see below for estimation of generation time) (H. Whitehead pers. comm.). As sperm whale population size seems to have changed rather little between about 1910-1930 (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material), the calculations are probably quite robust with reference to the estimated generation time. Using the “best” estimates of the model parameters (as in Whitehead 2002), the population in 2003 would have been 44% of that in 1921. Of 1,000 runs using model parameters randomly selected from within reasonable ranges (as in Whitehead 2002), 6% gave populations in 2003 of &lt;30% of that in 1922, 54% gave a 2003 population between 30-50% of that in 1992, and 40% suggested depletion levels of less than 50% over this time.<br/><br/> Arguments can be made that the model results are overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. Factors that would contribute to making the results overly optimistic that are not accounted for in the model include not accounting for under-reporting of illegal Soviet catches in the North Pacific and Antarctica and under-reporting of Japanese catches in the North Pacific (Kasuya and Brownell 2001), other continuing threats (described below), and factors such as continuing effects of social disruption from whaling that might inhibit recovery (consistent with an apparent lack of recovery in many areas). Factors that would contribute to making the results overly pessimistic include the assumption of a relatively low rate of increase in the model and the extrapolation of a relatively high estimate of g(0) (the proportion of whales detected on the trackline) from a single study to the global population. The direction of the effect of other uncertainties in model inputs, including the effects of sex-biased catches, is not certain. Despite these uncertainties, the Whitehead model provides the best available scientific evidence upon which to base this assessment. To reduce these uncertainties, future analyses would need to address the concerns identified above. <br/><br/>Efforts to assess the conservation status of sperm whales and the impact of historical whaling on contemporary structure are compromised by the absence of a good model of sperm whale population structure; pooling data may obscure distinct geographic patterns. While Sperm Whales are known to show long distance movements (Ivashin and Rovnin 1967; Mitchell 1975) and low genetic differentiation among ocean basins, several lines of evidence suggest that sperm whales past and present, have significant geographic structure. Analyses based on historical and contemporary data from tagging records (Rice 1974; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988), blood types (Fujino 1963), catch distributions, sighting patterns, size composition, lack of recovery from exploitation (Japan), timing of pregnancy (Best <em>et al</em>.1984), photo-identification (Whitehead 2003), genetics (Drouot 2004; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999), cultural markers (Rendell and Whitehead 2003) and combinations thereof (Bannister and Mitchell 1980; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988) suggest evidence for structure in many regions. Over the past decade, several authors have investigated population structure in female Sperm Whales using sequence variation within the mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) and/or polymorphic nuclear loci (microsatellites). In general, results tend to find low genetic differentiation among ocean basins and little evidence of subdivision within ocean basins, with the exception of some isolated basins such as the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (Lyrholm <em>et al</em>. 1999; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999; Drouot <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, factors such as low sample sizes, low mtDNA haplotypic diversity and social structure alone and together reduce the power to detect population structure. In addition, it is clear that biologically discrete populations of odontocetes can occur independently of strong geographic or oceanographic features. Alternative, non-geographic based hypotheses of population structure, such as dialect and differences in diet such as are found in Killer Whales, have not been thoroughly examined. For example, Rendell and Whitehead (2003) suggest that female populations seem to be culturally structured within oceans by “coda” vocalizations and may be genetically distinct (Rendell and Whitehead 2005, Rendell <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Unknown,"The Sperm Whale has a large geographic range (Rice 1989).

They are often found over sand and gravel substrates feeding on aquatic insects, mussels, worms and crustaceans. Spawning normally occurs from April through early July with mature shovelnose migrating upriver to spawn over rocky substrates in flowing water between 19–21ºC. Individuals mature after 5–7 years of age, at total lengths of approximately 500 mm and 630 mm for males and females, respectively. Their weight at this age ranges from 0.9–1.3 kg (National Paddlefish and Sturgeon Steering Committee 1992). <br/> <br/>River sturgeon are uniquely adapted to mainstem river systems which are characterized by their large scale, diverse habitats, and a dynamic nature (Beamesderfer and Farr 1997). Adaptations include mobility, opportunistic feeding habits, delayed maturation, longevity, and high individual fecundity. Unfortunately, in recent decades these same life history characteristics have become a handicap to the species and led to population declines because of man-induced habitat fragmentation and destruction (Beamesderfer and Farr 1997).","Alteration of large rivers and construction of locks and dams for navigation purposes has contributed significantly to the decline of shovelnose sturgeon by blocking access to ancestral spawning grounds and by eliminating its requisite lotic habitat.

This may be due to its relatively small size in comparison to lake sturgeon (<em>Acipenser fulvescens</em>) and the pallid sturgeon (<em>Scaphirhynchus albus</em>), the other two sturgeon species found historically throughout its range. Shovelnose are locally abundant in some areas where large river habitat is still fairly intact and modest commercial fisheries occur in a few states where some acceptable riverine habitat still exists (National Paddlefish and Sturgeon Steering Committee 1992). <br/> <br/>Hesse and Carreiro (1997) recorded causes for shovelnose sturgeon decline (as reported to them by state biologists) as habitat degradation, loss of natural hydrograph, sedimentation, channelization, loss of spawning habitat, flood control and navigation dams, artificial water management, water temperature alteration, and past over-harvest. Boreman (1997) noted that sturgeon life history and habitat use attributes make the species highly vulnerable to fishing pressure. Specifically, he attributed this vulnerability to their older age (than most fishes) at full maturity, lower fecundity values, and older age at which 50% of the lifetime egg production is realized with no fishing mortality. <br/> <br/>Shovelnose sturgeon continue to be commercially harvested in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Arkansas closed shovelnose sturgeon to commercial fishing on its state waters of the Mississippi River in 2000, as a measure to reduce the by-catch of endangered pallid sturgeon.

Ten of the range states responded with sufficient information to allow the author to place the individual states into one of four classifications: (1) extirpated, (2) rare/vulnerable/imperiled, (3) stable and (4) undetermined. The remaining range states were assigned these classifications based on information provided by the Nature Conservancy at their website: <a href=""http://www.natureserve.org/explorer"">http://www.natureserve.org/explore</a>. The species has been extirpated from five states, is rare to imperiled in four states, stable in 10 states and has undetermined status in five states.
<br/>
<br/>Historically, shovelnose were apparently common in the Tennessee River system, all the way to the French Broad River on the Tennessee-North Carolina border before the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reservoir system was constructed (Etnier and Starnes 1993). These authors note that, while the species may still occur there sporadically, no recent records exist for either the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers. Sprague (1960) documented the decline in catch and condition of the shovelnose over a five-year period in the Missouri River after impoundment of Lewis and Clark Lake. However, since then these subpopulations have apparently recovered and stabilized (Hesse and Carreiro 1997). Trautman (1981) stated that the shovelnose was considered abundant in the Ohio River until 1911 when the river began ""ponding"" as a result of construction of the slackwater navigation project, thereby partially stopping the spawning run. After that, Trautman (1981) said fishermen reported a drastic decrease in shovelnose sturgeon abundance.  Mettee, <em>et al</em>. (1996) considered the shovelnose extirpated in Alabama.
<br/>
<br/>Today, the shovelnose sturgeon still occurs in most of the large tributaries of the Upper Mississippi River from Wisconsin to Illinois. Hesse and Carreiro (1997) listed 59 rivers, creeks, oxbows and bayous in the Mississippi River Basin where shovelnose sturgeon occurred historically, but only 44 of these were listed as supporting the species today. In Illinois, the species is most abundant in the Wabash River, a tributary to the Ohio River (Smith 1979). According to Smith (1979) the Wabash is less impacted by flood-control dams and other modifications than are the remainder of Illinois’ large rivers.
<br/>
<br/>In the mainstem Mississippi River, numbers of shovelnose sturgeon have decreased sharply since 1900 (Becker 1983), although the species is still commonly taken by commercial fishermen (UMRCC Annual Reports; Etnier and Starnes 1993. Several authors have noted a lack of natural reproduction in areas of the Missouri and have attributed it to man-made alterations to shovelnose sturgeon habitat (Bailey and Cross 1954, June 1977, Moos 1978).   Meanwhile, upstream from the Missouri River mainstem impoundments shovelnose sturgeon remain abundant in the river below Great Falls, Montana and in the major tributaries (Montana DNRC 1977). Robison and Buchanan (1988) describe the shovelnose as especially abundant in the unimpounded portions of the Arkansas, lower White and Red rivers in Arkansas. According to Hesse and Carreiro (1997) state biologists attribute the success of White River sturgeon to a somewhat natural hydrograph with seasonal floods, good gravel bars, and backwater complexes.
<br/>
<br/>Hesse and Carreiro (1997) concluded that while shovelnose sturgeon have probably been considered less at risk than other sturgeon species, evidence suggests that deterioration of the shovelnose’s overall range is keeping pace with that of the other sturgeon species.
<br/>
<br/>Obrecht (1996) noted that shovelnose have been reintroduced into the Bighorn River Basin in Wyoming, where they had been extirpated by dams which blocked spawning migrations from downstream in Montana. West Virginia and New Mexico have also developed reintroduction plans for rivers where the shovelnose has been extirpated (Keenlyne 1997). The Ohio Division of Wildlife reports a plan to reintroduce the shovelnose sturgeon in the Ohio River above Meldahl Lock and Dam at Ohio River kilometer 702 (Scott Schell, pers. comm.). The species has not been recorded from the middle Rio Grande in New Mexico since 1875 (NMDGF 1991).",Decreasing,"The species occurs throughout much of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and portions of their largest tributaries (Lee 1978), including the lower Ohio River (Smith 1979). The species once occurred as far upstream in the Ohio River as Pennsylvania (Trautman 1981). Shovelnose sturgeon are rare above Newburg, Indiana (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 1990), but relatively abundant below Smithland Locks and Dam at Ohio River kilometer 1,479 (Greg Conover, USFWs, pers. comm.). The <em>Scaphirhynchus</em> species, previously reported as shovelnose sturgeon in the drainages of Mobile Bay in Alabama by Smith-Vaniz (1968), were reclassified by Williams and Clemmer (1991) as the Alabama sturgeon (<em>Scaphirhynchus suttkusi</em>). The only known subpopulation of shovelnose sturgeon in the Alabama portion of the Tennessee River is apparently extinct. Shovelnose sturgeon may still occur sporadically in the lower Tennessee or Cumberland Rivers (Etnier and Starnes 1993). A disjunct subpopulation once occurred in the Rio Grande of Northern New Mexico  (Tomelleri and Eberle 1990), but only one specimen is known to exist from that subpopulation (Blair <em>et al</em>. 1968). Eddy and Underhill (1974) report shovelnose sturgeon occurring in the Hudson Bay drainage of the Canadian Plains.

It arrives on its breeding grounds between late-April and May and breeds from late-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in highly dispersed (Kear 2005) solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). After mating (from June onwards), males migrate long distances prior to their flightless moult, most travelling in small groups to inshore or offshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988). Females and juveniles leave the breeding grounds in September (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious when not breeding (Madge and Burn 1988) with males forming large congregations during the flightless moulting period (Kear 2005). Large flocks of several hundred to a thousand (Snow and Perrins 1998) or occasionally over 100,000 individuals can be observed during winter (Scott and Rose 1996). Non-breeders often oversummer on the wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on Arctic dwarf heath (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005) or boggy tundra on pools, small lakes, streams (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and slow-flowing rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for freshwater habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) with low banks (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), small islets (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys<strong><sup> </sup></strong>or among mossy bogs (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). It generally avoids areas with steep slopes or wetlands enclosed by forest (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) the majority moult and overwinter at sea (Kear 2005) or shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep (Kear 2005) (optimally 5-15 m [Scott and Rose 1996]) with abundant benthic fauna (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. barnacles and shrimps [Johnsgard 1978]), worms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), echinoderms, isopods, amphidods (Kear 2005) and insects&#160;(e.g. midges and caddisflies [del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992]) as well as small fish<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and fish eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as seeds, roots and tubers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) close to water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) or placed further away in dwarf heath (Kear 2005).</p>    <p></p>","<p>Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions have been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011), and future ocean acidification may lead to sustained declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten the species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while oil drilling sites could also cause low-level impacts through human disturbance and degradation of food resources (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). In parts of the range, avoidance of busy shipping areas by flocks of the species could displace flocks from preferred feeding areas. Hunting represents another threat to the species, with an average of 9,500 birds reported to be shot annually in the US and an additional 7,000 per year in Canada through the 1980s and 1990s. However, the actual number killed may have been much higher with maximum estimates exceeding 24,000 in the US in 1974 and 23,000 annually in Canada between 1974 and 1982 (Bordage and Savard 2011). Since this period, numbers of hunters have decreased considerably and the annual harvest has fallen concomitantly. The species is susceptible to avian influenza and may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is unlikely to affect the majority of the population at once and only small numbers of birds tested in various countries have developed the disease despite evident exposure to the virus. High-speed ferries can cause disturbance to this species (Larsen and Laubek 2005).

178589687,41712,Eubalaena glacialis,Critically Endangered,C2a(ii),2020,2020-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The estimated number of North Atlantic Right Whales alive at the end of 2018 was&#160;409 individuals (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020), of which fewer than 250 were mature. The population was declining during 2011–2020 due to a combination of increased mortality rates (driven primarily by entanglement in fishing gear and vessel strikes) and reproductive rates below the average for previous years. Because the former eastern North Atlantic subpopulation of Right Whales, if it still exists, contains at most a few individuals, it can be assumed that the western North Atlantic subpopulation contains over 90% of North Atlantic Right Whales. The species therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(ii).","Right Whales feed on calanoid copepods and other small invertebrates (smaller copepods, euphausids (krill), pteropods, and larval barnacles), generally by slowly skimming through patches of concentrated prey at or below the surface (Mayo and Marx 1990). The most common prey species is the copepod <em>Calanus finmarchicus</em> (Baumgartner <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Relative abundance of Right Whales has been positively correlated with copepod density off the northeastern United States (Pendleton <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also correlated with sea surface temperature, sediment type, and bathymetry (Good 2008). Baumgartner and Mate (2005) attached satellite-monitored radio tags to Right Whales in the Bay of Fundy in order to investigate their habitat use. They found that when the tagged animals left the Bay, they did not frequently visit the deep basins of the Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf, where abundance of <em>C. finmarchicus </em>was thought to be high. Instead, the whales visited areas characterized by low bottom water temperatures, high surface salinity, and high surface stratification.","Right Whales in the North Atlantic are no longer hunted, and the most serious current threat is death and injury from entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes off the east coast of North America (Kraus <em>et al</em>. 2016). During 2012–2016, there were 30 confirmed human-caused deaths or serious injuries, including 26 entanglements and two ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2019). Because some human-caused deaths probably pass undetected, the reported events are minima. Entanglement events appear to be increasing in both frequency and severity (Knowlton <em>et al</em>. 2016). A further 30 deaths were recorded during 2017–19 of which 21 were in Canadian and nine in US waters (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Photo-identification images revealed that most individual Right Whales (82.9%) bear evidence of being entangled at least once while over half (59.0%) of the individuals have been entangled more than once. The evidence suggests that Right Whales acquire new entanglement scars on a nearly annual basis, juvenile whales at a higher rate than adults (Knowlton <em>et al</em>. 2012). Based on observations during 1995–2008 of 50 free-living individuals observed to be carrying fishing gear, compared with 459 individuals never seen with gear during that period, Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a mortality rate of approximately 25% during the first year after which the individual was first seen with gear. Because some deaths may occur before the whale is seen with gear, this provides a minimum estimate of the mortality rate of entangled whales in addition to those that die immediately following entanglement. Even if not directly fatal, entanglement is detrimental to the whale’s energy balance leading to poorer body condition, lower reproduction and lower survival (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2017, van der Hoop <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In the Bay of Fundy and on the Scotian Shelf (Canada), from 2004 to 2008, groundfish hook-and-line gear was found to pose the greatest risk to Right Whales during the summer, and lobster gear during the spring and autumn migration periods (Vanderlaan <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, of 12 Right Whale deaths recorded in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in summer 2017, six were examined, and the cause of death was found to be entanglement in snow crab fishing gear in two cases and suspected to be blunt trauma consistent with vessel strike in four cases. In addition, five live whales were observed entangled including at least four in snow crab gear. Three of those whales were freed by human intervention or freed themselves, and the fate of the remaining two was unknown (Daoust <em>et al</em>. 2017, Taylor and Walker 2017).<br/><br/>Right Whales appear to be the most vulnerable large whales to ship strikes (Vanderlaan and Taggart 2007). Ship strikes were found to be the cause of death for 53% of the 40 Right Whales necropsied between 1970 and 2006 and could have been responsible for up to 10 individual North Atlantic Right Whale deaths per year (Vanderlaan <em>et al</em>. 2009). Confirmed Right Whale deaths due to ship strikes declined from 2.0 (2000–2006) to 0.4 per year (2012–2016) (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2019). The decrease may have been due, in part, to spatial mitigation efforts (so-called Seasonal Management Areas, or SMAs) implemented in U.S. waters in 2008 (van der Hoop <em>et al</em>. 2015). The SMAs were designed to correspond to Right Whale feeding, calving, and migration areas and it is estimated that this mitigation effort reduced mortality by 80–90% (Conn and Silber 2013). The risk of ship strike was reduced by an estimated 82% due to an “Area to Be Avoided” vessel-routing initiative implemented by the International Maritime Organization in the Roseway Basin Area on the Scotian Shelf (Vanderlaan and Taggart 2009). However, the shift in summer distribution of Right Whales may have increased their exposure to ship strikes in the most recent years.<br/><br/>Low-frequency in-water noise from shipping activity has been linked to physiological stress (increased glucocorticoid levels) in North Atlantic Right Whales (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2012), but the evidence is weak. Acoustic masking from anthropogenic noise (especially ship noise) may negatively affect both reproduction by interfering with courtship vocalizations and prey acquisition by interfering with communication and reducing feeding opportunities (Hatch <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Environmental neurotoxins produced as a result of harmful algal blooms have the potential to affect reproduction and development. Paralytic shellfish toxin and domoic acid that were detected in faecal samples indicate that Right Whales are exposed to environmental neurotoxins on an annual basis for up to six months of the year (Durbin <em>et al</em>. 2002, Doucette <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Climate change appears to have caused a northward shift in the summer distribution of North Atlantic Right Whales, likely due to effects on prey distribution, which exposes the Right Whales to shipping and entanglement risks over a greater area (Meyer-Gutbrod <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><p></p>  <p></p>","<strong>Northwest Atlantic<br/></strong>Based mainly on photo-identification data, the North Atlantic Right Whale population was estimated to have been increasing at an average rate of 2.8% per year from 1990 to 2011, peaking at about 480 individuals in 2011. Abundance has been declining since 2011, to an estimated 409 individuals by the end of 2018. Reproduction has declined as reflected in both lower calf counts (average 10 calves per year observed during 2012–19, compared with 24 per year during 2004–11) and longer calving intervals. Associated with a lower estimated survival rate for females, the female proportion in the population is estimated to be only about 40%, despite a birth sex ratio close to 50:50. During 2017–19, only 12 calves were observed but 30 deaths were documented. (Pace <em>et al</em>. 2017, Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160; <br/><br/>There has also been a change since 2011 in patterns of habitat use (IWC 2017). There has been a northward shift in summer distribution into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, leaving fewer whales in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine (Stokstad 2017).<br/><br/>Calf counts have been conducted since 1980, and calf production has fluctuated. It was particularly low during 1998–2000 and again during 2012-2019, with no calves at all observed in 2018 (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020). Years of low calf production have been correlated with environmental conditions (Greene <em>et al</em>. 2003) and with poor body condition of adults (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016). Based on the pattern of occurrence in the calving grounds of females at different stages in the calving cycle, Browning <em>et al</em>. (2010) inferred that there is considerable cryptic perinatal mortality in addition to known calf deaths. For the period 1989–2003, those authors documented 191 surviving calves and 17 known calf deaths and estimated a further 28 cryptic calf deaths.<br/><br/>The demographics of North Atlantic Right Whales compare unfavourably with those of Southern Right Whales in terms of birth and death rates as well as indicators of health (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2016, Corkeron <em>et al</em>. 2018). The occurrence of skin lesions of a kind not seen in Southern Right Whales was recorded in North Atlantic Right Whales during the period 1995 to 2002, and appeared to be correlated with the failure of females that would normally have been ready to have reproduced on schedule (Rolland <em>et al</em>. 2007). Body condition as measured by blubber thickness was poorer in the North Atlantic Right Whales than in Southern Right Whales (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic</strong><br/>Due to the paucity of records in recent times (see Geographic Range), and the fact that all photographed sightings have been identified as migrants from the west, it seems unlikely that there is a remnant northeast Atlantic breeding subpopulation. It is also unclear whether in the past the animals in the northeastern part of the range (off Iceland and Norway) belonged mainly to the western or eastern breeding subpopulations, or to what degree the two breeding subpopulations were separate.<br/><br/><strong>Historical population size</strong><br/>The first documented records of Basque whaling in the Bay of Biscay are from the 11th century (Rey-Iglesia <em>et al</em>. 2018). At least dozens of Right Whales were killed each year in the Bay of Biscay until a marked decline was evident by 1650, and whaling declined during the 18th century. Basque whalers arrived in Iceland as early as 1412, and participated in the Right Whale fishery around the British Isles and Norway from the 14th to the 18th century, but probably many more whales were taken by Dutch, Danish, British, and Norwegian whalers. Quantitative estimates of catches are not available. Historical “right whale” catches as far north as Iceland and Norway appear to have been mainly <em>Eubalaena glacialis</em>, with Bowhead Whales being the main species only in the far north (Greenland and Svalbard) (Aguilar 1986). Smith <em>et al</em>. (2006) documented extensive whaling for Right Whales in the North Cape area (northern Norway) in the 17th century. Right Whale hunting in the northeastern Atlantic seems to have declined from the mid-17th century and all but disappeared by the mid-18th century, but there was a brief period of Right Whale catches by modern whalers operating from shore stations in the northwestern British Isles and off Iceland, with at least 120 Right Whales taken during 1881–1924 (Collett 1909, Brown 1986). The last recorded catch was a cow-calf pair off Madeira in 1967, accompanied by a third individual that escaped. There is some archaeological and historical evidence for a Right Whale wintering ground in the Mediterranean Sea in classical times, with a likely fishery near the Straits of Gibraltar (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>It is not clear when Basque whaling first spread to the western North Atlantic, but it had been established no later than 1530. It had long been thought that large numbers (tens of thousands) of Right Whales were taken off Labrador and Newfoundland by the Basques between 1530 and 1610 (Aguilar 1986, Reeves 2001) but recent genetic evidence suggests that many, if not most, of these were Bowheads (Rastogi <em>et al</em>. 2004, McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2008). Shore-based whaling along the U.S. east coast began in the mid-17th century and continued at least sporadically over the next two and a half centuries (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>Historical catches, particularly in the northeastern Atlantic, are insufficiently documented to allow estimation of the pre-whaling population size. Monsarrat <em>et al</em>. (2016) used historical catches in the North Pacific, which are better documented, to relate pre-whaling Right Whale summer abundance to habitat parameters, and then applied this relationship to the North Atlantic. This resulted in an estimated pre-whaling total abundance in the North Atlantic of 9,000–21,000, based on ecological carrying capacity. Much of this population is predicted to have summered in the Norwegian Sea and on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong></strong>",Decreasing,"The Right Whale formerly was common on both sides of the North Atlantic. It appears to be effectively extirpated in the eastern North Atlantic but in the past probably ranged from a calving ground in the Golfo de Cintra (23°N) off Western Sahara, through the Azores, Bay of Biscay, western British Isles, and the Norwegian Sea to the North Cape (hence the Dutch, German and Scandinavian name Noordkaper / Nordkaper) (Rice 1998). It may also have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2018). In the western North Atlantic the species migrates from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia along the eastern seaboard of North America, to summering grounds largely in the Gulf of Maine, south of Cape Cod, Bay of Fundy, Scotian Shelf, and Gulf of Saint Lawrence.<br/><br/>Today, North Atlantic Right Whales are regularly seen in the winter calving grounds off Florida and Georgia, and in spring/summer feeding grounds in Cape Cod Bay and south of Cape Cod, the Great South Channel off Massachusetts, the Gulf of Maine, the Scotian Shelf, the Bay of Fundy, and increasingly in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2019). There have been a few sightings off Cape Farewell (southern tip of Greenland) (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Iceland (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2007), and in the Gulf of Mexico (Ward-Geiger <em>et al</em>. 2011). Adult females appear to migrate to the southern calving grounds in winters in which they bear a calf while most males and other females do not migrate to the calving grounds, especially after summers with below-average prey abundance (Gowan <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>There have been very few sightings in the northeast Atlantic in recent times. A possible Right Whale was sighted in the Bay of Biscay in 1977 (Aguilar 1981) and a cow-calf pair was sighted off Cape Vincent, Portugal in 1995 (Martin and Walker 1997). One Right Whale was apparently sighted off the island of Sardinia (Mediterranean Sea) in 1991, but a survey of the former Cintra Bay calving ground off Western Sahara failed to locate any Right Whales (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 1998). Individual Right Whales sighted off Norway in 1999, off the Azores in 2009 (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2012) and off France in 2019 (Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020) have each been identified as animals from the western North Atlantic subpopulation (Jacobsen <em>et al</em>. 2004, Silva <em>et al</em>. 2012, Pettis <em>et al</em>. 2020). There have been unconfirmed reports from northwest Ireland and the Canary Islands. <br/><br/>The distribution map shows where the species is known to occur, based on confirmed records post-1900, and may occur, based on oceanography. The species has not been recorded for all the states within the hypothetical range as shown on the map.",This North Atlantic Right Whale is no longer hunted. It was once the target of major commercial whaling.,Marine,"Right Whales have been protected from hunting by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling since it came into force in 1948, and by its predecessor in the 1930s. The North Atlantic Right Whale is listed as Endangered under both the U.S. Endangered Species Act and the Canadian Species At Risk Act and it is listed in Appendix I of both the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.<br/><br/>Efforts are underway in both the U.S. and Canada aimed at limiting North Atlantic Right Whale deaths and injuries due to ship strikes and entanglements. In both countries, recovery plans have been implemented. In U.S. waters, mandatory time-area speed restrictions in the form of Seasonal Management Areas were implemented in 2008 in an effort to reduce the frequency and severity of ship strikes. A Mandatory Ship Reporting Scheme has been in place since 1999 in two areas of the Right Whale calving and summering grounds to warn vessels of whales’ presence. Regulations specify minimum approach distances for whale-watching and other vessels. Regulations are in place in the U.S. involving restrictions on certain types of fishing gear in areas where, and times when, Right Whales are common. Pace <em>et al</em>. (2015) found that measures adopted prior to 2009 to reduce entanglements had not been effective. New measures adopted since 2009 have yet to be evaluated (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>Canada has introduced measures to limit ship speeds and close areas to snow crab, lobster and other non-tended fixed-gear fishing in areas where Right Whales are common and in other areas following sightings of Right Whales (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2019). <strong></strong>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Migration is driven by the need for calm weather (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Breeding takes place during the dry season when rivers are at their lowest and sandbars most exposed (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. This generally occurs from March to June in West and East Africa, and mainly from July to November south of the equator (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Nigeria the species disperses up to 600km from its breeding sites in June - August (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, moving mainly downstream (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It returns in November or December, coinciding with the onset of strong winds in its non-breeding areas (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Breeding occurs in small colonies of up to 50 pairs (Tyler 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Botswana, it breeds along the Okavango and Chobe rivers between July and November (Tyler, 2012). During the non-breeding season larger flocks are formed, sometimes of up to 1500 birds (Tyler 2004)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Habitat </strong>This species requires expanses of calm water for feeding (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <em>Breeding </em>It breeds along broad rivers on large, dry sandbars that are largely free from vegetation (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It sometimes breeds on sandy lake shores, and very occasionally on sandy sea shores (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>During the non-breeding season it is more commonly found at lakes (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986) and also frequents coastal lagoons, salt-pans, open marshes and estuaries (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is less common along coasts (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Vagrant birds may use swamps and artificial habitats such as sewage ponds and dams (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <strong>Diet </strong>It feeds on fish, such as cichlids (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, foraging exclusively in the fashion characteristic of the family Rynchopidae, namely by skimming the water in flight with its mouth open and lower mandible submerged (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.<strong> Breeding site </strong>Eggs are laid in an unlined scrape in the sand (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Scrapes occurs within 2-14m of one another (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986) and are initially created within 30m of the water (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, though falling water levels may increase this distance (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The clutch-size is two or three, rarely four, and the incubation period is c.21 days followed by a fledging period of about four weeks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","Dam-building has flooded some upstream areas and reduced downstream flows, destroying suitable habitat (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Coppinger <em>et al.</em> 1988, Ginn <em>et al.</em> 1989)<strong></strong>. Farming practices have also caused siltation of many rivers, raising river levels and swamping breeding islands (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Ginn <em>et al.</em> 1989)<strong></strong>. Egg-collecting, trapping of adults and general disturbance by humans, cattle and recently increased boat traffic can be serious problems in some areas (Britton 1980, Coppinger <em>et al.</em> 1988, Tyler and Stone 2000)<strong></strong>. Disruption by recreational fishermen may impact breeding colonies in the Okavango Panhandle, and local fishermen have been reported using chicks as bait (Vial 1995; cited in Hancock 2008). Food supplies may have been reduced by pollution, overfishing and introduced predatory fish, but it is unclear whether this has affected its prey of small fry (fish) (Tyler and Stone 2000)<strong></strong>. Large-scale spraying of DDT and general water pollution may result in toxic bioaccumulation of pollutants in these piscivores (Coppinger <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong></strong>.

It is less restricted in the non-breeding season, dispersing to rivers, lakes and coasts in countries as widespread as <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Gambia</strong> and <strong>Botswana</strong>. In Botswana, they disappear from breeding areas in the austral summer and autumn (S. Tyler <em>in litt. </em>2020). Large concentrations (including breeding birds) occur along the Zambezi River (F. Dowsett-Lemaire and R. J. Dowsett <em>in litt</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, e.g. 1,428 individuals (Coppinger <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and non-breeding flocks of at least 1,000 individuals have been recorded in <strong>Tanzania</strong> and <strong>Kenya</strong>. Research by (Gamundani <em>et al.,</em> 2017) suggests that breeding in Zimbabwe has not recovered, more than fifty years after the creation of Lake Kariba.

Whilst the situation is more concerning in Southeast Asia despite its marginal occurrence here, localised declines also continue to occur across India, of which currently holds the majority of the population. Comprehensive monitoring is however required to limit uncertainty in population trends.","It inhabits rivers and freshwater lakes, also occurring rarely on estuaries, and breeds on sandy and rocky islands, especially along river banks (Mundkur 1991, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species is known to be breed in high concentrations in large reservoirs and rivers, as well as natural and artificial wetlands in India (G. Sundar <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Some sandbanks may also be used for nesting due to temporary exposure after irrigation and water management from nearby reservoirs (S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160; It has been recorded up to 600 m in Nepal. It feeds predominantly on fish, small crustaceans, insects, and frogs (Mundkur 1991). Breeding occurs mainly in February-May, although the season may extent from November to May (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Mundkur 1991).","Nesting areas are vulnerable to flooding, predation and disturbance (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160;In a 2017-2019 study in Odisha, India, flooding, predation and cyclones were the main threats (Debrata 2019, Kar <em>et al</em>. in prep). Local fishermen also report that children collect eggs and chicks from sandbanks, which may pose a substantial threat to ground-nesting birds. Strangling of chicks in discarded fish nets is being recorded at different areas and may pose a growing risk (Narwade and Fartade 2013, Reshamwala 2017). Sand and gold mining is an emerging threat for breeding colonies of Indian Skimmer, with which the River Tern nests and is thought to have a long-term effect on nesting-island formation (Das 2015, Shaikh <em>et al</em>. 2018, Debata <em>et al.</em> 2019, C.&#160;Zöckler <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Poor water level management along rivers are additionally affecting the stability of colonies (T. Mundkur <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In several places in India, human disturbance, encroachment of wetlands by cities, disturbance by photographers and birdwatchers, egg and chick trampling by domestic water buffalo and Chital deer is common (Amoghavarsha 2013, S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Future plans for water transportation routes on the&#160;Ayeyawady, and dredging on the Chindwin River for commercial and passenger transport&#160;may further create localised threats (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Predation of eggs and chicks by a variety of terrestrial animals including domestic dogs, Lesser Bandicoot Rat (<em>Bandicota bengalensis</em>), Monitor Lizard (<em>Varanus salvator</em>; Mundkur 1991), and avian predators including House Crow (<em>Corvus splendens</em>; Siddiqui <em>et al</em>. 2007), Black-headed Ibis (<em>Threskiornis melanocephalus;&#160;</em>Parimala 2013, Reshamwala 2017), Pallas’s Fishing Eagle (<em>Haliaeetus leucophus</em>; Lowther 1949) and Bonelli's Eagle (<em>Aquila fasciata</em>; Belur 2014) may be taking their toll. Invasive plants such as <em>Mimosa pigra </em>may also reduce nest success and chick survival (Claassen <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>The negative population trend in Laos is probably due mainly to excessive human disturbance on sandbars (Thewlis <em>et al</em>. 1998). In Nepal, it is&#160;threatened by food shortage, illegal and over-fishing in protected areas, destruction of breeding habitats on rivers, disturbance and hunting (K. Bhusal <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;In Cambodia, a study of breeding colonies in 2010-2015 found that egg collection, predation by rodents, crows and domestic dogs and trampling by domestic water buffalo were responsible for low breeding success (Claassen <em>et al</em>. 2017, J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2018).&#160;The study found very little evidence of direct hunting of the species, although a snare was once found at a nest (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160; The multitude of dam construction projects completed, underway or planned in South-East Asia (e.g. along the Mekong river [F. Goes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011]<em></em>) may also threaten the species through changes to flow regime and flooding of nest-sites. Dams along the Sesan river in Vietnam have precipitated the decline and led to near-extirpation of the species downstream in Cambodia (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Its habitat may be threatened by the construction of dams  in the Dayingjiang region of south-western Yunnan (Yang Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>.  2011, Dasgupta 2019). In Nepal it is severely threatened by food shortages owing to illegal fishing inside protected areas and overfishing outside protected areas, it is also threatened by destruction of breeding habitat, disturbance and hunting (Inskipp <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Myanmar, planned developments may potentially threaten the species in the future (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). Breeding sites along the Indus River (passing between the plains of Punjab and Sindh provinces) are threatened with encroachment and conflict, as well as agricultural expansion leading to increases in human settlements and live stock (M. Ali <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","A previous Asian Waterbird Census' observed 5,733 birds during 1987-1992, 5,558 during 1993-1997, 9,963 during 1998-2002, and 7,578 during 2003-2007 across some Indian and Pakistan sites (Li <em>et al</em>. 2009). Further surveys for the 2008-2015 period then observed across all of Asia and Australasia found an overall 29,577 birds across Myanmar (39 birds), Thailand (2), Bangladesh (74), India (17,776), Nepal (31), Pakistan (11,485)&#160;and Cambodia (170) (Mundkur <em>et al</em>. 2017). Under-counting is however thought to have been a major factor. Populations in the Southeast Asian part of its range are however very small and at higher risk of extinction (F. Goes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). In the whole Mekong basin for example, the population is currently estimated at less than 100 birds (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Using the best available information therefore, the population is thought to number at least 29,500 individuals, with the potential to reach a maximum of 100,000 individuals, assuming some surveys may be under-counted. Using a rounded population size of 30,000-100,000 individuals therefore, the population is placed in the band of 20,000-70,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species occurs along river systems across a wide range in southern and south-east Asia, being found in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pakistan</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bangladesh</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Myanmar</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Thailand</span>,&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cambodia</span>,&#160;and southern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span> (Yunnan), as well as <strong>Nepal, Bhutan, Laos, </strong>and <strong>Vietnam </strong>during the non-breeding season ([T.

Whilst the population in India, Bangladesh (albeit has become rare here), Pakistan, Myanmar and Cambodia are largely resident with some seasonal movement, the species will have additional local movement in India, often migrating to Nepal (considered rare) and Bhutan during the non-breeding season, with breeders from southwest China migrating to northern Laos (T. Mundkur <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>It has also reportedly declined in abundance in Thailand, where it is now considered very rare (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>.1996). The species has declined along the Mekong River, in Laos since the early 20th century (Thewlis <em>et al</em>. 1998), and was very close to being extirpated from the country (W. Duckworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). It has also been undergoing a strong decline along the Mekong River system in Cambodia since 2003, with extirpation or sharp declines noted in the number of pairs throughout its breeding range since 2007 (Goes 2014, F. Goes&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2016). Specific conservation actions, alongside nest protection and exclosure have however slowed down decline rates and stabilised the core Mekong population (Classern 2018, F. Goes&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>It however no longer breeds on the Tonle Sap, the Mekong below Kratie, or Sesan River (Goes 2014, Claassen 2018). In Cambodia the species has declined by &gt;80% in the past 20 years and in 2018, the population was estimated to be 54-62 individuals whilst less than 50 birds are thought to exist currently (Claassen 2018, S. Mahood <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Moreover, only 2-3 pairs are thought to occur at Sekong River in Siem Pang (J. C. Eames <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Two nests were observed in May 2019 at Khang Lok Krau, albeit only one was observed 3 days later due to rat predation&#160; (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2019). During the 2017-2019 period overall, further records showed only one pair that nested on a particular river stretch in Myanmar (with nesting deemed unsuccessful due to flooding in 2019), a decrease from 65-69 birds observed during the 2003-2004 period (C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In China, the species occurs along two river systems, including the Dayingjiang River in Southwestern Yunnan and the Yarlung Zangbo River in Southeastern Tibet (W. Cheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The species is described as uncommon along the Dayingjiang river in south-western Yunnan (Yang Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, Dasgupta 2019). The number of species present on the Dayingjiang River had declined from 30 birds to less than 5-13 between 2010-2019, with only 5 individuals recorded in early 2020; 11 individuals are however currently thought to reside on this river temporarily after one pair successfully raised two clutches, harbouring 3 juveniles each (X. Zheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020, W. Cheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020), suggesting temporary recovery of the population here. 3 individuals have additionally been sighted on a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River in 2018. It may also occur in small numbers on the Ruili River, between the border of China and Myanmar (H. Fen-Qi <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Pakistan, the species is common throughout most small and large wetlands, subjected to only selective declines in particular sites (Z. Shaikh <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>The species has greatly declined to a few pairs that may breed at few sites on the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin rivers in Myanmar (Zöckler 2020, A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2020), with only one breeding site in Bangladesh (Chowdhury <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Recent sightings at Padma River in the Rajshahi Division are confirmed however, with 10-20 pairs observed continuously&#160;over the last decade on the Bangladeshi coast (S.

This is after 81 birds observed in the early 2000s. More than 40 birds were although recorded at Chindwin River in recent surveys (2018-2019; C.&#160;Zöckler&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Nepal, the species is now a rare and very local visitor, with a maximum population of 20 individuals estimated in 2016, having rapidly declined since the 1990s (Inskipp&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is only regularly recorded from two protected areas here; Bardia National Park and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (K. Bhusal <em>in litt</em>. 2020, R. Chaudhary <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>In contrast to declines noted in South-East Asia, the species is now more regular in southern India than was once thought, having probably benefited from the development of reservoirs (Praveen J.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012). At Pong Dam hydro-electric power station for example, 384 nests were observed in 2006 (with 126 nests observed on Ranseer Island), 400 nests in 2015, with an average sighting record of 800-1,000 birds every winter (S.

Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020). At Chilika Lake (Odisha state), despite previously harbouring c. 1,500 birds and particularly 300-400 birds on the Nalabana Island (located within the lake), the species has seen marginal declines here for example; 540 nests were found in 2002, with declines beginning in 2003, leading to only 200 nests in 2008, and subsequently below 50 nests in 2010, and complete abandonment of the island by 2011 (S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020). 20-30 nests have since been observed on a nearby, unprotected island (Panchgudhi; S. Balachandran <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Declines (likely attributed to fishing camps) have also been observed in sandy islands and tracts in&#160;Brahmaputra, Subansiri, Lohit and Dibang (A.&#160;Choudhury <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Alternatively, 11,000 nests were recently found at Almatti Backwaters in Bagalkot, Karnataka over 12 exposed sandy islands (S. Subramanya <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Despite some localised declines therefore, the species is overall considered to be widespread in large numbers across many artificial and natural wetlands in India (G.

The species is considered At Risk in Laos, Critical in Thailand, Critical in Cambodia (Goes 2014) and Critically Endangered in Nepal (Inskipp <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species occurs in a number of protected areas. In Cambodia, nest protection programmes have been implemented by the World Wildlife Fund on the Mekong River and by the Royal University of Phnom Penh on the Sekong and Sesan rivers (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2016). These programmes involve education, employing local people as nest guards and the use of predator exclosures&#160;(A. Claassen&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Local conservation efforts is thought to enable temporary recover of the species on Dayingjiang Rive (W. Cheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Cambodia, a Species Action Plan has been prepared for 2018-2028 (Claassen 2018), however this currently lacks funding to be implemented properly (F. Goes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Myanmar,&#160;a nest protection programme is being implemented on the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin rivers by the Wildlife Conservation Society (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Community Conservation Areas (CCA's) are also proposed to maintain the last remaining sites along the Ayeyarwady River (Zöckler&#160;2019). In China (Yunnan), nest protection is being led by the Kandoorie Farm and Botanic Garden (A. Claassen <em>in litt</em>. 2020, X. Zheng <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Direct payments have additionally proven successful in implementing nest protection, however require continued use of monitoring, community relations and exclosures (Claassen <em>et al</em>. 2017).

Thus the species is listed here as Near Threatened, but future surveys could show that the species is declining at an even greater rate.","This species breeds on small lakes, pools, bogs and streams of the tundra. It mainly feeds on molluscs but will also take crustaceans, with a more varied diet in summer including insects, arachnids, berries and seeds. It feeds by diving, and will pluck or dabble on the surface. Breeding begins in May or June in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1992)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","<p>Climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Warming and sea ice retreat poses an ongoing and future threat to the species’ habitat as sea ice provides an important resting platform when not foraging (Lovvorn <em>et al</em>. 2009). Reductions in ice habitat are predicted to result in large decreases in the area of viable habitat, even in the absence of other impacts such as shifts in food availability (Lovvorn <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; Such habitat shifts have been seen in almost one third of winters between 1998 and 2011, denying access to preferred foraging locations and forcing prey switching, resulting in adult body fat being one third lower than in winters with access to these resources (Lovvorn <em>et al.</em> 2014). A recent modelling study by Christie <em>et al</em>. (2018) reveals that under an RCP 8.5 scenario, the species's abundance will likely increase through to 2040 before declining rapidly through to near extirpation in the late 21st century as the Bering Sea becomes ice-free. There appears to be no difference in mean survival between widely separated breeding areas, indicating that survival is mainly a function of wintering conditions (Solovyeva <em>et al.</em> 2017). Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for the species, and remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith <em>et al. </em>2005, Riordan <em>et al. </em>2006), while the alteration of habitats through coastal erosion, inundation and salinization from storm surges, thawing permafrost, and sedimentation changes due to sea level rise and increased river discharge could change the suitability of current nesting areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, no link between wetland loss and population decline has been made for this species yet. Nevertheless, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region, with unknown impacts on the long-term survival of the species (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Climate change has also been held responsible for severely reducing the Eiders’ benthic prey, likely due to ocean acidification (e.g. molluscs which form a large part of Eider diet) (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017); <em>Macoma calcarea</em>,&#160;a key prey of the Spectacled Eider, is evidenced to be decreasing in abundance throughout sites in the Bering Sea, influencing the Eider's winter foraging (Goethel <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Direct persecution poses another major threat to the species, with 10s to 100s of individuals harvested in Alaska and 10,000-14,000 in Russia per annum (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). This represents around 5% annual mortality, based on a population of 330,000 (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Pollution also threatens this species with lethal and sub-lethal levels of lead poisoning from ingested lead shot found in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding population, with levels high enough to influence regional subpopulation dynamics (Flint <em>et al.</em> 2016, Sea Duck Joint Venture 2016). Exposure to lead reduced estimated survival from 0.78 to 0.44 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010), while the survival of females exposed to lead was 0.34 lower than that of those with blood lead levels at or below background levels (Grand <em>et al.</em> 1998). Lead levels exceeding typical exposure thresholds were found in 30.7% of females in the Chaun Delta, Russia between 2003-2010; however, only 8.8% exhibited levels above the critical threshold (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt</em>. 2012, 2020). Lead shot is likely not a serious threat to Siberian populations due to the low human density in the breeding range (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt</em>. 2020).</p>  <p>Oil spills occur in the species range, and although infrequent, represent a significant risk to the population (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). Oil and gas development on the central coast of Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain has altered nesting habitat, causing potential threats from oil contamination, off-road vehicle use, wetland filling as well as the indirect effects of human disturbance (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, the development related to the petroleum industry is not regarded a significant threat to the species as only a small proportion of the species’s range is within or near developed areas. The risk to eiders from collisions and disturbance resulting from industrial activities and interaction with shipping lanes linked to oil and gas development is thought to be low and is unlikely to have population-level effects (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, but at present, the disease appears not to have any significant effects on the population. Seroprevalence of avian influenza in Spectacled Eider is approximately 90% (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013), but less than 5% tested positive for the virus (Ip <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  Arctic Foxes <em>Vulpes lagopus</em> are present in the species’s range and may contribute to mortality through predation. Density of wolverine and now brown bear appear to have increased in low Arctic tundra as a result of climate change impacts (Solovyeva 2016). Modelling of breeding success indicates that predation is likely to be driving reductions in productivity, although factors operating over winter are likely to be the main drivers of observed declines across the range (Solovyeva <em>et al</em>. 2017a). Changes in the species community composition may be also having an effect, with a decline in Sabine’s Gull <em>Xema sabini</em> and Arctic Tern <em>Sterna paradise</em> (which provide nest protection) and an increase in mammalian predators and Vega Gull <em>Larus smithsonianus vegae</em> potentially leading to reduced breeding success (see Solovyeva and Zelenskaya 2016, Solovyeva <em>et al</em>. 2017b). It is possible that these community changes are a result of climate change (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt. </em>2018).","Wetlands International (2020) estimate the global population to number 360,000-400,000 individuals, in line with the 2010 estimate based on aerial surveys of winter flocks in the Bering Sea of 369,122 individuals, rounded here to 370,000 individuals (Larned&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). This equates to 246,081 mature individuals, rounded here to 250,000 mature individuals, as estimated by Partners in Flight (2019).",Decreasing,"This species breeds along the coasts of north-east Siberia, <strong>Russia,&#160;</strong>east from the Yana Delta to Cape Schmidt, and also along the Beaufort Sea coast of Alaska's North Slope and the&#160;Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, <strong>USA</strong>. 90% of the breeding population is thought to inhabit the Russian range with just 5% of the population residing in the northern Alaskan and Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta ranges respectively (Goldman <em>et al</em>. 2017).

These perturbations have caused an overall very rapid population reduction over the last three generations (31 years). In addition, the species has a small population and is restricted to a very small range, with breeding confined to a few locations. These factors qualify it as Endangered.   <p></p> <p></p>","<p>With its range located on the equator, the Galápagos Penguin is the most northerly breeding penguin species. Nonetheless, its distribution is highly linked to the cool and nutrient-rich oceanic waters in the western Galápagos archipelago, that allows for a high density of prey when upwelling is present (Boersma 1977, 1978; Palacios<em> et al.</em> 2006; Vargas 2006; Boersma <em>et al. </em>2013, 2015; Karnauskas<em> et al. </em>2015). It nests just above sea level and forages close to shore and at relatively shallow depths (Mills 2000; Steinfurth <em>et al.</em> 2008; Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015). Galápagos Penguins breed throughout the year, coinciding with increased upwelling (Boersma 1978; Steinfurth 2007; Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015). During chick rearing, adult birds move up to 23.5 km from the nest, concentrating foraging within 1 km of the shore (Steinfurth 2007). While breeding Galápagos Penguins show high site fidelity, non-breeding individuals (adults and juveniles) tend to migrate away from their colony (max. 64 km) (Boersma 1977; Vargas <em>et al.</em> 2006; Steinfurth 2007). After fledging, if food is available, adults continue to feed fledglings (Boersma <em>et al. </em>2017).</p><p>The ecological relationships between penguins and their prey varies depending on the frequency and strength of upwelling, making the population size unknown and extremely difficult to estimate. This is due to the highly variable strength of cool, mineral-rich upwelling water.</p><p></p>","<p>In recent decades, this species has been influenced primarily by the effects of ENSO on the availability of shoaling fish (Boersma 1978, 1998; Vargas <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2006, 2007; Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015). In 1982-83 and 1997-98, head counts declined by 77% and 65%, respectively. The annual penguin head count then increased, so the population may have been relatively stable. Then head counts further increased slightly until 2009, when the last complete count was done. Despite these increases, head counts were still 48% below the pre-El Niño head counts (Mills and Vargas 1997; Boersma 1998; Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1998; Vargas <em>et al.</em> 2007). Recovery from the 1982-1983 ENSO may have been slowed by the lower frequency of La Niña cold water events and above average surface water temperatures (Boersma 1998). Also, ENSO events may have a disproportionate impact on females, which could result in a biased sex ratio, making population recovery slower (Boersma 1998; Vargas <em>et al.</em> 2007). Climate change may lead to an increase in the frequency of ENSO events in the future (Trenberth and Hoar 1996, 1997; Houghton <em>et al.</em> 2001; Karl and Trenberth 2003), which will also reduce the species's resilience to other threats, such as disease outbreaks, oil spills and predation by introduced predators (Boersma 1998; Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2005; Steinfurth and Merlen 2005; Travis <em>et al.</em> 2006; Vargas <em>et al.</em> 2007). Locations of upwelling vary with climate variation (Karnauskas <em>et al.</em> 2016). The Galápagos cold-water pool has been intensifying and expanding northward since 1982, which may shift the mean position of the Equatorial Undercurrent and would likely impact the penguins (Karnauskas <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Local fishing boats operating in inshore waters in the western part of the archipelago are documented as incidentally drowning Galápagos Penguins due to floating nets (Cepeda and Cruz 1994). Increasing demand for bait fish could dramatically increase inshore bait fisheries, which may exacerbate these problems (Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2014). Contamination from oil spills poses another severe potential threat. <br/><br/>Non-native predators like rats, cats, and dogs remain problems on many islands. Predation by one individual feral cat (<em>Felis catus</em>) at one of the species's breeding sites resulted in adult mortality of 49% (Steinfurth 2007). Feral cats are also vectors of parasites, such as <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, which has recently been found in Galápagos Penguins with still unknown consequences (Deem <em>et al.</em> 2010; Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015). Mosquitoes (<em>Culex quinquefasciatus</em>) arrived in the Galápagos islands in the 1980s as a result of human actions (Whiteman <em>et al.</em> 2005). Since they are vectors for avian malaria and West Nile Virus, and penguins in the genus <em>Spheniscus</em> are highly susceptible to these diseases, these insects represent a potential new threat for the Galápagos Penguin (Travis <em>et al.</em> 2006). The <em>Plasmodium </em>blood parasite has been found in Galápagos Penguins (Levin <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2013). Many of the above threats are potentially exacerbated by an ever-expanding human population and an increase in tourists visiting the islands.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>Although the population is small, the exact size is unknown: it could have been as low as 700 individuals in 1983 or as high as 10,000 in 1971. The population in 2009 was likely between 1,800 and 4,700 individuals (Boersma <em>et al. </em>2013, 2015). The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in 1971-1972, 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 reduced the number of penguins to half of the number seen in the early 1970s (Boersma 1977; Mills and Vargas 1997; Boersma 1998; Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1998; Vargas <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2006, 2007; Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015). A head count of 1,009 Galápagos Penguins in 2007 was half the number counted in 1970 (2,020) and 1971 (2,099) (Boersma <em>et al. </em>2013, 2015).</p><p></p> <p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Spheniscus mendiculus</em> is endemic to the Galápagos archipelago, <strong>Ecuador.</strong> It is the most northerly species of penguin, breeding on Isabela, Fernandina, Floreana and Santiago islands, and several offshore islets. Approximately 95% of the Galápagos Penguin population is found on Isabela and Fernandina islands in the western part of Galápagos (Vargas <em>et al.</em> 2007; Boersma <em>et al. </em>2013, 2015). Isabela is home to the majority of Galápagos Penguins, but there are severe problems with introduced species, including rats and cats. The main breeding range stretches along the coast of the two westernmost islands, encompassing approximately 400 km of coastline, where 96% of all nests are found (Steinfurth 2007). During the breeding season, penguins forage close to the shore and nest sites, while there is evidence that non-breeding adults move further offshore and longer distances away from the colony. The marine habitat use by juvenile birds is largely unknown (Boersma 1977; Vargas <em>et al.</em> 2005; Steinfurth 2007; Steinfurth <em>et al. </em>2008).&#160;Vagrants have been recorded from Panama (Eisenmann 1956; Ridgely and Gwynne 1976).<p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway<br/></strong>The whole population of Galápagos Penguins is found within the Galápagos National Park and Galápagos Marine Reserve (GMR), which is managed by the Galápagos National Park Service (GNPS) and the authorities of the GMR. Access to breeding sites is strictly regulated, take of adults and/or eggs is prohibited and research is only possible with special permission. Introduced predators are to be controlled by the GNPS. On a few islands, introduced predators have been successfully eradicated. Research projects have been encouraged by the GNPS with the aim to protect this species by determining its marine needs and strengthening local capacity in scientific research, practical conservation, decision-making and sustainable management for this species (Vargas 2006; Steinfurth 2007). To create more high-quality breeding habitat for the penguins, artificial nests were built in 2010 and some are being used (P. D. Boersma pers. obs.). Research on the value of these constructed lava nests and marine protected areas continues. To protect penguins, the President of Ecuador in February 2016 recommended that no-take (fishing) zones are to be established within the GMR at three sites where penguins breed (Elizabeth Bay, Bartolomé and Sombrero Chino islands and Caleta Iguana). iGalápagos.org engages people in taking pictures of penguins to determine when and where penguins are molting and breeding, in order to gain more information on the breeding cycle and to raise awareness for the precarious population status. The Galápagos Conservancy, together with the National Park, has developed an educational program for children in the islands.</p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong></strong><strong><br/></strong>An urgent need remains for long-term monitoring of the population, improvements in fisheries management and increased protection levels within the Galápagos Marine Reserve in areas where penguins breed. Monitoring and minimizing penguin mortality from alien species at breeding sites is needed. Carry out monitoring of breeding sites and counting of individuals twice a year. Develop robust tools to determine population trends, recruitment, health and molting success. Assess feeding success of multi-species feeding assemblages and their importance for each species. Providing constructed nests in predator-free areas and monitoring reproductive success, or building artificial islands for breeding would likely help the population. Recommendations for conservation measures are detailed in Boersma <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015, 2019. Further no-takes zones urgently need to be implemented.

In Colombia <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> inhabits dry forest, humid forest and cloud forest, occupying the greatest range of forest habitats of any of the Colombian spider monkeys (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976).&#160; Defler (2004) indicated that they range as high as 2,000-2,500 m Asl in the Cordilllera Occidental. In Panama, <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> is reported between 200-1,350 m Asl in pre-montane and montane forest, but have been also reported in lowland tropical rainforest, persisting in agricultural mosaics using only living fences or gallery forest (Méndez-Carvajal 2012). <br/>The presence of <em>A. f. fusciceps </em>in a locality could be correlated with suitable habitat conditions such as continuous canopy cover and high abundance of large and tall trees (Gavilánez-Endara 2006; Estévez-Noboa 2009; Cueva and Pozo 2010; Moscoso 2010). These conditions are found mostly in mature and undisturbed forest. Nevertheless, this species has been recorded in old secondary forest, connected with continuous forest patches.&#160; Occupancy modelling of the subspecies in a lowland evergreen forests (Tesoro Escondido) suggest that with enough primary forest it may be able to persist in a mosaic habitat (Spaan 2013). Altitude could be associated with low abundance of the subspecies (Madden y Albuja 1989; Shanee 2009; Moscoso 2010), therefore well preserved lowland forest harbors the healthiest populations of <em>A. f. fusciceps. &#160;</em><br/><br/>Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend much time in the canopy and also use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understory. In accordance with their use of the highest levels of the forest, they are highly suspensory. When travelling they spend more time hanging from branches, brachiating, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise 83% of their diet and are found mainly in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). They also eat young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage during the beginning of the dry season), young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, and honey, and very occasionally small insects such as termites and caterpillars (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988; Tirira <em>et al.</em> 2014). They play a significant role as seed dispersers. Van Roosmalen (1985; Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988) found that <em>A. paniscus</em> was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species used) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). A further 10 species were being dispersed by the monkeys carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory). In only 23 species were the seeds being ruined or eaten (seed predation). A study of diet of one individual <em>A. fusciceps fusciceps </em>living with a group of <em>Alouatta palliata </em>in a patch of forest in Ecuador (Moscoso 2010), revealed a high rate of ingestion of young leaves during the dry season (63%), followed by fruits (25% ), flowers (8%) and others (5%); while during the wet season fruits were the main item consumed (47%), followed by young leaves (42%) and others (11%).&#160; Tapia (2013) reported that the fruits of Brosimum utile are the preferred item selected by <em>A. f. fusciceps</em> in Tesoro Escondido (Esmeraldas Province), followed by the fruits of <em>Inga</em> spp. and <em>Pouroma chocoana. </em>","<p> <em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em><br/>Tirira <em>et al.</em> (2011) identified this subspecies as the most endangered primate in Ecuador and estimated a reduction of greater than 80% in population size based on habitat loss. This species has a very small distribution, is highly fragmented, and is under pressure from high rates of habitat loss due to deforestation and strong hunting pressure.<br/> <br/> <em>Ateles fusciceps rufiventris<br/></em> In Colombia all spider monkeys are considered threatened due to hunting, habitat loss and fragmentation (Defler <em>et al.</em> 2003). National Parks such as Katios and Orquideas are believed to have very few spider monkeys because of indigenous hunting pressure (N. Vargas pers. comm.; H. Rubio pers. comm.) and the population density of <em>Ateles</em> may be decreasing in Los Katios (Director del Parque Los Katios, D. Pintor pers. comm.). Widespread censuses of <em>Ateles</em> are needed, especially in national parks.<br/> <br/>In Colombia, along the Caribbean coast, it has been estimated that over 30% of habitat has been lost in the past 10 years based on calculations from satellite photos (Miller <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Ground truthing of this data found only 2.5% of viable secondary forest habitat was left in this region (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Panama, there is a lower human population and likely higher habitat availability, but more research is needed to determine population status and threats to this subspecies.</p> <p>In Panama, <em>A.f. rufiventris</em> is considered Critically Endangered due to deforestation and heavy hunting activity as indigenous people from the Embera-Wounaan ethnic group use them as a cultural protein resource. Among the environmental problems that Darien Province currently faces are high and uncontrolled deforestation. The Chucantí Nature Reserve is one of the few areas in the Darien Province that are now protected by the land owner (Méndez-Carvajal, 2012).&#160;</p>","<em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em> is rare and difficult to see (Madden and Albuja 1989). Recent population density estimates in Ecuador within the buffer areas of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the Awa Ethnic Reserve report are 0.2–8.5 individuals/km² (Gavilánez-Endara 2006, Baird 2007, Cueva 2008, Estévez-Noboa 2009, Moscoso 2010). The size of the subgroups varies from 1-10 individuals (Gavilánez-Endara 2006, Cueva 2008, Estévez-Noboa 2009, Moscoso 2010). No subpopulation larger than 50 individuals has been found. Further population decline in the future is probable due to deforestation, fragmentation and hunting pressure. Nevertheless, some localities, such as Playa de Oro (in Esmeraldas Province), where conditions have improved (e.g. hunting has stopped), populations of this subspecies are recovering (Moscoso 2010). There is possibly one main area that is harbouring the greatest subpopulations of <em>A. f. fusciceps</em> in Ecuador: the buffer area of the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve, especially the unprotected Canandé basin (Moscoso 2010, Peck <em>et al.</em> 2011). Other important subpopulations in the north of Ecuador are the Awa Ethnic and Forest Reserve and the Awacachi Ecological Corridor (which connects both reserves). It is inferred from past records and recent reports of one individual (Tirira 2008, Moscoso 2010, S. Shanee (unpublished data)), that a subpopulation exists within the northwest of Pichincha Province, but this subpopulation is almost isolated from the others. There is one recent record suggesting a possible relict population in Flavio Alfaro (Manabí Province) (Cervera and Griffith submitted).<em><br/><br/>Ateles fusciceps rufiventris</em> is distributed in a wide area of the Colombian Chocó region. However, it is extremely difficult to find in these forests, probably due to the low population densities that are a result, in part, of pervasive subsistence hunting. Some recent records include a large group observed in Montes de Maria, Bolivar, a population living in the Private Reserve Tití Cabeciblanco from Fundación Proaves, and other scant records in the Colombian Chocó. Some sporadic records have been registered in the adjacent areas near Parque Nacional Tamá, at about 1,800 m asl. The first population survey for this species in Panama was conducted by the Fundación Pro-Conservación de los Primates Panameños (FCPP), estimating about 60 individuals of <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> living in two groups with average of 20 individuals/group and 1-13 per subgroups, population density of 9.3 ind/km² at Chucanti Nature Reserve within 3.5 km² of montane and pre-montane forest reaching 1,350 m asl (Méndez-Carvajal, 2012).<br/><br/>Global Forest Watch data for the regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Panama in  which the species currently occurs suggest that, should  forest loss continue at the same rate that it has since 2004, close to 20% of this monkey's forest habitat is  likely to be lost by the year 2063. This, combined with hunting for bushmeat  and the pet trade, to which this large-bodied primate is particularly  susceptible, is driving population declines for <em>Ateles fusciceps</em>. It is suspected that these threats will cause a population reduction of at least 50% over three generations (2018-2063).",Decreasing,"<p> There are two recognized subspecies:<br/><br/><em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em> is endemic to northwestern Ecuador from Esmeraldas Province (west of the Andes Mountain Range) to the northwest of Pichincha and Santo Domingo Provinces, extending to the western borders of Imbabura and Carchi Provinces.  There are past reports of this species in the south, within the Colon Colonche Mountain Range (within Manabí, Guayas and Santa Elena Provinces), and westward on Chimborazo Province. A recent report of this subspecies has been made in the northwest of Manabí Province (Flavio Alfaro). Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) suggested that <em>A. f. fusciceps</em> might occur in southern Colombia, south of the Río Mira, continuous with the populations in Ecuador, but no evidence has been forthcoming regarding this.</p> <p> <em>Ateles fusciceps rufiventris </em>does not occur in Ecuador and is discontinuous with <em>A. f. fusciceps</em>. <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> ranges from the western cordillera of the Andes from south-western Colombia, northward on west side of the Río Cauca to eastern Panama (Cerro Pirre and the basin of the Río Bayano of the Pacific coast) (Rylands <em>et al.</em> 2006). The Cerro Pirre or the Río Tucutí mark the border with <em>A. geoffroyi grisescens</em>. In Colombia, <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> occurs throughout the Pacific lowlands except for Juradó in the north-western part of the Department of Chocó, supposedly the domain of A. g. grisescens (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler, 2003, 2004). It occurs in the Urabá region in north-western Antioquia, Córdoba, Sucre, and northern Bolívar east to the lower Río Cauca along the western bank to south-central Antioquia. The most southerly record in Colombia is Barabacoas, Department of Nariño, and the most northerly is the southern bank of the Canal del Dique, Cartagena. Hernández-Camacho and Cooper (1976) believed that it formerly occurred as far north as Pendales.  Although the historical distribution of <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> comprises large areas in the Colombian Chocó, many of these areas have been largely defaunated and only a few recent records of the species have been registered in the last decade, specifically in Montes de Maria, Bolivar, at Mutatá, Chonó and near Guapi. <br/><br/>In Panama, <em>A. f. rufiventris</em> occurs in Maje Mountain Chain, Darien National Park (Pirre, Boca de Cupe), Chucanti Nature Reserve, only for Darien and Panama provinces (Méndez-Carvajal, 2012; 2014).</p>",It is used as food by humans.,Terrestrial,"<p>This species is included in CITES Appendix II.<br/><br/>In Ecuador, <em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em> has been considered Critically Endangered in the Red Book of Mammals of Ecuador since 2001 (Tirira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011) and included in the List of the World’s 25 Most Threatened Primate Species (2012-2014) (Tirira <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It is protected in accordance with Resolution No. 143 of the Ministry of the Environment (<em>Registro Oficial</em> No. 6 of 23 January 2003) (Tirira <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), prohibiting hunting and commercialization throughout Ecuador for an indefinite period.<br/><br/>All studies conducted up to now on <em>A.f. fusciceps</em> recommend conservation actions focusing on unprotected lowland forest to the south and west of the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, where population densities are greatest, the habitat conditions are good and hunting pressure is low (Moscoso 2010; Peck <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011; Tirira, <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). If this area is protected, it could become a core area of healthy groups of the subspecies, capable of sustaining itself and become a source of genetic flow with individuals of other subpopulations in the north and south of the country. Some initiatives focused on research and conservation of the subspecies have been developed in Ecuador since 2005, firstly through PRIMENET (sustainable&#160;network&#160;for conservation of primates and habitat in NW Ecuador), and through ongoing projects of Proyecto Washu and the University of Sussex (since 2012). Proyecto Washu has started (2014) to conduct a reintroduction project in a locality where the species has become almost extinct (Mashpi Reserve, Pichincha Province).

Iverson (2008) suggested that clutch sizes might range from one to five eggs, and that the clutch sizes reported by Alvarez del Toro (1982) may be exaggerated. Sexual maturity in females is attained at approximately 8–10 years, when both sexes have reached 120 mm carapace length (Iverson 2008). Longevity and home range are unknown.&#160;Suitable habitat for this species is in decline with widespread water shortages requiring individuals to migrate to nearby bodies of water with increased competition for resources.","Most species of the genus <em>Kinosternon</em> have been consumed locally in southeastern Mexico for subsistence (Legler and Vogt 2013). They are one of the most popular animals for local people to keep as pets (C. Guichard-Romero pers. obs. 2020). In addition, <em>K. abaxillare</em> is likely to be highly affected by the degradation of ecosystems for conversion sites for agriculture, contamination of waters with pesticides, and the effect of annual fires to clean up crop sites (as with other species of kinosternids; Acuña 1990). The three modifications that put <em>K. abaxillare</em> populations at risk are:<br/>1) reduction or desiccation of bodies of water (streams, rivers, lakes),<br/>2) contamination (mainly with pesticides), and<br/>3) modification of soil and vegetation (burning, soil compaction by cows, modification of the vegetation for the cultivation of corn).<br/><br/>Very few localities within the range of&#160;<em>K. abaxillare</em>&#160;that are pristine.&#160;Water bodies in the Fraylesca region have been greatly diminished or completely dry forcing individuals to migrate to nearby bodies of water, with increased competition for resource. Individual remains have been found on the roads and near the crops where they may have tried to cross (E. Reyes-Grajales pers. obs. 2020). Although no published data is available, high incidence of turtles with shell deformations have been observed in lagoons where irrigation bags are washed.&#160;Reduction in availability and quality of nesting habitat, as well as absence of appropriate vegetation for foraging and aestivation, modify annual activity cycles and may lead to reductions in future populations.&#160;Annual burning has an impact on the acidification of the soil, the reduction of vegetation and, of course, the death of turtles of all ages and sexes.<br/><br/>This species is not listed for protection in any national or international law (C.

Although there is no published data, many of the native populations near Tuxtla Gutierrez&#160; have been negatively affected by intensive agriculture, where annual crop fires, water shortages, contamination and modification of soil and vegetation greatly reduce suitable habitat (C.

It occurs near the surface in temperate waters and deeper, below the thermocline, in tropical waters. The species has low biological productivity with limited fecundity and late age-at-maturity. Although no longer targeted, it is still caught as bycatch in trawl, trammel nets, and set-net fisheries, and becomes entangled in pot lines. The large fins are extremely valuable in the fin trade. Across regions, there have been some severe  historic decline, however there are indications of some stability  and possible slow recovery since cessation of target fishing and high levels of protection.  The global population may now be beginning  to stabilize, with signs of that from the Northeast Atlantic, although elsewhere there is little information upon which is assess stability.<strong> </strong>However, abundances  are still estimated to be well below historic levels  and there is  ongoing demand for the high-value fins, and a global population reduction of 50–79% is suspected over the past three generations (102 years). Therefore, the Basking Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","<p>The Basking Shark is a planktivorous coastal-pelagic species named for its habit of swimming slowly at the surface but it also vertical migrates to depths of 1,264 m (Gore <em>et al. </em>2008). It occurs in temperate and tropical waters, but in temperate waters it is present near the surface and in tropical and equatorial waters, it occurs deeper, below the thermocline (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Dewar <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is the second largest shark after the Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>)  and reaches a maximum estimated size of 1,276–1,973 cm total length  (TL) (Parker and Stott 1965, Holden 1974, Weigmann 2016). The species  aggregates in coastal waters, with aggregations of up to 1,398  individuals observed in the northeast United States, and it also undertakes large-scale  migrations (Gore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Skomal <em>et al. </em>2009, Witt <em>et al. </em>2014, Doherty <em>et al.</em> 2017, Crowe <em>et al. </em>2018, Dewar<em> et al.</em>  2018). Males mature at 400–750 cm TL, females mature at 690–980 cm  TL, and size at birth is estimated at 150–200 cm TL (Matthews and Parker  1950, Parker and  Stott 1965, Pauly  1978, Compagno 1984, Sims&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Fowler 2005, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013,  Francis 2017).

Only one litter of 6 near-term pups has been reported  (Sund 1943). Female age-at-maturity is estimated at 16–20 years (18  years average) and maximum age is estimated at 50 years; generation  length is therefore 34 years (Compagno 1984, Pauly 2002, Fowler 2005).  Annual rate of population increase is estimated at 0.013–0.023 and  natural mortality is low at M = ~0.07 per year (Pauly 2002,  Fowler 2005).</p>","<p>  </p><p>Currently there are no target fisheries for the Basking Shark, however it was targeted for several centuries by harpoon and net fisheries for meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and liver oil (Rose 1996, Dewar <em>et al. </em>2018, SARA 2019). Surface fisheries have primarily caught large, recently-mated females (CITES 2002). The large fins are extremely valuable in the fin trade being worth up to US$57,000 for a single, large fin (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2004, Magnussen <em>et al. </em>2007). Targeted fisheries were banned in many countries during the 2000s (ICES 2016, Dewar <em>et al. </em>2018).  The species is still taken as bycatch by trawl, trammel nets, and  set-net fisheries, and becomes entangled in pot lines (Fowler 2005,  Mancusi <em>et al</em>. 2005, COSEWIC 2009, Francis and Smith 2010, Francis and Sutton 2012, Francis and Lyon 2012, Murua <em>et al</em>.  2013, ICES 2018). Many range states across its distribution now have  regulations that require release of live individuals (see Conservation section).  Strikes from recreational and commercial shipping are a threat due to  the species' habit of spending time at the surface (Pirotta <em>et al. </em>2019). Collisions from recreational boats are relatively frequent in United Kingdom waters (OSPAR 2009).&#160;</p>","<p>There are no data on the absolute global population size, although it is likely to be greater than 20,000 individuals (and thus not approaching the thresholds for criterion C: small population size and decline). Genetic results indicate one global population&#160;(Noble <em>et al.</em> 2006, Francis 2017). Basking Shark total abundances have been estimated for a number of regions: 4,200 and 632 (CI: 377–1,058) in the Bay of Fundy, Canada in 2007 and  2011, respectively (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008, Westgate <em>et al. </em>2014); 10,125  in Canadian Northwest Atlantic waters in 2007 (highly uncertain estimate) (Campana  <em>et al.</em> 2008); 6,671–14,925 in New England shelf waters, United States in 1982 (Kenney <em>et al.</em> 1985); 985 on the west coast of Scotland in 2010 (95% CI: 495–1,683) (Gore <em>et al. </em>2016); and, possibly 19,151 (+/-10,629) for Scotland and Ireland combined (Gore <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Landings and sightings data are available from the Northeast Atlantic (e.g.&#160;CITES 2002, Southall&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Speedie<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2009, Witt<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012, ICES 2018); landings data are available from Japanese waters (Yokawa 2017); and, sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) are available from New Zealand (Francis 2017, M. Francis unpubl. data).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, the landings of Basking Sharks declined  dramatically during the period 1946–2017 (CITES 2002, ICES 2018). Landings within  ICES Subareas 1–14 peaked in the mid-1960s and mid-1970s at around 5,000  tonne (t), declined rapidly during the 1980s to less than 1,000 t  annually, after which there was a peak in 1992 of 1,697 t, followed by a rapid decline. There is evidence of serial exploitation and depletion patterns in different ICES Subareas during this fishery. For example,  the artisanal Achill Island fishery, which targeted Basking Sharks in a  single bay with rowing boats, nets, and hand harpoons, declined rapidly after a  decade of high catches during the 1950s and 1960s, and Basking Sharks did not return to this location (CITES 2002). Following the ban on target Basking Shark  fisheries in 2006–2007, landings  declined to &lt;30 t annually and have  been &lt;0.1 t since 2013  (ICES 2018). There are no effort data or catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data available for recent  years (ICES 2018) which means caution  is required in the interpretation of these data for population abundance  trends.<strong>&#160;</strong>However, the large catch declines during the  1960s to 1980s are believed to reflect unsustainable fishing levels and a  decline in population abundance (CITES 2002, Sims <em>et al.</em> 2015). Since then, public record sightings and boat  surveys in  the U.K. for 1988–2008 suggest population recovery following  cessation  of targeting in the mid-2000s, based on decreased sightings of  small  Basking Sharks and increased sightings of medium-sized and large  sharks  (Witt <em>et al. </em>2012). However, when current research  survey  encounter rates are compared with historical target fishery catch   rates, the population is estimated to be well below 30% of historical   abundance, although it is suspected to be stable and possibly increasing in   European waters (Sims <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the Japanese target Basking Shark fishery of the 1960s and 1970s,  estimates of catches (in numbers) severely declined during the mid-1970s from a high of about 100 individuals per year until the  fishery closed in the early 1980s, with catches since then at, or near, zero (Uchida 1995, Yokawa 2017). These data are unusual, having records of the same catch (100 sharks) annually from 1967 to 1974 followed by a 50% increase in 1975 and an 87% decrease in 1976, with no information on effort; hence they must be interpreted with caution. In New Zealand, the SPUE over the period 1985–2015 peaked in 1988–1991, which may  have been due to Japanese trawl vessels targeting sharks during that time, but since the mid-2000s catches have been at, or near, zero. The reason for this decline cannot be definitively determined as it may be indicative of changed fishing practices,  regional shifts in availability of Basking Sharks, or a real abundance  decline (Francis and Sutton 2012, Francis 2017). The Japanese and New Zealand data may not be reliable indices of abundance.</p><p>Further to the landings and SPUE data above, there are estimates of population  changes from five regions: Northwest Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Southwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, and Southwest  Pacific. In the Canadian Northwest Atlantic, declines were estimated in  the Bay of Fundy between 2008 and 2011 based on aerial and boat surveys  from different studies, although direct comparison between the two  abundance estimates is constrained by different estimation methods  (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008, Westgate <em>et al.</em> 2014). Furthermore,  population models in 2008 suggested a 23% probability that the abundance  was decreasing, although there was high uncertainty in the model data  (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008). In United States Atlantic waters, there has been no evidence of decline since 1979 (Campana <em>et al</em>.  2008). Population trends in the  Mediterranean Sea are unknown, but it is suspected that the Basking Shark  has declined by at least 50% over three generations (Sims <em>et al. </em>2016).  In temperate waters of the Southwest Atlantic, Basking Shark were  historically common and are now rare (Soto 2000, Lucifora <em>et al. </em>2015).  In the Northeast Pacific, the Basking Shark was persecuted as a  destructive 'pest' and although targeted fisheries ceased in the  1970s,  the abundance is considered to still be at a historic low with fewer  than 6 sightings per year off the coast of British Colombia (Wallace and Gisborne 2006, McFarlane&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Dewar <em>et al.</em>  2018). In the Southwest Pacific, the New Zealand Threat Classification  System found that the Basking Shark was Vulnerable based on the criteria that the population size within New Zealand is likely to be &lt;5,000 mature individuals, with a predicted decline over three generations of 10–50% (Duffy <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p><strong></strong></p><strong></strong>Across  these regions, there have been some severe historic declines, however, the global population may now be beginning to stabilize, following cessation of target fishing, high levels of protection, and indications of recovery (particularly in the Northeast Atlantic, although elsewhere we have little information upon which is assess stability). Recovery is expected to take  hundreds of years due to the low biological productivity of Basking  Shark, exacerbated by the removal of adult females by target fisheries (CITES 2002). Abundances are still estimated to be well below historic levels  and there is ongoing demand for the high-value fins, and a 50–79% global  population reduction is suspected over the past three generations (102 years).  Therefore, the Basking Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Basking Shark occurs mainly in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; in the Indian Ocean, it is reported only from southern Australia, Indonesia, and South Africa (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Fahmi and White 2015).</p>","<p>No utilization or commercial trade of this species is currently known to exist, although prior to 2012, meat and fins were exported from Norway and fins from New Zealand.  No  commercial trade records have been noted in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) trade database  since 2012, although not all trade records may be reported to CITES.  However, it is likely that if caught, the meat would still be used fresh for  either local consumption or exported internationally along with the  fins.</p><p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. The Basking Shark was among the first shark species listed under several wildlife treaties. Many fishing nations worldwide and the European Union protect Basking Sharks through wildlife conservation legislation or apply zero quotas under fisheries management regulations.<br/><br/>In 2002, the Basking Shark was added to Appendix II of CITES, which requires Parties to ensure that exports be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. In 2005, the Basking Shark was listed on Appendix I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which respectively, obligates Parties to strictly protect the species and to work regionally toward conservation, specifically through the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks.<br/><br/>In 2005, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted its first ban on directed Basking Shark fisheries in the Convention Area. This measure has since been regularly renewed; the current ban, adopted in 2015, expires at the end of 2019 and will be reconsidered based on scientific advice (ICES 2016). There are a range of conservation measures in the UK, along with a recommended Basking Shark code of conduct (OSPAR 2009). The Basking Shark is listed on Appendix II of the Bern  Convention for the Conservation of European Wildlife and Habitats. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Basking Shark and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow.<br/><br/>To allow recovery, it is recommended that all Basking Shark retention and landings be prohibited, at least as long as the global population is classified as Endangered. Initiatives to avoid contact, prevent capture, promote safe release, and improve catch (including discard) reporting are also urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties (MarLIN 2018).<br/><br/>Basking Shark tourism is managed in some locations but if sustainable tourism industries are indeed to be developed around encounters with these sharks, they should be legislated, continuously monitored, and enforced with permitting systems to make sure operators and tourists are adhering to best practice protocols and codes of conduct.</p>    <p></p>","",,false,false,Global
