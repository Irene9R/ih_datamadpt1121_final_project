Townsend and L. Herrera pers. comm. March 2019). Additional major threats include deforestation as a result of agricultural and large-scale livestock encroachment, human settlements, selective logging of hardwoods, and human-induced fires (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). There is a proposal to shift the core part of Parque Nacional Pico Bonito, which may create a much larger buffer zone where habitat conversion can progress unabated (C. Antúnez, J. Ramos Galdámez and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).&#160;The reform to the Ley de Protection de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Articulos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is also increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).<strong><br/></strong><br/>Climate change is also considered to be an ongoing threat. An increase in high rainfall events are being observed in parts of its range, as well as, an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events and longer dry seasons in other parts of its range (Honduras and Guatemala Red List Assessment Workshops 2019).<br/><br/>Chytridiomycosis may be a threat to the species, as chytrid infection was found to be present in other species of this genus in Honduras (J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019).&#160;The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Mesoamerica (Honduras and Guatemala Red List Assessment Workshops 2019).</span></span></span>","<p>It can be locally abundant within its fragmented habitat, and surveys are recording them regularly (J.

Ten individuals, including one dead adult, were found along the other two transects (&#160;Río&#160;Los Zarzos and&#160;Rincón de Quilmes)&#160;at the edge of its original distribution area,&#160;over two survey sessions in May and July 2005 (Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008).&#160;No frogs were found in subsequent surveys in the same areas; during 2008 and 2017, however this species was recently found along the Amaicha river (S.

In the completely snowed in valleys of the Himalaya, however, ibex remain in high elevations during winter to feed on emergent vegetation in the avalanche chutes and windblown crests, and also digging through softer snow of the higher elevations. They descend to the lower valley bottoms to take advantage of the spring thaw, but ascend to the highest ridgelines during the peak of summer (Schaller 1977, Bhatnagar 1997). Ibex occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. Siberian Ibex&#160;can also be found in areas with canyons, rocky outcrops, and steep ‘escape’ terrain far from high mountains (Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007, Peterson 2016, Bragin <em>et al.</em> 2017). The species rarely enters forest zones, but on a hot day does prefer shaded areas, or even small pockets of pastures near glaciers. Ibex tend to remain near steep, escape terrain (Bhatnagar 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Pin Valley National Park in India, over 90% of the over 800 ibex sightings were within 100 m from ‘escape terrain’ (Bhatnagar 1997). Females tend to retreat into the security of cliffs for parturition in May-June (Schaller 1977). </p>  <p>Ibex live in small groups that vary considerably in size, sometimes forming herds of over 100 animals, but more typically averaging 6-30 animals, depending on the region (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1997, 1999b; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Singh <em>et al. </em>2010). They spend the day in alternating periods of activity and rest, having a bimodal pattern through much of the year. In winter, ibex in the Himalaya tend to have a distinct unimodal activity peak towards noon, while resting on or near cliffs from evening until the next morning (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1992, Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). </p>  <p>Ibex shows little sexual segregation throughout the year, except the period between parturition (around June) and autumn (November) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex in an area of rocky outcrops in the Mongolian Gobi Desert displayed no segregation between sexes and similar sized mean annual home ranges using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) of 42 km<sup>2</sup> for females (n = 5) and 39 km<sup>2</sup> for males (n = 4) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). A study on ranging patterns of ibex in the Indian Himalaya (2 adult males and 3 females) shows that the mean annual home range (MCPs) of males (44 km<sup>2</sup>) was almost double that of females (20 km<sup>2</sup>) (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex used extremely small ranges on lower, south facing slopes with early sprout during the spring (&lt;3 km<sup>2</sup>), expanding to larger ranges in summer and autumn, but again confining to small ranges during winter (5-10 km<sup>2</sup>). Daily movements of ibex were highest during the summer flush when they traversed over a km during a day to take advantage of forage quality, but were confined to barely a 300-400 meters during winter and spring due to limited usable patches (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015).</p>  <p>Ibex are primarily grazers with herbs as well as subshrubs and shrubs such as <em>Eurotia sp</em>., <em>Rosa</em> sp. and <em>Ephedra sp.</em> contributing significantly to their diet (Manjrekar 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Bagchi <em>et al. </em>2004, Tumursukh 2015). </p>  <p>Females gestate for 170-180 days (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961) and usually give birth to one, sometimes two, kids in the spring. The animals reach sexual maturity at 18 months for females and 30 months for males, although usually only older males mate (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Siberian Ibex&#160;can live up to 16-17 years (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961, Fedosenko and Blank 2001).<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>Throughout its range, local people hunt ibex for subsistence use because they traditionally provide an important supplementary food for local people. Poaching also occurs in some areas by military personnel, road maintenance workers, and others, especially in areas accessible by vehicle (Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987). Additional threats to ibex include competition with livestock for food and habitat, and in some areas by predators. As a result of these threats, some populations have declined significantly, especially in regions with dense human populations.<br/> <br/> In 2007, producers of wool products in Nepal began marketing a product they termed “yangir”, which they claimed originated from wild, hunted <em>Capra sibirica</em>. (Some hair fibers from <em>C. sibirica</em> are quite fine, and potentially may be used for high-quality wool). At least one importer based in Germany was marketing these products as high-end, specialty scarves. As of this writing (early 2020), the origin of these products (and whether they indeed came from <em>C. sibirica</em>) had not yet been determined, but were still being advertised on the internet as coming from ibex, stating that annually 1500 kg of the wool are produced world-wide (www.acitac.com/materialien/faserkunde/yangir.html). This would require the harvest of a considerable number of animals. Domestic hunting might provide the raw material. Trophy hunting programs harvest only a few animals/year and are unlikely to be the source of a commercially marketed wool product. However, so far interest in ibex wool at local level is unknown and it seems Central Asia is not (yet) a supplier (Michel unpubl. data). If <em>Capra sibirica</em> were being poached specifically to feed this market, formerly stable populations could quickly become threatened.<br/> <br/> In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Siberian Ibex&#160;are harvested in trophy hunting programs. Trophy hunting targets only males above a certain age, and so direct impacts on targeted population size likely remain negligible, but poorly regulated trophy hunting can have many negative consequences (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), including an effect on the sex and age composition of populations as reported from Kyrgyzstan (Michel and Rosen 2016). The potential of causing evolutionary effects is low as long as hunter harvest only a minor portion of the males. Bans on trophy hunting and importation of hunting trophies risk removing incentives to prevent poaching and might increase human-caused mortality of ibex.<br/> <br/> Climate change likely poses new threats by altering habitat quality, in particular affecting water availability, vegetation composition and phenology as well as causing changes in land-use. <br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, it seems that prior to the Soviet invasion, Siberian Ibex&#160;was abundant and hunted throughout its range by local tribesmen. The impact of hunting was believed to be limited, in some areas due to customary regulations (Michel unpubl. data, based information from traditional hunters 2009). Currently hunting is formally banned, but poaching is still a major threat to the species, especially where new roads increase accessibility and modern weapons improve efficiency, in particular where military personnel and other armed forces are involved. Poaching became of greater concern in Wakhan National Park (i.e. the district of Wakhan), where border guards and police presence has increased (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2019). <br/> <br/> In China, the species is classified as a Category I Protected Wild Animal Species under the Wild Animal Protection Law (Wang 1998). Poaching might now pose a minor threat, as the government has confiscated most guns from pastoralists living near ibex habitat, although some poaching by police and/or military no doubt continues. Competition with livestock may occur.<br/> <br/> In India, region-wide threat assessments are scarce. Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2015) report illegal hunting by migratory laborers and migratory herders as one of the most important threats across the state of Himachal Pradesh, followed by subsistence hunting by local people and competition with migratory livestock for fodder. Increased grazing and disturbance from livestock are apparent in some areas (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1986, 1994; Pandey, 1993). Livestock grazing may not necessarily indicate competition, as was evident from summer grazing by local herders in Pin Valley; however, large herds of migratory herders were certainly a threat (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2000, Bagchi <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004). The fact that ibex can utilize rugged habitats have probably allowed them to linger precariously in parts of Himachal Pradesh with heavy grazing by migratory herds of livestock (Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>2015). The level of poaching is extremely low in the Buddhist dominated areas of India (Spiti and Ladakh). Heavy military presence along the disputed border between India and Pakistan can cause considerable disturbance to the species on both sides of the border, including the presence of border fencing. In fact, the ‘highest battlefield in the world’ around the Siachen glacier, contested between India and Pakistan, is surrounded by prime ibex habitat of the Karakorum, but is subjected to considerable military activity.</p>  <p>In Pakistan, poaching for food, heavy military presence on the Indian and Afghanistan borders, and competition for food with livestock are threats to Siberian Ibex. <br/> <br/> In Mongolia, transformation of ibex habitat for mining might be one of the most important emerging threats to the conservation of this species (see Tumursukh <em>et al.</em> 2015). The impact of trophy hunting on ibex populations remains uncertain (Lkhagvasuren <em>et al.</em> 2016). Other important threats to the species include grazing competition and disturbance from livestock, and poaching (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ibex is probably less affected than argali (<em>Ovis ammon</em>) by poaching and competition with livestock, because of the more precipitous and hence less accessible terrain it occupies, yet both probably negatively affect the species (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). A recent study by Odonjavkhlan (2018) did not find evidence for an impact of livestock grazing on habitat use by ibex in Tost Tosunbumba Nature Reserve. Tumursukh (2013) found evidence for competition between ibex and goats/sheep for forage; however, he did not find any evidence for demographic impacts from this competition. Illegal and unsustainable hunting for meat, trophies and skins remains a threat (Wingard and Zahler 2006), although habitat degradation through grazing by increasing livestock numbers and competition for pasture and water may constitute threats in some areas (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2006b) and increasing resource extraction and mining activities may also result in habitat loss and degradation. Harsh winter weather conditions can also severely affect population sizes locally (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  <p>In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the species is hunted by local people based on permit systems, but with a large unreported and illegal take. Informal hunting still seems to exceed official quotas in these countries, although the quotas for domestic hunters have not always appeared sustainable. Kyrgyzstan since 2017 has applied temporary hunting moratoria in several provinces, the effect of which is not yet evident.<br/> <br/> In Russia, although hunted legally under license, many are shot illegally and in large numbers.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>No rigorously derived population estimates exist for Siberian Ibex&#160;in any range state, although Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) and Lkhagvasuren <em>et al. </em>(2016) provide population estimates for most of Mongolia in 2009. Thus, the total population number provided here is a rough guess. Summarizing all available guestimates for the range states the total population size likely would be in the range of 170,000 to 250,000 animals (102,000 to 150,000 mature individuals).<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, the Siberian Ibex&#160;was considered abundant throughout its range prior to the late 1970s and a series of wars. Shank <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1977) estimated that around 5,000 animals used the Ajar Valley Reserve seasonally during the 1970s; this population is likely much smaller now (C. Shank pers. comm. 2007). More than 4,000 were believed to inhabit the Pamir alone. Their present status in the Pamir is unknown, but they are known to persist in reasonably large numbers throughout the ranges of the Wakhan Corridor. There in 2011 WCS recorded 2,069 animals in a direct count (1.6 per km²); in 2015, the double observer method yielded an estimate of 740 ±226 (2.2 per km²) (Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017)<span lang=""EN-US""> and 753 ±267 (2.2 per km²) in 2018 (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2020). The Siberian Ibex&#160;occurs along the Panj River across most of Badakhshan Province, but in some districts is exposed to illegal overhunting and population numbers are unknown (Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> There is no overall population estimate in China. The population in the Tian Shan had been guessed at 40,000-50,000 individuals (Wang 1998). Wu <em>et al. </em>(2015) estimate a density of 1.54 (± 0.23) per km² in the Tien Shan mountains south of Urumqi. Densities in other areas are relatively low. Rough guesses of ibex numbers in the Bei Mountains (northern Gansu) are between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals. The species has almost disappeared in the Daqin Mountains (Gao <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is listed as “Endangered” in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals (Wang 1998).<br/> <br/> In India, earlier population estimates include a minimum of 6,000 in Ladakh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1991a) and perhaps another 4,000 on the south side of the main Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, and in the Pir Panjal range of Himachal Pradesh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1992). A total of up to 15,000 ibex was estimated by Johnsingh, Mishra and Bhatnagar (1997) in <em>ca</em> 40,000 km² of potential habitat based on rough extrapolations. Counts of ibex in protected areas include 330 in the Kanji-Boodkharbu, 225 in Lungnag, 250 in Rangdum, and 174 in Rizong Wildlife Sanctuaries (Jammu and Kashmir) (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a), and 174 in the Pin Valley National Park (Himachal Pradesh) where Pandey (1993) estimated a density of 2.3 ibex/km² in 1989 and Johnsingh <em>et al.</em> (1997) at a lower value of 1.2 ibex/km². More recently Suryawanshi <em>et al.</em> (2012) estimate a density of 0.37 ibex/km² or 184 (± 40) ibex in 497 km² in Pin Valley National Park; a density of 0.11 ibex/km or 45 (±13) in 411 km² of Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary and a density of 0.14 ibex/km² or 30 (±14) in 219 km² of Lossar area of Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Over the past 10 years, these populations have been monitored using similar protocol and the population trends are stable (Suryawanshi, unpublished data). A recent occupancy survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2017) across the state of Himachal Pradesh found that ibex occupy an estimated 8,915 km². They found no evidence of range expansion or contraction in the Himachal Pradesh region between 1992 and 2015. Given these figures, we suspect that total population might not be more than 15,000.<br/> <br/> As reported by Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997), the total number of ibex in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia (as well as in adjacent Russia) was estimated at between 100,000 to 110,000 animals. Most of these occurred in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (<em>ca</em> 70,000) and Kazakhstan (ca. 17,000) with far fewer (8,000 to 9,000) in southern Siberia (3,000 to 3,500 in the Altai, 2,500 in Tannu Ola mountains of Tuva, 1,500 in Western Sayan and 2,000 to 2,500 in Eastern Sayan) and Uzbekistan (2,400). In Kazakhstan, the official numbers reported by the Provincial Territorial Inspection Services for Forestry and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture (A. Muzbay pers. comm. 2019) during the period 2014-2018 varied between 16,582 and 22,700 (average 20,500). These variations may reflect differences in reporting or methods rather than actual fluctuations of the population size. In Kyrgyzstan, officially reported numbers for the years 2000 – 2013 vary between 34,000 in 2009 and 73,000 in 2000, and are not always fully consistent (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019); the most recent official figure was 41,463 in 2018 (Press Service of the State Agency on Forestry and Environmental Protection, 2019 quoted at https://eco.akipress.org/news:1562027). The abundance varies. There are hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Ala-Arch National Park and Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) with high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low. The population size in the Pamirs and Pamiro-Alay in Tajikistan are unknown, but the species was considered common, especially in the western part of the Pamirs (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers had declined during and after the civil war in Tajikistan in the 1990s and recovered only locally. The total potentially suitable area in Tajikistan is approx. 70,000 km²; if applying the lower density margin (0.2/km²) from the site estimates below the total ibex population size might be 14,000 animals (own guess Michel, 2019). Considering that large areas are intensively used for grazing and poaching impact has reduced population sizes, this figure might be more realistic than higher estimates of up to 25,000 (Kh. Karimov pers. comm. 2019). In Uzbekistan, the population might still be in the range of 2,000-2,500 animals, although the southern part of the Hissar Range in Surkhandarya Province has not been surveyed for the last two decades (E. Bykova pers. comm. 2019). Thus, despite local declines the overall population size seems to be still similar as reported in Shackleton (1997) with no detectable overall trend, but possibly declines at least in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, it is not clear if this apparently stable or slightly declining population size reflects the real situation or continuity in formal reporting by state agencies and hunting organizations. The continuing prevalence of poaching across Central Asia combined with an increase in the intensity and area covered by livestock grazing in mountainous rangelands over the last two decades leads us to suspect an overall more substantial decline in population size than reflected in official numbers. This suspected decline is also supported by site-level estimates in areas with different management regimes </p>  <p>Few site level estimates exist for the Central Asia region. Jumabay-Uulu (2013) estimated a density of 0.67 ibex/km² in 1,341 km² of Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve in Kyrgyzstan. Recent surveys (2018) by Khanyari (unpublished data) using the double-observer survey method put the estimates in this area at 2.26 ibex/km². Numbers in community-based conservancies in the Bartang valley, Wakhan and Northern Alichur range of Tajikistan have been stable or increasing between 2009 and 2019 with densities varying between 0.19 and 1.42 animals per km² conservancy area and an absolute number of up to 2,300 over an area of 2,250 km² (unpublished data of ANCOT, 2019). Michel and Muratov (2010) reported direct counts of 2,476 animals in 8,174 km² surveyed area of the eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan (0.30 ibex per km² surveyed area with substantial variation between areas). Point counts in two sections of this area in 2013 yielded estimates of 0.34 animals per km² in an unmanaged area and 0.57 animals per km² in a game management area (unpublished analysis of data of ANCOT by Michel).&#160; <br/> <br/> The Mongolian Red Data Book 1987 (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987), stated that 1,000 individuals inhabited western Khövsgöl alone, and a total of 80,000 animals occurred in Mongolia in the mid-1980s (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) stated that ibex numbers declined since that peak estimate of 80,000 due to exploitation, habitat degradation and competition for resources (Schaller 1994, 1995, 1998). Lkhagvasuren et al. (2016) estimated a total of 36,018 (13,840–43,873) ibex across Mongolia. This is much lower than the 80,000 ibex estimated in mid-1980s. In the Khohk Serkh Reserve in the High Altai, the population was estimated at 1,000 in 1979 by Dzieciolowski <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1980) and at 1,200 by des Clers (1985). Tulgat and Schaller (1992) estimated 600 ibex in the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area. In 1989, in a 200 km² study area west of Tsogt in the Altai, Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1994) counted 337 ibex, and estimated there may have been a total of up to 450 animals. Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) recorded 1,218 ibex in 623 km² of Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Conservation Park (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999b). Tumursukh <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate a density of 0.75 ibex/km² or 1,051 (±196) in 1,400 km² of the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, which were later declared Tost-Tosumbumba Nature Reserve. Few other rigorously derived estimates of population numbers exist for other parts of Mongolia. <br/> <br/> Siberian Ibex&#160;is widely distributed over northern Pakistan, but is only locally abundant in the northern part of the country. Hess (1986) found the highest density in northern Pakistan to be in the area along the Barpu Glacier (Gilgit District) with 1.2 to 1.6 animals/km² (n = 194-270 animals, area surveyed = 164 km<sup>2</sup>). Wegge (1988) estimated that &gt;2,000 ibex lived in the Khunjerab NP, at a slightly lower density of <em>ca</em> 1.0 ibex/km². In many areas the species had densities of only 0.1 to 0.3/km² as in the Shinghai Valley, Gilgit District (n = 15-50 animals, area surveyed = 176 km², Hess, 1986). Within the Gilgit District, Siberian ibex was clearly rarer in the southern than in the northern part. The reasons for this may be that compared to northern areas, elevations in the south are generally lower, there are higher densities of humans using alpine pastures, and there are smaller distances between villages. The census of the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP, 1992) gives 2,545 animals for the whole province; in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a total of 375 were estimated (Qayyum, 1986, 87). Recent surveys by Khan <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a total of 899 ibex in a survey area of 1,895 km² of Khunjerab National Park. They encountered the highest densities of ibex in the Muztagh-Taxkorgan region with an estimated 1.17 ibex per km²<sub>. </sub>Din <sub>et al</sub>. (2011) counted 429 ibex in 1,022 km² of northern Chitral (Torkhow valley). Rahman and Din (2016) in Chipursan Valley (Hunza) recorded 2,085 ibex (0.26/km²). Ali <em>et al</em>. (2007) counted 122 ibex in the Neelum Valley of Azad Kashmir. During 2010-2011 in Nagar Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan Ali <em>et al</em>. (2015) counted 478 in winter and 456 in spring, leading to density estimates of 0.33 and 0.32 per km² respectively. Khan <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported 2,777 ibexes from the whole of Gilgit Baltistan, while annual surveys of ibex in central Karakoram National Park suggest numbers to be around 2,500 ibex.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species inhabits the mountain ranges, isolated mountains, and rocky outcrops of central and northeastern Afghanistan, China (northwestern tip of Gansu, western Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, possibly Tibet on its border with Xinjiang, Schaller 1998), northwestern India (Himalaya of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh), southern and eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia (Altai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, and Sayan Mountains, as well as in the southeast), northern Pakistan, Russia (southern Siberia, southern Tuva, and the Altai Mountains), Tajikistan and northeastern Uzbekistan (west Tian Shan) (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005, Harris <em>et al. </em>2009). </p>  <p>In Afghanistan, Siberian Ibex were historically found in steep habitat throughout the Afghan Hindu Kush and its outlying ranges (e.g., Spinghar, Kohe Baba, Safed Koh, Feroz Koh, Nuristan), but current distribution is not known. Its occurrence has been confirmed since 2000 in suitable habitat throughout the Afghan Pamir and along the Panj River of north-eastern Badakhshan, in particular in Wakhan, Ishkashem, Zebak, Rushan and Darvaz districts (Simms et al. 2014, Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017, Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> In China, Siberian Ibex occur primarily in the mountains surrounding Xinjiang, but also in those of extreme northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Populations are relatively widespread in western Xinjiang (Abudoukadi’er 2003) in the mountains around the Dzungarian Basin, including the mountains along the border with Kazakhstan from south of the Irtysh River, through the Kok Shaal Tau Mountains along the border with Kyrgyzstan and into the Pamir along the border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also throughout the Tian Shan ranges. Populations occur along the Sino-Mongolia border in the Baytik Mountains (Xinjiang), in the Mazongshan area of northern Gansu, and as far east as the Daqinshan of central Inner Mongolia (Wang 1998). Slightly separated from these are populations in the Altai Mountains in northern Xinjiang, along China’s borders with Mongolia, and Russia. <br/> <br/> The Siberian Ibex has a widespread distribution in northeastern and eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and southern Siberia, where it occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from hot deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. It is found throughout the ranges of the Pamiro-Alay, Pamir, Tian Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Altai, and Tuva Mountains, as well as the western and eastern Sayan (Weinberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997; Fedosenko 2001). The species occurs in mountainous areas with sufficient rugged escape terrain and suitable pockets of grazing habitat, but is missing in the wide mountain valleys and plateaus intensively used for livestock grazing.<br/> <br/> In Mongolia, Siberian Ibex are patchily distributed in rugged terrain throughout the western half of the country, and in central and south-central Mongolia to the trans-Siberian railway line (Ulaanbaatar to Sainshand) (Dulamtseren 1970, 1977; Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). More specifically, ibex inhabit the Altai, Hangai, and Gobi Altai Mountain Ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980, Mallon 1985, Schaller 1994, Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). They also occur in the Sayan Mountains near the Russian border west of Lake Hovsgol and in scattered populations in the small mountains in the Transaltai Gobi and in canyons, rocky outcrops, and other rugged terrain throughout the Gobi Desert (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1977; Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1999a, 1999b; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). A small, introduced population survives in the Bogd Uul Mountains just outside of Ulaanbaatar (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The largest number of ibex occurs in the Altai and western Hangai Mountains (Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Populations continue to become increasingly fragmented, especially in central and southeastern Mongolia (Schaller 1994, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2009). A long-term research project on ibex ecology is being conducted in northern Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in northern Dornogobi Aimag (Reading <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006b, 2007; Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Peterson 2016; Bragin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017; Otgonbayar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/> <br/> In India, the Siberian Ibex occurs in the Himalayan regions of Jammu and Kashmir, in the Karakorum, Zanskar and Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh and in the Trans Himalayan and Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh, as far east as the Sutlej river (Fox 1987; Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992; Gaston <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1981; Pandey 1993). The species occurs in the western half of Ladakh, in the Shyok Valley (Nubra region) of northern Ladakh, along the Ladakh Range, and along both sides of the main Himalayan Range eastward to Shingo La (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a, 1992; Mallon 1991; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Its occurrence is very sparse east of the Zanskar River, a tributary of the Indus. It is present along the southern side of the Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir from the Zoji La eastwards to Himachal Pradesh, where it occurs throughout much of Lahul and Spiti, in the upper Beas and Parbati catchments, and Kinnaur in the east, primarily on the right bank of the Sutlej river (Fox <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1992; Pandey 1993; Bhatnagar 2003; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015; Ghoshal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). </p>  <p>In&#160; Pakistan,&#160; the population of Himalayan Ibex&#160;is currently concentrated within the Karakoram Range, especially in the Districts of Hunza (Gojal Valley), Nagar (Hopper and Hisper), Shigar (Basha and Braldu) and Ghanche (Hushey and Kandey) (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015; Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In the Hindu Kush Range, the largest and most stable population occurs in Qurumber National Park and its buffer areas (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In the Himalayas, ibex habitat is shrinking overall; currently it is confined to Shouter Valley of Neelum Valley within the range that was reported for ibex in Pakistani Kashmir (Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Among the valleys of Gilgit-Balitstan that fall in the Himalayas, ibex exist in the Rupal, Rattu and Darley Valleys of Astore District in Gilgit-Baltistan. In the Hindu Kush Range, the ibex survives in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the upper Chitral District. It is restricted to the relatively dry mountains between about 3,200 to greater than 5,000 m.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Siberian Ibex are harvested by subsistence hunters for their meat and by trophy hunters primarily for their skulls with horns sometimes also the entire skin. Locally the fur is used to produce high-end wool, called “yangir”, but the extent of this use is not known.",Terrestrial,"<p>Within Afghanistan, ibex are nominally protected from human harvest by a nationwide presidential ban on hunting. Ibex populations residing in the Ajar valley (in Bamyan Province) were listed by the Government’s National Environmental Protection Agency as legally protected in 2009, formally banning all hunting and trading of animals from this population within Afghanistan. They are present in the Wakhan National Park (declared in 2014), and the Bamyan Plateau protected area (declared in 2019), which incorporates the Ajar Valley. They are probably very few left in Band-e-Amir National Park (declared in 2009) and their status in Shah Foladi protected area (declared in 2019) is unknown. Conservation measures proposed include surveys to determine the current status and distribution of the species.<br/> <br/> In China, the taxon is listed as Class I in the Wildlife Protection Law. Siberian ibex occur in at least eight nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Khanasi and Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), Tuomur Feng, Bogda Feng, Tianchi, West Tian Shan, and Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). Conservation measures proposed include determining the status of populations throughout their distribution in China, providing additional protection in some areas (e.g., in the Altai), considering others for development of managed, sustainable trophy hunting programs. These latter programs may be useful where ibex numbers are sufficiently abundant, and where removal or reduction of livestock is advised, local people should be provided with compensation. In northern Gansu, livestock should be managed to reduce conflicts with <em>C. sibirica</em>. It has also been suggested that a cross-boundary reserve be developed that would connect to the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia, not only to protect ibex but also other species.<br/> <br/> In India, the Project Snow Leopard, a national level policy for conservation in high elevation area promotes landscape scale participatory approaches within multi-use landscape (PSL 2008). Such a policy facilitates working with local communities to reduce impacts of livestock grazing and illegal hunting on wildlife in the region through the implementation of carefully developed management plans. Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2015) corroborate this by finding that most of the wildlife (including ibex) occur outside protected areas in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Siberian ibex is found in several protected areas in the western Himalayan region (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, 1991a, 1994; Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981; Bhatnagar 2003) including: Jammu and Kashmir (undivided) – Kishtwar and Hemis National Parks and Batkal Thajwas, Overa Aru, Kanji, Boodkharbu, Tongri, Rangdum, Karakoram, Lung Nag, Rizong Sabu, and Chukor Wildlife Sanctuaries; Himachal Pradesh - Pin Valley and Great Himalayan (possibly) National Parks and the Daranghati (possibly), Gamgul Siya-Behi, Kanawar, Kugti, Lippa Asrang, Manali, Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/> <br/> Within ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia ibex are present in several strictly protected areas (<em>zapovedniks</em>) and National Parks. Among these are important areas: Kazakhstan: Aksu-Dzhabagly, Alma-Ata and Markakol, Altyn-Emel National Park; Kyrgyzstan: Besh-Aral, Naryn, Sarychat-Ertash and Sary-Chelek, Ala-Archa National Park, Khan-Tengri National Park; Russia: Sayano-Shushensky and Altai; Tajikistan: Romit, Zorkul, Tajik National Park; Uzbekistan: Chatkal, Gissar and Zaamin, Ugam-Chatkal National Park, Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserve. Hunting by domestic hunters based on permits and hunting seasons exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and in few hunting areas in Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting for ibex exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting can be important for conserving the species, as it can provide incentives to prevent poaching, but usually only if implemented as community-based programs. Most such operations in the former Soviet Union involve former poachers and the income they provide encourages these people to refrain from poaching and to prevent others from poaching (Michel and Rosen 2016). Bans of trophy hunting as proposed in Kyrgyzstan in 2018 and 2019 or prohibition of trophy imports would remove such incentives and could result in higher mortality from unregulated illegal use. In Kyrgyzstan (since 2010) and Tajikistan (since 2008) community-based game management led to local recoveries of ibex numbers (Michel and Rosen 2016) in areas where previously poaching had reduced population sizes to low levels (SULi 2019). For instance, in Tajikistan 4 such game management areas with a total area 2,250 km² harbor about 2,300 animals with further community-based areas under development. Hunting and tourism revenues finance the management of these areas, managed by local NGOs created mainly by former poachers. Also in Kyrgyzstan, on several thousand square kilometers community-based organizations prevent poaching and thus support ibex conservation, although so far hunting quotas have not been assigned in any of these areas. Conservation measures proposed include the expansion of community-based hunting management and protection and the increase of protected areas effectiveness with a focus on stopping poaching and regulation of livestock grazing to prevent forage competition and habitat degradation. </p>  <p>In Mongolia, ibex is legally protected as a Rare species under the Mongolian Law on Fauna and the Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). No general hunting is allowed, but a limited amount of licensed trophy hunting is permitted. The species is listed as Near Threatened in most recent Mongolian Red List (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006), which represents a change in status from the last 2 Mongolian Red Books, in which the species was listed as Threatened (Shagdarsuren 1987; Shiirevdamba <em>et al</em>. 1997). Approximately 14% of the species’ range is protected (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006) and it occurs in at least the following protected areas: Altai-Taivan Bogd, Bodgkhan Mountains, Eej Khairkhan Mountain, Great Gobi, Gobi Gurvan Saikhan, Ikh Nart, Khangai Nuruu, Khar-Uvs Lake, Khokh Serkh Mountain, Khovsgol Lake, Otgontenger Mountain, Sharga Natural Reserve, Silkhem Mountain, Tarvagatai Mountain, Tost Mountains, Tsambagarav, Uvs Lake, and Yoliin Valley. Khokh Serkh Nature Reserve in the Altai region was established specifically for the conservation of this species. A long-term research project on ibex in Ikh Nart has been established for several years now, and several hundred are estimated to be living within this protected area (R. Reading pers. comm.). Conservation measures proposed include: 1) Undertake more rigorous population surveys of all populations; 2) Study the ecology, particularly habitat requirements and movement patterns, and the impacts of livestock grazing on ibex; 3) Hire, train, and equip law enforcement agents, especially for protected areas; 4) Begin using the money generated from trophy hunting to pay for conservation and management of the species, ideally using community-based approaches (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016); 5) Establish new protected areas to conserve additional populations of ibex; and 6) Collaborate better with Russia and China to protect populations that live in border regions. Trophy hunters purchase hunting licenses from which US$800 for Altai ibex and UD$720 for Gobi ibex are theoretically allocated to the government for a quota of 260 animals per year (MNE 2005). Little to none of this money is used specifically for conservation or management of the species (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), although a small percentage of the money goes toward general conservation activities, such as the budgets of regional protected areas administrations. <br/> <br/> Within Pakistan, Shackleton (1997) reported numerous protected areas providing differing levels of protection to ibex. These include: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Agram-Basti Wildlife Sanctuary (WS), Goleen Gol Game Reserve (GR); Swat District: Giddar Baik WS, Mahu Dand GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987). Gilgit-Baltistan - Gilgit District: Khunjerab NP, Kargah WS, Naltar WS, Kilik-Mintaka GR, Danyore GR, Sherqillah GR, Pakura Nallah GR, Chassi-Bowshdar GR, Nazbar Nallah GR (Rasool no date); Diamir District: Astor WS (Rasool n. d.); Baltistan District: Baltistan WS, Satpara WS, Nar Nallah GR, Askor Nallah GR (Rasool no date). Azad Jammu and Kashmir – Muzaffarabad District: Ghamot GR, Machiara GR (Qayyum 1986, 1987; Zool. Survey Dept. 1986). Mahu Dand GR was created for ibex in 1992. WWF-Pakistan began a hunting program in 1990 at the Bar village near Gilgit (Johnson 1997, Arshad 2002). In 1991, IUCN-Pakistan, with support from UNDP, in co-operation with local people and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program, initiated a planning process to survey protected areas and to prepare an overall sustainable-use wildlife management plan for ibex populations. The program involves hunting by both local and foreign hunters. Conservation measures include: 1) Provide complete legal protection for the species and 2) Establish a proper hunting system involving a management plan for locals, as well as for foreigners. Hunting occurs in areas with healthy populations. This trophy hunting program has benefited the ibex population in Pakistan, and helped many populations to recover in several valleys of northern Pakistan (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

There are small pockets with reasonable densities of tahr but vast areas devoid of them. Overall, tahr populations are on the decline, as indicated by sharp drops and disappearance in some areas, and declining habitat quality, ongoing poaching and impact of livestock as competitor, in other areas.

In general, they inhabit steep rocky mountain slopes, between 3,000–4,000 m asl, with woods and rhododendron <em>Rhodondendron</em> sp. scrub (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/></p>  <p>In Nepal, various surveys—like those in Kang Chu area (Schaller 1973), Everest National Park (Ale 2007), Langtang National Park (Green, 1979) and Annapurna Conservation Area (Gurung 1995)—reported that tahr occupy various habitat types from open alpine grassland and subalpine scrubland to sparse or even dense forests (tahr winter habitat). Precipitous cliffs break the continuity of these habitats. The best tahr habitat in the Everest region can be described as cliff faces broken by ledges supporting grasses, forbs and shrub mats at higher altitudes (mean 3,863 m, SE=0.9, range 3,260 m - 4,800 m, n=191) and patches of open pine or birch forest at lower altitude (mean 3,621 m, SE=1.4, range 3,300 m - 4,031 m, n=66). Tahr was reported from as high as 5,200 m (e.g., in Langtang: Fox 1974) and as low as 2,500 m in Kang Chu (Schaller 1977). In these mountains, steep hill slopes and undulating terrains are often characteristically interrupted by abrupt cliffs which act as oasis for these cliff-huggers whose presence is often predictive in these enclaves. This cliff-hugging behaviour of tahr restricts its own distribution (Ale 2007) and perhaps limits its group size as well. </p>  <p>Himalayan Tahr is diurnal, with varying group sizes depending on the degree of habitat ruggedness that characterizes particular localities. Group size of tahr is also influenced by the abundance of food and predation pressure. For instance, in Everest, group size ranged from 1-46 (average of ca. 8, n=277), during 2004 to 2006 (Lovari 1992, Ale 2007). The average group size increased over the decade in Everest perhaps in response to the return of snow leopards to the region (Ale 2007). Tahr formed comparatively larger groups in Annapurna Base Camp, Annapurna Conservation Area (13.8, range 1-57, n=134: Gurung 1995) and Langtang (average 15, largest group 77: Green 1979). Both Annapurna and Langtang lacked large predator, such as the snow leopard, in alpine and subalpine habitat, but most of these areas were characterized by undulating grasslands and scrublands thereby providing more plant forages for herbivores. <br/></p>  <p>The prevalence of local hunting may also influence the average group size. In Himachal Pradesh, western Himalaya (India), group size was very small (ca. 1.7, n = 7) with severe hunting in the past (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1983). This may have been reflected in the overall density reported from different study sites. In Everest, the tahr density was ca. 3.4/km<sup>2</sup> (with no human hunting but presence of large predator). Gurung (1995) reported tahr at the density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup> from Annapurna, with no human hunting and no large predator. In the absence of local hunting or natural predation, food can be the principle factor liming the size of populations. In overall Langtang (with no large predator and no human hunting), Tiwari (2006) reported 8.72 tahr/km<sup>2</sup> (8 herds, 218 individuals, in an area of 25 square kilometre). In the Langtang region of Langtang National Park, local density of tahr reached as high as 24/km<sup>2</sup> (Green 1979: 170 in 7 km<sup>2</sup>), where tahr was neither hunted nor its habitat grazed by livestock. On the other hand, Yala region of Langtang National Park, with ten times more domestic sheep and eight times more cattle than Langtang region, reached low tahr density (6/km<sup>2</sup>). In the absence of hunting in parts of New Zealand, tahr attained densities of &gt;30/km<sup>2 </sup>(Tustin and Challies, 1978). Female groups can reach very high densities in New Zealand, with groups of 100–150 commonly observed in areas that have not been hunted (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data). With regular hunting their population, however, maintained a density of ca. 5/km<sup>2</sup> (Tustin and Challies 1978)</p>  <p>Mating occurs from October to January, with it peaking around the first half of December (Lovari, S., unpubl. data). One or occasionally two kids are born in June and July after a gestation of 180-242 days. The age at sexual maturity is 1.5 years, with captive animals living up to 22 years (Smith <em>et al</em>., 2008). Females have home ranges of about 2 km<sup>2</sup> centred on rock bluffs. Males appear to be highly mobile, and outside of the rut are segregated from females (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data).</p>    <p>Himalayan Tahr is known to eat grass, herbs and some fruits. On Mt. Everest, tahr’s diets consisted typically of such grasses and sedges as <em>Carex, Avena</em>, <em>Poa</em>, <em>Trisetum</em>, <em>Cyperaceae</em> and <em>Imperata</em>. (Shrestha et al. 2002): overall, the diets were composed of 47% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 28% grasses and 25% sedges. This was similar to that Green (1979) reported for tahr in Langtang valley (38% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 34% grasses, 21% sedges, 4% ferns and 4% mosses). Green (1979) found in winter tahr supplemented its diet with small amounts of mosses and ferns, presumably because other food is less readily available. The diets of livestock and tahr were similar in the Everest region, but the proportion of woody plants (<em>Rhododendron</em> and <em>Cotoneaster</em>) was higher and that of grasses and sedges were lower in the diet of livestock than tahr. </p>","<p>The major threats in China are uncontrolled hunting and deforestation. In India, Himalayan Tahr is hunted for meat, and there is apparently significant competition with livestock for summer grazing in some areas. <span lang=""EN-IN"">Tahr possibly survive in small patches of steep, rugged forests around the sub-alpine zone, while much of its habitat is lost due to heavy pressure from local people and from developmental pressures. In Nepal, threats come from an expanding human population and accompanying increases in livestock, habitat loss, and poaching. As a result of these factors, tahr populations are becoming increasingly isolated. Besides threats related to anthropogenic activities, avalanches during winters with high snowfall also can be a significant mortality factor for tahr.</p>","<p>No global population estimate of Himalayan Tahr is currently available. The rate of its population change is unknown.<br/><br/>Only a few Himalayan Tahr have been observed in China (Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986). Perhaps, between 400 and 500 tahr, all located in southern Tibet, may exist in China (Wang 1998).<br/><br/>No estimate of tahr population in India is available, however, a number of sporadic counts of tahr are available from across the range. In Himachal Pradesh, for instance, approximately 130 in Kanawar Wildlife Sanctuary, and over 100 in Great Himalayan National Park (S. Pandey, pers. comm.) were reported. Population estimates have also been reported from parts of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary: 70 in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1994), and 110 in the Tungnath region of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Kittur <em>et al</em>. 2006). One survey between 1996 and 1998 indicated 50 tahr inhabiting Tirthan valley of the Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). Kandpal and Sathyakumar (2010) reported tahr from the Pindari glacier area. A recent high altitude ungulate survey in 2016 estimated 297 tahr (range: 222–565, 0.32 animals/sq. km) from Uttarakhand (Habib <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest several local extinctions of tahr in India (Sathyakumar, S., unpubl. data). They may be close to extirpation from western parts of Jammu and Kashmir. The entire population reported earlier from north of the Chenab River (between Kisthwar and the Banihal pass) is believed to be locally extinct now. Small populations of tahr survive in Bani-Sarthal (Kathua) and Kisthwar National Park (Kisthwar-Doda) (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Density estimates ranging from as high as 19.6 to 25.7<span lang=""EN-IN""> per km² (Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttarakhand) (Sathyakumar 1994) and from as low as 1.4 to 4.6 <span lang=""EN-IN"">per km² (Great Himalayan National Park, Himachal Pradesh) (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999) have been reported from different parts of Western Himalaya.<br/><br/></span>A different abundance index, that is, encounter rates (number/km walked) indicated tahr was less abundant in Nanda Devi National Park than Tungnath in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1993, 1994). Also, the tahr population was denser in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary than Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). A camera trap survey (trap nights/100 days) from the upper catchment of Bhagirathi River revealed higher abundance of tahr in temperate habitat (4.4 ± 2.62) than alpine habitat (0.6 ± 0.34) (Pal <em>et al</em>., in press). In Sikkim, an intensive study in Prek Chu Catchment found the presence of Himalayan Tahr in subalpine and alpine zone, but they were rare compared to other ungulates such as blue sheep (Bhattacharya 2013).<br/><br/>No total population size estimates of tahr are available for Nepal, but there have been several sporadic surveys from different parts of the country over the decades. Bauer (1988) estimated 1,000 tahr for Sagamartha, Makalu-Barun and Langtang National Parks. These three regions obviously support more tahr than Bauer’s estimates, as revealed by relatively recent studies (see below).<br/><br/>Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park can easily support 700-800 tahr, at least half of them occurring in Namche, Phorste, Thame and Gokyo valleys, in an area of <em>ca</em> 160 km². The overall mean group size was 8.5, from 2004 to 2006, with an overall density of 3.4/km2 (Lovari et al. 2009, Ale 2007). Between 1989 and 2010, there was a decrease of tahr by some 2/3, from ca 350 to <em>ca</em> 100 tahr, in the core area of Sagarmatha National Park because of increased predation following the return of the snow leopard (Lovari &amp; Mishra 2016). The recent data are lacking but numbers of predator and prey may have estabilised by now in Everest (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The most recent survey, in 2012, revealed a minimum of 394 tahr from Langtang in ca. 79.3 km² (density 5.3 tahr/km²: Thapa 2012). Green’s (1978) density estimates in Langtang National Park were similar in some localities (6.8 per sq. km) but in other localities they reached as high as s 25.0 per square kilometre.<br/><br/>Tahr has been reported from all of Nepal’s mountain protected areas but there have been no systematic surveys in these parks. No data on tahr are available from Gaurishankar Conservation Area, but in 2010 a short survey on the status of snow leopards also revealed the presence of tahr in Rolwaling valley in Gaurishankar. Their numbers, however, were dwindling (just 12 individuals observed, although with a decent kid-to-female ratio of 0.7: Ale <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent survey (Devkota <em>et al</em>. 2017) in an area of 124.2 km<sup>2</sup> in the upper reaches of Tsum valley, in Manaslu Conservation Area, revealed 223 tahr (nine herds, average group size of 25, range 2 to 74 individuals; a density of 1.8 animals per km<sup>2</sup>). Earlier in 2012, just two-day observations yielded at least 400 in the Tsum Valley and a similar number from the Budhi Gandhaki Valley in Manaslu (Sandro Lovari and Madhu Chettri, unpubl. data). The recent status of tahr in Annapurna Conservation Area is lacking but Gurung (1995) counted over 500 tahr in Annapurna Base Camp (density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>A total of 285 tahr were reported from Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve by Kandel <em>et al</em>. (2011). Tahr has been sighted in Shey Phoksundo, Khaptad, and Rara National Parks, in western Nepal. Even though there have been no formal surveys, each of these parks were reported to support at least 50 tahr, according to local experts (quoted in Gurung, 1995). Many districts that fall outside of protected areas, such as Dolpo, Jumla, Humla and Jajarkot, have been reported to contain sparse populations of tahr (Raju Acharya, Karan B. Shah, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest that considerable local extinctions of tahr have taken place in Nepal. Overall, conservative estimates of tahr population for entire Nepal may not exceed 10,000 (Som B. Ale, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The potential habitat of Himalayan Tahr, worldwide, between 2,200 m and 4,200 m elevation, is estimated at <em>c.</em> 44,200 km<sup>2</sup> with most areas being in Nepal (that is, 22,455 km<sup>2</sup>), followed by India (20,248 km<sup>2</sup>) and China (1,465 km<sup>2</sup>). Suitable tahr habitat occurs in Himachal Pradesh (8,903 km<sup>2</sup>), Uttarakhand (6,500 km<sup>2</sup>) and Sikkim (865 km<sup>2</sup>), and Jammu and Kashmir (3,979 km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>The current global population of Himalayan Tahr in its native range (that is, China, India and Nepal) is difficult to estimate due to the paucity of data, but it may not exceed the size of introduced populations in New Zealand, South Africa, United States of America, and Argentina (likely extinct). No attempts to census tahr populations have been made from the other countries except from New Zealand. The total abundance of tahr in New Zealand alone, from 2016 to 2018, was placed between 24,777 and 47,461, with average density ranging from 0.06 to 9.2 tahr/km<sup>2</sup>.</p>",Decreasing,"Himalayan Tahr is found in the Himalaya of China, India and Nepal spread over an estimated 44,200 km², however the actual area of occurrence may be much smaller given extirpation and currently unsuitable habitats in between. Outside the Himalayas, tahr was introduced to the South Island of New Zealand and Western Cape Province in South Africa (Grubb 2005). They were accidentally released in Cibola National Forest Mountain (New Mexico, USA) from a game ranch, and in Neuquén province and Parque Diana ranch of Argentina perhaps illegally by ranchers (Flueck 2010), and possibly now extinct from Neuquén (Guichon <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In China, Himalayan Tahr was discovered in 1974 in Quxiang of Buoqu Valley (aka Zhangmu Valley) in southern Tibet (Beijing Natural History Museum and Qinghai Institute of Biology 1977). Since then, there has been no additional information pertaining to its occurrence or status. A confirmed report of species presence came from Tibet’s Geelong-Buoqu Valleys (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986, Wang 1998, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Qomolangma Nature Reserve (pers. comm., Labaciren) where numbers of tahr have been sighted regularly in the Rongxia and Chentang valleys.<br/><br/>In India, Himalayan Tahr occurs along subalpine regions across southern forested slopes in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim (Sathyakmuar 2002). Populations are patchily distributed from south-central Kashmir through the southern part of Kullu (Himachal Pradesh) between c. 2,000 and 3,300 m (Gaston et al. 1981, 1983). They are widely present at similar elevations from northern Uttarakhand all the way to the border of Nepal. Small numbers of tahr also inhabit east Sikkim (nearby India-Nepal border) and west Sikkim (close to India-Bhutan border).<br/><br/>In Nepal, Himalayan Tahr formerly had a continuous distribution between 1,500 m and 5,200 m, but this has been increasingly disrupted by human activities such as livestock-grazing and subsistence hunting (Green 1978, 1979, Ale, S. B. unpubl. data). Overall, in Nepal, tahr inhabits temperate to sub-alpine forests and alpine meadows, mainly between <em>ca</em> 2,500 m and 4,000 m, but individuals at times venture up to 5,200 m. Schaller (1977) mapped fourteen locations of tahr in Nepal, but there are undoubtedly more.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, tahr is reported from the Jigme Khesar Strict Nature Reserve (Tshewang <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Bhutan Government’s Nature Conservation Division of the Department of Forest and Park Services has not confirmed its presence in the country (Sonam Wangdi, December 2019, pers. comm.).","<p>In New Zealand, there is occasional commercial harvesting of tahr for meat. There is a substantial recreational hunt of this species, and adult males (≥4.5 years old) are highly sought after as trophies by recreational and trophy hunters.</p>  In Nepal’s only in one hunting reserve, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Himalayan Tahr is harvested for trophy (blue sheep, <em>Pseudois nayaur</em>, were more sought after than Himalayan Tahr). The income thus generated has been used for conservation and local income generation activities (Karki and Thapa 2011). Two types of revenue have been generated through trophy hunting: the revenue collected by the Nepal’s government’s wildlife department, and money collected by local communities (although not substantiated on a legal basis, so monetary figures are not known: the charge to hunters may have varied from $533–1,333 for a Himalayan Tahr (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015). Locals used the money collected from tahr and blue sheep trophy-hunting for community development activities, for example, upgrading facilities of the local health post, constructing trails, and maintaining a bridge. Government revenue collected from 2007 to 2012 totalled $184,372, a portion of which went to conservation activities (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Terrestrial,"<p>Himalayan Tahr is not listed under threatened category of CITES. </p>  <p>It is listed as Category I species in China. Conservation measures proposed for China included undertaking surveys to determine the species’ distribution and status in Qomolangma Nature Reserve&#160;(Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Qomolangma&#160;Nature Reserve started the snow leopard program in 2015 funded by Vanke Foundation. The program undertook a large-scale wildlife survey and subsequent conservation projects that included educating local communities about tahr and other wildlife. </p>  <p>In India, protected areas with Himalayan Tahr include: Jammu and Kashmir – Kishtwar National Park (locally threatened); Himachal Pradesh - Great Himalayan National Park (confirmed), and Daranghati (locally threatened), Gamgul Siahbehi, Kanawar, Khokhan, Kugti, Manali (locally threatened or extinct), Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah (locally threatened) Wildlife Sanctuaries; Uttarakhand -Nanda Devi and (probably) Valley of Flowers National Parks, Govind Pashu Vihar and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuaries; and Sikkim - Khangchendzonga National Park (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981, 1983, Green 1987; Kathayat and Mathur 2002). Tahr uses rugged forested slopes with temperate oak and pine forests, well below the subalpine areas where it is often currently located. This suggests that its current range distribution may reflect displacement from formerly used lower elevation areas. Conservation measures proposed for India include: 1) extend the Great Himalayan National Park as proposed, 2) establish the proposed Srikhand National Park (Himachal Pradesh), 3) devise innovative community based reserves for the species outside protected areas (these need to include community based protection, tourism, awareness, etc.), and 4) include areas with tahr in the innovative, participatory, landscape level planning and action under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Project Snow Leopard. Overall, the country’s conservation strategy clearly states conserving species in and outside protected areas.</p>  <p>A significant proportion of Nepal’s tahr occurs within protected areas, but its population is widespread in areas outside of protected areas (e.g., the region that lies between Manaslu and Langtang, Bhimthang valley between Manalsu and Annapurna, and Dolpo, Jumla, Mugu and Humla districts). The species occurs in all mountain protected areas of Nepal: Langtang, Rara, Sagamartha (Everest), Makalu-Barun and Shey-Phoksundo National Parks; Api Nampa, Annapurna, Manalsu, Gaurishankar and Kanchanjunga Conservation Areas, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, and Khaptad National Park. </p>  <p>Conservation measures proposed for Nepal: 1) maintain the current, closely controlled, legal hunting program in Dhorpatan, 2) consider a regulated program of low-level subsistence hunting by local villagers, and 3) undertake surveys to understand the increasing fragmentation of tahr populations and offer mitigation measures. The first steps to address this issue would be to begin in selected areas by mapping tahr habitat features such as cliffs (using 1:50,000 topographic maps), followed by ground surveys to validate the species’ presence/absence.</p>  <p>Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is the only reserve in Nepal that allows trophy hunting of Himalayan Tahr along with blue sheep. From 2008 to 2011, Karki and Thapa (2011) reported 34 Himalayan Tahr were harvested: 18 in 2008/09 (100% harvest; quota set by the government), 11 (61% in 2009/10) and 5 (28 % in 2010/11). A quick glance on the numbers harvested indicates they were not so small numbers if adult males have been the only target. It would mean some 10-15 % of the adult male (trophy) population (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm). Perhaps the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation – Nepal should consider revaluating the trophy hunting of tahr on a sustainable basis.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Also, the species is affected by a continuous habitat loss and degradation due to agriculture, landslides, fires, logging, human settlements, among other threats occurring throughout its range, and areas that it may possibly be found. If a population still exists it is thought to have fewer than 50 mature individuals, and it is tagged as 'Possibly Extinct' as it has not been recorded since 1996.","This species lives in premontane and lower montane wet forest, and is found breeding in clear water, steep and fast-flowing mountain streams. It is not tolerant to habitat disturbance.","Chytridiomycosis is thought to be a threat to this species, and it is suspected that it caused the population declines that have been observed. Habitat loss and degradation are also problems. In Parque Nacional Pico Bonito, the area from which this species was recorded is subject to extensive landslides which often severely impact the species' habitat. The type locality for this species has been completely destroyed by landslides.&#160;Additional major threats include deforestation as a result of agricultural and large-scale livestock encroachment, human settlements, selective logging of hardwoods, and human-induced fires (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;In Texiguat, the major threats to this species include high rates of deforestation and encroachment in the wildlife refuge for extensive cattle ranching and coffee plantations, agricultural crops (e.g., beans, avocado), including in the core area, mining activity to extract antimony at the locality where this species has been found, illegal selective logging for hardwoods, followed by clear-cutting along the same access routes (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Another threat includes the construction of several small-scale hydroelectric dams (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). There is a proposal to shift the core parts both the Parque Nacional Pico Bonito and Texiguat, which may create a much larger buffer zone where habitat conversion can progress unabated (C. Antúnez, J. Ramos Galdámez and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The reform to the Ley de Protección de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Artículos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is also increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).<br/><br/>Climate change is also considered to be a threat. Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabitat a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).","The species was previously abundant up until 1989, when it was suspected that chytridiomycosis had caused major population declines.

Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g.<em>&#160;</em>chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).</p>","It is moderately infrequent and seems to be in decline (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). It was last documented at the type locality (Quebrada de Oro) in May 1996, when two metamorphs and two tadpoles were collected with deformed mouthparts (McCranie and Wilson 2002), which is often correlated with the chytrid infection in tadpoles of this genus (J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019). It is apparently extirpated from the type locality, but may still occur in unsurveyed parts of the surrounding areas (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).

Additional major threats include deforestation as a result of agricultural and large-scale livestock encroachment, human settlements, selective logging of hardwoods, and human-induced fires (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;There is a proposal to shift the core part of Parque Nacional Pico Bonito, which may create a much larger buffer zone where habitat conversion can progress unabated (C. Antúnez, J. Ramos Galdámez and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).&#160;In Parque Nacional Nombre de Dios, the major threat is habitat destruction from large-scale cattle ranching, small-scale oil palm plantations in the lower elevations (0-100 m asl), small-scale cacao plantations, selective logging for valuable hardwoods followed by clear-cutting, human-induced fires, and the building of roads (L. Herrera and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). In Campiro y Calentura, deforestation is a major threat in the northern part caused by increasing urbanisation (J.M. Solís pers. comm. March 2019). The reform to the Ley de Protección de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Artículos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is also increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;Cerro Correviento is unprotected forest, where the only forest that remains is a patch of less than 1,500 hectares between 1,130-1,245 m asl, which is threatened by small-scale agriculture (crops), expanding human settlements, selective logging for valuable hardwoods followed by clear-cutting, landslides, and human-induced fires (L. Herrera and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Chytridiomycosis is very likely to be threat to this species (J. Kolby and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). Other species have been found infected in the same localities as this species (Puschendorf<em> et al</em>. 2006), and tadpoles of this species have been observed with deformed mouthparts (J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019). Tadpoles of <em>Ptychohyla hympotker</em> found in Parque Nacional Cusuco that are infected with chytrid often exhibit severely deformed mouthparts, suggesting that the observed deformities within this species may be due to infection (J.

It was last seen in 1990, and exhaustive surveys at the species' known sites and the only other adjacent site with suitable habitat at suitable elevations have failed to record the species in several decades. The species experienced drastic population declines, probably due to chytridiomycosis and habitat loss, and has apparently not recuperated.","This species lived on the ground along mountain streams in premontane and lower montane moist forest. It presumably bred by direct development, with eggs laid on land, similar to other species in the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em>&#160;series&#160;(McCranie and Castaneda 2007). It was not though to have tolerated habitat disturbance.","Species of the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em> group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by&#160;agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides.&#160;The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J.

Additional major threats include deforestation as a result of agricultural and large-scale livestock encroachment, human settlements, selective logging of hardwoods, and human-induced fires (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;In Texiguat, the major threats to this species include high rates of deforestation and encroachment in the wildlife refuge for extensive cattle ranching and coffee plantations, agricultural crops (e.g., beans, avocado), including in the core area, illegal selective logging for hardwoods, followed by clear-cutting along the same access routes (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Another threat includes the construction of several small-scale hydroelectric dams (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). The reform to the Ley de Protección&#160;de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Artículos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;There is a proposal to shift the core parts both the Parque Nacional Pico Bonito and Texiguat, which may create a much larger buffer zone where habitat conversion can progress unabated (C. Antúnez, J. Ramos Galdámez, and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Cerro Correviento is unprotected forest, where the only forest that remains is a patch (&lt;1,500 ha) between 1,130-1,245 m asl, which is threatened by small-scale agriculture (crops), expanding human settlements, selective logging for valuable hardwoods followed by clear-cutting, landslides, and human-induced fires (L. Herrera and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).<br/><br/>Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).

Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).

Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).

Historical records from the type series suggest that this species occurred in the Páramo ecosystem between 3,000-3,500 m asl. However, this species was not recorded again in these ecosystems. It has been seen on leaves (sometimes on branches or stems) of Piperaceae species, <em>Pitcarnia</em> sp., <em>Cavendishia</em> sp., <em>Clusia</em> sp., and ferns (Cadenas <em>et al</em>. 2009, Barrio-Amorós <em>et al</em>. 2010), and along the edge of trails (Javier García, unpublished data). Some individuals have been found during the day under mosses, roots, or within decomposing logs. High densities of individuals have been observed in disturbed habitats (ie. secondary vegetation with abundant mosses and rotten logs on the edges of trails) (Javier García, personal communication 2020). Ants, mites, and pseudoscorpions are the most frequent items found in its diet (Cadenas <em>et al</em>. 2009, Díaz de Pascual <em>et al</em>. 2010).

Like the genus&#160;<em>Gastromyzon</em>, species in the genus&#160;<em>Neogastromyzon&#160;</em>are benthic/demersal fishes that exhibit remarkable morphological adaptations to bottom-dwelling in torrential waters and have lost their ability to swim, thus relying on crawling over submerged rocks as their main mode of locomotion. In consequence, these loaches prefers run or riffle zones of hill streams, which are characterised by relatively shallow water with swift current and with boulders, rocks, and cobbles as the dominant bottom substrates. They are known to be primarily rock grazers, feeding on algae and diatoms and opportunistically on the aquatic insect larvae (Inger and Chin 1961, Tan 2006, Chong&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). This species has been collected in areas with very clear water and many areas of shallow rapids and waterfalls, with a river bed of rock, gravel and pebbles (Roberts 1991). Continuing decline in the habitat quality has occurred as inferred from Chong&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2010) who reported that habitat degradation is one of the threats to this species other than being vulnerable due to its endemicity.","The terrain in which this species occurs is topographically extreme with high gradients. As a result, any heavy rainfall, for example during monsoon season, can lead to landslides that may cause population fluctuations as stream habitats are severely impacted by heavy sedimentation (H.H.

The total adult population size is uncertain, but it is likely small given the information based on its representative specimens in museums (Tan 2006) and its encounter probability as implied in Chong<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;(2010) that may suggest a relatively low abundance of individuals being collected/encountered in one locality on average.

There is no credible quantification of decline rate from anywhere in the species' range. The overall forest loss rate at appropriate altitudes&#160;in the species' range is suspected to be sufficient for Near Threatened status (about 25% in the last three generations), but Red Panda populations are suspected to be declining much faster, reflecting a battery of direct threats, this species' fragmented present range, and poor survival in fragmented areas. (1)&#160;Red Panda diet is 98% bamboo. These plants&#160;show mass flowering followed by die off. Red Pandas will not readily find new feeding grounds in a highly fragmented landscape and are exposed to other threats when crossing unsuitable habitat. These bamboos do not easily re-establish after flowering in areas of environmental degradation and deforestation, which are now widespread across the&#160;species's range. (2)&#160;Red Pandas are highly susceptible to canine distemper (even developing the disease after vaccination with&#160;domestic dog vaccine), which is lethal to them. As more people, particularly herders, encroach Red Panda habitat, contact between domestic dogs (and their excreta) and Red Pandas increases. Unless all dogs (including feral ones) in Red Panda habitat are vaccinated against this disease the chance that it will enter and spread in the wild Red Panda population with catastrophic consequences are high. (3)&#160;Red Panda has specific habitat requirements for forest type, altitude, slope gradient and aspect, proximity to water courses, precipitation and presence of tree stumps. The gentle slopes and rich bamboo understorey of Red Panda habitat make it also a prime choice for herders with their dogs. Cattle also prefer these more gentle slopes, so trample bamboo, which is also collected extensively by herdsmen and used for fodder. In addition tree stumps are often collected by local villagers for firewood. (4)&#160;Hunting for trade seems to be increasing, Red Pandas are starting to enter the pet trade, perhaps partly in response to the increasing number of ‘cute’ images on social media. Deforestation and road building are easing access to Red Panda habitat. There are reports of poachers capturing Red Pandas in Nepal and Myanmar to satisfy the Chinese demand for the species (as wild meat, for medicine and for skins). The smaller population fragments, such as in&#160;Nepal, can support little or no off-take. (5)&#160;The human population in the Eastern Himalayas is growing at an average rate of 2.1% (doubling time 33 years). With this growth more people are moving into Red Panda habitat for their livelihoods, thereby exacerbating the above threats. Yonzon and Hunter (1991) showed that Red Panda mortality is high in disturbed areas; in their study area only three of the 12-13 cubs born survived to&#160;six&#160;months and only five of the nine adults survived the study period. They stated that 57% of these deaths were directly related to human causes. Comparable figures from undisturbed habitat are not available; but annual mortality rates such as these cannot possibly be&#160;sustainable.<br/><br/>The Ailuridae comprises a monospecific family. In part for this reason of conservation priority, with the evidence of precise decline rate being inadequate for certain discrimination between Vulnerable and Endangered, the precautionary course is taken of categorisation as Endangered, pending more precise information.","<p>Red Panda is closely associated with montane forests (oak mixed; mixed broad-leaf conifer; and conifer) with dense bamboo-thicket understorey (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). Conifer/fir forests seem to be preferred (Yonzon and Hunter 1991). Habitats above the tree-line are probably not consistently occupied given that Red Panda is essentially arboreal (Choudhury 2001). A dead Red Panda at 4,325 m asl in Arunachal Pradesh, in an area where the species is not generally known and far from any typical Red Panda habitat, was presumably a dispersant (Dorjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Six studies reported that Red Panda prefers to live near (typically within 100–200 m of) water (e.g., Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001). Five indicated a preference for canopy cover above 30%, with some suggesting cover as high as 70–80% may be preferred. Three suggested a preference for slopes of below 45%. Several indicated a preference for slope aspect: most suggest avoidance of south-facing slopes in favour of the cooler climate of the north, northwest and northeast aspects (Yonzon and Hunter 1991, Pradhan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001,&#160;Mahato 2004,&#160;Mallick 2010,&#160;Jhoshi and Sangam 2011,&#160;Subedi and Thapa 2011,&#160;Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Panthi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sharma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Sagamartha National Park, Red Panda was found on south-facing slopes in only one of six study areas, at lower density than at similar altitudes on north-facing slopes. In another area where both north- and south-facing slopes had otherwise similar habitat, Red Panda was found only on the north-facing slopes (Mahato 2004). Only in China have there been reports that Red Panda prefers south-facing slopes (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2013). All studies investigating aspect took place in a similar altitude range. Also in China, in contrast to the rest of the range, steep slopes of more than 45% seemed preferred. Perhaps this relates to sympatry with Giant Panda <em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>&#160;(in the Minshan, Qionglai, Liangshan, Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling ranges in western Sichuan; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a, 2000), which uses the more gentle slopes. Zhang <em>et al</em>. (2008) found that Red Panda prefers microhabitats with higher densities of fallen logs and tree stumps.</p><p> Red Panda is largely vegetarian, eating chiefly young leaves and shoots of bamboo. It also takes fruit, roots, succulent grasses, acorns, lichens, birds' eggs and insects (Hodgson 1847, Sowerby 1932). It is largely arboreal (Hodgson 1847).<br/> <br/> Gestation in captivity lasts 114–145 days (Northrop and Czekala 2011), suggesting a variable delay in embryo implantation. The animals breed once per year giving birth in the summer (late May to early August in northern hemisphere zoos). In captivity, litter sizes range from one to four, most commonly one to two; quadruplets are exceedingly rare. In the field, Yonzon and Hunter (1991) reported litters usually of singletons or twins. The young are sexually mature at 18 months and females can give birth for the first time around their second birthday. In captivity the generation length is around five to six years and its average longevity around 12–14 years. This slow reproductive rate and relatively long generation time are typical of a k-selected species, adapted to a stable environment and less capable of survival when that environment starts changing rapidly.<br/> </p>","<p>Each of the three recent&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs)&#160;listed the threats to Red Panda assessed to be most prevalent in their country/countries. Several problems occur throughout the species's range, albeit with some variation in assessed impact. The major threats are habitat loss and fragmentation; habitat degradation; and physical threats. These are all compounded by the region's increasing human population;<span class=""a1""> climate change; natural disasters; inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations; mostly low political will and interest; political instability (in some regions); low coordination of stakeholders, funding and human resources; trans-boundary issues facilitating poaching, illegal collection of non-timber forest products, and Red Panda trade (skins and other body parts); and the movement of cattle herders/grazers during the breeding season.<br/> <br/> <span class=""a1"">Natural disasters include cyclones; landslides; floods; heavy snowfall and rainfall; bamboo flowering (which results in death of the plant and typically occurs synchronously across large areas); forest fires; poor regeneration of shelter trees; weed infestation and invasive alien species; and disease outbreaks. Although most of these have been in operation throughout Red Panda existence, their effects are increasingly severe as an ever-larger proportion of the distribution is outside contiguous habitat blocks&#160;large enough&#160;for recolonisation to occur post-disaster.</span></p><p><span class=""a1""><span class=""a1""> In some areas, habitat is lost and degraded by commercial logging. In the Emaw Bum region of Myanmar more&#160;than 5,000 km<sup>2</sup> have been logged since 1999–2000, resulting in many new roads into mountain areas, e.g. between the May Hka river and the China border. These logging roads not only&#160;destroy&#160;habitat&#160;directly, they also facilitate access for hunters and can destabilise the substrate. A recent video report from FFI shows two young Red Pandas crossing a landslide, the result of foreign road-building in the area.<br/> <br/> As human populations grow, more people move into mountain regions to live. They clear land for habitation, bring domestic herds to roam in the forests where they trample and eat bamboo. Herders collect bamboo for fodder and other necessities. The herds are protected by dogs that attack pandas and, if not vaccinated, potentially carry canine distemper, fatal to Red Panda. The lack of annual vaccination in India, at least, leads to a high incidence of canine distemper in dogs of one to five years of age (Latha <em>et al</em>. 2007). Spillover of canine distemper into wild species is already well documented, such as to Indian Fox <em>Vulpes bengalensis</em> (Vanak <em>et al</em>. 2007) and Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em>&#160;(e.g. Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Himalayan bamboos, the Red Panda’s dietary staple, are sensitive to environmental degradation, deforestation, fire and overgrazing (Stapleton 1996). Reduced canopy cover increases wind and water stress for the bamboo. In these situations, seedlings are destroyed by the harsh conditions coupled with grazing pressure.<br/> <br/> Reports of Red Panda poaching and smuggling seem to be increasing, perhaps through demand in China.&#160;F. Momberg (pers. comm. 2010)&#160;saw Red Panda carcases and skins in&#160;villagers'&#160;homes in eastern Myanmar. One hunter allowed him to accompany him while he caught a Red Panda with his hands; apparently these villagers regularly take Red Pandas. Wildlife trade is rampant in Myanmar (about 30 tons of wildlife products per month), facilitated by wildlife habitat proximity to the Chinese border. Before Red Panda was upgraded to Appendix I of CITES in the early 1990s, individuals captured in Myanmar were traded by China to zoos around the world.&#160;<br/> <br/> Ang Phuri Sherpa (pers. comm. 2015) &#160;reported an increase in illegal trade over the preceding three years, based on the number of poachers and traders caught in Nepal. These incidents mostly involved skins and the items were headed for China. One incident involved a live Red Panda. A general increase in interest in Red Panda skins and meat in China could fuel more trade. A US businessman reported Red Pandas on offer in a restaurant. In the 'Threats' discussions during the 2012 Red Panda PHVA in China, many Chinese participants indicated that Red Panda meat was fairly widely available in restaurants, although no details are available. &#160;<br/> <br/> The live Red Panda trade, for pets, also seems to be increasing. Ian Lee (Chinese representative for Red Panda Network, pers. comm. 2015) found several reports in Chinese newspapers and social media of Red Pandas for sale as pets. This corroborates indications that Red Panda is increasing in popularity as a pet in China and other Asian countries, notably Thailand (YouTube videos and Instagram photos).<br/> <br/> Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) considers hunting and poaching the major threat to the Red Panda in Myanmar, in two ways: in one area, Red Panda is not a target species but is caught in iron traps, and some of skins are traded; in another, live Red Pandas are traded to China, motivating local people to go to catch them whenever they have time.<br/> </span></p>","<p>Red Panda was “estimated to be more common in the eastern part of its range, especially along the Myanmar-Yunnan border, yet it cannot be considered a common species” (Roberts and Gittleman 1984). There have been four undertakings to estimate, per country, the area of occupied habitat and from this the approximate Red Panda population: Choudhury (2001), Mahato (2010), the recent Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs; held in Nepal in 2010, China in 2012, and India in 2013) and Kendal <em>et al</em>. (2015). These show very little concordance (<span style="""">see Table 1 in the&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Supplementary Material</span>) and whilst some differences might reflect real change between earlier and later assessments, most must stem from differing assumptions and techniques. The PHVA figures are taken here as the most realistic guides, although none has been corrected for suitability of gross area of broadly suitable habitat accounting for specific preferences. Yet Red Panda is selective in forest used with regard to level of annual rainfall, percentage canopy cover, and density of bamboo (e.g., Yonzon <em>et al.</em>&#160;1991, Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012, Zhou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). These would ideally all be taken into account when estimating area of potential habitat. In addition, Red Panda is usually found near water-courses and in areas with many tree stumps, and apparently prefers medium-gradient or shallower, north-facing slopes. In combination, these factors will make the area occupied at average to high densities substantially below that of potential habitat. For example, taking into account forest type, altitude, precipitation and slope aspect, Yonzon <em>et al. </em>(1991) estimated only 68 km<sup>2</sup> of the 1,719 km<sup>2</sup> Langtang National Park to comprise suitable Red Panda habitat.</p><p> Regardless of the uncertainty of actual area occupied, increases in human population and the continuing spread of human activity has driven habitat loss and degradation since the assessment of Choudhury (2001).<br/> <br/> <strong>Nepal</strong>. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i), with numbers low (317–582 – similar to the prediction by Yonzon <em>et al.</em> 1997) and a declining population fragmented into 11 subpopulations. These data are extracted from the PHVA report. Subsequent surveys of Api Nampa (Arjun Thapa pers. comm. 2014) and Khaptad (Hari P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011) did not confirm the survival of these two subpopulations. The following estimates of density/numbers have been reported:&#160;<strong>Rara: </strong>about one animal per 3 km<sup>2</sup>, mostly between 3,100 and 3,600 m asl because of fragmentation and disturbance below this, and reduced habitat suitability above; a maximum of 11 Red Pandas in a 35&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;study area (Sharma 2008, Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014). <strong>Langtang</strong>: one per 2.09&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;giving a total of 68 Red Pandas in the park (Yonzon 1989), but Yonzon <em>et al</em>. (1991)&#160;reassessed the Langtang population at 24. This apparent decline, of 65% in less than two to three years, was probably real, reflecting high mortality resulting from anthropogenic disturbance in the park. <strong>Panchthar – Ilam – Tapeljung:</strong>&#160;one per 5.5&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;– 100 animals in 178&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Williams 2003, 2004). <strong>Dhorpatan: </strong>animals present but no density or population estimates available<strong>.</strong> Most Red Pandas occur over 3,200–3,400 m asl (Subedi and Thapa 2011) or 3,000–3,800 m asl (Panthi <em>et al</em>. 2012), and suffer disturbance from local people for livestock and collection of forest products. <strong>Bhotkola:&#160;</strong>135&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;good Red Panda habitat holds about 30–46 Red Pandas (Joshi and Sangam 2011).<br/> <br/> <strong>India: the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh</strong>. Participants in the 2013 PHVA calculated that the amount of habitat available for Red Panda in Sikkim and Arunachal was 6,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. More rigid constraints on assessing habitat as 'suitable' gave merely 2,600&#160;km<sup>2</sup>. Even with the more relaxed habitat conditions, this area is only half that proposed for India by Choudhury (2001), although the comparison is complicated by the non-availability of 2013 figures for West Bengal. Given the changes in land use in the last 20 year, the area of potential Red Panda habitat has undoubtedly declined, although direct comparison between PHVA data and those published by Choudhury is unwise: Choudhury estimated Red Panda habitat from forest service maps and national park maps, whereas the PHVA evaluation used current satellite imagery. In Sikkim, 225–370 Red Pandas in 650&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of suitable forest were calculated by Ziegler <em>et al</em>. (2010); the PHVA estimate was of 44–415. In West Bengal (<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">not included in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material</span>), a statement of 78 Red Pandas in Singalila (Pradhan <em>et al</em>. 2001) contrasts with a more recent one of 27 animals (Roka and Jha 2014) and a similar number stated by Bahaguna <em>et al</em>. (1998). This figure plus the 28–32 animals stated to live in the Neora Valley by Mallick (2010) gives a total of 55–60 Red Pandas in West Bengal. In Arunachal Pradesh there have been fewer site-specific studies. This state is presumed to hold the largest Red Panda population in India. According to Choudhury (2001) it was relatively common in Tawang and northern West Kameng districts and in the Mishmi Hills, especially Dibang Valley and Lohit districts. Ghose and Dutta (2011) reported sightings of Red Pandas from&#160;several&#160;districts, all from before 2000. Habitat maps suggest that most Red Panda habitat is in the east of the state, with a second concentration in the west, around Tawang and Eaglesnest. The habitat between these two regions looks more sparse and fragmented.<br/> <br/> <strong>Bhutan.</strong> Red Panda seems to be widely distributed, mostly at 2,400–3,700 m asl. Bhutan is a very small country with a fast developing economy. The road system is expanding fast and the growing rural population depends on forest and forest products. Even in this country, the pressure on Red Panda habitat is marked.<br/> <br/> <strong>Myanmar</strong>. The area where Red Panda is found (northern Kachin province) is remote, with recent locality records from Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary, Mount Majed and Emaw Bum, mostly above 3,000 m asl. The number of villager captures suggests the species may be common in Hkakaborazi National Park, but none was camera-trapped there despite substantial effort at suitable altitude (Than Zaw <em>et al.</em> 2008). Ngwe Lwin (pers. comm. 2014) believes Red Panda is still fairly common in the Emaw Bum region, albeit much disturbed by logging and hunting. Red Panda is presumably less common than formerly in Myanmar and, although apparently not specifically targeted by hunters, it is still caught and killed.<br/> <br/> <strong>China. </strong>China is the only country for which the PHVA estimated much higher forest cover than did Choudhury (2001). Choudhury’s (2001) estimates were supported by Wei <em>et al</em>. (1999, 2011). As Wei <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported, reforested lands (which are increasing, reflecting government policy) do not provide suitable Red Panda habitat. Red Panda perhaps decreased in China by as much as 40% in the second half of the twentieth century, through massive habitat loss, increased human activity and poaching (Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999). Wei <em>et al.</em> (1999) estimated 3,000–7,000 Red Pandas in China.<br/> </p>",Decreasing,"<p>The current Red Panda distribution is detailed in three Population and Habitat Viability Analyses (PHVAs) since 2010, covering all range states holding the species: Nepal (2010), China and Myanmar (2012), and India and Bhutan (2013). As discussed by Roberts and Gittleman (1984),&#160;Red Panda&#160;distribution range should be considered disjunct, not continuous. Reports, including a shot animal of undoubted identification and provenance, of a population on the Meghalaya Plateau of northeastern India, in anomalously tropical habitat (Choudhury 2001, Duckworth 2011) warrant investigation as soon as possible. Captive&#160;Red Pandas from the main distribution and habitat do not breed well in tropical conditions (Princee and Glatston in prep); the Meghalaya Red Pandas, if native, might be a separate taxon.</p><p> In Nepal&#160;Red Panda&#160;has been reported from 23 districts, but a number lack confirmed specific records. A further district, Darchula, contains suitable habitat but so far lacks any Red Panda reports. The westernmost global reports are from the Api Nampa Conservation Area and Khaptad in far western Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), but specific verifiable records there have not been traced since the 2010 PHVA,&#160;even though local people had affirmed Red Panda in these areas in the recent past. Two post-PHVA surveys failed to find the species in either area (H.P. Sharma pers. comm. 2011,&#160;A. Thapa pers. comm. 2014). The westernmost confirmed records are from Kalikot and Jumla at about 81°E (Dangol 2014); both are west of the formerly accepted range. In Bhutan it is found in 13 districts (Haa, Thimphu, Paro, Punakha, Wangdiphodrang, Gasa, Trongsa, Zhemgang, Bumthang, Mongar, Lhuntse, Trashigang and Trashiyangtse); high-elevation areas in other districts (Chukha, Tsirang, Dagana, Samtse and Samdrupjongkhar) require further surveys (Dorjii <em>et al. </em>2012). In India it is found in only three states: Sikkim, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh. In Myanmar it is known only from the northernmost state, Kachin, and is locally distributed even there (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). In China it is found in three provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan and Tibet. Sichuan is its main homeland. In this province its range extends through the Minshan and Liangshan to Qionglai and the Lesser and Greater Xiangling mountains (Wei <em>et al</em>.1999, 2011). It is believed to be extinct in the rest of its historical range in China, e.g. Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces (Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999). The Xiaoxiangling population appears isolated from the other <em>A. f. styani </em>population(s). It is a small population and represents a different genetic type that should be considered as a separate conservation unit (Hu <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda was&#160;stated to inhabit Lao PDR by Cheminaud (1942) and Deuve (1972). Re-examination of Cheminaud (1942) reveals many significant internal inconsistencies and flaws. Hence, there is no evidence that Red Panda has ever occurred in Lao PDR (Duckworth 2011).<br/> <br/> Red Panda occurs in a narrow altitude band. Roberts and Gittleman (1984) gave a range of 2,500–4,000 m asl. Prater (1948) mentioned occurrence down to 1,500 m asl and Choudhury (2001) gave a typical range of 1,500–4,800 m asl, up to nearly 5,000 m asl in the summer. However all recent publications, excepting those discussing animals from Meghalaya, support the Roberts and Gittleman range as that typically occupied, notwithstanding sporadic reports above 4,000 m asl and down to 2,300 m asl. The occupied altitude varies across the range. This might result from any of: disturbance at lower altitudes; time of year of assessment (several authors indicate that Red Pandas migrate seasonally up and down the mountainside; e.g., Yonzon and Hunter 1991); aspect (with animals occurring higher on the warmer south-facing slopes); and potentially other factors.<br/> </p>","Red Panda is taken for various purposes including wild meat, medicine, pelts and pets. Levels of offtake are not well documented; nor are trends in offtake or geographical patterns of harvest and use. It has been&#160;suggested that the rising numbers in the internet pet trade in China are captive-bred, but this remains&#160;to be confirmed.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Red Panda is included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I (www.cites.org). It is listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972, the highest protection possible for a species in India (Choudhury 2001). It is also legally protected in Bhutan, China (where it is classed as a Category II species under the Wild Animal Protection Law; Wei <em>et al</em>. 1999a), Nepal (Glatston 1994) and Myanmar (by the Wildlife Act of 1994). In China, the species is Red Listed nationally as 'Vulnerable' under A2ace. In the most recent Red List for Nepal (Jnawali&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012), Red Panda is considered to be 'Endangered' under C2a(i),&#160;<br/> <br/> In Myanmar it is found in at least three protected areas: Hkakaborazi National Park, Hponkanrazi Wildlife Sanctuary and Emaw Bum proposed National Park. It is difficult to determine how much of the Red Panda’s range in the country these protected areas cover. Hunting and, in Emaw Bum, logging are widespread within their confines.<br/> <br/> In Bhutan it is found in the following protected areas: Jigme Dorji, Thrumshingla and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Parks, Bumdeling and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuaries, Toorsa Strict Nature Reserve, biological corridors connecting these reserves, and the biological corridor connecting Thrumshingla and Royal Manas National Parks. It has also been recorded in the Royal Botanical Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Wangchuck Centennial Park (Dorji <em>et al</em>. 2012). Potential Red Panda habitat in the country modelled using MAXENT and ArcGIS 9.3 revealed 46% of predicted Red Panda habitat is under protected areas (PAs), 16% is in biological corridors and 38% lies outside the PA system. However, even protected areas are subject to activities such as road construction, livestock grazing, subsistence agriculture (slash-and-burn in some areas), collection of forest resources such as timber and NTFPs, and domestic dog presence.<br/> <br/> In India it is found in 19 protected or otherwise managed&#160;areas: Lachung Reserve Forest, Kanchendzonga National Park (NP), Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary,&#160;the buffer and transition area of the latter two,&#160;Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS), Pangolakha WLS, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary, Singalila NP, Neora Valley NP, Kamlang WLS, Eaglesnest WLS, Zemithang Valley Community Forest, Nuranang Valley Community Forest, Mehao WLS, Mandla-Phudung CF, Anjaw Reserve forest, Mechuka-West Siang CF, Mouling NP and Dibang WLS. It might also inhabit Taley Valley WLS, Pakhui WLS and Sessa Orchid Sanctuary. These protected areas cover about one-third of the species’s total potential habitat in India (Choudhury 2001). In the 2013&#160;Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA)&#160;workshop, 22 protected areas (outside Meghalaya) were identified as having potential habitat for Red Panda, some with only very small areas. Furthermore, the workshop participants identified medium to high levels of threat in these areas from&#160;two or more of development activities; fire; herders; firewood and non-timber forest product collection; illegal trade/'accidental' hunting; dogs (very prevalent); refuse; and habitat reduction. In Arunachal Pradesh (the state believed to have the largest Red Panda population in India) around 60% of the forest is under community ownership rather than having PA status. Also in Sikkim, 60% of potential Red Panda habitat falls outside the PA system. Enforcement of protective legislation, especially outside protected areas, is almost non-existent (Choudhury 2001).</p><p> China has 46 protected areas containing Red Panda (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2011), covering about 65% of the species’s habitat in China. Poor law enforcement in PAs was listed as a problem during the 2012 PHVA workshop (Wei <em>et al</em>. 2014). Livestock grazing and collection of non-timber forest products occur widely in these areas.<br/> <br/> Red Panda has been confirmed in nine of Nepal’s PAs: Sagarmatha NP; Makalu Barun NP; Langtang NP; Rara NP; Kangchenjunga Conservation Area (CA); Annapurna CA; Gaurishankar CA; Manaslu Conservation Area; and Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve. In all these PAs, habitat loss and degradation, poaching and dog problems and developmental activities have been rated as moderate to severe by participants in the Red Panda PHVA workshop (Jnawali <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Currently there is a Global&#160;Species&#160;Management Plan (GSMP) for Red Pandas held in zoos around the world. This plan is closely allied to&#160;current field&#160;conservation efforts. The three PHVAs were largely the initiative of, and funded by, the zoo community. The aims of the GSMP are to contribute both directly and indirectly to Red Panda conservation by: providing a genetically and demographically sustainable and behaviourally competent back-up population for the wild population; holding the potential to supply individuals for genetic or demographic supplementation or reintroduction programmes; educating and the raising of public awareness of Red Panda, its uniqueness and conservation needs; and providing financial, technical, scientific and other support and expertise to the planning and implementation of <em>in situ</em> conservation and research &#160; <br/> <br/> Priority conservation actions fall into four main categories:<br/> <br/> 1. <u>To protect against habitat loss</u>: improve and manage Red Panda habitats (including within corridors); improve connectivity, including across international borders; balance developmental activities by promoting eco-friendly and sustainable development with minimal impact on Red Panda habitat; increase areas under protection; implement better Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) for all development programmes; engage political willingness and win support;  develop and implement landscape-level conservation policy, identifying unprotected Red Panda habitat and &#160;making legal provision for the declaration of Red Panda Community Conservation Areas.<br/> <br/> 2. <u>To reduce habitat degradation</u>: restore degraded habitats, plant bamboo; regulate tourism by the use of entry permits; zone PAs to define&#160;restricted-access zones in core areas for Red Pandas, facility  zones, and resource use zones, with restricted visitor access during the breeding season (set quotas for&#160;non-timber forest products); educate, sensitise, and promote community participation to reduce and mitigate threats to Red Panda and its habitat; promote the use of alternative energy and building materials; provide sustainable livelihoods; enhance range-land management, using native species; reduce livestock numbers, especially of&#160; unproductive breeds; develop an integrated agriculture, pasture and  agroforestry system; develop proper rubbish disposal systems; improve community stewardship in natural  resources management; improve fire-fighting, in part by training communities, developing a national fire fighting strategy, ensuring PA&#160;management plans include comprehensive coverage of forest fire (the implementation of a fire strategy including forest fire alert and monitoring system, forest fire mapping and zoning, provision of fire fighting equipment, and controlled burning to prevent fires).<br/> <br/> 3. <u>To reduce deaths of Red Pandas:</u>&#160;strengthen law enforcement and improve physical protection; enhance transboundary cooperation on both of the former; strengthen coordination/collaboration between  line agencies and other stakeholders; implement a reward and punishment system both for  communities and forest department; establish anti-poaching units (in community forests and PAs) with capacity building for front-line, anti-poaching staff; train customs officials; reintroduce captive-bred individuals to reinforce local populations; formulate a dog management plan to control, sterilise and vaccinate dogs; engage army personnel in border bases to keep their dogs in check and not let them roam free in Red Panda areas.</p><p> 4. <u>To improve awareness</u>: design and implement a dedicated awareness programme using radio, pamphlets, posters, and documentary film; secure adequate funding; improve conservation education (with a focus on Red Pandas) in schools; establish/strengthen Green Force Clubs; implement a Red Panda research programme, identifying priority research topics, and including regular monitoring of its habitat; develop a trans-national ‘Project Red Panda’.<br/> </p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Additional major threats include deforestation as a result of agricultural and large-scale livestock encroachment, human settlements, selective logging of hardwoods, and human-induced fires (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;In Parque Nacional Nombre de Dios, the major threat is habitat destruction from are large-scale cattle ranching, small-scale oil palm plantations in the lower elevations (0-100 m asl), small-scale cacao plantations, selective logging for valuable hardwoods followed by clear-cutting, human-induced fires, and the building of roads (L. Herrera and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).&#160;The reform to the Ley de Protección de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Artículos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).<br/><br/>Climate change is also considered to be a threat. Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Honduras (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).","It is infrequently encountered, and it is often only single individuals that are found (J.

These authors report that it is found in home gardens, but this is considered to refer to isolated houses within forest rather than true cultivated areas. It is arboreal and generally found on moss-covered tree trunks, but has also been observed on low bushes, cardamom plants and lianas (Somaweera and Somaweera 2009). Females lay 2-4 eggs in a clutch (Somaweera and Somaweera 2009). This region receives more than 2,000 mm of precipitation each year.","This species is restricted to the Knuckles mountain range, most of which is currently not protected or subject to conservation management  (Bahir and Surasinghe 2005), and which has largely been converted to tea, pine and rubber cultivation. In the 1960s, the vast majority of the  remaining forest in the Knuckles Hills was underplanted with cardamom.  This process has left the canopy in good condition, but the regeneration  of natural forest has been almost completely inhibited  (Manamendra-Arachchi and Liyanage 1994), and active management of cardamom plantation - including illegal burning - and the removal of understorey and small trees for fuel are ongoing. Tourist development is ongoing, often illegally within former cardamom plantations. Localized landslides in forest, a consequence of water diversion and clearance of forest at higher elevations, disturb or destroy this lizard's habitat. Invasive mist flower (<em>Ageratina riparia</em>)&#160;is expanding through cardamom plantations into otherwise natural forest, reducing the availability of oviposition sites, and the species is rare within or absent from areas where this plant has become established. This species is most common in moist, high elevation forest where the impacts of drought, especially in the drier north, are likely to be most pronounced. Forest dieback (the causes of which remain poorly-understood but have been linked to lead pollution - Ranasinghe et al. 2009) has been observed at known localities (N. Perera pers. comm. 2019). The Knuckles Range is a major locality for pet trade collection, and habitat destruction has been observed in forested areas as a result of efforts to collect this and other species.","This species is still fairly common in natural habitat and cardamom plantations.

There are continuing declines in the area of occupancy (AOO), EOO, habitat quality and the number of mature individuals, inferred as a result of these threats.&#160;</p>","This species typically inhabits small clear shaded rainforest streams flowing over mixed rock, sand, gravel and log debris. They are often found in deeper pools in area of high flow and swim near the surface to midwater depth. This species presumably feeds on terrestrial invertebrates taken from the surface. This species has been found to sometimes school with other rainbowfish species. Presumably this species breeds from August to October, with females depositing batches of eggs amongst root masses.<br/><p>The species has extremely specialised habitat requirements (Barclay and Martin 2013; Hammer <em>et al. </em>2018). It is found only in small tributary streams of Cooper and Hutchinson Creeks. There is only one record (two individuals) from the main reach of these streams and it appears that the species avoids the main stream channels possibly because of increased habitat instability and increased predatory pressure from larger fish species in those areas. The streams where it occurs are small (&lt;5 m wide and generally less than 1 m deep), clear and shaded rainforest streams which have permanent flow charged from springs on the nearby Thornton Peak (one of the highest rainfall sites in Australia). Substrates in the area include granite boulders and alluvium deposits of gravel and sand, with no instream aquatic vegetation.<br/><br/>The species is most common in stream reaches closest to the foothills/plains interface. It congregates in high flow areas, such as areas immediately up or downstream of riffles or small waterfalls, where it has been observed feeding on terrestrial invertebrates on the surface, or capturing small prey swept by in the current. Local water extraction could alter flow regimes.</p>","<p>This species has an extremely small population size and occupied area. This in itself could lead to a rapid extinction event if a major local perturbation was experienced.</p><p>Permanent stream flow appears to be a critical habitat requirement for this species. Any reduction or loss of permanent stream flow could be a serious, potentially catastrophic threat to populations. This threat could occur due to climate change, extended drought, excessive water extraction, or most likely a combination of these effects (i.e. demand for water is greatest in times of low rainfall and streamflow, especially during drought). Regulated and unregulated water extraction activities occur on all sites.</p>  <p>Known populations occur on private land, including hobby farms, tourist developments and small scale horticulture, although much of the riparian zone in these areas is maintained in a natural rainforest condition (canopy at least). Landuse change/clearing and introduced terrestrial species like pigs are considered as threats. Pigs destroy bankside vegetation and modify bankside and in stream soil structure, leading to erosion during flood events and siltation of habitats.</p>  <p>There are currently no exotic or translocated species populations in the areas where this fish occurs. However, exotic species such as Tilapia, and translocated native species such as grunters (<em>Hephaestus</em> spp.) have been widely introduced in the Wet Tropics bioregion and are likely to threaten <em>Cairnsichthys</em> populations if they became established in the area.

Most eggs are laid in late May, and hatch mostly in mid to late July. Chicks fledge from November to December (ACAP 2012)<strong></strong>. In any given year, a large proportion of the population skip breeding; however, there is no discernible pattern to this behaviour, although it maybe linked to El Niño events (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Skipped breeders have lower survival rates, possibly owing to differences in the 'fitness' of individuals. Juveniles return to the colony as young as three years, but the age of first breeding is 7.5 years (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2015a)<strong></strong>. During incubation and chick-rearing, satellite-tracking data indicate foraging principally on the continental slope off the West Coast of South Island, but birds regularly visit Cook Strait, the Chatham Rise and Fiordland, and frequently forage in the mid-Tasman sea (Freeman <em>et al.</em> 1997, 2001)<strong></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding </em>They nest on densely forested hills at 20-250 m. Burrows are usually concentrated in areas where the ground is relatively open, and where take-off areas are close by. This is one of the few remaining petrels still nesting on mainland New Zealand, possibly due to more aggressively resisting attacks from land-based predators (Brooks 2011). <strong>Diet</strong> Fisheries waste is an important dietary component, perhaps forming more than half of solid food fed to chicks during the hoki fishing season (Freeman 1998)<strong></strong>. Subsequent satellite tracking studies have suggested that dietary analysis over-estimates the amount of food scavenged from trawlers and that the species continues to forage over wider areas than those occupied by the hoki fishery. Even individuals known to forage at fishing fleets acquire a large proportion of their food elsewhere (Freeman <em>et al. </em>2001, Freeman and Wilson 2002)<strong></strong>.<br/><p></p>","<p>The Westland Petrel is at risk from introduced species. A population of feral pigs has established within 20km of the breeding colonies, leading to concerns that, if the pigs discover the colonies, they will predate adults and cause habitat degradation, an issue that is exacerbated by their difficulty of eradication (Waugh and Wilson 2017). Feral dogs are present at locations very close to the breeding colonies, and vagrant dogs have killed petrels at the colonies previously (Waugh and Wilson 2017). Other predatory introduced mammals sighted in and around the colonies during 2010-2016 include Brushtail Possums, stoats <em>Mustela ermine</em> and rats <em>Rattus</em> spp. Nevertheless, productivity is relatively high, with around 65% of eggs laid fledging chicks (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2015, Waugh and Wilson 2017), suggesting that their presence may not hinder breeding success. Cats <em>Felis catus</em> are considered a more significant threat and most chick deaths recorded in the 1990s were attributed to cat predation (Wilson 2016), however the levels of predation appear low and do appear to be causing a population decline.</p>  <p>Habitat loss and degradation is also a threat. In the past, farming may have destroyed some habitat, but presently the colonies are situated on land that is too steep and difficult to access for agriculture. In 2014 tropical storm Ita destroyed or damaged up to half of the area of assessed colonies, which contained up to 75% of the breeding population (Waugh <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2015). Severe erosion following the storm continues to cause the loss of burrows (Waugh and Wilson 2017).</p>  <p>At sea these petrels overlap considerably with fisheries (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2018) and their ecological niche widens in El Niño years, indicating that food type is affected by climatic variation (Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2018). Non-breeders, which spend considerable time off South America, demonstrated reduced survivorship compared to breeding individuals. This is thought to be due to the effects of bycatch, both commercial and subsistence. The behaviourally (and visually) similar Black Petrel is killed as bycatch in artisanal fisheries off Ecuador and Peru (Mangel 2012) indicating that small-scale fisheries may be a significant source of mortality. Bycatch also occurs within the foraging range of breeding birds, and the species is considered at high risk of adverse population effects here also (Richard and Abraham 2015).</p>  Human exploitation is likely to occur, with equipment used to extract chicks from burrows found in 2011, but any take is considered likely to be very limited (Waugh and Wilson 2017). The 'fallout', attraction of petrels (especially fledglings) to lights at night, may be an important threat for the species, as it causes mortality through direct collisions and grounding, although the level of mortality is unknown (Waugh and Wilson 2017).<p></p>","The most recent estimate of population size is 2,954-5,137 annual breeding pairs (Wood and Otley 2013), but given that not all individuals breed each year this is likely to be an underestimate for the number of mature individuals. Assuming that 25% of breeding age birds may skip breeding in any one year (as derived from long-term data sets on similar species) (B. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 2012), the population size is estimated at 7,877-13,698 mature individuals, rounded here to 7,900-13,700 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Following the tropical storm Ita in 2014, there was considerable damage to the breeding area, with the loss or damage of up to 50% of the major colonies, which contain up to 75% of the breeding population (Waugh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015b). Fortunately, the storm occurred before the laying period and so adults may not have been killed in their nests, unless they were visiting prior to breeding (which some birds have been reported to do) (S. Waugh&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016), and some birds have moved between impacted colonies (S. Waugh&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Therefore, the level of destruction may not equate to any decline in population, and no population data subsequent to the storm are yet available, though surveys are currently underway (S. Waugh&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016).",Unknown,"<em>Procellaria westlandica</em> breeds in the densely forested coastal foothills near Punakaiki, South Island, <strong>New Zealand </strong>(Best and Owen 1976).

It prefers intact forest and can be found on forest edge, but not in degraded habitats. Breeding takes place by direct development and the species is not dependent upon water.","The main threat is loss of habitat for subsistence and small-scale agriculture, cattle grazing, logging and human settlement.

The cultivation of cardamom, coffee, and flowers is taking place within the boundaries of Parque Nacional Cusuco and Reserva de Merendón (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Another major threat is an increase in intentional human-induced fires for clearing of habitat for agriculture (J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019). Increasing human settlements and selective logging are causing habitat loss within the parks (J. Kolby, F. Castañeda, J.M. Solís, L. Herrera pers. comm.

Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (<em>e.g</em>. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). While the presence of this fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further.

Another threat includes the construction of several small-scale hydroelectric dams (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). The reform to the Ley de Protection de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Articulos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). There is a proposal to shift the core part of the refuge (which currently is at 1,250 m asl) upslope, which would create a much larger buffer zone where habitat conversion can progress unabated (C.

Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout this species' range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019).

K. Herzog <em>in litt</em>. 1999, 2007). The conversion of native vegetation into Eucalyptus plantations, combined with the destruction of native vegetation and high grazing pressure, has caused hydrological changes leading to massive soil erosion&#160; and landslides (S.

The current known range of this species is relatively restricted, with an extent of occurrence of around 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>, but the number of locations is uncertain as it occurs in a number of tributary creeks with diverse threats including pollution from human settlements and invasive species. It is likely that more than 50% of occurrences are impacted by threats from human settlements such as from domestic and agricultural pollution, so there are probably ongoing declines in habitat quality. This species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened, as if current threats intensify this species would qualify for a threatened category. The identity of the specimens in the Digul also need verification.","This species occurs in both turbid lowland rivers and small, clear mountain tributaries between elevations of about 50-600 m. It is most commonly encountered in high elevations in rocky streams with variable flow in mountainous terrain. It can reach a maximum size of 13.5 cm SL (G.R.

There is also oil and gas exploration and production which could potentially threaten the creek habitat of this species. Invasive species such as snakeheads (Channidae)&#160;have been recorded in the area which could potentially threaten this species. Landslides, if they occur, would impact individual creek communities of this species.

Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden <em>et al</em>. 2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed in parts of its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (<em>e.g</em>. droughts) (Honduras and Guatemala Red List Assessment Workshops 2019).","This is a poorly known species. It is apparently extremely rare and difficult to find as it lives in the forest canopy (J.M. Solís and F. Castañeda pers. comm. March 2019). The population is probably in decline and may no longer occur at the type locality because its habitat has been completely destroyed&#160;(J.M. Solís and F. Castañeda pers. comm. March 2019).&#160;In 2009, an adult was observed in Cortesito in&#160;Parque Nacional Cusuco&#160;and in 2014, a sub-adult at Guanales Camp in Parque Nacional Cusuco (J.M. Solís and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019). In September 2018, the species was recorded at Cerro del Mono, Zacapa, Guatemala (C. Vásquez-Almazán pers. comm. August 2019).",Decreasing,"This species was formerly only known from Quebrada Grande in Parque Nacional Cerro Azul Copán, Department of Copán, Honduras (Wilson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1985), but it may have been extirpated from this site.

This is compounded by the likelihood that governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within two or arguably three generations time, that derivatives of this species are used in traditional medicine in China, both legally and illegally, and being promoted as a means of economic growth in the country and along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which could increase demand for the species and its parts, and there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives are effective, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest.<br/><strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/>Currently, only Hong Kong and Taiwan, and potentially Bhutan, are parts of the range where overexploitation is not thought to be a threat to the species.","<p>This species is found in a wide range of habitats, including primary and secondary tropical forests, limestone, bamboo, broad-leaf and coniferous forests, grasslands and agricultural fields (Chao 1989, Gurung 1996). The species digs its own burrows, or enlarges passages made by termites (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005. Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Mro hunters in Bangladesh reported that a pangolin can excavate up to 15 burrows in a single night (presumably feeding burrows) and that resident burrows can extend up to 10m deep (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). This study also revealed that like the Indian Pangolin, the Chinese Pangolin will create an earthen wall once in a resident burrow which likely aids in predator avoidance (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Indications are that home ranges are relatively large. In Taitung, Taiwan, the home range of a male was estimated 96.0 ha (100% MCP) or 66.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel; n = 1) and 14.3-30.3 ha (100% MCP) or 15.9~19.6 ha (90% Fixed Kernel) for females (n = 6) (Lin, 2011) </p>  <p>The Chinese Pangolin is solitary, primarily nocturnal (sometimes crepuscular), and largely terrestrial although it is fully capable of climbing trees and, like other pangolins, swims well (Heath and Vanderlip 1988; Chao 1989). Little is known about the species' life history, although in China (including Taiwan [Province of China]), young (normally one and occasionally two) are reportedly born from August to February (Allen and Coolidge 1940, Liu and Xu 1981, Shi and Wang 1985, Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al.</em> 1993, Chin<em> et al.</em> 2011). Hunters in Viet Nam reported that they never find this species in trees and it seems likely that it is far more terrestrial than the more arboreal Sunda Pangolin (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p>Lin (2011) reported that there are two type of burrows that Chinese Pangolin use, namely feeding burrows and resident burrows. Feeding burrows are created by feeding on subterranean termites and are mainly used once. Lin found no statistically significant difference between the frequency of forest and more open habitats. Resident burrows are used for shelter and resting and sleep. A male pangolin can occupy ~80 resident burrows in its home range and a female has ~30-40 resident burrows. Different individuals may use the same resting burrow but very rarely on the same day.</p>  <p>Sun <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported the nursing period of the wild Chinese Pangolin was 157 days. The infant pangolin was observed exiting the nursing burrow alone at 11 weeks old and exploring behaviors such as s soil scraping and licking were recorded. In addition, the exploring behaviours were observe while the mother had left the burrow. The growth rate of was estimated at a constant rate of 1.2 cm/week during the nursing period, which was much faster than the only record from a hand-reared individual (0.7 cm/week; see Sun <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>  <p>The diet consists of ants and termites and it has been noted that in China, there appears to be a close correlation between the Chinese Pangolin's distribution and that of two termite species (<em>Coptotermes formosanus</em> and <em>Termes</em> (<em>Cyclotermes</em>) <em>formosanus</em>) which are assumed to form a major component of the diet (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Individuals are prey selective but known prey species include <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes, Camponotus mitis, C. nicobarensis, C. variegatus dulcis, Polyrhachis demangei, Aphaenogaster exasperata, Crematogaster dohrni</em>, and termite species <em>Macrotermes barneyi</em> : this is based on analysis of stomach contents (see Lee <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p><br/></p>","The primary threat is indiscriminate hunting and poaching, both targeted and untargeted, for local and international use, with the latter primarily driven by demand in China, and the species is subject to very heavy collection pressure across much of its range (Wu and Ma 2007, Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018). As has occurred historically, exploitation for nutritional, medicinal and spiritualistic purposes takes place locally (Anon 1999, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017, D'Cruze et al. 2018). However, evidence suggests that local use is now frequently forgone in favour of entering animals into national and international trade given their high financial value (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thapa 2013, MacMillan and Nguyen 2014). International use involves trafficking of the species and its derivatives despite the species being included in Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated that between 2000 and 2013 international trafficking in this species potentially involved ~50,000 individuals, though the actual number between 2000 and 2018 is higher (see Challender <em>et al.</em> 2019). In China and Viet Nam, the meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat for which affluent consumers are willing to pay high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in traditional medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (e.g., Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission, 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Other threats include infrastructure development, habitat loss and fragmentation, and pesticide use. In China, major developments including hydropower stations and mining also pose a threat.<br/>Taiwan and Hong Kong are exceptions where populations are not threatened by heavy hunting or poaching. The threats here include predation by feral dogs, roadkill and development, i.e. conversion of land for human use. In Taiwan, research suggests that Chinese Pangolins can become trapped in burrows or tree hollows, and is a cause of mortality, as is their capture in gin traps (Sun<em> et al.</em> 2019).<strong></strong><em></em>","<p>There is very little information available on population levels at any level (local, national or global) with few exceptions, and there is a paucity of research on abundance. This species is rarely observed, principally due to its increasing rarity, but also because it is secretive, solitary and primarily nocturnal. Evidence indicates it has been extirpated from parts of its current range as a result of over-exploitation, and is otherwise in steep decline across most of its range (Zhang 2008, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2016, Trageser <em>et al</em>. 2017). An exception is Taiwan where populations are suspected to be stable and potentially increasing.&#160;</p><p>China comprises the largest range state for this species, but populations have suffered severe declines in recent decades. Between the 1960-1980s up to 160,000 Chinese Pangolins were harvested annually in China for consumptive use resulting in all but the commercial extinction of the species by the 1990s (SATCM 1996, Zhang 2008). We <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated that populations declined by 88-94% between the 1960s and 1990s. In 2002, Wu <em>et al.</em> (2002) estimated populations in China to comprise 50,000-100,000 individuals, and in 2008 China’s then National Forestry Administration (NFA; though now National Forestry and Grassland Administration [NFGA]) estimated the national population to comprise 64,000 individuals. In contrast, Zhang<em> et al.</em> (2010) estimated the population in China in 2008 to comprise between 25,100 and 49,450 individuals. Also in 2008, the NFA (2008) estimated the population of Guangxi Province at 990 individuals with a density of 0.043 individuals/km². Interviews as part of research in China in recent years indicate this species is present but very rare in the border areas of Guangxi and Yunnan provinces (P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data), but at some sites (e.g., Dawuling Natural Reserve and Luofushan Natural Reserve), new burrows have not been seen in approaching twenty years indicating extirpation, and it is suspected that the species has been extirpated from Jiangsu, Henan and Shanghai Provinces (Wu <em>et al.</em> 2005, Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010). Between 2015 and 2016, more than 20 natural reserves were surveyed in southern China, but found no fresh burrows or live individuals (F. Zhang and Q. Wang, unpubl. data). Li et al. (2018) estimated that in eastern China (Fujian, Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces) the species’ range contracted by 52% between 1970s and 2000s, and populations are now largely confined to the Wuyi Mountains. On Hainan Island, extensive field research between 1997 and 2013 and interviews with hunters and local people indicate the species is of very low abundance and likely commercially extinct (Nash <em>et al. </em>2016, P.L.B. Chan, unpubl. data). In Hong Kong SAR, the species is present but is considered rare (G. Ades, pers. comm).<br/></p><p>In Taiwan (P.R. China) reports from the late 1980s and early 1990s suggest that populations of the nominal subspecies, the Formosan Pangolin were decreasing due to overexploitation from hunting and populations are were greatly reduced (Chao&#160; 1989, Chao <em>et al. </em>2005). After the Taiwanese government established the Wildlife Conservation Act in 1989 it appears that domestic consumption was significantly reduced. Evidence suggests populations are stable if not increasing in Taiwan and poaching is no longer the main threat. In southern Taiwan Pei (2010) estimated densities of 12-13 individuals/km². Kao <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated very approximately that the meta-population in Taiwan may comprise 15,000 individuals - though this estimate should be treated with extreme caution given significant knowledge gaps in parameters used to inform the models used to produce this estimate.</p><p>The species is very rare in Viet Nam. There are records from the past three decades from various protected areas, including Ba Na NP (Frontier Viet Nam, 1994), Cuc Phuong NP, Khe Net Nature Reserve and in Ke Go Nature Reserve (see Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). However, hunters in three areas of Viet Nam reported that although they still find the Chinese Pangolin it is extremely rare and populations have declined dramatically in the last two decades (i.e. in the 1990s and 2000s; see Newton <em>et al. </em>2008). In Khe Net and Ke Go, hunters reported that numbers of Chinese Pangolins were lower than those of the Sunda Pangolin probably because the former is easier to capture. If this is the case, then in places where both species occur, populations of the former are likely to be more heavily depleted (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008).</p><p>The species has been so heavily hunted in Lao PDR that field sightings are exceptionally rare. There were field sightings of an individual in Nam Theun Extension PNBCA (Proposed National Biodiversity Conservation Area) in 1994-1995, and an individual was seen in a village in Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA during the same period (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). There are unverified camera trap records from Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA in the early 2010s (Coudrat, 2017).<br/></p>  <p>In Bangladesh, Chinese Pangolins in the southeast may have disappeared (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017), however, there are still a few areas where they exist, such as within the Chittagong Hill Tracts where there is an absence of high-skilled hunters (Trageser <em>et al. </em>2017). In this area, there was consensus among hunters interviewed that populations in the south has been extirpated as a result of overexploitation from poaching since 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). Populations in Bangladesh are suspected to be declining.</p>  <p>This species was reported in the 1980s as common in the undisturbed hill forests of Arunachal Pradesh, however, little is known about the total population in India (Tikader 1983, Zoological Survey of India 1994). However, trafficking figures suggest this species is under severe hunting pressure in Northeast India (Misra and Hanfee 2000, Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015, D'Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/></p><p>Surveys conducted in the Royal Nagarjung Forest in Kathmandu, Nepal, in the early 1990s determined that there was a healthy population there (Gurung 1996). Nepal's population has been loosely estimated at 5,000 individuals but is suspected to be declining as a result of overexploitation (Jnawali <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p><p>There is little information on the status of the species in Thailand and Myanmar. There is a potential record from Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar form post-2000 (Rao <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, southern Bhutan, north and northeastern India, northeast, northwest and southeastern Bangladesh, northern and western Myanmar, to northern and Annamite regions of Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, part of northwestern Thailand, and across southern China. In China it occurs south of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) and on Hainan, Taiwan (P.R. China) and Hong Kong SAR. The species has likely been extirpated from parts of its current range, the limits of which are poorly known and may never be elucidated, due to high levels of exploitation historically. However, Taiwanese pangolin populations have stabilized in the last two decades and may even be increasing. The species occurs at high altitudes, especially in the southern and western parts of its range. In Nepal it has been recorded up to 3,000 m asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data), though also occurs at much lower altitudes, for example in Hong Kong and likely in the northeast of its range. Its latitudinal range is thought to overlap considerably with that of the Sunda Pangolin <em>Manis javanica</em>. Where this is apparent it is hypothesized that the Chinese Pangolin occurs in hills and mountains and the former is more generally found at lower altitudes (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). In Viet Nam interviews with hunters in 2007 (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008) suggested that the two species can be found in the same areas of forest, and that the differences between them are ecological, relating to diet and habitat use, rather than altitude, but ecological differences between the species have yet to be fully elucidated. <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>  <p>In China the species' distribution extends from the southern border as far north as the Changjiang, including on the island of Zhoushan at the mouth of the Changjiang (Allen and Coolidge 1940). Its distribution extends to the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Huibei, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Fujian, and in the Autonomous Regions of Guangxi Zhuang, Tibet, and Hainan Island. Zhai (2000) suggest the species occurs in Xichuan county of Henan province, which would be the only record north of the Changjiang, but they provide little detail and this requires verification. In Hong Kong, the species has been recorded from the central and northeast New Territories and Lantau Island, but not on the smaller outlying islands (Shek <em>et al.</em> 2007); it occurs here at low altitudes (Reels 1996). In Taiwan (P.R. China), the species occurs on the periphery of the Central Mountain Range, the Western Foothill Range, the Taoyuan Tableland, the Ouluanpi Tableland, the East Coast Mountain Range, the Tatun Volcano Group, Taipei Basin, Puli Basin, and the Pingtun Plain (Chao 1989, Chao <em>et al</em>. 2005). The upper limit of occurrence in Taiwan is around 2,000 m asl (Chao 1989).</p><p>Beyond China, the species is distributed in northern and central Vietnam, from Ha Giang province as far south as Quang Tri Province, but is absent from the northeast coast (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is found in Cuc Phuong National Park, Khe Net Nature Reserve, and Ke Go Nature Reserve, and Ba Na National Park (Newton<em> et al.</em> 2008). In Lao PDR, the species has been recorded in the north and central parts, but there are too few locality records to determine the geographic and altitudinal range of the species in the country with any accuracy (Timmins and Evans 1996; Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). The species is plausibly widespread in northern Myanmar, although there are few records and its exact distribution is not well known (Salter 1983, Corbet and Hill 1992). There is a record from Karen State in the early 2010s (Moo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Rao <em>et al.</em> (2005) report a sighting of the Sunda Pangolin in Hkakaborazi NP in northern Myanmar, but there is uncertainty over the species' identification (M. Rao, pers. comm.) and it is plausibly and perhaps more likely the Chinese pangolin. There are few records from Thailand but include those from Doi Inthanon (formerly Doi Angka) in Changwat, Chiang Mai (northern Thailand), sometime in 1937 and 1939 (Allen and Coolidge 1940) and Doi Sutep, Chiangmai (northern Thailand) in 1901.</p>  <p>In Bangladesh, the species occurs in northern, northeastern and southeastern parts of the country, including in the border areas with northwestern Myanmar and India’s Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram states. Two Chinese Pangolins were captured from northwestern Bangladesh in recent years but which is thought to be the result of flash flooding from India. The species has reportedly been extirpated from most protected areas in southeastern Bangladesh. However, it does occur in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (southeast), Lawachara National Park and adjacent protected areas (northeast), and Thakurgao (northwest) but has been extirpated from some areas due to poaching since around 2014 (Trageser <em>et al.</em> 2017). In northern Bangladesh, it may be restricted to the India-Bangladesh border area only (Trageser<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p>  <p>The species is marginally present in northern India e.g. Vamiki Tiger Reserve, Bihar (Maurya <em>et al.</em> 2018). There are photographic records of the species in Bihar and it has been recorded in northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, Sikkim and the northern part of West Bengal) (Tikader 1983, Zoological Society of India 2002, Srinivasulu and Srinivasulu 2012). Chinese Pangolins also exist in Kaziranga-Karbi-Anglong landscape and Manas-Bhutan landscape and there are recent (post-2015) camera trap records from Manas National Park, India (D. Lahkar, unpubl. data), and reports of the species being present near Sirohi Wildlife Sanctuary, Bunning Wildlife Sanctuary and Yangoupokpi-Lokchao Wildlife Sanctuary of Manipur, India (J. Sethy, unpubl. data). The species appears to be sympatric with the Indian Pangolin (<em>M. crassicaudata</em>)<em> </em>in the Neora Valley National Park (Mallick 2010) and Manas National Park (Lahkhar <em>et al.</em> 2018; Goswami and Ganesh 2014).</p>  <p>The species occurs in southern Bhutan (though potentially central and western areas only) and Nepal, where it is typically located between 555-1740 m Asl, though there are records from 3000m Asl (A. Khatiwada, unpubl. data). A nation-wide survey of pangolins (see DNPWC and DOF 2018) in Nepal unveiled the occurrence of Chinese Pangolin throughout Nepal largely distributed in human dominated landscapes outside the protected areas, though it does occur in protected areas as well. This suggests that Chinese Pangolins are distributed across eastern, central and mid-western Nepal and the Mid hills of central Nepal harbors likely strongholds for the species. It has been recorded as present in the lower elevation belt of the Kangchenjunga Conservation Area, the Gaurishankar and Annapurna Conservation Areas, Makalubarun, Sagarmatha, Chitwan, Parsa and Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Parks, the Salyan district in western Nepal (Khatiwada <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160; It has been also recorded in the Suklaphanta NP in southwest Nepal within the last four years and in Jajarkot district in mid-west Nepal (H.S. Baral, unpubl. data). In Nepal, its distribution appears to overlap with the Indian pangolin in the south and west. The Chinese Pangolin occurs from Inner Terai to hills and mountains while the Indian Pangolin is confined to lower altitudes; however, ecological differences between are not fully understood. &#160;</p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup>","<p>This species has been hunted at a local level historically, both for the consumption of its meat as a protein source, and for its scales for use as an ingredient in traditional medicines among other spiritual and ritualistic uses (Anon 1992, Zhang 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). It has also been subject to international trade historically. Based on trade data from CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, this has principally involved scales&#160;or traditional medicines containing scales, as well as skins between the 1970s and the year 2000 (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015; Heinrich <em>et al. </em>2016). However, following population declines in China up to the mid-1990s (see Zhang 2008), a heavy unrecorded and seemingly illicit international trade in live pangolins has occurred between Southeast Asia and China since which has involved this species (Li and Li 1998,&#160;Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Wu and Ma 2007). In the year 2000, CITES introduced zero export quotas for wild-caught specimens of this species traded for commercial purposes. Despite this, illegal trade has continued post-2000 which is largely driven by market demand in China and mainly involves live animals and scales originating from Southeast and South Asia based on available evidence (Wu and Ma 2007, Challender and Waterman, 2017). Trade in this species in particular appears to come from Myanmar (Challender and Waterman 2017). Although local use of pangolins also continues today, evidence suggests that this is often forgone in favour of selling the animals into trade, which is primarily destined to China (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008).&#160; </p>  <p>In China, as well as Viet Nam, pangolin meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury wild meat dish for which affluent consumers are willing to pay very high prices (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). This species also appears in both Chinese and Vietnamese traditional medicinal literature&#160;which prescribes the use of scales in medicines to treat skin conditions, improve blood circulation and to stimulate milk secretion in lactating women (Chinese Pharmacopeia Commission 2015). In China, pangolin scales also appear to be prescribed for these and other ailments, and cancer (Yu and Hong 2018), through designated outlets such as hospitals, but also through traditional medicine retailers, as in Viet Nam. Since 2009 the Chinese government has released an average of 26.6 tonnes of pangolin scales from (presumably) government stockpiles on to a legal market for scales in the county (CBCGDF 2016), and which are certified through a certification system. However, this mechanism is undermined by ongoing illegal trade and availability of scales in traditional medicines shops in China (Xu <em>et al.</em> 2016). Ongoing but illicit availability is also the case in Viet Nam (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>Other consumer countries include the United States which imported large quantities of derivatives including the Chinese Pangolin between 1985 and 20111 based on CITES trade data (Challender and Waterman 2017).</p><p>There is ongoing local use across the species' range though quantifying this across the species' range is challenging. In Bangladesh, tribal communities believe that the use of pangolin meat can reduce their illness and the scales can keep away evil spirits. Local physicians also sell the scales by promoting their supposed supernatural medicine value, occasionally in cities. Trade routes exist between Bangladesh and Myanmar and pangolins are trafficked along these routes, mainly destined to China. In Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal, scales are worshipped as an incarnation of God during Tihar festival and are kept in homes to avoid evil spirits (P. Kaspal, unpubl. data). In Nepal, jhakris, local traditional healers have been using the pangolin for its supposed medicinal benefits for generations, but it is only recently that a booming trade has developed around the species which is threatening the specie.

It does not tend to survive in degraded habitats, and is a species that breeds by direct development.","The major threats include deforestation as a result of agricultural and livestock encroachment, human settlements, logging, fires and landslides. In addition, chytrid infection has been reported for a lowland subpopulation (Puschendorf<em> et al</em>. 2006), but the direct effects of the infection in this species are as yet unknown (Townsend and Wilson 2016). In Texiguat, the major threats to this species include high rates of deforestation and encroachment in the wildlife refuge&#160; for extensive cattle ranching and coffee plantations, agricultural crops (e.g., beans, avocado), including in the core area, illegal selective logging for hardwoods, followed by clear-cutting along the same access routes (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Another threat includes the construction of several small-scale hydroelectric dams (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>In Parque Nacional Pico Bonito, the&#160;area from which this species was recorded is subject to extensive landslides which often severely impact the species habitat. Additional major threats include deforestation as a result of agricultural and large-scale livestock encroachment, human settlements, selective logging of hardwoods, and human-induced fires (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). There is a proposal to shift the core parts both the Parque Nacional Pico Bonito and Texiguat, which may create a much larger buffer zone where habitat conversion can progress unabated (C. Antúnez, J. Ramos Galdámez and J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019).<strong>&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In Campiro y Calentura, deforestation is a major threat in the northern part caused by increasing urbanisation (M. Solís pers. comm. March 2019). In Río Yaguala, within the area this species is found, it has been&#160;cleared for accessibility for a dam development (M. Solís&#160;pers. comm. March 2019). This subpopulation appears to be stable at present, however the area is currently unprotected (J.M.&#160;Solís&#160;pers. comm. March 2019). The reform to the Ley de Protección de la Actividad Caficultora y Cacaotera (Decreto 37-2016; Artículos I, V, VI) has incentivised the cultivation of coffee in national lands, including the core zones of protected areas, which is also increasing the alteration of primary forest (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong>By 1996 that most, if not all, streamside&#160;<em>Craugastor&#160;</em>known to occur above 900 m asl were thought to have disappeared in Honduras (Wilson and McCranie 1998). The reasons for the disappearances of this species at higher elevations remains unproven, although infection with chytridiomycosis together with the alteration of its habitat due to extensive landslides is a strong possibility (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;Species of the <em>Craugastor rugulosus</em> group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis has been confirmed in this species (Puschendorf <em>et al</em>. 2006), and is associated with their population declines.<br/><br/>Climate change is also considered to be a threat. Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabitat a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).","The lowland subpopulations appear to be common, but higher elevation subpopulations (above 900 m asl) have been noted to be severely reduced, as have all streamside <em>Craugastor</em>&#160;species above this elevation. A dying individual was observed with a high chytrid infection at 150 m asl in northern Parque Nacional Pico Bonito (Puschendorf <em>et al</em>. 2006). Multiple surveys in 2010, 2011, 2017-2019 have not recorded this species in the higher elevations, apart from eight individuals in Nombre de Dios National Park at 1,400 m asl in 2013 (J. Ramos Galdámez pers. comm. March 2019). It is common and frequently encountered below 900 m asl (J. Townsend, M. Solís and F.&#160;Castañeda&#160;pers. comm. March 2019). Due to ongoing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat, the population is suspected to be decreasing.",Decreasing,"This species was formerly only known from the&#160;Cordillera&#160;Nombre de Dios, Montaña La Muralla, and Montaña Texiguat in the departments of Atlántida, Colón, Yoro and Olancho in north-central Honduras, between 50-1,550 m asl.

The area from which this species was recorded is subject to extensive landslides (McCranie 2017); these often severely impact the&#160;habitat and, in turn, the species.&#160;During October 1998, torrential rains from Hurricane Mitch, aided by previous habitat destruction by humans, caused much larger landslides, some of which devastated parts of the Quebrada de Oro (McCranie 2017). Additionally, it is noteworthy to mention that by 1996 that all streamside <em>Craugastor</em> known to occur above 900 m asl were thought to have disappeared in Honduras (Wilson and McCranie 1998). <em>Ba</em><em>trachochytrium dendrobatidis</em>&#160;was recorded in two of the four anuran species collected along the Quebrada de Oro during 2003 (Puschendorf <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;Reasons for the disappearances of this species remains unclear, although infection with chytridiomycosis together with the alteration of its habitat due to extensive landslides is a strong possibility (McCranie 2017, Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>If this species is found to occur within Parque Nacional Pico Bonito, then additional major threats include deforestation as a result of agricultural and large-scale livestock encroachment, human settlements, selective logging of hardwoods, and human-induced fires (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).

Thus, sometime between August 1989 and February 1995 the population&#160;at the Quebrada de Oro completely crashed (McCranie and Castañeda 2007,&#160;McCranie 2017).&#160;However, additional surveys are needed in areas of the core zone of Parque Nacional Pico Bonito to confirm whether the species is extant at other sites and confidently declare this species Extinct (J.

Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabitat a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climate conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Wicaksono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Lyra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Neate-Clegg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events are being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaustein&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The emergence of the salamander chytrid fungus (<em>Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</em>, “<em>Bsal</em>”) as an amphibian pathogen has caused dramatic declines in European salamanders since its arrival in 2010 through the international pet trade (Feldmeier&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Honduras (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019).</span></span></span>","It is only known from its holotype.
