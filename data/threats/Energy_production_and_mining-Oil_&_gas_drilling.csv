507698,12695,Malaclemys terrapin,Vulnerable,A4acde,2019,2018-06-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>                 <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em>&#160;is assessed as Vulnerable due to observed threats documented in the past and projected into the future with ≥35% population declines of monitored populations resulting from overexploitation, accidental mortality as bycatch in commercial Blue Crab fisheries, coastal habitat loss due to development, principally the loss of limited nesting habitat, in addition to extensive estuarine saltmarsh loss, and ongoing subsidized nest predation by mesopredators (threats reviewed in Roosenburg 2004; Butler <em>et al</em>. 2018; Chambers and Maerz 2018; Roosenburg and Kennedy 2018). Overall, it is our assessment that <em>M. terrapin</em> has sustained range-wide population declines over the last 30 years (two generations) of 25-30% and that the rate of decline is predicted to continue at the same rate for another 15 years (one generation), or about a 10-15% further decline, for a total decline over three generations (45 years) of 35-45%. The species therefore meets the criteria for Vulnerable designation under criteria A4acde. <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> was last assessed in 1996, when it was evaluated as Near Threatened.<br/><br/>Documenting population declines for a long-lived species like <em>M. terrapin</em> is challenging and requires intensive, long-term sampling (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 2001). Female terrapins become sexually mature at 4-13 years and longevity may exceed 50 years. Using an average estimated generation time of 15 years, it is reasonable to examine trends in the terrapin population for the past 30 years (two generations) and project 15 years (one generation) into the future. Subpopulations for which long-term data are available show significant declines, upwards to 75% decrease in population size over 20 years in the two populations with long term data in South Carolina (Gibbons <em>et al</em>. 2001; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007), Maryland (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data), and 55% decline in a New York population over 20 years (R.L. Burke, unpubl. data). Other populations have high mortality rates due to anthropogenic causes (Wood and Herlands 1997; Avissar 2006; Szerlag and McRobert 2006; Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018) and, in some cases, a change in population structure has been observed (Roosenburg <em>et al.</em> 1997; Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is not possible to determine range-wide population declines over specific time periods other than to rely on anecdotal evidence suggesting that terrapins are now rarely encountered in areas where they were once relatively common (Kennedy 2018a,b).</p><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p></p></span>","<p>                      </p><p><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> is found in brackish coastal waters (salinity range = 0 to <a style=""mso-comment-reference: WMR_1;mso-comment-date:20161231T0810"">35</a>). Typical habitats include coastal regions, estuaries, lagoons, tidal creeks, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. In coastal estuaries supporting large watersheds, terrapins can occur far inland up to the terminal end of the salt wedge (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, Hudson River, and Pamlico Sound). Although <em>M. terrapin</em> is found in brackish water, periodic access to freshwater is necessary for long-term health, and populations in high salinity habitats actively seek and drink freshwater which is essential for neonate survival and growth (Dunson 1985; Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2009) and may be a contributing factor to the semi-terrestrial behavior of neonates to 3-year-olds.&#160;Hatchlings are exceptionally desiccation tolerant (Figueras <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The diet of <em>M. terrapin</em> consists largely of invertebrates, crustaceans, and mollusks (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995, 2018) and a variety of plant materials and algae (Tulipani 2015; Erazmus <em>et al</em>. 2018). In some populations terrapins are predators of the Salt Marsh Periwinkle (<em>Littoraria irrorata</em>), a snail that grazes on epiphytes that grow on Salt Marsh Cord Grass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>). Silliman and Bertness (2002) demonstrated through a series of experiments that when periwinkle predators were removed, periwinkles damage and kill cord grass, leaving a barren mudflat and increasing marsh erosion rates. Although terrapins were not removed or tested in this experiment, as a periwinkle predator they are frequently identified as a potential saltmarsh keystone species. This extrapolation suggests that healthy terrapin populations play a role in maintaining primary production in salt marsh ecosystems and stabilizing shoreline vegetation, thus reducing local erosion.<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> exhibits considerable variation in size, sexual size dimorphism, and reproductive output throughout its range. In general, along the Atlantic sea board there is a gradient of increasing body size, greater sexual dimorphism, later ages of maturity, and higher reproductive output with increasing latitude (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Gulf Coast populations do not conform to this latitudinal variation and are larger than their counterparts on the Atlantic Coast at the same latitude. Most comprehensive life history data come from long-term studies of populations in South Carolina, Maryland, and New York, with limited data from other parts of the range focused mostly on reproductive output and females. Nonetheless, the differences in morphological and life history traits contribute to different environmental stressors and management strategies relevant to terrapin populations throughout the range. Careful modeling is needed to compare reproductive traits among populations to assess how total annual reproductive output per individual varies along the latitudinal gradient.<br/><br/>Diamondback Terrapins under natural conditions exhibit high adult survivorship, low reproductive rates, and high egg/juvenile mortality characteristic of most temperate turtles (Mitro 2003). As a consequence of this suite of life history traits, increases in adult mortality result in declining populations (Congdon <em>et al</em>. 1993, 1994). Marked variation in life history traits can be attributed to a broad latitudinal distribution (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Females from northern populations mature later and at a relatively larger size than those from southern populations. Clutch size and body size appear to be somewhat correlated over the range; females from New York average 12.8 eggs per clutch (Burke <em>et al</em>. 2018), Maryland females may produce as many as 26 eggs per clutch (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data), and smaller females from more southern populations produce only 4–6 eggs per clutch (Seigel 1984). Average annual reproductive output depends on the number of clutches produced per season. In Chesapeake Bay populations, the average female may produce 1–3 clutches of about 13 eggs in a single nesting season (13–40 eggs/year) and detailed nesting data suggest that terrapins rarely forgo nesting annually, but the number of clutches per year may vary (Roosenburg and Dunham 1997). For detailed reviews of reproductive data, see Roosenburg (1994), Butler <em>et al</em>. (2006a, 2006b), Brennessel (2006), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Lovich <em>et al</em>. (2018).<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> demonstrates marked sexual dimorphism, most likely as a fecundity advantage (Carr 1952), with females being considerably larger, with maximum reported population mean female carapace length of 20.1 cm and male carapace length of 13.3 cm (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Female terrapins can reach weights over 2.5 kg in northern populations, but males rarely exceed 0.5 kg throughout the range (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). The maximum recorded size for an adult female, 32 cm carapace length, is much greater than that of males, 16 cm, from the same population, and the discrepancy between male and female size increases with latitude (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Female terrapins mature later and at a larger size than males. The resulting difference in body size is more pronounced in more northern populations. Size differences result in differences in jaw morphology and bite forces that likely contribute to resource partitioning (diet, habitat) between the sexes (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1999; Herrel <em>et al</em>. 2018). Throughout their geographic range, population means for hatchlings range from 25–38 mm in carapace length and 6.3–8.8 g in mass (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Maturity is reached at 4–13 years of age in females, and 2–7 years in males, depending on location (see summary in Brennessel 2006). Longevity may be greater than 40 years for some individuals; marked adult females have been recaptured 30 years after their initial capture as adults (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation time has not been reported in the published literature; available information indicates that it ranges from 13 to 20 years and also increases with increasing latitude (Mitro 2003; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation times in more southern populations are shorter, as maturity at lower latitudes is attained several years earlier (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Nesting requirements vary among subpopulations (Roosenburg 1994, Butler <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> embryos have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), with females produced at higher incubation temperatures, generating&#160;important differences between populations (Jeyasuria <em>et al</em>. 1994; Burke and Calichio 2014). The challenges of climate change, combined with sea level rise and nesting habitat loss (Michener <em>et al</em>. 1997, Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017) could potentially affect sex ratios in populations. The conservation challenges associated with climate change and TSD as it affects sex ratios generates new concerns for the effective management of terrapin populations throughout their range, particularly when integrated with the nesting habitat loss due to development (Seigel and Gibbons 1995).<br/><br/>Terrapin hatchlings in northern parts of the range also facultatively overwinter in the nest, suggesting that the nesting environment is critical habitat throughout the entire year (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2018; Graham 2009; Kitson 2016). Post-emergence neonate habitat is poorly known, but after emergence, some hatchlings move to shallow, self-excavated hibernacula in upland areas (Draud <em>et al</em>. 2004, Duncan and Burke 2016) before moving into intertidal marshes where they may remain semi-terrestrial well into their second growing season (Muldoon and Burke 2012). Adult terrapins hibernate communally in depressions in the mud at the bottom of tidal creeks and embayments protected from prevailing weather (Haramis <em>et al</em>. 2011), in undercut banks within the tidal zone, or burrow into creek banks (Yearicks <em>et al</em>. 1981). Southern subspecies (e.g., <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em>) may be active throughout the winter.</p><br/><p></p>","<p>                      </p><p>                     </p><p>Four main factors pose the most significant threats to <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> populations: 1) mortality of juveniles and adults in crab pots and mostly nesting females on roads, 2) loss of nesting and juvenile habitat to development and sea level rise, 3) the effect of subsidized predators at nesting beaches (Roosenburg 1991; Siegel and Gibbons 1995; Feinberg and Burke 2003; Woodland et al. 2017), and 4) loss of estuarine saltmarsh and mangrove habitats throughout their range (Kennish 2001; Ner and Burke 2008; Gedan <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In states with a commercial Blue Crab (<em>Callinectes sapidus</em>) fishery, which includes almost the terrapin’s entire range, incidental drowning in crab pots is considered to be the major threat to <em>M. terrapin</em> (Butler <em>et al</em>. 2006; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Terrapins, attracted to the bait, enter through an underwater opening, become trapped, and drown within a few hours (Wood 1997; Roosenburg 2004; Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Small males and juveniles are caught more frequently than adult females due to the limitations on the size of the trap entrance. Wolak <em>et al</em>. (2010) suggested that high mortality in crab traps has led to selection on body size traits in a Chesapeake Bay population. Most studied populations where terrapins occurred with crab pots have skewed sex ratio biased toward females that have lower catch rates because of their larger size (Chambers and Maerz 2018).&#160;Crab pots remain the most prominent threat to terrapin populations and their ubiquitous use throughout the terrapin’s range and habitat hamper other conservation restoration efforts because the mortality caused by crab pots is so high.<br/><br/>Adult female terrapins are frequently struck and killed by motor vehicles while attempting to cross roads and motorways in search of nesting sites (Wood and Herlands 1997; Szerlag and McRobert 2006; Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011; Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018). Hatchling terrapins migrate to water after emerging from the nest and can get trapped in vehicular tire tracks left in the sand on nesting beaches. If the hatchlings are unable to escape, they may die of dehydration or be crushed by the next vehicle. Large female terrapins often bear scars from the propellers of motor boats; in the Chesapeake Bay region and in Jamaica Bay, New York, boat impacts are a significant source of mortality for this age class in areas with moderate to high boat traffic (Roosenburg 1991; R.L. Burke and Roe, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Although most states now have legislation that regulates the collection of <em>M. terrapin</em> (Hackney 2010; Nanjappa and Conrad 2011; Kennedy 2018a), this species is still taken commercially in parts of Louisiana. Commercial interest in terrapins remains high, primarily for trade and consumption in Asia or to Asian communities in North America. Hatchlings sell in pet markets of Hong Kong for $50-500 each depending on colouration (T. Leuteritz, pers. comm.). In 2006, the last year in which terrapins were legally harvested in Maryland, watermen reported a catch of 10,500 pounds of terrapins. Additionally, harvest of terrapins for turtle farms in the US and Asia is taxing wild populations and contributing to potential illegal harvest in states where they are currently protected. One such event resulted in the offtake of more than 3,000 females from a single population in New Jersey. Serendipitously, this event resulted in the closure of the commercial terrapin harvest in New Jersey.<br/><br/>One of the terrapin subspecies, <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em>, is considered endemic and endangered in its restricted range in southern Florida. Unless examined by expert terrapin biologists familiar with all the subspecies, <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em> could easily be traded unnoticed because of its similarity to the other subspecies. Similar to endangered map turtles, genus <em>Graptemys</em>, some of which also can only be recognized by experts, the trade of endangered terrapin subspecies is facilitated by the trade of the species in general. Furthermore, several states throughout the range have provided protected status to terrapins or restricted trade and harvest. These terrapins cannot be distinguished from terrapins that were collected from areas where they were legally harvested or from farm-produced individuals.<br/><br/>Habitat destruction poses a serious and ongoing threat to the species. The Diamondback Terrapin’s range is coincident with areas of dense human population (Ner and Burke 2008), and &gt;50% of original estuarine saltmarsh habitat in terrapin range has been lost over the last century (Kennish 2001). Coastal development, particularly salt marsh draining and shoreline armoring for residential or agricultural purposes, increased use of coastal waterways for commercial and recreational purposes, and loss of sand dunes (important nesting habitat) contribute to habitat loss and degradation which negatively affects terrapins (Isdell <em>et al</em>. 2015). Coastal development is particularly problematic because it frequently destroys nesting beaches (Roosenburg 1991; Roosenburg and Place 1995). Three consequences of development for terrapins are: 1) higher concentration of nesting habitat in remaining areas resulting in greater predation rates of nests, 2) alteration of incubation conditions potentially affecting survivorship and gender because of temperature-dependent sex determination, and 3) increased predation on adult females. Additionally, sea level rise due to climate change may have a severe impact on diamondback terrapin habitat including loss of nesting habitat, but more seriously the elimination of critical juvenile salt marsh habitat. Recent GIS modeling based on predicted sea level rise suggests substantial habitat loss during the next 50-100 years in Chesapeake Bay (Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Human-subsidized predators (i.e., native or introduced animals whose populations prosper as a result of association with humans and human-altered habitats) are another threat to turtle populations (Boarman 1997). Studies across the range have identified (locally introduced) Raccoons (<em>Procyon lotor</em>), Skunks (<em>Mephitis mephitis</em>), Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), feral Hogs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), and non-native Norway Rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) as major predators on the adults, juveniles, and eggs of <em>M. terrapin</em>, accounting for a nest predation rate of 92%, and emerging hatchling predation rate of up to 20% (Feinberg and Burke 2003; Draud <em>et al</em>. 2004; Muldoon and Burke 2012; Buzuleciu <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Finally, the impacts of various pollutants in heavily urbanized estuarine environments jeopardize terrapin populations. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), heavy metals and various insecticides and herbicides all potentially affect terrapins (Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2018). Many of these compounds have been discovered in terrapins and have been demonstrated to have deleterious effects on development, growth, and survival (Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2009; Holliday and Holliday 2011; Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Microplastics, which are both pollutants themselves and synergists with other pollutants, were found in the feces of eight of eight terrapins tested in Jamaica Bay, New York (R.L. Burke, unpubl. data).</p><p></p>","<p>In the early 1900s, populations of <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> were in danger of extinction due to intense commercial harvest for human consumption (Hay 1917). Although pre-harvest population data are lacking, many populations had recovered to some extent by the late 20th century and <em>M. terrapin</em> was listed as Lower Risk/Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List in 1996 (Kennedy 2018b). However, data from long-term studies (Avissar 2006; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Roosenburg 2004; Wood and Herlands 1997) suggest that many terrapin populations are again in decline. Effects that contribute to observed declines in well-studied subpopulations (ongoing habitat loss/degradation, crab pot mortality, subsidized nest predation, and road mortality) are ubiquitous and likely to have a similar effect throughout the terrapin’s range (Seigel and Gibbons 1995). Low recruitment due to high nest predation, juvenile and adult male mortality in crab pots and high adult female mortality from vehicle collisions and crab pots in southern populations are cause for alarm because population models suggest a stable population requires both modest recruitment and, most importantly, high adult survival (Roosenburg 2004; Mitro 2003).<br/><br/>In Kiawah, South Carolina, population estimates from a mark-recapture study of <em>M. terrapin</em><span class=""datalabel1""> suggest a decline of 75% over the last two decades (Gibbons <em>et al</em>. 2001; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). High male and juvenile mortality rates in this population, likely due to incidental drowning in crab pots, result in an increase in the proportion of large females in the population (Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). Similarly, crab pots have been suggested to cause female biased sex ratios (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) and potentially driving the evolution of male body size (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010) in Chesapeake Bay. Similar levels of decline have been observed in the adult female population during a 20 year population study in the Patuxent River of Chesapeake Bay. Factors contributing to the decline in the Patuxent population include commercial harvest, bycatch mortality in commercial fisheries, an oil spill, and nesting habitat loss (W.M. Roosenburg, <span class=""datalabel1"">unpubl<span class=""datalabel1"">.<span class=""datalabel1""> data<span class=""datalabel1"">).<br/><br/>Commercial and recreational use of crab pots continues to be the major contributing factor to the population declines from New Jersey to Texas (Bishop 1983; Wood 1997; Roosenburg 2004; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Seigel and Gibbons 1994; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Populations in Chesapeake Bay have female biased sex ratios due to the impact of crab pots (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) in addition to compensatory growth and changed size structure as a consequence of continued crab pot mortality (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent work has suggested that even a single crab pot in a tidal creek or local area can drive population declines (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In estuaries near Tuckerton,&#160;New Jersey, road mortality contributed to a significant decline in the number of adult females over 13 years (Avissar 2006). This demographic shift was not attributed to crab pot mortality because the site is closed to crabbing; however, a decline in large females is consistent with the observation that road mortality of nesting females had increased (Avissar 2006; Szerlag and McRobert 2006). A long-term study on the Cape May Peninsula of southernmost New Jersey documented 4,020 road kills during a 7-year period (Wood and Herlands 1997). As of 2011, the total number of roadkills at this study site has surpassed 10,000 adult females (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data). The terrapin population decline during this time is unknown, but is likely substantial because the area also has a significant commercial and recreational crab fishery (Wood 1997). Similarly in Georgia, small tidal creeks impacted by commercial crabbing and nearby roads had reduced terrapin populations relative to creeks more isolated from these threats (Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>New York’s largest terrapin populations inhabit the heavily-urbanized Jamaica Bay. Researchers observed over 2,000 nests on one island in this study area in 1998 (Feinberg and Burke 2003). Recruitment is low because annual nest predation rates, primarily by raccoons, vary from 92-100%. The number of nests laid per year declined 43% from 1999-2011 (Feinberg and Burke 2003; R.L. Burke, unpubl. data) and the nesting terrapin population has experienced a 55% decline from 1998 to 2017 (R.L. Burke and Roe, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Little is known about terrapin populations along the Gulf Coast. Historical accounts suggest large populations once existed in this part of the range, but overexploitation has reduced populations which are slow to recover in the face of heavy crabbing pressure (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Dauphine Island, Alabama, formerly supported a significant terrapin fishery which currently remains as a relic population (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Recent studies in Louisiana have discovered subpopulations in the Rockefeller National Wildlife Refuge and its adjoining bayous and in Barataria Bay, but detailed population and life history data are lacking from this area (Selman <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pearson and Wiebe 2018). Small populations are also known from Galveston Bay, Texas, but the combination of development and pollution has reduced the available habitat to a few small islands within the bay (V. Guillory, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Bermuda’s terrapin population is estimated at about 100 individuals and recruitment is low, caused by low nest success (Outerbridge 2014). The reasons for developmental failure are not known, but could be due to insecticides and herbicides used around the only wetland where terrapins are found (M.E. Outerbridge, pers. comm.).</span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Malaclemys terrapin </em>inhabits the estuarine coastal waters of the United States along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Corpus Christi, Texas (Iverson 1992; TTWG 2017). A breeding subpopulation also is found in the Bermuda Islands (Davenport et al. 2005), which was considered native by Parham <em>et al</em>. (2008) and genetically attributed to subspecies <em>M. t. centrata</em>. The human role in the origin of the Bermuda subpopulation remains under consideration (Lovich and Hart 2018), but it currently is an established and protected population (Outerbridge 2014).<br/><br/>Subspecific distributional information for the morphologically-defined historically recognized subspecies is as follows (noting, however, that molecular phylogeography does not agree with this pattern, but that a revised taxonomy has not yet been formulated; see Taxonomy section):<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin terrapin</em>: from Cape Cod, Massachusetts southward to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin centrata</em>.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin centrata</em>: from the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina southward to northern peninsular Florida, where it meets and intergrades with <em>M. terrapin tequesta</em>; also on Bermuda.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin tequesta</em>: Atlantic east coast of peninsular Florida to Biscayne Bay, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em>.</p>  <p><em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em>: Florida Keys westward to the Marquesas Keys.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin macrospilota</em>: Gulf coast of peninsular Florida, intergrading with <em>M. terrapin pileata</em> in the panhandle and with <em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em> in Florida Bay.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin pileata</em>: from the Florida panhandle, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin macrospilota, </em>to<em> </em>Louisiana, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin littoralis</em>.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin littoralis</em>: western Louisiana and the coast of Texas, at least as far south as Corpus Christi Bay.<br/><br/>Anecdotal reports that this species is found in Mexican waters (e.g., Carr 1952) have been disputed (Smith and Smith 1979); there is no credible information indicating occurrence in Mexico (Iverson 1992; Mexican Red List Workshop participants, Sept. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Range Size:</strong>&#160;The presence of a coastal species like <em>M. terrapin</em> is difficult to determine because of their cryptic nature and the inaccessibility of much of their habitat. Its distribution is discontinuous along the ~5,000 km of coastline between Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Corpus Christi, Texas. However, it is unknown if the discontinuity can be attributed to natural biological boundaries or to barriers created by extensive urbanization and industrial development in portions of its coastal habitat. Terrapins inhabit salt marshes that form on the bay side of barrier islands, and the extent to which they move inland via estuaries varies considerably, but seems to be bounded by waters that are brackish for most of the year.&#160; Nonetheless, terrapin habitat, salt marsh juvenile habitat, and nesting areas, have all diminished greatly because of salt marsh loss and the development of coastal and estuarine waterfront (Kennish 2001; Ner and Burke 2008). No range-wide population estimate is available, but data are consistent in that subpopulations are local, sensitive to anthropogenic perturbation, and many individually studied subpopulations are small, while others are more robust (summarized in Roosenburg and Kennedy 2018).</p>","<p><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em>&#160;was utilized for food prior to European settlement in North America; however, as human populations increased throughout the terrapin’s range and terrapin consumption became fashionable, the exploitation reached unsustainable levels. By the late 19th century native populations were in dramatic decline, warranting the first federal attempts to farm terrapins (Kennedy 2018a). Captive propagation for commercial purposes was initiated in the early 20th century because of range-wide population declines and danger of extinction, indicating that fisheries of wild populations were not sustainable (Hay 1917). Extensive data are available for artificial propagation of terrapins for commercial purposes (Hay 1917; Coker 1920; Hildebrand and Hatsel 1926; Hildebrand 1932) but the general consensus of these studies was that it is not economically feasible to farm terrapins as a food source because of slow growth rates. The demand for terrapin meat eventually decreased and the depleted populations began to slowly recover after 1930 (Carr 1952). In the early 2000s increases in the commercial capture and trade of terrapins were identified (USDA 2011). Most of the captured turtles were shipped to Asian communities in major metropolitan areas in the US and also exported to Asia. This increase in demand alarmed turtle biologists and prompted many states to increase regulations, protection, and monitoring of terrapin populations (Kennedy 2018a). The primary concern with the resurgence of the commercial terrapin fishery is that, combined with habitat degradation, recovery will be slower, if not impossible. Export data for terrapins in 1999-2010 indicate an increase in the number of individuals and shipments, primarily as exports to Asia (USDA 2011). Concern about the increases in terrapin export has resulted in the closure of the remaining commercial wild harvest in all states except Louisiana. Maryland closed their commercial fishery, based primarily on the export to China and declining populations in Chesapeake Bay (Roosenburg <em>et al.</em> 2008). Following the closure of the Maryland fishery exports dropped by approximately 25% from their peak and most exports at this time are believed to originate from farms, although this has not been confirmed. Today, Louisiana remains the only state where terrapins can be harvested from the wild for commercial sale. Many states maintain a subsistence harvest of two per day for either consumption or pets.<br/><br/>Terrapins are currently bred in captivity (turtle farms) on a small scale in the United States and the hatchlings are sold commercially for the pet trade and to supply aquaculture rearing facilities in Asia that eventually supply the consumption trade and maintain reproductive colonies for the pet trade. Recent exports of high numbers of terrapin hatchlings originating from the single commercial turtle farm in Maryland revealed that successful terrapin farming requires a constant infusion of wild brood stock. The adults that produced most of the hatchlings sold were obtained from New Jersey in a manner that was disputably legal or illegal; New Jersey subsequently closed its commercial terrapin fishery (T. Leuteritz, pers. comm.).</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>Diamondback Terrapins are protected from commercial exploitation in most states where they occur, but as of early 2018 commercial harvests remain permitted under regulations in Louisiana (Kennedy, 2018a). Personal possession is permitted under certain conditions in most states (Nanjappa and Conrad 2011; Kennedy, 2018a) but restricted in most cases to no more than two individuals and permits required for possession as pets. <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> was included in CITES Appendix II in 2013, making its international trade subject to determinations and evaluation that traded volumes are not detrimental to the survival of wild populations.<br/><br/>Hackney (2010) used the standardized Natural Heritage Program to compare the conservation status of terrapins among range states. Of the 16 range states, one (Rhode Island) lists the species as S1, or critically imperiled. Four states list the species as S2, imperiled, while six states list it as S3, vulnerable. Four states consider the diamondback terrapin to be S4, apparently secure. South Carolina has not ranked terrapins according to this scale. State protective listing or harvest regulation in all range states is recommended. In Bermuda, diamondback terrapins have level 2 protection under the Protected Species Order 2012.<br/><br/>Diamondback Terrapins reside in coastal habitats that are intensively used and modified by humans (Kennish 2001, Ner and Burke 2008, Gedan <em>et al</em>. 2009). Safeguarding areas of optimal habitat, particularly foraging, nesting and hibernation sites, from development and other modification is essential for the long-term survival of this species. Terrapins occur in a substantial number of protected areas and their movement is limited (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mortality in crab pots and habitat fragmentation are suggested to reduce gene flow while signatures of the past commercial trade and movement of terrapins are still detectable in some populations (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2017, Converse and Kuchta, 2018). Terrapins use a variety of estuarine habitats throughout their range and local populations effectively exploit their native habitat. Populations can grow and respond quickly when provided with predator-free nesting areas, high quality juvenile habitat, and protection of adults, in particular reproductive females (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014, R.L. Burke, unpubl. data), suggesting that estuarine or marine preserves combined with nest predator control can provide an effective tool to restore terrapin populations in areas where numbers are reduced (Roosenburg 2018).<br/><br/>Bycatch reduction devices (BRD) can greatly reduce the number of terrapins that drown in crab traps (Wood 1997; Hoyle and Gibbons 2000; Roosenburg and Green 2000; Butler and Heinrich 2007). By installing BRDs in crab pots, most adult female terrapins are excluded, particular in mid-Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, and the Gulf coast regions where body sizes are larger. BRDs are also effective in southern Atlantic regions and Florida and perhaps more important because adult females never outgrow the vulnerability to crab pots without BRDs (Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011). Several states now require BRDs; however, regulations vary considerably across the terrapin’s range (Hackney 2010), as does the intensity of enforcement of regulations. Broad adoption of BRDs will significantly assist the species' prospects (Guillory and Prejean 1998; Rook <em>et al</em>. 2010; Radzio <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Perhaps the greatest concern for terrapins is entrapment in derelict or ghost crab pots that are not regularly checked. Several cases have been recorded where &gt;20 individuals have been recovered dead from crab pots that were abandoned, one with more than 100 individuals (Bishop 1983; Roosenburg 1991; Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>  <p>                     </p><p>Since 2003, research scientists and summer interns at The Wetlands Institute in New Jersey have deployed barrier fencing to reduce road mortality in their study area. Results to date suggest that barrier fencing can be an effective terrapin conservation tool (McLaughlin <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, at JFK Airport in New York, personnel successfully use barrier fencing to keep terrapins off runways (Burke and Francoeur 2014). Combined with nesting habitat improvement adjacent to roadways, fencing can dramatically reduce roadway mortality and help direct terrapins to protected nesting sites (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018). Finally, roadway warning signals activated at times of peak nesting in high use areas can dramatically reduce nesting female road mortality. Impacts by watercraft also present a problem for terrapins in areas with high boat traffic (Roosenburg 1991; Lester <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, terrapins appear not to respond to the noise of approaching vessels, increasing the risk of boat impact; thus suggesting that marine speed limits near areas of terrapin congregation (e.g., nesting beaches) would be the only effective mechanism to reduce boat strikes (Lester <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018).<br/><br/>Nest protection and head-starting programs exist at a variety of locations, and are subject to active research on their effective contribution to population dynamics and establishment success (Herlands <em>et al</em>. 2004; Smeenk 2010; Petrov 2014; Roosenburg 2018). High nest predation remains a key conservation problem for terrapins and control of mammalian nest predators increases nest success (Munscher <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the complete absence of nest predators can contribute to population recovery (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). Head-starting can supplement population growth and head-started individuals can establish within native populations. Furthermore, head-started females can become reproductive and some remain in the local population where they were released (Roosenburg 2018). However, the low level of gene flow among populations (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2015) suggests that source animals should only come from the same population they will supplement or from the nearest population for extirpated areas.<br/><br/>One example of effective terrapin conservation and restoration is the Paul S. Sarbanes Environmental Restoration Project at Poplar Island, Chesapeake Bay, Maryland (Roosenburg et al. 2014, Roosenburg 2018). Poplar Island’s restoration has established predator-free nesting habitat and extensive salt marsh habitat for juveniles. There also is an active head-starting program on Poplar Island. The terrapin population on Poplar Island is growing rapidly due primarily to the high nest survival (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014) and high quality juvenile habitat that ensures high post-hatching juvenile survivorship (Roosenburg 2018). Although head-starting does contribute to population growth, its impacts are secondary to that of the habitat creation and protection (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). The Poplar Island example illustrates the basic requirements for population recovery which suggests that estuarine reserves or sanctuaries that include both nesting and juvenile habitat, combined with nest predator control, offer an excellent strategy for terrapin population recovery.<br/><br/>Further research on terrapin conservation is needed, particularly towards understanding individual and seasonal movement patterns, habitat use at different life stages, and refinement of the taxonomy. Although some populations and areas are well studied, other parts of the range have less data, particularly the Gulf Coast and the populations within Pamlico Sound and the estuarine waters of North Carolina, and southern New England. Most states have some form of ongoing terrapin research, but the expansive range and the need for boats to access key habitats limits both surveys and detailed population studies. Recent work also has suggested that climate change will dramatically affect habitat availability for terrapins, particularly the juvenile dependence on saltmarsh habitat, which is predicted to decline dramatically due to sea level rise (Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further study of the effects of sea level rise is needed to evaluate how habitat and resources will be affected.<br/><br/>Although these conservation targets have been known for years, declines in terrapin populations have not been fully addressed for a variety of issues. Conservation measures, such as establishing requirements for bycatch reduction devices in crab pots, have often been effectively resisted by commercial fishermen through political lobbying efforts. Furthermore, even with regulations in place, lack of compliance and enforcement results in ineffective use rates (Radzio <em>et al</em>. 2014). Finally, conflicts between the preservation of nesting habitat shoreline and the development and protection of high-value coastal real estate seem to preempt terrapin conservation measures. Despite the slow pace of terrapin conservation, some progress has been made to reduce road mortality in some areas (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b) and population recovery and growth have been observed in at least one population (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). Additionally, the technology to reduce terrapin capture in crab pots has made substantial progress (Roosenburg 2004, Chambers and Maerz 2018) as range-wide fine-tuning of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) continues (Schwenter and Arndt, unpubl. data).</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Its sandy habitat is largely untrawled in the USA providing some refuge for this species. Elsewhere, it is targeted and taken as bycatch in coastal artisanal and commercial  trawl, handline, and gillnet fisheries that are intense and unmanaged  in parts of its range. For example, it is prevalent in Mexican shrimp trawl fisheries and is the third-most caught species in bycatch In the Mexican Caribbean. Although data are sparse in Central America and northern South America, fisheries there are intense in some areas and are largely unmanaged. In northern Brazil, unmanaged trawling and gillnetting has led to steep declines and local extinctions of several sharks and rays. Habitat  loss and degradation due to coastal development and oil exploration are  also threats to this species in many parts of its range. Overall, due to the level of intense and unmanaged fishing pressure  across its range, outside of USA waters, it is suspected that the Freckled Guitarfish has undergone a  population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (18  years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.","The Freckled Guitarfish is a coastal benthic shark-like ray that inhabits sand, algae, and patch reefs from inshore to 30 m depth. It reaches a maximum size of 78 cm total length (TL), and size-at-maturity is unknown. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with a litter size of six pups (Last <em>et al.</em> 2016). Generation length is suspected to be about six years, based on data available for the larger congeneric Shovelnose Guitarfish (<em>Pseudobatos productus</em>), which has a maximum size of 170 cm TL and a generation length of 9 years (Timmons and Bray 1997).","This guitarfish is targeted and taken as bycatch in coastal artisanal and commercial trawl, longline handline, and gillnet fisheries that are intense and unmanaged in parts of its range. In the USA, it is a rare bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries (C.F. Cotton unpubl. data 2019). It is also taken in recreational fisheries in Texas and likely elsewhere on the USA coast (Hensley <em>et al.</em> 1998). In Mexican waters of the Caribbean, this species was reported as the third-most abundant species in shrimp bycatch (Garcia-Zúñiga <em>et al.</em> 2019). It has been caught as a frequent bycatch on small-scale longlines in Tabasco since at least the 1980s (Lara-Mendoza <em>et al. </em>2016). Fisheries in general have been declining in the Gulf of Mexico, and some shrimp stocks there have collapsed (J.C. Pérez Jiménez unpubl. data 2019). Although there are no data on this species from Central America, artisanal and commercial fisheries there are intense in some areas, and are largely unmanaged. If this species occurs in Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries there are widespread and lack management and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have collapsed. In the mid-2000s, this fishery had one of the highest ratios of bycatch relative to target species of any in the world (Duarte<em> et al.</em> 2010). In Venezuela, fishers capture guitarfishes in the intense fisheries  off Margarita Island (Ehemann and González-González 2018), and this  species is likely included if it occurs there. In northern Brazil, artisanal gillnetting  and commercial trawling are intense and have led to steep declines in  other chondrichthyans (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016). This guitarfish is caught there in gillnets, including lost and abandoned ghost nets (Lima <em>et al.</em> 2019). This species is also threatened by habitat  loss and degradation due to coastal development and oil exploration through much of its range.","There are no range-wide estimates of population trend for this species. It is captured in mostly unmanaged fisheries, some of which are intense. Historically, this species was locally common in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Walls 1975), with Florida regarded as the centre of abundance (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953), but it is now relatively rare and patchily distributed in Texas (Hensley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)&#160;and throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico (Shepherd and Myers 2005). Its sandy habitat is largely untrawled in the USA which provides some refuge for this species (J.K. Carlson pers. comm. 10/08/2020). In the 1980s, shrimp fisheries in Mexico were very intense and there was a steep decline in this shrimp fishery (M.P. Blanco-Para and J.C.&#160;Pérez Jiménez unpubl. data 2019). Catches of the Mexican shark fishery declined by 35% over the decade between 1999–2008 due to rising effort and limited regulation (<span class=""s1"">Castillo-Géniz <em>et al. </em>1998,&#160;Pérez-Jiménez and Méndez-Loeza 2015).<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&#160;In other areas of the Western Central Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are dominant and are largely unmanaged.

Although fairly common at some sites, its overall distribution is limited and overall population declines of 10–15% are estimated to have occurred over the previous two generations (30 years) and predicted to continue over the next one generation (15 years), for an ongoing decline of 15–20% over three generations (45 years). As such, the species just qualifies as Near Threatened (NT) under criterion A4cde following a very precautionary approach (normally reductions of 20-25% would be required to qualify a species for an NT listing). However, given that there has been an ongoing decline of more than 10% for three generations, the species qualifies for listing as NT under criterion C1. The species was previously assessed as Least Concern for the IUCN Red List in 1996, but not published since LC species were not listed at that time. It was re-assessed as Near Threatened at the IUCN Red Listing workshop on African chelonians organized by the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group in Lomé, Togo, in August 2013.","<em>Pelusios niger</em>&#160;occurs in the rainforest region in a variety of standing and slow-flowing permanent waters, including lakes, lagoons, and marshes, as well as rivers (Trape <em>et al</em>. 2012; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is often seen on land and can also be found in ephemeral waterbodies, especially during the wet season (Trape <em>et al</em>. 2012). It feeds on shellfish, mollusks, fish and aquatic vegetation (Luiselli 2008; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). Data available on the reproductive biology of <em>P. niger</em> in the field are scarce. A female of 22 cm CL had a clutch of 10 eggs measuring 47–49 mm long and 24–25 mm wide, with a mass of 17–18 g each (Maran and Pauwels 2005). In the Niger Delta of southern Nigeria, clutch size ranged from 18–28 with an average of 25 ± 2, and eggs measured 30–40 mm in length (mean, 35.5 ± 4 mm) (Akani <em>et al</em>. 2015c). Mean hatchling size was 40 × 33 mm carapace length and width (F. Grünewald, unpubl. data). Age at maturity is probably about 6-8 years at carapace lengths of ca. 10-12 cm (males) and about 15 cm (females), generation time is estimated to be about 15 years, and longevity is at least 20-25 years. Maximum size of females is about 26.5 cm carapace length, and males are larger, reaching about 34.7 cm in carapace length (Maran 2006). Weight varies considerably among individuals, however, an average female of about 20 cm carapace length may be 1100-1300 g, whereas an average male of about 26 cm carapace length may be 2,100-2,300 g with captive individuals being slightly heavier (F. Grünewald, unpubl. data).","The major threats for this species include local subsistence consumption, habitat destruction and degradation, especially from pollution in the Niger Delta due to oil spills, and the international pet trade (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<em>Pelusios niger</em> is widespread in eastern West Africa and locally abundant in several places in its range, but is regularly collected by humans for food (e.g., Branch 2007; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2013; Akani <em>et al</em>. 2015a,b,c). In Gabon, because of its large size, the species is particularly sought after for local consumption, especially in the lakes around Lambaréné (Gramentz 1999; Maran and Pauwels 2005; Maran 2006). Its flesh and eggs are greatly appreciated. <em>Pelusios niger</em> is caught by fishing or more occasionally with a trammel. In the dry season, turtles inhabiting swamps hide in tangles of aquatic plants. Using their machete or a simple piece of sharpened wood, hunters probe these areas and are able to capture a large number of turtles. Locally, the species is affected by pollution and degradation of its primary habitats: in the Niger Delta of Nigeria, for instance, several populations are collapsing due to the effects of oil spill contaminations (Luiselli and Akani 2003; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006a,b). It is often exported from Africa for sale to turtle hobbyists, with Ghana (animals trans-shipped primarily from Nigeria) and Benin being the main exporting countries (Ineich 2006; Segniagbeto 2009).","<p><em>Pelusios niger</em> is a species of limited distribution, poorly represented in museum collections, although sometimes reaching high local abundance, as in the swamps and coastal streams of Gabon and Nigeria (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). Local declines appear to have occurred at some sites in the Niger Delta of southern Nigeria. For instance, the species tends to be quickly extirpated from sites subjected to oil spillages (Luiselli and Akani 2003; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2006a). Overall, there is no evidence yet that population declines rangewide are generalized in a major way, although no long-term monitoring data on any natural populations are available. However, much of its natural habitat, which includes water bodies within the forest block of eastern coastal West Africa and coastal Cameroon and Gabon (Maran 2006) is under severe threat due to industrial expansion and deforestation (Akani <em>et al</em>. 1999; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000), and population declines of at least 10-15% over the last 30 years (two generations) are estimated.</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Pelusios niger</em> is a coastal West African species that ranges from Benin continuously through coastal southern Nigeria and western Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea to southwestern coastal Gabon (Trape<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2012; TTWG 2017; Luiselli&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).

Also, more conservation biology research would be desirable, including data on hatchling size, incubation time, age and size at maturity, longevity, annual reproductive output, etc. Export quantities for the international pet trade should also be continuously monitored in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the trade on wild population sizes and to adjust export quotas as necessary.

Genetic results indicate that two major subpopulations exist, in the Atlantic Ocean and Indo-Pacific, respectively.<br/><br/>Pronounced size- and sex-based segregation is present in most of the species’ known coastal feeding areas, with coastal sites typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. The largest known aggregation sites for Whale Sharks host hundreds or low thousands of individuals, based on counts and model estimates. Although individual sharks are highly mobile, many show a degree of site fidelity.<br/><br/>Directed fisheries and significant bycatch fisheries have targeted areas where high densities of Whale Sharks occur, leading to rapid reductions in catch per unit effort (CPUE) measures. Some bias toward juvenile Whale Shark-dominated aggregations are present in trend data; in the absence of information on other life-stages, these trends are inferred to be representative of population-level declines. While a number of commercial fisheries for the species closed during the 1990–2000s, Whale Shark products remain valuable and the species is still commonly caught in some countries. Serious injury and inferred mortality through vessel strike is a threat to several globally significant aggregations, as is bycatch in net fisheries, and the risk of ship strike. In the absence of conservation action, declines is likely to continue into the future.<br/><br/>Based on count data, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, 75% of the global Whale Shark population is inferred to occur in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. A variety of datasets present declines of 40-92%, inferring an overall decline of 63% in the Indo-Pacific over the last 75 years (three generations), resulting in a subpopulation assessment of Endangered A2bd+4bd. In the Atlantic, the overall population decline is considered to be lower at&#160;&#160;≥30%, resulting in a subpopulation assessment of&#160;Vulnerable A2b+4b. Given the bulk of the global population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, the overall global decline is inferred to be&#160;≥50%. Globally, the Whale Shark is therefore assessed as Endangered A2bd+4bd.","Whale Sharks are found in both coastal and oceanic habitats (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Oceanic sightings are strongly correlated with temperature in the Indian and Atlantic oceans (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014), with most occurring between 26.5° and 30°C in the Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012). Depth was an important predictor in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but was not significant in the Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Whale Sharks are highly mobile, with mean daily movement rates of 24–28 km based on tethered geopositioning tags (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013). Cyclical or longer-term climate shifts affect Whale Shark occurrence and abundance (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012), which needs to be considered when discussing local abundance trends.<br/><br/>Whale Sharks spend the majority of time in the epipelagic zone, but dive to at least 1,928 m in depth (Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015). The driver of these deep dives is unclear, but may be related to foraging behaviour, especially when crossing oceanic waters with comparatively low surface productivity (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010, Brunnschweiler and Sims 2011, Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015) and/or assist with energy conservation when moving between prey zones (Gleiss <em>et al</em>. 2011) or navigating (Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015). Initial results from fatty acid dietary studies suggest that meso- and bathypelagic prey may be an important component of Whale Shark diet (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2013), and dive data from pop-up archival tags provide some evidence for mesopelagic foraging behaviour (Tyminsky <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Most Whale Shark sightings occur at a small number of known coastal feeding areas for the species, where the sharks aggregate on the surface to exploit seasonal productivity such as fish spawning events or zooplankton blooms (Rowat and Brooks 2012). A degree of inter-annual site fidelity has been documented in many locations (Cagua <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Sexual- and size-based segregation is typical in these locations, with a bias towards juvenile males from 4–8 m length (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). This pronounced segregation indicates that ontogenetic and sex-specific habitat or dietary shifts are present in the species. In the Gulf of California, juvenile sharks, comprising 60% males, were found in shallower waters exploiting abundant prey. Larger sharks, composed of 84% females, occurred in oceanic waters where they fed on diffuse patches of euphasiids (Ketchum <em>et al</em>. 2012). An initial stable isotope study of Indian Whale Sharks showed a positive relationship between size and δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N, suggesting that larger sharks feed on prey items of a larger size and higher trophic level (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2011). Females had lower values of δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N than males (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2011) suggesting that they have a different, more pelagic diet, while individuals of &lt;4 m total length (TL) also showed a lower δ13C than larger individuals suggesting a transition from pelagic to more coastal foraging habitats.<br/><br/>The largest recorded Whale Shark, approximately 20 m TL (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997) and 42 t in mass (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2014), have been reported from Taiwan. An individual extrapolated to be 18.8 m TL was caught in India (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2011). Norman and Stevens (2007) found that 50% of males were mature, based on clasper morphology, at a visually estimated TL of 8.1 m in Western Australia, while 50% maturity was estimated to occur at 9.2 m TL using laser photogrammetry in Mozambique (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Gulf of Mexico, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. (2012) visually estimated 50% male maturity to occur at around 7 m TL. Given the genetic differentiation between the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014), this may represent a subpopulation-level difference in the size of maturation. Size at maturity in female sharks is approximately 9 m TL, based on visual (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012) and laser photogrammetric estimates (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014) from the Eastern Pacific, and a 9.6 m TL individual recorded from Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2014). All of seven stranded female specimens from 4.8 to 8.7 m TL in South Africa were immature (Beckley <em>et al</em>. 1997). The only confirmed pregnant female examined, from Taiwan, was 10.6 m TL (Joung <em>et al</em>. 1996).<br/><br/>Whale Shark reproductive ecology is poorly known. Pregnant female sharks are seasonally found in the Eastern Pacific, particularly off Darwin Island in the Galapagos Archipelago (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014) and the Gulf of California (Eckert and Stewart 2001, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012), but rarely sighted outside this region. An exception is St Helena Island in the mid-Atlantic, where pregnant female sharks are routinely observed on a seasonal basis (A. Dove, pers. comm). The single pregnant female that has been physically examined, from Taiwan, had 304 pups in various stages of development, the largest litter size reported from any shark species (Joung <em>et al</em>. 1996, Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2010). This discovery established that Whale Sharks are aplacental viviparous. Paternity analysis on a subset of the offspring established that a single male might have sired the entire litter, suggesting that the species has the capacity to store sperm (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2010). The largest size class of embryos, 58–64 cm TL, appeared close to fully developed (Joung <em>et al</em>. 1996). The smallest free-swimming neonate found in the wild, from the Philippines, was 46 cm TL (Aca and Schmidt 2011). Size at birth is therefore presumed to be around this range (Aca and Schmidt 2011). Reproductive periodicity is unknown: resightings rarely occur in the areas where pregnant sharks are observed (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted).<br/><br/>Age and growth data on Whale Shark are sparse. Stranded sharks in South Africa (Wintner 2000) and fishery catches in Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2014), respectively, have been assessed. Both studies were limited by small sample sizes of predominantly juvenile sharks. Hsu <em>et al</em>. (2014) concluded that growth band deposition is likely to be biannual and, based on this, estimated that male sharks begin maturing at ~17 years and females at 19–22 years in the Indo-Pacific. However, these estimates have some important caveats: biannual band deposition has been demonstrated in very few other shark species, and other orectolobiform species have been shown to have aperiodic band pair formation (Huveneers <em>et al</em>. 2013). Validation through wild growth studies is important to confirm these results. Initial results from laser photogrammetric studies indicate that growth increments over periods of 1–3 years are too small to be accurately measured, but the technique may have value over longer time-frames (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). Generation length is estimated as 25 years.","Major contemporary threats to Whale Sharks include fisheries catches, bycatch in nets, and vessel strikes. Other threats affect Whale Shark on local or regional scales.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>Whale Sharks are presently fished in several locations. In southern China, large-scale commercial take of Whale Sharks appears to be increasing (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although Whale Sharks are not necessarily targeted, they are routinely captured and retained when sighted (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). A small-scale opportunistic fishery for Whale Sharks is also present in Oman (D. Robinson, pers. comm).&#160; <br/><br/>Whale Sharks have previously been targeted in large-scale fisheries from India, the Philippines and Taiwan, with hundreds of sharks caught annually in each country until species-level protections were implemented (Rowat and Brooks 2012). A smaller directed fishery occurred in the Maldives until Whale Sharks were protected in 1995 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993). Broader-scale subpopulation reduction caused by these fisheries was raised as a possible driver of declining sightings in Thailand (Theberge and Dearden 2006) and Western Australia (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2008). Occasional directed catch or bycatch of Whale Sharks has been documented from many of their range states, particularly where large-mesh gillnets are in common use (Rowat and Brooks 2012).<br/><br/>Tuna are often associated with Whale Sharks, and tuna purse-seine fisheries often use Whale Sharks as an indicator of tuna presence, even setting nets around the sharks (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Direct mortality in purse-seine fisheries appears to generally be low, recorded as 0.91% (one of 107) and 2.56% (one of 38) of sharks where fate was reported by observers in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, estimated mortality rates in the Western Central Pacific purse-seine fishery were higher: 12% for 2007–2009 and 5% in 2010. This extrapolated to a total mortality of 56 sharks in 2009 and 19 in 2010 (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013). Observer reports on release condition from this region from 2010–2014 were generally consistent, with 50–60% of encircled sharks released alive, 5–10% dying and 30–40% of status unknown (Clarke 2015). Assuming a poor outcome for the latter category, potential mortalities in 2014 range from a minimum of 11 to 42, with a higher number possible depending on longer-term survival of the sharks released alive (Clarke 2015). Available data on the number of Whale Sharks caught are likely to underestimate total catch (Clarke 2015). The longer-term survivorship of Whale Sharks released from nets has not been examined at this stage. Common release practices, such as being lifted or towed by the caudal peduncle, are likely to cause stress, injury and possibly death to the sharks.<br/><br/>Shipping lanes, where they are placed close to Whale Shark feeding areas, can create a serious risk of vessel strikes. Whale Sharks routinely feed at the surface (Motta <em>et al</em>. 2010, Gleiss <em>et al</em>. 2013), and propeller injuries are commonly recorded during monitoring programs (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2006, Speed <em>et al</em>. 2008, Fox <em>et al</em>. 2013). While mortality events are seldom reported in the contemporary scientific literature, they were often noted from slower-moving vessels in the past (Gudger 1941). It is likely that fast-moving, large ships do not register or report impacts, and as Whale Sharks will typically sink upon death, these are unlikely to be documented (Speed <em>et al</em>. 2008). Areas where Whale Sharks appear to be at particular risk include the Mesoamerican reef countries in the Western Caribbean (Graham 2007, R. de la Parra-Venegas pers. comm.) and Gulf states (D. Robinson pers. comm.), where a high frequency of serious propeller injuries are observed during monitoring.<br/>&#160;<br/>Inappropriate tourism may be an indirect threat to Whale Shark in some circumstances (for example from interference, crowding or provisioning). Marine pollution events occurring in Whale Shark hotspots, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Hoffmayer <em>et al</em>. 2005, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2012), may result in mortality or displacement from preferred habitats. These more local threats, as well as potential future concerns such as climate change impacts (Sequiera <em>et al</em>. 2014), should be closely monitored.","Based on counts, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, it is inferred that approximately 75% of the global Whale Shark population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. In the Indo-Pacific, a population reduction of 63% is inferred over the last three generations (75 years), and in the Atlantic a population reduction of more than 30% is inferred (see the discussion for each subpopulation below). Combining data from both regions, it is likely that the global Whale Shark population has declined by &gt;50% over the last 75 years.<br/><br/>Available datasets for Whale Sharks, in particular those from coastal sites, are typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. Acknowledging this, we make the assumption that trend data in the visible fraction of the population (i.e. mainly juveniles) is representative of the adult population. <br/><br/><em><strong>Global population size</strong></em><br/>Whale Sharks are individually identifiable based on their characteristic spot patterns (Taylor 1994, Arzoumanian <em>et al</em>. 2005, Marshall and Pierce 2012). A global database of Whale Shark sightings, comprising submitted photographs from both researchers and the public, is hosted online at Wildbook for Whale Sharks (<a href=""www.whaleshark.org"">www.whaleshark.org</a>) (Wild Me 2016, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). As of February 2016, there were 7,011 individual sharks on this database, identified from images submitted between 1964 and 2016. However, 70% of sexed individuals (n = 3,420) were male, with the majority of these likely to be immature based on length estimates (Norman and Stevens 2007, Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012, Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015). This dataset is assumed to not fully represent female, small juvenile or adult sharks (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Therefore, the total represents a minimum number of sharks alive over this period.<br/><br/>Two global-scale genetic studies on Whale Sharks have estimated genetic effective population size – the number of breeding adults – albeit based on small sample sizes of 70 (Castro <em>et al</em>. 2007) and 68 sharks (Schmidt <em>et al</em>. 2009), respectively. Castro <em>et al</em>. (2007) used mitochondrial DNA to estimate current genetic effective population size to be 119,000–238,000 sharks. Schmidt <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated genetic effective population size to be 103,572, with a standard error of 27,401–179,794, based on microsatellite analysis. However, lack of knowledge on species-specific mutation rates mean these estimates should not be used for management purposes (J. Schmidt pers. comm., T. Vignaud and S. Planes pers. comm).<br/><br/><em><strong>Global population structure</strong></em><br/>While global connectivity of Whale Shark subpopulations has been postulated (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013b), a large global genetic study using both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analysis has demonstrated that the Whale Shark subpopulations in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific are functionally separate (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014). Large-scale photo-identification studies in the Indian Ocean (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010) and western Atlantic (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013), along with Wildbook online database results (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), have shown limited connectivity exists between non-contiguous countries. Based on these results, here we have considered two separate subpopulations in this assessment.<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic subpopulation trend<br/></strong></em>A decline of  ≥30% in the Atlantic subpopulation is inferred over the last three generations (75 years) based on data from tuna fleet observers off a likely centre of abundance for this subpopulation. Between 1980 and 2010 there was a decline in sightings per unit effort (SPUE) off western Africa, with SPUE peaking in 1995 and declining thereafter (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, sightings decreased from about 500 during the 1990s to around 150 during the 2000s. Peak-month sightings also declined by approximately 50% over this time (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>At Gladden Spit in Belize, Whale Shark sightings declined from a mean of 4 to 6 sharks per day between 1998 and 2001 to less than 2 per day in 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), with reports from diving guides indicating that numbers have remained low until 2016 (R. Graham, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In the Azores, there was a significant increase in sightings in 2008 and afterwards compared to the decade before (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This was strongly correlated with the location of the 22°C isotherm, indicating that this increasing sighting trend is due to environmental conditions (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><em><strong>Atlantic subpopulation size</strong></em><br/>Regional counts of identified sharks or modelled abundance estimates are available from many of the larger known aggregation or feeding areas. Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. (2012) photo-identified 350 individual Whale Sharks from Holbox Island in Mexico between 2005 and 2008, and estimated that 521–809 sharks participate in this aggregation. Aerial surveys from this area and the adjacent Caribbean coast have counted up to 420 sharks in a single aerial survey (de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011). The largest-known aggregation as of February 2016 occurs seasonally off the Yucatan cost of Mexico, with over 1,100 identified sharks (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Satellite-tagged sharks from this aggregation have been tracked to the northern Gulf of Mexico (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013), where aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been reported (Hoffmayer <em>et al</em>. 2005), south to Belize where 106 individual sharks were identified between 1998 and 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), and off the island of Utila, Honduras, where 95 sharks were identified between 1999 and 2011 (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2013). One shark, tagged in 2007, was tracked swimming across the equator to the South Atlantic Ocean, near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013). The end point of this track was 543 km southeast from the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, where 54 Whale Shark sightings were recorded between 2000 and 2005 (Hazin <em>et al</em>. 2008). This individual was subsequently photo-identified back off the Yucatan coast in 2011 and 2012 (Hueter <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Aside from St Helena Island (A. Dove, pers. comm.), there have been few photographic records from elsewhere in the Atlantic (Wild Me 2016). There were, however, 2,297 records of Whale Sharks from the logbooks of tuna purse-seine vessels between 1980 and 2010, mostly from the eastern Atlantic (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014) and particularly off the coast of Gabon (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). An additional 1,449 sightings were recorded from the Azores archipelago between 1998 and 2013 (Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><em><strong>Indo-Pacific subpopulation trend</strong></em><br/>A decline of &gt;50% (likely around 63%) in the Indo-Pacific Whale Shark subpopulation is inferred&#160;over the last three generations (75 years)&#160;based on relevant indices of abundance from Mozambique, the broader Western Indian Ocean, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and the Western and Central Pacific, and actual levels of exploitation in mainland China, the Maldives, India, the Philippines and Taiwan.<br/><br/>A commercial fishery for Whale Shark existed in Taiwan until 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). Information provided by fishers operating from Hongchun harbour in southern Taiwan indicated that 50–60 sharks were caught each season in the mid-1980s, declining to less than 10 per year in each of 1994 and 1995 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). Although definitive catch trends are not available, there was a significant (58%) decrease in the estimated annual catch in 1997 of 272 sharks (Chen and Phipps 2002) to a reported catch of 113 sharks over 15 months in 2001–2002 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean total length of landed sharks was noted between 2002 and 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean size of landed sharks was also noted in southern Chinese waters, from 8.27 m prior to 2004 to 6.3 m in 2008–2011 (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Data from observers aboard the tuna purse-seine fleet in the Western and Central Pacific noted 1,073 Whale Shark sightings, with most from the Bismark and Solomon Seas (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013). The occurrence of Whale Shark in free school sets decreased by approximately 50% between 2003 (1%) and 2012 (0.5%), potentially representing a fall in abundance (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material), although a weak linear increase in occurrence probability was modelled by Sequeira <em>et al</em>. (2014) between 2000 and 2010 (Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, model performance for this latter dataset was poor (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The influence of environmental variability on sightings of Whale Shark can complicate the interpretation of trend data, particularly with the shortage of long-term datasets. A decline in Whale Shark sightings along the eastern coast of South Africa between 1993 and 1998 (Gifford 2001) was included in the proposal for listing the sharks on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES 2002). However, with the benefit of hindsight, the substantial variability in sighting data from this area over summer months (Cliff <em>et al</em>. 2007) and seasonal changes in their oceanic distribution (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012), makes it unclear whether these earlier data are indicative of a true subpopulation decline. North of this area, in the northern Mozambique Channel and broader western Indian Ocean, a slight increase in Whale Shark sightings was noted between 1991 and 2000 based on tuna purse-seine vessel data, then a decrease from 2000 to 2007 (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013a; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, 600 sightings were reported from the 1990s decreasing to ~200 across 2000–2007 (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Peak monthly sightings decreased by around 50% over the study period (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Inhambane, Mozambique, in the southern Mozambique Channel, sightings declined 79% between 2005 and 2011 (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This decreased rate of sightings has persisted to at least January 2016 (S. Pierce, unpubl. data). Sharks routinely move between South Africa and southern Mozambique (Rohner <em>et al</em>. 2015, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), but there is limited or no connectivity between these and other known coastal feeding areas to the north in Djibouti, Seychelles and Tanzania (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Prior to the species being protected in the Maldives in 1995, catches of Whale Shark declined from around 30 each year from one of the significant fishing locations up until the early 1980s to a catch of 20 or less Whale Sharks from the entire archipelago by 1993 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Two hundred and fifty-three Whale Shark sightings were recorded by a local dive charter company in the Andaman Sea, Thailand, between 1991 and 2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Sightings per unit effort showed a significant decline over this period, with an overall decrease from 1.58 Whale Sharks per trip in 1992–1993 to 0.13 sharks per trip in 2000–2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A low absolute number of sightings persisted until at least the 2002–2003 season, although effort data were not recorded (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Following the conclusion of data collection for that study, shark sightings have likely increased in frequency according to reports from dive operators. However, sharks are perceived to be smaller than those sighted in the 1990s (P. Dearden, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) analysed tourism sightings at Ningaloo Reef, Australia, between 1995 and 2004, corrected for search effort and environmental fluctuation, and identified a 40% decline in sighting rate and a decline in mean shark length of 1.6 m over this time period (Table 1 in the supplementary material), although seasonal shifts in peak abundance to outside observation months may also have contributed to this observed decline (Mau and Wilson 2007, Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Analysis of individual sighting data from 1995 to 2006 identified behavioural heterogeneity in the sharks at Ningaloo, with the majority showing some site fidelity in that they were sighted in multiple seasons (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008). This (majority) subset of the study population was increasing over the course of this work (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008). Follow-up analyses on a slightly longer dataset (1995 to 2008) confirmed this result, with smaller individuals contributing in larger numbers to recruitment, thereby potentially explaining the observed decline in mean size (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009; Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, a genetic study on Ningaloo sharks indicated declining genetic diversity over five consecutive years for mtDNA (2007–2012) and two (2010–2012) for microsatellites (Vignaud <em>et al</em>. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>Whale Sharks were fished in the Philippines prior to protection in 1998, with Whale Shark catch per unit effort (i.e., per boat) declining from 4.44 to 1.7 in Pamilacan and 10 to 3.8 in Guiwanon between two surveys conducted in 1993 and 1997 (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/><em><strong>Indo-Pacific subpopulation size<br/></strong></em>Six hundred and seventy sharks were photo-identified in southern Mozambique between 2003 and 2014 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Off Mafia Island in Tanzania, 131 sharks were photo-identified between 2006 and 2014 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Off Djibouti, 297 individuals were photo-identified between 2003 and 2010 (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2011), while 443 individuals were photo-identified off Mahe in the Seychelles between 2001 and 2009 (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2011). A subset of the Seychelles dataset, comprising records from 2004 to 2009, was modelled to produce an abundance estimate of 469 to 557 sharks from that area (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Comparisons of identities collected from the Seychelles, Djibouti, Tanzania and Mozambique, comprising a total of 1,069 individual sharks sighted up to 2009, found no matches between these countries (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Norman <em>et al</em>. (submitted) updated these figures and found three international matches (all between Mozambique and Tanzania) from 1,098 individuals. A significant aggregation of juvenile Whale Sharks also occurs in the Red Sea off the Saudi Arabian coast, with 122 individuals identified to 2013 (J. Cochran, pers. comm). Aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been noted off the Qatar coast (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013). One hundred and six sharks have been identified around South Ari Atoll in the Maldives (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2010, Davies <em>et al</em>. 2012), with a modelled abundance estimate of around 74 to 104 sharks (Davies <em>et al</em>. 2012). There were 1,184 Whale Shark sightings in the Indian Ocean recorded by tuna purse-seine vessel logbooks between 1991 and 2007, with almost all of these from the Western Indian Ocean (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>Eighty-two sightings were recorded off Christmas Island, Australia, between 1996 and 2008 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2009). Whale shark photo-identifications range back to the early 1990s off Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006; Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2009). Three hundred and eighty-six sharks were identified here between 1995 and 2008 (Holmberg <em>et al</em>. 2009), with over 1,000 sharks identified by 2015 (Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted). Although two satellite-tagged sharks were tracked moving from Ningaloo Reef to the vicinity of Christmas Island (Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010), no exchange of photo-identified sharks has been documented to date (Wild Me 2016). One photo-identified Whale Shark was, however, recorded from both Ningaloo Reef and Borneo (B. Norman, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Whale Shark abundance at Ningaloo Reef, Australia has been modelled by two studies. Meekan <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated super-population size to be 319 to 436 sharks between 1992 and 2004. Holmberg <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated annual abundance to vary between 86 and 143 sharks in the years 2004 to 2007, when length was used as a covariate. Whale Shark abundance in this area is correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index and several other oceanographic variables, which potentially relate to the strength of ocean currents and local productivity (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Sleeman <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Over 820 individual sharks have now been photo-identified from the Philippines (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), with large aggregations recorded from around Donsol (Quiros 2007), Oslob on Cebu Island (Araujo <em>et al</em>. 2014, Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), and Pintuyan on Southern Leyte (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Excluding the Philippines, 326 sharks have been photo-identified from Southeast Asia (here including Cambodia [3], Indonesia [64], Malaysia [32], Myanmar [4], Taiwan [7] and both coasts of Thailand [216]) and added to the global database by February 2016 (Wild Me 2016).<br/>&#160;<br/>In the Eastern Pacific, Whale Sharks are seasonally present in small numbers around Darwin and Wolf islands in the north of the Galapagos Archipelago (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. (2014) identified 82 individuals here from 2011–2013 and estimated an annual study population size of 695±166 individuals for the Galapagos Islands. Males and immature females are rarely observed at this location, so this estimate refers predominantly to large, apparently pregnant females (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014). Two hundred and fifty-one individual sharks were photo-identified in the Gulf of California, Mexico, between 2003 and 2009: 129 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, 125 from Bahía de La Paz and smaller numbers from other sites (Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012). Modelled abundance estimates from this dataset were 54 in 2008 and 94 sharks in 2009 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, and between 19 and 62 through 2005–2009 at Bahía de La Paz (Ramírez-Macías <em>et al</em>. 2012). Outside of these areas (Galapagos Islands and Mexico), few photo-identified sharks have been added to the global database from the Eastern Pacific (Wild Me 2016). Twenty-five whale sharks were reported from tuna purse-seine vessel observers in 2014 (Clarke 2015).",Decreasing,"The Whale Shark has a circumtropical distribution through all tropical and warm temperate seas, apart from the Mediterranean (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Their core distribution is between approximately 30°N and 35°S, with occasional seasonal penetration to the north and south (Colman 1997, Rowat and Brooks 2012, Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). The northernmost records are from 44°N in the Bay of Fundy, Canada (Turnbull and Randell 2006) and the Sea of Okhotsk off Japan (Tomita <em>et al</em>. 2014), with the southernmost from 37°S in Victoria, Australia (Wolfson 1986). Whale Shark distribution is likely to be temperature limited, as they are rarely sighted in surface temperatures of less than 21°C (Iwasaki 1970, Colman 1997, Duffy 2002, Afonso <em>et al</em>. 2014, Tomita <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Areas where 500 or more individuals have been documented through either counts or model estimates include the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (Robinson <em>et al</em>. in review), Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006, Norman <em>et al</em>. submitted), Darwin Island in the Galapagos (Acuña-Marrero <em>et al</em>. 2014), Quintana Roo in Mexico (de la Parra Venegas et al. 2011, Ramírez-Macías et al. 2012), Inhambane province in Mozambique (Norman et al. submitted), the Philippines (Schleimer <em>et al</em>. 2015), and around Mahe in the Seychelles (Rowat <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Evidence from fisheries catches indicates that the Gujarat coast of India (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2012), Taiwan (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012) and southern China (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012) also had large numbers of Whale Sharks in the vicinity, at least prior to the initiation of targeted fisheries in those countries, with estimated catches of up to 1,000 individuals per year (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/>&#160;<br/>In the Indian Ocean, data from the tuna purse-seine fleet has identified the Mozambique Channel as having a high density of Whale Shark-associated sets (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Whale Shark sightings were correlated with effort (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014). Modelled habitat suitability was highest in the eastern Atlantic in the area off Gabon and surrounding countries (Sequeira <em>et al</em>. 2014), while the Bismark and Solomon Seas have relatively frequent Whale Shark sightings within the Western and Central Pacific (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Whale Sharks are subject to large- and small-scale bycatch in fisheries, with some national and international trade in products. They are also a focal species for marine tourism industries.<br/><br/>The only known targeted fishery for Whale Sharks to have existed in the Atlantic Ocean was located in Santa Cruz, Cuba, where 8–9 sharks were caught each year until the fishery was banned in 1991 (Graham 2007). Aside from Venezuela, where Whale Sharks were occasionally harpooned by fishers (Romero <em>et al</em>. 2000), there are few other records of utilization or trade of individuals from this subpopulation.<br/><br/>Prior to 1985, there was little demand for Whale Shark meat in Taiwan, with specimens of several tonnes weight selling at between US$200–300 (Chen and Phipps 2002). No dedicated fishery was present, though Whale Sharks were caught as bycatch in set-net fisheries (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). A meat fishery developed during the 1990s, with annual catches estimated to be 272 individuals in 1996 from set-net and harpoon catches (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). Total catches were likely to be higher (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). Whale Shark became the most expensive shark meat available in Taiwan by 1997, reaching prices of US$13.93/kg (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). A small 2 t Whale Shark could fetch US$14,000, with a larger 10 t shark selling for around US$70,000 in 1997 (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997). Catches declined after this peak, potentially due to local stock depletion, to 80–100 sharks through the country each year after 1997 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, the annual volume of Whale Shark meat traded more than doubled between 1998 and 2000, to 60 t in 2000 (Chen and Phipps 2002). Market surveys in 2001 indicated that catch was under-reported in official statistics, and that significant quantities of meat were likely being imported through unofficial channels (Chen and Phipps 2002). Following the introduction of specific export codes for Whale Shark meat in 2001, 2 tonnes of exports (to Spain, valued at US$1.15/kg) and no imports were recorded over the following year (Chen and Phipps 2002). A total of 693 sharks were caught in Taiwan between 2001 and 2008 (Hsu et al. 2012). Total allowable catch quotas steadily reduced through to zero sharks from 2001 to 2007 (Hsu <em>et al</em>. 2012). A small international trade in live Whale Shark was also noted in Taiwan (Chen and Phipps 2002), and is also present in mainland China (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Prior to the protection of Whale Shark in India (2001) and the Philippines (1998), Whale Shark meat was exported from those countries to Taiwan (Chen and Phipps 2002). From 1990 to 1997, 624–627 Whale Shark were caught from four of the primary fishing sites in the Philippines (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2002). Whale Shark meat from mainland China was also thought to be illegally exported to the Taiwanese market (Chen and Phipps 2002). While Whale Shark is not presently targeted off mainland China, there is a large bycatch, estimated to be more than 1,000 individuals per annum (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Whale Shark is considered a high value catch in this fishery, so they may be actively targeted in the future (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although the species is technically protected, catches are unmonitored and enforcement is minimal (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). A reduction in the mean size of landings has been reported, from 8.27 m prior to 2004 to 5.5 m from 2004–2007 and 6.3 m from 2008–2011 (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). It is unclear whether this apparent decrease in mean catch length reflects a decrease in landings of large sharks.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, Whale Shark fins were regarded as low value due to poor quality and the difficulty of preparation (Chen and Phipps 2002). Demand for fins within trade was minimal, although they were sometimes sold as display or trophy fins for shark-fin soup restaurants (Chen and Phipps 2002). More recent surveys have reported that Whale Shark fins are now demanding high prices, which is likely to result in increased targeting (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). Whale Shark fins are sporadically seen in Hong Kong markets (G. Curtis, pers. comm.), indicating that international trade in Whale Shark fins is still likely to be occurring. The source of these fins is unknown. A live shark was seen with a recently removed first dorsal fin in the Maldives (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2009). Whale Shark were also opportunistically finned in Indonesia in the 2000s (White and Cavanagh 2007).<br/><br/>The Whale Shark fishery in India was reviewed by Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. (2013). A traditional small-scale seasonal harpoon fishery in India took Whale Shark for their liver oil, which was used to waterproof boats. In the mid 1990s, fishery effort increased along the Gujarat coast to meet demand for oil, meat and fins from countries in Europe and Southeast Asia. From 1990 until 2001, when Whale Shark became legally protected in territorial waters, there was a targeted commercial fishery in Gujarat. Between 1889 and 1998, 1,974 sharks were recorded as landed through India. Some bycatch still occurs following the closure of this fishery, with 79 landings from 2001 to 2011 (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>A small opportunistic fishery is active in Oman (D. Robinson, pers. comm). Small-scale harpoon and entanglement fisheries for Whale Sharks have taken place in several other countries such as Iran and Pakistan (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Recent landings in these areas are unknown. Fishers in the Maldives used to take 20–30 individuals per year for their oil, but reported declining catches during the 1980s to early 1990s (Anderson and Ahmed 1993), and the fishery was banned in 1995. Occasional hunting may have continued following protection (Riley <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Tourism industries based on viewing Whale Shark have now developed in several countries or locations, including Australia, Belize, Cuba, Djibouti, Ecuador, Honduras, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mexico, Mozambique, Oman, Panama, the Philippines, St Helena, Saudi Arabia, the Seychelles, Tanzania and Thailand. These range in size between a maximum of 24 tourists at a time in Cuba (Graham 2007), to over 250 licensed tour operators off Quintana Roo in Mexico (Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Direct expenditure for Whale Shark-focused tourism at South Ari Atoll in the Maldives was estimated at US$9.4 million in 2013 (Cagua <em>et al</em>. 2014), while payments for tours alone off Quintana Roo in Mexico were estimated to be US$7 million in 2013 (R. de la Parra Venegas, pers. comm). In Western Australia, whale shark tourists spent an estimated AU$6 million in the Ningaloo region in 2006 (Catlin and Jones 2010). Tourist numbers have since doubled, from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 per year, so expenditure will also have substantially increased (B. Norman, unpubl. data). Graham (2007) projected that, globally, Whale Shark tourism was likely to be worth over US$42 million annually. Rapid increases in the numbers of tour participants in some key locations, such as in Mexico (R. de la Parra Venegas, pers. comm.), Australia (D. Robb, pers. comm.) and the Philippines (Araujo <em>et al</em>. 2014) indicate that the industry is growing fast in economic importance.",Marine,"The Whale Shark has been listed in a number of international conventions and agreements. The species is included in Annex I (Highly Migratory Species) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides a framework for the conservation and management of fisheries, and other uses of the seas. To date, no management initiatives enacted through UNCLOS have included the Whale Shark. Under the aegis of this convention, the United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks was introduced in 1995, which has potential for direct actions to be taken in relation to species such as Whale Shark, although none have yet been proposed (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Also in 1995, the FAO finalized a Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and then in 1998 the International Plan of Action for Conservation and Management of Sharks (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Davidson <em>et al</em>. (2015) noted that only 22 National Plans Of Action had been published at that time, limiting the effectiveness of this initiative.<br/><br/>The Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Bonn Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in 1999. This identifies it as a migratory species whose unfavourable conservation status would benefit from the implementation of international cooperative agreements. The CMS has provided a forum for the development of more direct conservation approaches with the adoption, in 2010, of a Memorandum of Understanding on the migratory shark species listed on this agreement, including Whale Shark. There were 40 signatories to this memorandum as of February 2016, which aims to improve scientific knowledge, ensure fisheries sustainability, protect critical habitats, movement corridors and life stages of sharks, while increasing public participation and national, regional and international cooperation towards these objectives. Whale Shark routinely move across political boundaries (summarised in Rowat and Brooks 2012), emphasising the importance of this unified approach.<br/><br/>Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 2002. This requires fishing states to demonstrate that any exports were derived from a sustainably managed population, enabling exports and imports to be monitored through a permit system. Continued presence of Whale Shark fins in Hong Kong markets, a major international transit point, despite no records in the CITES Wildlife Trade Database (http://trade.cites.org) suggests that illegal trade is occurring outside the CITES permit system. No Whale Shark fisheries have been certified as sustainable under CITES Appendix II regulations. Identifying the source of these fins, and enforcing CITES regulations, should be a key goal for managers.<br/><br/>National- or territory-level management measures for Whale Shark, via shark fishing bans or specific species protection, are in place in American Samoa, Australia, Bahamas, Belize, Cambodia, Chagos Archipelago (UK), China, Congo-Brazzaville, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, French Polynesia, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Honduras, Indonesia, India, Kuwait, Maldives, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Myanmar, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Palau, Panama, Philippines, Qatar, Reunion, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, South Africa, St Helena Island (UK), Taiwan, Thailand, Tokelau, United Arab Emirates and USA. Species-level legislative protection is an important conservation goal in countries where Whale Shark are still caught, either as a target or bycatch, including China, Mozambique, Oman, Pakistan and Tanzania.<br/><br/>While many of the larger commercial fisheries for Whale Sharks have now ceased, primarily due to rapid catch reductions, fishery and trade management is still required. The active fishery in Chinese waters is almost certainly unsustainable (Li <em>et al</em>. 2012). This national fishery is likely to be the largest single direct threat to Whale Shark recovery in the Indo-Pacific. Enforcement of existing laws for Whale Shark protection, and education and awareness programmes for fishers, will be an important component of management there.<br/><br/>Key habitats for Whale Sharks, in the form of coastal feeding locations or movement corridors, are protected in Australia (Ningaloo Reef), Belize (Gladden Spit), Costa Rica (Cocos Island), Ecuador (Galapagos Islands), Mexico (Yum-Balam Biosphere Reserve), Panama (Coiba Island) and the UK (St Helena Island). Site protection is necessary in some areas where high densities of Whale Sharks are present, as anthropogenic pressures on these sites could have disproportionate impact on subpopulation declines. Important aggregation areas for Whale Sharks in Mexico (de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011), Mozambique (Haskell <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Qatar (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013) are examples. Where Whale Sharks are routinely feeding on the surface, such as off Quintana Roo in Mexico (Motta <em>et al</em>. 2010, de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011), these areas should also be managed to reduce vessel strikes in nearby shipping lanes. This could entail either seasonal ‘go-slow zones’, or moving these routes to avoid the shark aggregations. Protection of the specific biological phenomena that influence Whale Shark presence at many aggregation sites, such as fish spawning events (Heyman <em>et al</em>. 2001, de la Parra Venegas <em>et al</em>. 2011, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2013), would also help to safeguard these habitats.<br/><br/>Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) have banned the intentional setting of purse-seine nets around Whale Shark in the Eastern Pacific, Western Central Pacific (WCP) and Indian Oceans, though not yet in the Atlantic Ocean (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, a large proportion of entangled Whale Sharks (73% in WCP; SPC-OFP 2012) were not sighted prior to nets being deployed. Therefore, fisher education and regulation on safe release practices should be a key management goal. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and Indian Ocean Tuna Commission require that best practices for safe release of Whale Sharks be followed when they are accidentally encircled (Capietto <em>et al</em>. 2014), and similar guidelines were endorsed by Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission members in 2015. All RFMOs should prohibit the deliberate setting of nets around Whale Sharks, and require that Whale Sharks be safely released when they are caught accidentally (i.e., using updated recommendations following Poisson <em>et al</em>. (2014) and the summary of guidelines by Clarke 2015). Fisher education and training initiatives would be useful to facilitate implementation.<br/><br/>Whale Shark tourism is managed through legislation in Australia, Belize, Ecuador, Mexico and St Helena Island (UK). At the time of writing, whale shark tourism was not legal in Qatar, where whale shark aggregations occur in a restricted oil field (Robinson et al. 2013). Voluntary codes of conduct exist in many other tourism locations. As tourism can increase the risk of boat strikes, due to the close proximity of boats and sharks, enforcing minimum approach distances for vessels can help to reduce shark stress (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2010) and reduce the probability of boat strike. Similarly, enforcing general codes of practice for tourism industries will help to ensure their sustainability.<br/><br/>In some areas, such as China, India, Mozambique, Taiwan and Tanzania, the close proximity of whale shark feeding areas or movement corridors with net fisheries leads to regular incidental bycatch. Restrictions on mesh size, net length and fishing locations can help to avoid whale shark catch. Training in safe release, or provision of bycatch reduction technologies (deliberate weak points in nets or other ways to avoid entanglement) could help to reduce the likelihood of shark injury or mortality when interactions occur.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
2370621,194975,Dipsosaurus dorsalis,Least Concern,,2019,2019-03-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and occurrence within protected areas. There is considerable variation in terms of both threats to the habitat and to the species across its distribution. Thus, particular subpopulations may be of concern especially as the taxonomy is re-evaluated.","Desert Iguana habitat most often consists of sandy arroyos or other open areas with loose soils, but sometimes the species occurs on nearby rocky hillsides (Norris 1953; Grismer 2002, 2004). In most of its range, Desert Iguanas are typically found in Creosote Bush desert with hummocks of loose sand and patches of firm ground with scattered rocks, whereas in southern Baja they occur in subtropical arid shrub habitats (Norris 1953, Stebbins 2003, Venegas-Barrera <em>et al</em>. 2008). These lizards seek shelter both from heat and predators in rodent burrows or rock crevices (Grismer 2002, Revell 2005), and they may climb into bushes (Stebbins 2003).<br/><br/>The Desert Iguana is generally active from April-September, with limited activity at other times of the year dependent on environmental temperature, with the exception of populations on Catalina Island that are active throughout the year (Grismer 2004, Revell 2005, Venegas-Barrera <em>et al</em>. 2008). No specific information on hibernation is available. Activity patterns also vary throughout the day; individuals tend to bask early in the morning and are more likely to enter burrows later in the day (Grismer 2004).<br/><br/>The mean home range size of Desert Iguanas varies greatly among individuals (201–4,244 m<sup>2</sup>), but also differs among sexes (M = 1,462 m<sup>2</sup>, F = 1,558 m<sup>2</sup>; Krekorian 1976). Conversely, there does not seem to be much sexual dimorphism in body size, including snout-vent length, head length, or head width (Dibble <em>et al</em>. 2008). Mean snout-vent length across the range is 115.43 mm, with a maximum of 148 mm (M. Packer <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Males in Palm Springs, CA, had a mean body mass of 70.0 g with a range from 48.4 to 92.0 g (Singleton and McGarland 2018).<br/><br/>The Desert Iguana reproduces annually across its range (Mayhew 1971, Pianka 1971). The average size at reproduction was found to be 120 mm (females) and 127 mm (males) snout-vent length (Mayhew 1971). Clutch size can range from 3–8 eggs (Norris 1953). Once laid, the length of egg incubation ranges from 45–80 days until hatch (Krekorian 1984), and hatchlings are at least 47 mm snout-vent length before day seven (Parker 1972).<br/><br/>Generally an herbivore, the majority of Desert Iguanas’ diet is made up of plants, with insects contributing little overall dietary volume (Dibble <em>et al</em>. 2008). Examples of food items include leaves, seeds, and Cardon Cactus fruit (island populations), as well as ants, termites, and beetles (Grismer 2004, Dibble <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Desert Iguanas demonstrate a wariness for predators including escape behaviour into bushes and burrows, which can vary depending on the ambient temperature and also the speed of predator approach (Cooper Jr. 2003). Common predators include both birds (Revell 2005, Carbajal-Marquez <em>et al</em>. 2012) and snake species (e.g., Sidewinder; Avila-Villegas <em>et al</em>. 2007).","In some areas, especially around the Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, suburban communities, habitat has been lost or degraded as a result of conversion to human uses (agriculture, road construction, and commercial, energy production, and residential development). Populations along busy highways and newly paved byways presumably have been reduced as a result of road mortality and destruction of burrows that desert iguanas build inside the dirt berms. These threats remain in a limited, although increasingly substantial, portion of the overall range. There are added concerns for island populations including climate change-induced severe drought and temperature extremes that are likely affecting populations adversely, as has been documented in other iguana species (<em>Sauromalus</em>) from the islands (Case 1982).","The Desert Iguana is represented in museums by hundreds of collection sites throughout its range in the United States and Mexico (e.g., see Hulse 1992). The total adult population size is unknown but probably exceeds 100,000 adults. This lizard is noted as very common in northeastern Baja California (Grismer 2002) and in similar Creosote Bush desert habitats in southeastern California, southern Nevada, and western Arizona. Since then, habitat conversion due to continued development throughout their range has led to localized declines in areas of human occupancy. Population size declines have occurred where habitats have been lost or degraded due to urbanization, particularly in the southwestern US and Baja. The species is present in several protected areas in the United States and México. Little quantitative information is available on population densities; however, it is known that density across the distribution is not uniform (C. Malone pers. obs.). One study calculated juvenile densities in Arizona, which fluctuated from 11/hectare in late spring to 20/hectare in fall (Parker 1972).",Unknown,"The Desert Iguana ranges widely in the southwestern United States, northwestern mainland Mexico, and the Baja Peninsula. Its range encompasses: southern Nevada; extreme southwestern Utah along the Virgin River in the vicinity of Beaver Dam Wash; northwest, central, and southern Arizona; southern California east of the Sierra Nevada and coast mountain ranges; southward into Mexico through northeastern Baja California, all of southern Baja California (excluding most of the Vizcaíno Desert), and western Sonora to northern Sinaloa. This lizard occurs on many islands in the Gulf of California and on Magdalena and Santa Margarita islands along the Pacific coast of Baja California, occurring most densely in sand habitats (Norris 1953, Hulse 1992, Grismer 2002, Stebbins 2003). The elevational range extends from below sea level in desert sinks (~ 40 m bsl) to about 1,520 m asl (Stebbins 2003).",<p>There is very limited pet trade data from Mexico and the United States.

Specifically, its range extends into several national parks and monuments, and federal wilderness areas (e.g., Mojave National Park, Joshua Tree National Monument, Anza Borrego Desert State Park, Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Cabeza Prieta Wilderness, and Ironwood Forest National Monument). In Mexico, parts of the lizard's range is in the Bahía de Loreto National Park and the Área de Protección de Flora y Fauna Islas del Golfo de California which confers federal protection. The island populations are also included in the Gulf of California regional management plan for the protection of flora and fauna (Carabias Lillo <em>et al</em>. 2000), as well as a management plan for the Bahia de Loreto National Park (Bermúdez-Almada <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>More research is needed concerning population sizes and trends, as well as threat assessment throughout the range.

Since that time, particularly in the last six years, sufficient information has been collected to review its status. As such, an updated assessment was the highest priority recommendation for this species in the 2010 IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group Action Plan update (Shirley 2010).<br/><br/>The two regions (West and Central Africa) are completely isolated from each other underpinning the impending species split in this taxon. Central African habitats and populations do not seem to be fragmented despite some evidence for genetic isolation between major basins (Shirley 2013). In contrast, West African populations are highly fragmented due to a combination of severely fragmented forest habitats and the geology of the region and species-specific habitat use. For example, most major forested waterways throughout West Africa, especially in the Upper Guinea forest region, run north to south and show virtually no longitudinal communication except through the ocean which does not seem to be frequented by the Slender-snouted Crocodile.<br/><br/>The Slender-snouted Crocodile, particularly throughout West Africa, is incredibly shy and susceptible to human disturbance. As human populations throughout its distribution grow and occupy what were previously gallery forests and other forested wetland habitats this species is pushed out or hunted to local extinctions. In West Africa the extent of occurrence in the north of this species range has already declined drastically due to aridification and human settlement, it is projected that this species will likely be lost from the non-true forested areas (i.e., the wooded, gallery savanna areas in the north) of its West African range in the next 10–20 years if it currently still exists in these northern extremes. Additionally, surveys prior to 2005 already suggested that the Slender-snouted Crocodile may no longer occur in the Lake Mweru basin or throughout Lake Tanganyika. While very little historic survey data exists, that which does and can be compared to contemporary surveys (e.g., the Ogooué River and N’dougou Lagoon in Gabon – Behra 1987 and M. Shirley unpub. data, Côte d'Ivoire - Waitkuwait 1989, Shirley <em>et al</em>. 2009) show that populations are declining.<br/><br/>Long-running bushmeat studies in Gabon, Congo, and Democratic Republic of the Congo continually find adult Slender-snouted Crocodiles for sale in markets. &#160;In contrast, this species has not been detected in the bushmeat trade in West Africa for some time indicating it is not reliably available as a target species. Based on the current, estimated subpopulation declines and local extinctions throughout the Sahel, Lake Mweru, and Lake Tanganyika we anticipate these subpopulations to become extinct within one generation into the future. &#160;Additionally, while the Sene-Gambia subpopulation is currently well protected, any loss of will to continually protect the chimpanzee colonies will result in near instantaneous extinction of this subpopulation. Continuing decline in locationsThis species is significantly reduced in at least the Sahel zone and Lake Tanganyika and Mweru locations with anticipated complete extirpation in the near future. There is also continuing decline in the extent and quality of the habitat based on deforestation and forest degradation throughout this species range, especially in West Africa (Megevand 2013), which has resulted in sedimentation effecting prey species populations, as well as human settlement/encroachment and reduction in breeding habitat.<br/><br/>Based on known, extensive trade in crocodile skins and other products, as well as habitat alteration and human encroachment, since 1938 (three generations is 75 years), the Slender-snouted Crocodile meets the criteria for listing as Critically Endangered as it is inferred to have undergone a past population reduction of between 50-80% based on direct observation, loss of range and suitable habitat, direct exploitation and the impacts of introduced species (criterion A2acde). The reduction is closer to 50–60% for Central Africa and 70–90% for West Africa. There is no reason to expect the decline to slow, hence future reduction over the next 75 years is projected to be between 60–90% based on ongoing loss of range and habitat, exploitation and competition with other introduced crocodilian species (criterion A3cde). The future reduction is hard to quantify mostly due to extremely different threats and levels of active protection between West and Central Africa. On a global basis, however, this species is expected to lose 100% of mature individuals outside of protected areas and 60–90% inside of protected areas where fishing, hunting, and forest clearing remain issues. In West Africa subpopulations have already been reduced to the point where even small perturbations will result in localized extinctions and the state of protected area management (where most individuals are confined today) suggests that these reductions will continue into the future. For example, this species continues to exist in The Gambia solely due to the level of protection afforded the artificial chimpanzee colonies on the islands on which it breeds in the interior of the River Gambia National Park - it does not occur up or downstream of these core islands (M. Shirley unpub. data). Additionally, with increasing habitat conversion the West African Crocodile (<em>Crocodylus suchus</em>) will be able to occupy previously exclusive <em>M. cataphractus</em> habitat and out compete the latter species. Without intervention, in Central Africa the only remaining subpopulations at the end of three generations will be restricted to well-managed protected areas and remote areas of Gabon. In West Africa this species is anticipated to go completely extinct without significant revisions in protected area policy and management, as well as assisted efforts such as reintroductions.<br/><br/>Looking at a combination of the information on past and future reductions (i.e. subcriterion A4acde) it is estimated that population reduction would be between 50–80%, once again resulting in a Critically Endangered listing. This inference (for the past) and projection (for the future) is based on the period 1960-2035 and incorporates the extensive, post WWII skin trading that was happening throughout West and Central Africa and did not slow down until the mid-1980s. The majority of this trade was in Nile Crocodile products, but in certain parts of this range (i.e., Gabon, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, and the Congos) the Slender-snouted Crocodile was actually the primary traded species or heavily incidentally impacted. It is suspected that the slowdown of this trade in the 1980s was largely due to the significant reduction in crocodile populations (i.e., reduced efficiency and hunting output) and only partially due to international (e.g., CITES) and national legislative policies. From 2013 to 2035 it is estimated that continued habitat loss, habitat conversion for agriculture (e.g., palm oil and rubber developments throughout Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone), and increasing human pressures on natural resources (notably freshwater fisheries) will greatly increase this species extinction risk.","<a name=""habi""></a><a name=""habi"">  <p></p><p></p><p>The Slender-snouted Crocodile is a narrow-snouted, medium-sized species reaching a maximum length of up to 4 m (Brazaitis 1973), though individuals over 3-3.5 m are now rare.&#160;</p><p><br/></p><p>Historically, <em>M. cataphractus</em> was widely distributed throughout West and Central Africa, but recent surveys suggest that its distribution has changed as a result of local extirpations. The most comprehensive ecological studies on wild <em>M. cataphractus</em> are that of Waitkuwait (1989) and Shirley (2013, unpub. data). This species prefers forested rivers and other densely vegetated bodies of water (e.g. reservoirs and freshwater lagoons), but has also been found in sparsely vegetated, gallery habitats within savanna woodland (Waitkuwait 1989, Shirley <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p><p><br/></p><p>At the start of the annual wet season females lay an average of 16 eggs in mound nests composed of organic matter at the fringe of aquatic habitats. Nests are constructed at the base of trees at the edge of undisturbed forested wetland habitats, though some nests have also been encountered in cacao plantations in Côte d'Ivoire (Shirley 2007) suggesting a reasonable tolerance to disturbance when replacement ""forest"" habitat is available. The nesting season broadly overlaps that of the sympatric Dwarf Crocodile (<em>Osteolaemus</em> sp.), though there appears to be partitioning of nest habitat between the two species, and <em>M. cataphractus</em> has a more condensed nesting season (Waitkuwait 1989). Egg size is very large relative to female size and hatchlings tend to be larger than those of other crocodile species (Waitkuwait 1985, 1989; Thorbjarnarson 1996).</p><p><br/></p><p>Like most crocodilians, young animals feed primarily on small fish and a variety of invertebrates; adult animals are primarily piscivorous although they have been observed to consume mammals (Pauwels <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2007), turtles and birds (M. Shirley pers. obs.). Gabonese fishermen reported it feeding on aquatic snakes (Pauwels&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002). While there is nothing specific documented in the literature, <em>M. cataphractus</em> is known to be a very vocal species perhaps indicating a much more structured social hierarchy or breeding ethology than is presently known. An alternative hypothesis for their highly vocal behaviour has been proposed where adult M. cataphractus may live solitary lifestyles and their vocalizations are necessary for territory demarcation and finding mates. Both of these hypotheses have yet to be tested thoroughly.</p><p></p><p></p></a>","<p>Population decline in the past has been attributed to the commercial skin hunting associated with the decline of <em>C</em><em>. niloticus</em> populations throughout their sympatric ranges, though available evidence suggests that <em>M. cataphractus </em>was not directly targeted until the economic extinction of the Nile Crocodile, as well as subsistence hunting and habitat destruction (Abercrombie 1978, Pooley 1982). Currently, hunting for skins in Central and West Africa has abated, largely as the result of declines in crocodile populations and the availability of skins, but to a lesser extent from restrictions on international trade established by CITES (Thorbjarnarson 1999). Modern anthropogenic pressures impeding the recovery of <em>M. cataphractus</em> populations include small-scale, subsistence fisheries (resulting in a reduced prey base and incidental mortality in fishing nets) and habitat modification (where large tracts of forest are cleared for cacao and rubber plantations or settlements), as well as on-going limited hunting for the bushmeat markets.</p>","<p>Surveys prior to 1998 painted a grim picture for <em>C. cataphractus</em>, particularly in West Africa and the extreme south and east of its distribution (e.g., Angola, Zambia, Tanzania). The species was recorded as severely depleted in Liberia (Kofron 1992) and Nigeria (Dore 1991, 1996; Akani <em>et al</em>. 1998a, b) and likely extinct in Gambia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau (Jones 1991), Togo (Behra 1993), Chad and Angola (Ross 1998). It is possibly extinct in Equatorial Guinea where there is no clear evidence of the species’ presence since the 1980s (Lasso <em>et al</em>. 2002). Simbotwe (1993) suggested that Zambia was probably the southern range limit for this species and that changing habitat conditions in the Luapula River, Lake Mweru and Lake Tanganyika may mean <em>C. cataphractus</em> is now extinct in Zambia. However, other researchers suggested that <em>C. cataphractus</em> may have been common in Lake Mweru (Taylor 1998) and, while sparse, could still be found in the Luapula Basin (Thomas 1998) as late as 1991. There are still occasional reports of sightings from Tanzania (see below). Disruption of habitat through removal of riverside vegetation and direct harvest for meat and skins were the major threats in this eastern limit of its range. In contrast, populations in Côte d’Ivoire (Waitkuwait 1989), Gabon, Republic of Congo and Central African Republic (Behra 1987, 1994) were thought to be somewhat depleted but not imminently threatened.</p><p><br/></p>  <p>Since 1998, much additional survey data has become available for <em>C. cataphractus</em>, though with the exception of a few key countries much of what is available is composed of incidental observations from general biodiversity reports focused on other taxa. For example, the Malagarasi-Muyovozi Wetland Complex in Tanzania was designated as a Ramsar Wetland in 2000 partially on the basis that <em>C. cataphractus</em>&#160;was still present. Survey data from Nigeria (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000), Benin (Kpera 2003), Liberia (G. Miller, unpublished data), Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire (Shirley <em>et al</em>. 2009), and Gambia and Senegal (M. Shirley unpub. data) suggest that <em>C. cataphractus </em>is all but extinct in West Africa (i.e., west of the Cross River, Nigeria) with fewer than 50 individuals and five adults detected in all these surveys. However, recent reports from Central Africa have found a number of localized, robust populations in the Ogooue River and coastal basins in Gabon and the Lac Tele region of Republic of Congo (Thorbjarnarson and Eaton 2004, Eaton and Barr 2005, Pauwels 2006, Shirley unpub. data). Surveys in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2011 found small populations in the Ituri River and upper Lomami River regions and it is suspected that the vast area of uninhabited wilderness within the arc of the Congo River may support significant populations of this species (Shirley 2010; M. Shirley unpub. data).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>As the species is currently recognized it is distributed throughout western tropical Africa from Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru in the east/southeast to the Gambia River in the west (Shirley 2010).

It is likely extirpated from Angola, Chad,&#160;Equatorial Guinea, and Zambia.</p>","<p>Population decline in the past has been attributed to the commercial skin hunting associated with the decline of <em>Crocodylus. niloticus</em> populations throughout their sympatric ranges in this region, though available evidence suggests that&#160;<em>M.&#160;cataphractus</em> was not directly targeted until the economic extinction of the Nile Crocodile, as well as subsistence hunting and habitat destruction (Abercrombie 1978, Pooley 1982). Currently, hunting for skins in Central and West Africa has abated, largely as the result of declines in crocodile populations and the availability of skins, but to a lesser extent from restrictions on international trade established by CITES (Thorbjarnarson 1999). Modern anthropogenic pressures impeding the recovery of <em>M. cataphractus</em> populations include small-scale, subsistence fisheries (resulting in a reduced prey base and incidental mortality in fishing nets) and habitat modification (where large tracts of forest are cleared for cacao and rubber plantations or settlements), as well as on-going limited hunting for the bushmeat markets.</p><p><br/></p>In most countries the management of <em>M. cataphractus</em> is based on the legal protection of wild populations; however, this legislation exists without enforcement even in many protected areas. There are no “sustainable utilization” programmes based on <em>M. cataphractus</em> in West and Central Africa. Regulated hunting was formerly reported as legal in Chad, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of the Congo (Ross 1998); however, <em>M. cataphractus</em> is by all accounts now extinct in at least two of these countries (Chad and Togo; possibly Sierra Leone) and the other three countries likely experience heavy illegal harvesting despite legal mandates for protection. Currently, no countries hold a CITES export quota for this species, though the Republic of Congo renewed its annual CITES export quota for the years 1990 to 1992, but the permit has since lapsed (Ross 1998). There is no known ranching or farming operations for <em>M. cataphractus</em> for the purposes of utilization or conservation.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),To date the only known conservation actions for this species are not targeted specifically at it but rather at communities and landscapes (e.g. national parks and national legislation).

3104105,61416,Squalus cubensis,Least Concern,,2020,2019-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Cuban Dogfish (<em>Squalus cubensis</em>) is a small (to 60 cm total length) deep-water shark with a widespread distribution in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans ranging from North Carolina (USA), throughout the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. Records&#160;from Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina should be re-evaluated as they may come from an undescribed species. It inhabits the continental shelves and slopes from 50 to 904 m depth. It is suspected to be taken as discarded bycatch of deep-water demersal trawl and hook and line fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Overall, the bulk of the species’ depth range and geographic range is unfished and the population trend is estimated to be increasing in the Gulf of Mexico by 3.1% over three generation lengths (27 years).&#160;There is no evidence of population decline and the species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold, and the Cuban Dogfish  is assessed as Least Concern.","The Cuban Dogfish is a demersal shark that inhabits the outer continental  shelves and slopes from 50–904 m depth (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2013, Shipley <em>et al.</em> 2017). This maximum reported depth is from Exuma Sound and may be inflated due to the very deep thermocline of the sound. Similar increases in maximum depth have been for other deep-water sharks from Exuma Sound (R.D. Grubbs unpubl. data 2020). The depth range of Cuban Dogfish in the northern Gulf of Mexico is 50–430 m and may be more representative of the normal range for this species (C.F. Cotton unpubl. data 2019). It reaches a  maximum size of approximately 60 cm total length (TL) (Jones&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013, C.F. Cotton unpubl. data 2019). Males mature at 38 cm TL and females mature at 47 cm TL (Jones <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).  Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with a litter size of 1–4 pups (Jones&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, C.F. Cotton unpubl. data 2020). Generation length was estimated to be 9 years, based on unpublished age and growth data&#160;(Rolfe <em>et al. </em>2015, C.F. Cotton unpubl. data 2019).","There is little information available on catch or bycatch of this species, mainly because there are few deep-water fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Approximately 490 sharks were reported as bycatch from 2006–2012 in the reef-fish demersal longline  fishery observer data and 91% of those are released alive (Gulak and  Carlson 2013). This species may also be caught in directed  tilefish fisheries that operate as deep as 300 m&#160;and it is reported among the bycatch of&#160;as the royal  red shrimp trawl fishery in the US Gulf of Mexico that operates at  depths of 250–550 m (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007, Driggers <em>et al.</em> 2015, E. Scott-Denton pers. comm. 12/05/2020). Demersal trawling occurs on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007). Observer coverage in the royal red shrimp fishery has also been low (Scott-Denton <em>et al.</em> 2012) and so bycatch information is scarce and reported as presence/absence. Information is lacking on the post-release survival from commercial gear, however, a study conducted in the Bahamas reported post-release survival from research longlines of around 50% (Talwar <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/></span></span>","Population trend data are available from two surveys: the first from a nominal deep-water longline catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) survey in the Gulf of Mexico (Florida State University,&#160;R.D.

Cotton and unpubl. data 2019) and the second from a nominal CPUE small pelagic trawl survey&#160;in the northern Gulf of Mexico conducted between 2002–2013 (NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Fisheries Science Centre, Mississippi Laboratories unpubl. data 2019).&#160;Population trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2020, Winker <em>et al.</em> 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<p></p>The trend analysis of Grubbs and Cotton deep-water longline nominal CPUE revealed an increase of 24.9% over that timespan for 2011–2018 (7 years), although the error  associated with the model was quite large. The trend analysis of (NMFS) small pelagic trawl survey for  2002–2013 (11 years)  revealed a decrease of 3.0% over that timespan,  although the error  associated with the model was quite large. To  estimate an overall population trend, these two models were combined and projected increases of 7.2% over one generation length (9 years) and 3.1% over three generation lengths (27 years). Notwithstanding high error in the model, the combined model indicates an  increase in population in the Gulf of Mexico.<br/><br/>There is little information throughout the rest of this species range, probably because there are few deep-water fisheries throughout this species range. This species has been recorded and is occasionally caught in artisanal handline fisheries in the southern Gulf of Mexico (<span class=""text surname"">Pérez-Jiménez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;There are generally few deep-water shark fisheries throughout the Caribbean.

As such, we reaffirm the prior assessment of the taxonomically restricted Mojave Desert Tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, as Critically Endangered, and add criterion “a” for direct population observations: CR A2abce+A4abce. The previously defined widespread species&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu lato</em>)&#160;was last assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1996; a separate assessment currently in progress by the TFTSG for the Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai </em>(previously considered part of <em>G. agassizii</em>)&#160;has provisionally assessed that species as Vulnerable.","The life history of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is typical of long-lived chelonians and has been reviewed by Berry and Murphy (2019). Tortoises require 17–20 years to reach sexual maturity at a straight-line carapace length (CL) of 18 cm or more (Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, Medica <em>et al</em>. 2012). Variation in years is dependent on desert region, frequency of droughts, and quality of available forage. In the northern part of the geographic range, females smaller than 20.9 cm were not reproducing (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998).&#160; Maximum lifespan was estimated by Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) at 75 years, but few live beyond 50 yrs in the wild (Germano 1992). Generation time was estimated to be 20–32 years (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, USFWS 1994). Based on data from three desert regions, mean sizes of females ranges from 21.4 to 23.1 cm, whereas the mean sizes of males ranged from 24.3 to 24.9 cm; the largest desert tortoises on record, a male, reached 38.1 cm carapace length (Stebbins 2003), whereas a female was 37.4 cm, but these animals were exceptions (Berry and Murphy 2019).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Mature females may lay clutches of one to 10 eggs in up to three clutches per year in spring and early summer; in some years, some females do not lay eggs (Rostal <em>et al</em>. 1994, Henen 1997, Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wallis <em>et al</em>. 1999, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2015). Annual fecundity ranges from 0 to 16 eggs (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2015). Several factors may affect egg production: site, year, size of female, size and number of eggs, and available water and protein from precipitation and forage in the year preceding egg laying, as well as the year eggs are laid (Henen 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Incubation times for eggs range from 67 to 104 days (Burge 1977, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hatching success varies and appears to depend on year, location of the nest, and whether it is the first or second clutch. Eggs may be infertile or broken during laying (e.g., 12%; Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). Many nests are destroyed by predators before hatching and the loss of eggs (and nests) varies by year (Turner et al. 1987); they estimated an average loss of 37.1% of nests in a multi-year study. Hatching success in intact nests, undisturbed by predators, has been shown to vary from 73 to 100% (McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Rostal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bjurlin and Bissonette 2004, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises inhabit desert scrub habitats, including saltbush, creosote bush, Joshua Trees and Mojave yuccas, and microphyll woodlands with ironwood, palo verde, desert willow, and smoke trees (Berry and Murphy 2019). In the northeastern part of their geographic range, they occur in an ecotone between the Mojave and Great Basin deserts with sand sagebrush and junipers. Actual occurrences tend to be in valleys, alluvial fans, bajadas, and ephemeral stream channels, although tortoises can be found in low sand dunes and on steep slopes of mesas and cliffs (Berry and Murphy 2019).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises are herbivorous and selective in their choice of plant species (Jennings 1993, Oftedal 2002, Oftedal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jennings and Berry 2015). They primarily eat forbs when available. In years of abundant precipitation, they are selective feeders and prefer specific species of annuals and herbaceous perennials in the legume, mallow, borage, aster, four o’clock, and cactus families (as well as other families). Although they eat grasses, a diet solely of grasses is deficient in nutrients and is likely to inhibit growth and survival, especially in neonate, juveniles, and immature tortoises (Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The quality and quantity of preferred plant foods has diminished because of continuing invasion of non-native annual grasses and forbs and increased fire associated with the highly combustible&#160;non-native grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).&#160;<br/><br/>Annual survival and mortality of adults is dependent on sex, size of the tortoise, frequency and severity of droughts, numbers and types of anthropogenic uses, location, and decade of study. In a multi-year study in the eastern Mojave Desert, annual survivorship of juveniles increased with size, ranging from 0.767 when &lt;6.0 cm to 0.861 when 6.0 to 17.9 cm (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). When tortoises reach breeding age at an estimated 18.0 cm, survival rates were 0.87 to 0.944. Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported an annual survival of 0.883 for adults at Joshua Tree National Park. In a study in the Colorado Desert, Agha <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated adult survival at a wind-turbine energy site (0.96) and an adjacent area (0.92). At two sites in the eastern Mojave Desert, Longshore <em>et al</em>. (2003) reported annual survival of adults of 0.985 and 0.829, with the lower survival rate at a site affected by drought.<br/><br/>Woodbury and Hardy (1948) estimated that 1% of adults died per year in a population mostly comprised of adults. In the northeastern Mojave Desert, Turner <em>et al</em>. (1984) reported mortality rates of 18.4% in a year of drought and 4.4% in a normal year. In the western Mojave Desert, death rates were lowest at a protected Research Natural Area (2.8%/yr) and highest in critical habitat (20.4%/yr). At Joshua Tree National Park, the mortality rate was 11.7% (Freilich <em>et al.</em> 2000), and in Red Rock State Park, 67% (Berry et al. 2008). In a demographic study of tortoises at 21 sites in the central Mojave Desert, mortality rates of adults ranged from 1.9 to 95.2% (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) predicted an annual rate of population increase of <em>ca</em>. 2% in a model based on a tortoise subpopulation in the eastern Mojave Desert between 1977 and 1985. By 2000, this subpopulation had declined precipitously, apparently due to disease (see Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2002) estimated the recruitment rate of young tortoises into the adult subpopulation at 0.092 in a plot in Joshua Tree National Park. This number of tortoises on this plot was thought to be stable between 1991 and 1995, but later declined (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>Gopherus agassizii</em>&#160;faces&#160;multiple threats to individuals, populations, and habitat (for annotated bibliographies of reports and published papers, see Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980; Berry 1984; USFWS 1990, 1994, 2010, 2011; Grover and DeFalco 1995; Bury and Luckenbach 2002; von Senckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002; Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2011; Lovich and Ennen 2013a; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015; Berry and Murphy 2019). Recent articles document further examples of threats (Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b,c). Much of the information with numerous references are contained in Berry and Murphy (2019). Substantial tortoise habitat was already lost to cities, towns, settlements, agriculture, energy developments, and military bases in the 20th century, and continuing habitat loss and degradation, combined with high mortality rates in dwindling low-density populations due to disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis), road and off-road vehicle-induced mortality, subsidized predators (e.g., ravens), poaching for pets, and mortality from increasing droughts associated with climate change, are threatening most remaining populations of Desert Tortoises (summarized in Berry and Murphy 2019). The majority of desert tortoise populations are currently considered non-viable because of the low density of adults and their existence in isolated and fragmented pieces of habitat (Berry 1984, USFWS 2010, Allison and McLuckie 2018, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).&#160;<br/><br/>Many threats are cumulative in nature and interact synergistically with others. By rating them separately in the Standard Threats Classification Scheme below, the severity of threats and their negative impacts are not described in full measure. One of the limitations of the classification scheme for threats are the ratings for severity. Severity is associated with declines (or not) by percent over 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer. For species such as desert tortoises with long generation times (<em>ca</em>. 20–30 years), this may be 60 to 90 or more years. Here we provide a detailed and expanded Threats Classification Scheme for <em>G. agassizii</em>.<br/><br/><strong>Detailed Threats Classification Scheme<br/><br/></strong>Classification Level<br/><br/>&#160; a. Examples<br/>&#160; b. Timing and Scope<br/><br/>1.1 Housing &amp; urban areas, towns, settlements, ranches<br/>&#160; a. Desert cities, towns, settlements, scattered homes in rural areas, desert land entry, e.g., Inyokern, Ridgecrest, Red Mountain, Trona, Boron, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, Lucerne Valley, Ft. Irwin, Barstow, Daggett, Mountain Pass, Joshua Tree, Twentynine Palms, Vidal Junction, Ludlow, Amboy, Needles, Las Vegas, St. George, Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, Parker, Blythe, El Centro,&#160;Stateline, Las Vegas, Mesquite, St. George.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, disappearance of tortoises and habitat; 20% of geographic range. Loss of habitat from widespread and rapidly growing and expanding cities, towns, and settlements associated with high levels of human population growth in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts and loss and degradation of adjacent habitat (Hughson 2009, U.S. Census Bureau 2010). In the northwest and southwest portions of the geographic range, tortoise populations are locally extinct, absent from valleys and fans and in low densities on military bases.<br/><br/>1.2 Commercial &amp; Industrial<br/>&#160; a. Airports and landing strips, military bases, solar and wind farms.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, loss of tortoises and habitat; 8% of geographic range. Development and use of multiple airports, landing strips, several large military bases with ground disturbing activities (military manoeuvres), and solar and wind farms (with associated transmission lines and roads)&#160;result in degradation and loss of substantial habitat in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts.<br/><br/>1.3 Residential &amp; commercial; golf courses, tourism, recreation<br/>&#160; a. Golf courses are associated with cities and towns that currently exist or are expanding within or near Desert Tortoise habitat (e.g., Las Vegas, Henderson). Vehicle-oriented recreation and visitation are very high in many parts of both deserts including what is now critical habitat, several State Parks and National Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, museums, and other points of interest.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Loss and degradation of habitat, illegal collecting of tortoises: 30%. The high levels of visitor use pose severe threats to <em>G. agassizii</em> throughout remaining habitat as well as in critical habitat. For example, at Lake Mead National Recreation, annual records of visitors from 1946 was &gt;1 million visitors per year; by 2018 more than 7.5 million visits occurred (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/"" style=""color: purple;"">https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/</a>). In parts of critical habitat in the western Mojave Desert, visitor use is very high, e.g., visits and visitor days recorded annually from 2008–2018 ranged from 55,874 to 94,474 visits and 26,218 to 90,445 visitor days per year (USBLM 2019). Visitor use, particularly vehicle-oriented use, is very difficult to control; a substantial portion occurs off-highway and designated trails.&#160;Off-road vehicle recreational uses are associated with higher rates of deaths from gunshots in tortoises occurring in areas with high visitor use days (Berry 1986, 2020a).<br/><br/>2.1.3 Agriculture: Agro-industry farming<br/>&#160; a. Farms for cotton, alfalfa, pistachio, goat-nut, and other crops and dry farming in parts of the geographic range (e.g., Fremont, Antelope, Indian Wells, Victor, Apple, Lucerne, Mojave River, Chuckwalla and Virgin River valleys, bordering the Colorado River).<br/>&#160; b. Severe, cleared land, local areas, often expansive, throughout the geographic range. Historic and ongoing. Habitat and tortoises lost, 10%. Farming began very early (late 1800s) and continues to the present. Farming has negatively affected the water table locally, causing subsidence and fissures to develop in at least one area (Berry 1984), as well as altering vegetation in the vicinity. Habitat cleared for farming generally is used for industrial purposes, e.g., solar or off-road vehicle recreation after abandonment. Both agricultural and industrial uses are associated with influx and proliferation of non-native plants onto adjacent, high quality desert tortoise habitat and protected areas.<br/><br/>2.3.2 and 2.3.3 Agriculture: livestock farming &amp; ranching<br/>&#160; a. Cattle ranching, sheep grazing and driveways, allotments, licenses, and leases (often on federal lands); growing herds of feral burros and expansion into critical habitat.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Moderate to severe, historic (from 1850s), ongoing; 80% of the geographic range affected. Grazing of livestock and use of driveways was widespread and often intensive throughout the geographic range until the Taylor Grazing Act in 1932. Livestock grazing was widespread after that time but managed as an important desert use (e.g., Berry 1984, USBLM 1980). In 1990, after the tortoise was listed as threatened, sheep grazing continued but was excluded from critical habitat. Cattle grazing continued throughout much of critical habitat and still occurs in an estimated 17% of critical habitat (USFWS 2010). Feral burros also graze in tortoise habitats and are encroaching into one critical habitat (USFWS 2010; Berry et al. 2020c). Livestock cause degradation and loss of habitat through development of piospheres, trampling, altering cover, composition of shrubs and forage plants available for tortoises to eat (Webb and Stielstra 1979, Fleischner 1994, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Abella 2008, Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016). The disturbances created by grazing contributes to growth and proliferation of non-native, fire-prone, invasive grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992).<br/><br/>3.1 Energy production &amp; mining: oil and gas<br/>&#160; a. Oil and gas, drilling and exploration.<br/>&#160; b. Medium severity, local areas, &lt;1% of geographic range. Exploratory drilling has occurred in tortoise habitat and has left degraded and cleared areas of &lt; 1-2 ha, with spoil piles, drilling waste, and trash from the drilling operations spread over the area. These sites became focal points for camping and vehicle-oriented recreation, enlarging over time (K.H. Berry pers. obs.).<br/><br/>3.2 Energy production &amp; mining: mining and quarrying<br/>&#160; a. Small and large mines, exploratory pits, bulldozed areas, shafts, and major mines; quarries.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation on a local or regional scale; 5%. Mining on small and large scales began in the late 1800s, killing tortoises and destroying habitat. Roads were constructed to access potential mining areas and districts (Mojave,&#160;Rand, Atolia, Goldstone, Calico, Mountain Pass). Tortoises fall into pits and shafts and were killed. Some mines cover 7.8 km<sup>2</sup> or more and their influence can expand beyond that. Gold mines are associated with spread of mercury and arsenic in soils and plants far beyond the source (e.g., &gt;12 km), transported by wind and water (Chaffee&#160;and Berry 2006; Kim <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014). Tortoises are negatively affected by these elemental toxicants with poor health; these toxicants were reported in livers, integument, lungs, etc.&#160;(Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, Selzer and Berry 2005, Foster <em>et a</em>l. 2009).<br/><br/>3.3 Energy production &amp; mining: renewable energy<br/>&#160; a. Windfarms, photovoltaic, solar fields; new utility and transmission lines, power poles and towers with adjacent roads accompany these developments.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, future. Severe degradation and loss locally over large areas, 5% over the geographic range. Windfarms occur in tortoise habitat, generally on slopes or on hills and small mountains. Solar panels have been constructed on abandoned agricultural fields or in low density or marginal habitat. However, some projects were built in prime habitat, causing loss of habitat and displacement of tortoises. Solar and wind energy is a growing industry with losses of &gt;106 km<sup>2 </sup>as of 2019 (Mark Massar, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>4.1 Transportation and service corridors: roads &amp; railroads<br/>&#160; a. Freeways, 2-lane highways, county gravel or dirt roads, and roads to points of interest; railroads (two major) and several spurs with associated dirt roads and tower lay-down areas for power towers and poles.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe loss and degradation of habitat. 5% throughout the geographic range. Roads were developed in the late 1800s and have proliferated and widened into freeways since that time. Several major freeways and state highways cross the geographic range. Importantly many more dirt roads exist to points of interest (e.g., mines, mining areas, water troughs and water sources, outlying rural areas, recreation areas). Tortoise populations are depleted on either side of highways and well-used roads for distances of &gt;4,000 m (von Seckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002). A very small portion of these roads and highways have tortoise-proof fencing.<br/><br/>4.2 Transportation &amp; service corridors: utility &amp; service lines<br/>&#160; a. Telephone and electric poles and lines; major transmission lines and corridors.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, moderate to severe. Telephone poles and electric poles and lines usually parallel major or minor paved and dirt roads and extend from towns and cities&#160;into remote areas to provide service to agricultural developments, mines, wind and solar farms and individual residences or small settlements. Electric transmission lines cross many parts of the geographic range, including critical habitat (critical habitat alone: 1,634 km of lines in corridors, total area of corridors, 1,743.5 km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2010).&#160; These corridors are accompanied by dirt roads and spurs to the towers. Often corridors contain several sets of towers and electrical lines. Utility lines also include ground disturbance from fibre optic cables, aqueducts, and gas lines, all of which disturb tortoise habitat. Utility poles and transmission lines have allowed for spread of predators (Common Raven, Red-tailed Hawk) into remote parts of the desert, because they make use of the towers and poles for perching and nesting, leading to increased predation on tortoises (Knight and Kawashima 1993, Anderson and Berry 2019).<br/><br/>4.4 Transportation and service corridors: flight paths or military use<p>&#160; a. Commercial, non-commercial, and Department of Defence flight paths.<br/>&#160; b. Numerous, ongoing. Flight paths are minor or no impact if not associated with release of ordnance (bombing ranges). The noise may have effects on wildlife, including tortoises (e.g., Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>5.1.1 Biological resource use: hunting &amp; trapping terrestrial animals: intentional use (species is the target)<br/>&#160; a. Illegal collecting of <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>for commercial sale, food, cultural purposes, and for international trade, etc.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Tortoises have been and continue to be collected for pets, food, tourism,&#160;commercial sale, and cultural purposes, although such collection has been unlawful since 1939 (Berry 1984, Berry <em>et al</em>. 1996, Berry and Murphy 2019, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.1 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: recreational activities<br/>&#160; a. Visits to State and National Parks and Preserves, National Recreation Areas, federal and state lands, private lands, and Open Recreation Use Areas (unrestricted vehicle play areas) by vehicle-oriented recreationists.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe impacts regionally and locally, especially in the western, central, and southern Mojave Desert and growing in the western Sonoran Desert; associated with proximity to cities, towns, and settlements. Formerly populated with Desert Tortoises, several intensively used areas are now severely degraded and have few if any tortoises (e.g., Bury and Luckenbach 2002, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014a, USFWS 2015, Berry and Murphy 2019). Vehicle-oriented visitation is exceptionally high, ranging from &gt;50,000 to 86,550 between 2008 and 2018 annually in some regions of the Mojave Desert (USBLM 2019). Other parts of the desert and critical habitat are also experiencing growing numbers of visitors. Deaths of desert tortoises from road kills and shooting is higher in areas with high levels of vehicle-oriented visitation (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.2 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: war, civil unrest &amp; military exercises<br/>&#160; a. World War II and subsequent. Military manoeuvres across substantial areas of habitat in the western Sonoran and eastern Mojave deserts to train troops using tanks and other vehicles for the war in North Africa. Since the 1960s, military manoeuvres with armoured vehicles in extensive areas in the western, southern, and central Mojave deserts; aerial bombing training in limited areas in the western Sonoran Desert.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Military manoeuvres in 1942 resulted in severely degraded habitat (compacted soils, damaged desert pavements, altered vegetation, including forage available for desert tortoises. Lands disturbed in 1942 have not recovered after 60 years (Prose 1985, 1986; Prose and Wilshire 2000). Similar disturbances have occurred and continue to occur in tortoise populations and habitat at military installations in the southern and central Mojave Desert. In the early 2000s, expansion of the Fort Irwin military installation in the central Mojave Desert caused loss and degradation of 760 km<sup>2</sup> of tortoise habitat and <em>ca</em>. 304 km<sup>2</sup> of the lost habitat was part of critical habitat (USFWS 2010, Berry and Murphy 2019). An estimated <em>ca</em>. 300 km<sup>2</sup> will be lost with additional, ongoing expansion of the same base. The western expansion of the Marine Corps base at 29 Palms caused hundreds of tortoises to be translocated and habitat lost in the southern Mojave Desert (USDD 2017).<br/><br/>6.3 Work and other activities: law enforcement, illegal immigrants, species research, vandalism<br/>&#160; a. Border patrol agents and illegal immigrants travel cross-country by foot and vehicle in tortoise habitat in the southern border range. Vandalism, specifically wanton shooting or killing of tortoises has affected some populations more than others, probably associated with higher visitor use and vehicle-oriented recreation.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, moderate severity. Border patrol agents travel north from the border into tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, to apprehend illegal immigrants. Vehicle travel can occur off dirt roads, widen existing roads, and create new disturbances. Shooting tortoises, running over them deliberately with vehicles, or otherwise killing them has been documented in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>7.1.1 Fires &amp; fire suppression<br/>&#160; a. Caused by lightning, car fires on highways or roads, arson.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, severe, with the severity dependent on the critical habitat unit or protected area. Mojave and Colorado Desert habitats did not evolve with fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). Fires increased in numbers, frequency, and amounts burned with the invasion and proliferation of non-native grasses which are highly combustible (Berry and Murphy 2019). Fires have occurred throughout the geographic range and have burned significant amounts of critical and other protected habitats in the southern, central, eastern and northeastern Mojave Desert regions. Once habitat burns, it is likely to burn again with higher frequencies and with potentially increased biomass of non-native annual grasses. Tortoises die in these fires or are injured, but some survive (Berry and Murphy 2019). Loss of cover of shrubs and food supply for the tortoises is severe in most burned areas. When fires are very hot, the seed bed may be damaged or destroyed. The most severely burned protected habitat is in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve with &gt;30% burned as of summer 2020 (McLuckie <em>et al</em>. 2021); the Mojave National Preserve also experienced a major fire and loss or degradation of 7% of the critical habitat unit in summer 2020 (Darby <em>et al</em>. 2021). <br/><br/>7.2.8 Abstraction of ground water<br/>&#160; a. For agriculture, primarily, followed by urban and cities.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, long-term degradation of habitat adjacent to cities, towns, industrial and agricultural developments. Depletion of the ground water table causing subsidence and formation of fissures has occurred in at least one part of the western Mojave Desert and in the northeastern Mojave Desert in the Las Vegas Valley in what was once desert tortoise habitat (Berry 1984, Burbey 2002). In the western Mojave Desert, the water table was depleted by agricultural uses (cotton, alfalfa) and now with solar energy development; and by cities in the Las Vegas Valley by depleted associated aquifers. Other regions have and continue to experience depletion of the water table in areas with agriculture and desert cities, e.g., adjacent to the Mojave, Colorado, and Virgin rivers (Stamos <em>et al</em>. 2001). Water is sought from sources and regions outside desert tortoise habitat (e.g., the Colorado River) to support cities and towns, as well as agriculture, because existing water tables are insufficient to support them.<br/><br/>8.1.2 Invasive and other problematic species, genes &amp; diseases: Named species<br/>&#160; a.&#160;<em>Bromus madritensis </em>ssp<em>. rubens, B. tectorum, Schismus </em>spp<em>., Erodium cicutarium, Hirschfeldia incana, Brassica tournefortii.<br/></em>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation of the Mojave and western Sonoran ecosystems. Landscape conservation forecasting (Provencher <em>et al</em>. 2011) quantified the pervasive abundance of annual brome grasses that foster destructive wildfires of a size and intensity far greater than the fire regime with which Mojave Desert habitats developed over the past millennia.&#160;In addition to supporting fires, the non-native grasses compete with native forage species of forbs required by tortoises to grow, reproduce, and remain healthy. Non-native grasses and forbs dominate the ecosystem in biomass in both wet and dry years in many tortoise habitats (Brooks and Berry 2006, Berry 2014b). Non-native grasses are not nutritious plants for tortoises to eat and cause weight loss and can cause death in juveniles (Hazard <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The awns of <em>Bromus</em> also can injure tortoise mouths. The non-native <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em> and especially <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, introduced through agricultural development, also compete with native forage species, changing the composition of the native flora (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b). They are not eaten by tortoises and can be high in oxalates, potentially a source of oxalosis in tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>8.1.2 Diseases. Named species<br/>&#160; a. Infectious diseases: <em>Mycoplasma agassizii, M. testudineum, </em>Testudinid herpesvirus 2 (TeHV2); Non-infectious diseases: oxalosis, gout, starvation, dehydration.<br/>&#160; b. Infectious diseases: ongoing, severe in some areas. The two species of <em>Mycoplasma</em> are infectious pathogens. The first (<em>M. agassizii</em>) was discovered in wild populations in 1989 and the second (<em>M. testudineum</em>) a few years later (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, 2014). These pathogens are spread by contact between tortoises cause disease and death in some populations, and inhibit olfaction necessary for foraging (Jacobson and Berry 2012, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Mycoplasma agassizii</em> is common in captive desert tortoises, more so than in wild populations. Epidemiological studies indicate that the distribution of the two species differs, and that tortoises with antibody-positive tests for the diseases occur closer to human habitations rather than more distant (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mycoplasmosis has been implicated as a major contributor to a catastrophic die-off of tortoises at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2020b). It is also associated with declines in other parts of the geographic range (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160; Non-infectious diseases of known etiology include oxalosis, gout, and starvation and dehydration (Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Some individuals and populations have been negatively affected by these diseases.<br/><br/>8.2.2 Problematic Native Species<br/>&#160; a. The Common Raven (<em>Corvus corax)</em>, an uncommon to rare resident between the 1920s and 1940s in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts, is now an abundant predator in ecosystems where the Desert Tortoise lives.&#160;Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>) is another similar predator, and Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>) can also be a hyper-predator.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe and negative effects on population structure; loss of juveniles and immature tortoises. Populations of the Common Raven have grown enormously, supported by subsidies of food, water, perch and nest sites available from humans (Boarman 1993, Boarman and Berry 1995). They have been able to access formerly remote parts of the desert by relying on settlements, road kills and trash along highways and roads, and utility poles and transmission lines for perching and nesting (Knight and Kawashima 1993). Common Ravens are very effective predators on hatchling, juvenile and immature tortoises, with dozens to hundreds of shells recorded beneath perch and nest sites. They are responsible for preventing recovery in many parts of the desert by depleting young tortoise cohorts in populations that can lead to local extinctions (Kristan and Boarman 2003). Red-tailed Hawks have expanded their use areas into remote parts of the desert ecosystems, using utility poles and towers as nest sites and juvenile tortoises for food (Anderson and Berry 2019). Similarly, Coyotes are subsidized predators found in increased numbers near cities, towns, and some military installations and at times have high predation rates on tortoises (Esque <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>8.4.2 Problematic Species/ Diseases: Named Species<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Several non-native species of tortoises and turtles carrying disease or potentially carrying disease have been released illegally into Desert Tortoise habitats, e.g., African Spurred Tortoise (<em>Centrochelys</em> <em>sulcata</em>; Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018) and Central Asian Steppe Tortoise (<em>Testudo horsfieldii</em>; Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe. Releases of tortoises, whether native or non-native are illegal in large parts of the geographic range. Nevertheless, introduced, non-native turtles and tortoises such as the African Spurred Tortoise and Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise have been found to carry new diseases that would negatively affect already declining <em>G. agassizii </em>populations (Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018). The African Spurred Tortoise can do damage to habitat and to the native tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, because of the large size and aggressive nature. One Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise was captured in the Central Mojave Desert with a new herpesvirus not previously described in <em>G. agassizii&#160;</em>(Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The concern is that this non-native tortoise may have transmitted the new herpesvirus to desert tortoises. New, non-native herpesviruses from other species and countries and continents are a threat to health in already declining <em>G. agassizii</em> populations.<br/><br/>8.5 Viral/Prion-induced Diseases<br/>&#160; a. Herpesviruses are implicated in illness and mortality in tortoises.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe if coupled with other stressors. Herpesviruses are a threat to health and survival of desert tortoises, especially those herpesviruses introduced from other, non-native species to the desert. Tortoises with clinical signs of the disease were among populations that severely declined between the 1990s and 2000s; herpesvirus may have contributed in some areas (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Testudinid herpesvirus 2 was first identified in captive tortoises, then confirmed in wild <em>G. agassizii</em> (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012). The estimated prevalence of this herpesvirus for captive and wild tortoises from the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts ranged from 15 to 56% (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>8.6 Diseases of Unknown Cause<br/>&#160; a. Shell diseases, i.e., cutaneous dyskeratosis, necrosis.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. A novel shell disease, cutaneous dyskeratosis and shell necrosis, was implicated in illness and deaths of Desert Tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1994; Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2001) and a decline of ca. 80% in a once-robust population. Other populations in critical habitats appear to be affected similarly. This is a metabolic disease with lesions of the shell and integument as outward manifestations. The causes are suspected to be toxicants (e.g., elemental toxicants and/or nutritional deficiencies). The disease is implicated in elevated death rates in adult tortoises in the western Sonoran Desert and eastern Mojave Desert (Berry and Medica 1995, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>9.2.2 Industrial &amp; military effluents<br/>&#160; a. Seepage from mining.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, unremediated regionally. There are links between some diseases in tortoises and toxicants from mining and other similar developments. Tortoises dying of upper respiratory tract disease caused by <em>Mycoplasma</em> spp. in the western Mojave Desert in close proximity to a mining district had high levels of mercury in livers compared to tortoises without the disease (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991). Ill tortoises with high levels of arsenic occurred in an area mining district with high levels of mercury and arsenic (Selzer and Berry 2005). Waste from the mines was transported by wind and water to distances of 15 km (Chaffee and Berry 2006; Kim et al. 2012, 2014). Mines in other tortoise habitat in different desert regions have yet to be examined.</p><p>9.4 Garbage &amp; Solid Waste<br/>&#160; a. Trash is a threat to tortoises because they can consume it or become entangled.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, low to moderate. Consumption of trash can lead to illness and death (Donoghue 2006, Walde <em>et al</em>. 2007). Balloons and other trash are common throughout the desert and most abundant near human habitations, along roads, and recreation use areas (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008, 2014a; Keith <em>et al</em>. 2008). Trash attracts predators—Common Ravens, Coyotes, and other canids—thus creating an additional risk to tortoises.<br/><br/>9.5 Air-borne Pollutants<br/>&#160; a. Pollutants such as atmospheric nitrogen and increases in CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the growth of invasive grasses and thus fire.<br/>&#160; b. Atmospheric nitrogen from urban or other areas is transported to deserts and tortoise habitat, and deposited on soils, thus enhancing growth of non-native grasses and plants prone to fire (Brooks 2003, Rao and Allen 2010).<br/><br/>11.1 Habitat Shifting &amp; Alteration<br/>&#160; a. Desertification; degradation of vegetation, soils, and topography<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Throughout the geographic range, most, if not all, tortoise habitats have received (and continue to receive) one or more anthropogenic uses and activities resulting in compacted or eroded soils and alteration of the natural structure and composition of annual and perennial vegetation (e.g., Lei 2009). Long-lived shrubs and native annual wildflowers and grasses have been replaced in part with short-lived colonizers (shrubs, non-native, fire-prone grasses) typical of disturbed areas. These changes have brought fewer places to dig burrows and a reduced supply of nutritious plants to eat (Brooks and Berry 2006, Webb and Wilshire 1983). In some areas, the rich diversity of shrubs and annual plants have been replaced by a few shrub species and the annuals replaced with primarily non-native annual species (Brooks and Berry 2006).<br/><br/>11.2 Droughts<br/>&#160; a. Desert Tortoises require water from precipitation and a diverse diet of native annuals to grow, reproduce and survive.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, increasingly severe with reduced survival throughout the geographic range, often associated with hyper-predation by coyotes. Although the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts are typified by droughts often lasting more than a year, tortoises have adaptations to cope. However, tortoises die of starvation and dehydration during prolonged droughts (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2002, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003, Longshore <em>et al</em>. 2003, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014). Juveniles are especially vulnerable. With climate change and warming, droughts, including megadroughts lasting 10 years or more, are predicted to occur in coming years (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2017, Steiger <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>11.3 Temperature Extremes<br/>&#160; a. Tortoises are able to withstand the extremes of temperature experienced in the desert; however, increases in warm temperatures coupled with drying and changes in precipitation patterns present high risks to the species.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing and a growing issue, with climate change having negative impacts throughout the geographic range. Tortoises cope with the extremes of summer and winter temperatures (and lack of water, see 11.2) by using deep burrows and restricting above-ground activities and reproduction during drought. As temperatures rise with the rise in CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases, tortoises will need to find habitats where deeper burrows can be excavated. At the higher temperatures, the spring season for foraging on ephemeral annuals and egg laying is likely to be shortened, reducing the time for eating, growing, and egg production. Sex of tortoises is determined by temperature of incubation in nests, with females produced at the higher temperatures and males at the lower temperatures. Eggs laid in nest that will experience the high temperatures of summer may be predominantly female, and if temperatures are excessive, may not be viable. Although the species could survive at higher (and cooler) elevations, the habitat in mountain ranges will be more limited, steep, rocky, with exposed bedrock in places with inadequate forage.<br/><br/>12.1 Other Threats<br/>&#160; a. Climate Change.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, see 11.2 and 11.3. Change in timing and amounts of precipitation coupled with increasing temperatures are likely to have profound negative effects on the species, further reducing available habitat (e.g., Barrows 2011). Profound changes are predicted to cause deterioration in composition, structure, diversity and biomass of trees and shrubs (Munson et al. 2016) that provide shade and cover to the tortoises. Barrows (2011) predicted that tortoises may survive if they move from the western Colorado Desert to higher elevations.&#160; However, the long-lived tortoises have strong fidelity to existing home ranges.</p>","Population estimates and trends have previously been difficult to obtain with certainty for large segments of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> populations due to their patchy distribution, difficulty of detection, and associated statistical weaknesses of population estimates. Population data have been variously documented or reviewed by Woodbury and Hardy (1948), Hardy (1976), Berry (1984, 1986, 1989), Bury and Corn (1995),&#160;Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Berry and Murphy (2019). A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;by Allison and McLuckie (2018) has demonstrated continued adult population declines in four of the five&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units and low densities in nearly all subpopulations near the minimum required to remain viable (3.9 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>Between the 1930s and early 2000s, estimates of density and trends in populations were based on demographic data, habitat condition, and anthropogenic threats from both long- and short-term study plots of varying sizes, as well as reports by government agency personnel and expert observers (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948; Hardy 1976; Berry 1984, 1989). The study plots were limited in number and did not represent the entirety of subpopulations across the geographic range (e.g., Berry 1984). The subpopulation on the Beaver Dam Slope, Utah, was federally listed as threatened in 1980 (USFWS 1980). A petition submitted by the Desert Tortoise Council in 1984 to list all wild populations in the United States was denied; the USFWS determined that listing of U.S. populations was warranted but precluded because of other higher priorities (USFWS&#160;<span style="""">1985</span>). In 1989 and 1990, the State of California and USFWS listed the tortoise as threatened (USFWS <span style="""">1989,&#160;1990;</span> California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2016). The appearance of upper respiratory tract disease and rapidly declining populations in the western Mojave and a major decline in tortoises in parts of the western Sonoran (Colorado Desert, California) associated with appearance of shell disease were additional threats to the many causes of declines (USFWS 1990, 1994, and references therein). Reflecting its concern over these declines, USFWS (1994:3) stated that: “The most serious problem facing the remaining desert tortoise population is the cumulative load of human and disease-related mortality accompanied by habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. Virtually every extant desert tortoise subpopulation has been affected by one or more of these factors.” As a result, the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994) also designated federal critical habitat units for desert tortoises at that time.&#160;In October 2020, the California Fish and Wildlife Commission accepted a petition from Defenders of Wildlife to up-list wild desert tortoises from threatened to endangered status; California has the largest subpopulation and geographic range of the species. The petition is currently under consideration by the agency with a response estimated in 2021.<br/><br/>To better measure trends in densities of adult populations in the threatened subpopulations, the Recovery Team proposed development of a landscape scale program (USFWS 1994). At the same time, the Recovery Team also noted the importance of study plot data, because more population attributes were provided than density of adults. After experimenting with different techniques, the USFWS decided to use distance sampling and initiated a formal, range-wide program for estimating densities of adult populations in critical habitat units (USFWS 2015, and references therein).<br/><br/>In the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994), population size, viability, and sizes of protected areas were discussed. Assuming the minimum density of adults in a population was “approximately 10 adults per square mile” (equivalent to 3.9 adults/km<sup>2</sup>), the target size for protected areas (then called Desert Wildlife Management Areas) was approximately 1,000 mi<sup>2</sup> (ca. 2,590 km<sup>2</sup>). This would ensure that even at such low densities and assuming half of such large areas might support no or few tortoises, each protected area would support enough adults for a genetically minimum viable population. The Recovery Team recommended six Recovery units with 12 different populations. The updated Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011) is based on the same number of populations but configured into five revised Recovery units with 17 different monitored subpopulations.<br/><br/>Most demographic data from study plots collected from the 1930s on the Beaver Dam Slope and between 1979–1980 in California and Nevada during the spring season indicated counts of 5–64 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Berry and Murphy 2019). In describing trends between 1978 and 1990 in California, the USFWS summarized data from 10 study plots in the Mojave and Colorado deserts and reported a highly significant downward trend (USFWS 1994). Additional data for the period showed some populations with low but potentially stable densities in Nevada (Berry and Medica 1995). A review of population status (Tracy <em>et al</em>. 2004) considered updated information from the permanent study plots in California and found that population declines in the western part of the range in California continued and declines were perhaps beginning in the eastern part of the California range.<br/><br/>The current population trends are based on landscape-level assessment using distance sampling for the 11-year period between 2004 and 2014 (USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). The sampling represented all five recovery units with 16 subpopulations in critical habitat units of from 115 to 3,763 km<sup>2</sup> described in the original Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994). Joshua Tree National Park is treated as a protected area and monitored as a 17th subpopulation although not designated as critical habitat. Consistent downward trends have continued in four of the five recovery units, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 11 years. Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014; the exceptions were adult densities in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) and the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (10.2/km<sup>2</sup>) (Berry et al. 2014, 2020). Unfortunately, in July 2020, a significant part of the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve burned and tortoises were found injured and dead. The Red Cliffs subpopulation declined from 2005 wildfires and with the recent 2020 fires, there will likely be further depression in densities. The six subpopulations with increasing densities had 2.7 to 6.4 adults/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2014. However, most of the 17 populations were near or below the 3.9 /km<sup>2</sup>&#160;density of adults considered as a minimum for viable populations (USFWS 1994, 2015).",Decreasing,"The Desert Tortoise was previously considered to be a single wide-ranging species, <em>Gopherus agassizii</em>, inhabiting the Mojave and Sonoran Desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico from southern California and Arizona through Sonora and into northern Sinaloa (Stebbins 1966, 2003; Iverson 1992). The species was found to be polytypic by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2011), who split the morphologically and genetically distinct Sonoran Desert populations as <em>Gopherus morafkai</em>, the Sonoran Desert Tortoise. Further analysis demonstrated that <em>G. morafkai</em> was also polytypic and split further to separate and describe the Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise further to the south as <em>Gopherus evgoodei</em> (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Geographically restricted <em>G. agassizii</em>, the Mojave or Agassiz’s Desert Tortoise, is endemic to the United States, inhabiting southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and extreme northwestern Arizona west and north of the Colorado River (TTWG 2017, Berry and Murphy 2019). The Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai</em>, occurs in both the United States and Mexico, inhabiting Arizona south and east of the Colorado River, Sonora (including Isla Tiburón), and extreme northern Sinaloa (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2011, TTWG 2017). The Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise, <em>G. evgoodei</em>, is endemic to Mexico and occurs in southern Sonora, northern Sinaloa, and extreme southwestern Chihuahua (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2016, TTWG 2017).<br/><br/>Within its geographic range, <em>G. agassizii</em> occurs in the Mojave Desert, the western Sonoran or Colorado Desert, the ecotone of the Mojave with the Great Basin Desert, and ecotones with vegetation types typical of higher elevations on the lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada, Transverse, Peninsular and desert mountain ranges (USFWS 1994). McLuckie <em>et al</em>. (1999) identified a subpopulation of <em>G. agassizii</em> east of the Colorado River in the Black Mountains of northwestern Arizona in which morphometric and mtDNA characteristics of the majority of the subpopulation were typically Mojavean; however, elements typical of tortoises in the Sonoran Desert were also evident. Edwards <em>et al.</em> (2015), using new genetic techniques, examined this and other nearby tortoise subpopulations, and identified hybrids (F2) in three mountain ranges near the Colorado River in Arizona. The two <em>Gopherus</em> species come in contact in limited places where Mojave Desert habitats meet Sonoran Desert habitats. The two species likely maintain largely independent taxonomic identities due to ecological niche partitioning (Inman <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species has been recorded at elevations of up to&#160;1,570 m asl (Rautenstrauch and O’Farrell 1998); however, tortoises may be found in unusual places, often transported by humans or other animals (e.g., the type specimen of <em>Xerobates lepidocephalus</em>&#160;[Ottley and Velázquez-Solis 1989] from southern Baja California, Mexico, is actually an introduced <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>[Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2011]).","Commercial take or use of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is prohibited by law, and few animals have been documented in (illegal) trade in recent decades. The evaluation of conservation status, conservation and monitoring actions for the species have generated significant financial investments in the species, supporting a range of local and visiting livelihoods. The approximate cost to develop and implement the 25-year recovery program for the Mojave Desert Tortoise was USD 100 million (USGAO 2002, Ernst and Lovich 2009, USFWS 2011, Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thirty years have passed since the federal listing of&#160; <em>G. agassizii</em> as threatened in 1989–1990, declines of breeding adults continue, and many tasks to reduce deaths, described first in 1994 (USFWS 1994), remain to be implemented (see also USFWS 2011, Reports from the Recovery Implementation Teams). If fully implemented, the recommended actions could exceed 159 million USD plus additional costs that could not be estimated in the 2011 Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011). As one of the keystone species of the Mojave Desert, <em>G. agassizii</em> plays an unquantified but substantial role in generating tourism income to regional protected areas (see Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/"">https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/</a>).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Conservation Measures taken:<br/></strong>The first legal conservation measures for <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> came from the State of California in 1939 (California Department of Fish and Game Code 1939–1981).&#160;Additional protective regulations followed until <em>G. agassizii </em>was listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act in 1989 (California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife 2016). Federal legislation to protect <em>G. agassizii</em> first occurred in 1980 and was restricted to the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utah (USFWS 1980). In 1989–1990, <em>G. agassizii</em> was federally listed as threatened (USDI&#160;<span style="""">1990&#160;</span>and references therein). The only population of <em>G. agassizii</em> that is not protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, is in the northwest corner of Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recovery efforts have been underway since 1990. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1994) published the first Recovery Plan in 1994, coupled with designations of critical habitat units by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994); this was followed by a revised Recovery Plan in 2011 (USFWS 2011), and regional Recovery Implementation Teams established in 2012. These teams are chaired by an employee of the USFWS Desert Tortoise Recovery Office, and are composed of federal, state, and county employees from the range of the desert tortoise, including representatives from local and national conservation and other stakeholder organizations. <br/><br/>The species is included in CITES Appendix II as part of Testudinidae spp., requiring that any commercial international trade be documented not to be detrimental to the survival of wild populations. CITES Trade records generally show very low levels of international exports of live animals; the vast majority of live traded Desert Tortoises are personal pets moving in-country with their owners, and many of the records in fact concern seizures of illegally transported specimens (CITES UNEP-WCMC trade database).<br/><br/>Conservation and recovery efforts began in the early 1970s, long before efforts of the federal actions by the USFWS in 1989–90. The Desert Tortoise Council formed in 1974-75 out of an interim recovery effort involving the four Southwestern states. This non-profit corporation was and continues to be dedicated to preserving representative populations of desert tortoises; educating the public; holding annual introductory workshops; and annual symposia to bring together representatives from government agencies, academia, and the public to learn and discuss important topics aimed at recovery of tortoise populations. The Desert Tortoise Council was instrumental in providing critical materials for federal and state listings of the species. The Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, Inc., was formed in 1974 to establish protected areas for <em>G. agassizii</em>. This non-profit organization is a land trust and mitigation bank, a source of education, and research. They were instrumental in establishing the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area and increasing its size.<br/><br/>Two preserves or protected areas exist with moderately high degrees of protection. One is the 100 km<sup>2</sup> (and increasing) Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area, which was formally designated by the U.S. Congress in 1980. It is fenced, with no vehicle access, livestock grazing, mining, or surface disturbances other than a few limited natural trails and a kiosk. The Natural Area is for wild tortoises only and populations are allowed to fluctuate naturally with no augmentation. Population density of adults throughout the Natural Area in 2011-12 was 10.2/km<sup>2</sup> (Berry et al. 2014a). The second preserve is Red Cliffs Desert Reserve in Utah (251 km<sup>2</sup>). The Red Cliffs National Conservation Area provides additional protection for federal lands within the Reserve. Several paved roads, fenced and unfenced, run through the Reserve and recreation occurs throughout (e.g., hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking).&#160;The next and lower level of protection could be described as occurring within National Parks, State Parks, and National Recreation Areas such as Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, Mojave National Preserve, Red Rock Canyon, Anza-Borrego, and Red Rocks State Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and the Beaver Dam Wash National Conservation Area. These parks and recreation areas have very high visitor use, unfenced paved roads, and some illegal collecting and release of captive tortoises of one or more species. <br/><br/>Twelve critical habitat units, the basis for Tortoise Conservation Areas (term defined in USFWS 2011), were designated by the USFWS (1994), and have far less protection than either the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area or the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve and are subject to multiple land uses that fragment and degrade habitat and create vulnerabilities and risks to the tortoises (e.g., invasive non-native grasses and other non-native species; highways; roads; utility poles, towers, and electrical transmission lines; gas lines and fibreoptic cables; recreational vehicle use; shooting; domestic and feral dogs; cattle grazing and feral burros; mining; military installations; fire that causes degradation of habitat).<br/><br/>Seventeen monitored subpopulations in the 12 critical habitat units are contained within five recovery units which cover a total of 25,678 km<sup>2</sup>. The following information for each recovery unit and the 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas reports area (km<sup>2</sup>), and density of breeding adults per km<sup>2</sup> in 2014. Western Mojave Recovery Unit: Fremont-Kramer (2,347 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Ord-Rodman (852 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Superior-Cronese (3,094 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Colorado Desert Recovery Unit: Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range (713 km<sup>2</sup>, 7.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Chuckwalla (2,818 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.3/km<sup>2</sup>), Chemehuevi (3,763 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Fenner (1,782 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Joshua Tree (1,152 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Pinto Mountain (508 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.4/km<sup>2</sup>), Piute Valley (927 km<sup>2</sup>, 5.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Eastern Mojave Recovery Unit: El Dorado Valley (999 km<sup>2</sup>, 1.5/km<sup>2</sup>), Ivanpah Valley (2,447 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Northeastern Mojave Recovery Unit: Beaver Dam Slope (750 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Coyote Spring (960 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.0/km<sup>2</sup>), Gold Butte (1,607 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Mormon Mesa (844 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit: Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (115 km<sup>2</sup>, 15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2015; Allison and McLuckie 2018). The overall decline in tortoise populations in critical habitats (Tortoise Conservation Areas) between 2004 and 2014 was 32.2% (USFWS 2015). Four of the five recovery units are in a state of decline, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 10 years (USFWS 2015). Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014 (USFWS 2015).<br/><br/>Extensive research has been published in peer-reviewed journals on many aspects of natural history, general ecology, physiological ecology, reproduction, health and diseases, population attributes, causes of death, movements and home range, predators, head-starting, translocation, and many other topics, making <em>G. agassizii</em> likely the most well-researched non-marine turtle species (Lovich and Ennen 2013b). Over 400 journal articles were published as of 2018, most between 1990 and 2018, as well as hundreds of reports (see three annotated bibliographies covering almost 160 years: Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980, Grover and DeFalco 1995, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016). Some information has been integrated into recovery programs, but many of the recovery measures recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) have not been implemented as of 2020.<br/><br/>Economic relevance: The approximate cost of USD 100 million to develop and implement the first and second Recovery Plans is significant within the regulatory, scientific and local economic sectors involved and much remains to be implemented (USFWS 1994, 2011; Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Measures needed:<br/></strong>The USFWS (1994) published recommended regulations for the areas that were designated as critical habitat. They described activities to be prohibited (e.g., all vehicle activity off designated roads; all competitive and organized recreational vehicle events on designated roads; habitat destructive military manoeuvres, clearing for agriculture, landfills and other surface disturbances; domestic livestock grazing, grazing by feral burros and horses; vegetation harvest; collection of biological specimens or vegetation harvest except by permit; dumping and littering; and deposition of captive or displace desert tortoises except under authorized translocation research projects; uncontrolled dogs out of vehicles; discharge of firearms except for hunting of game between September and February. There were many other recommended management actions but few of these recommendations were adopted when critical habitat units were officially described (USFWS 1994), and others have only been partially implemented by 2020.&#160;There were also recommendations for monitoring and research. In the second recovery plan, the USFWS (2011) identified and ranked (Darst <em>et al.</em> 2013) priority actions for recovering the Desert Tortoise and established regional Recovery Implementation Teams to implement these recovery actions. These Recovery Implementation Teams identify local, regional, and range-wide actions by submitting proposals to team members for discussion and prioritization. Ultimately the proposals are submitted to range-wide Management Oversight Groups composed of state, federal, and county government agencies for review, discussion, and potential sources of funding. Some projects are successfully funded and implemented, while many recommended in 1994 remain unfulfilled.<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Conservation Actions Needed, we provide the following notes:<br/></strong>1.1. Land/water protection -&gt; Site/area protection<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Better protection of Critical habitats could ensure that populations of tortoises become stable and/or increase. Examples of protective measures included in recovery measures for the tortoise are exclusion fencing and culverts along highways and roads; reduction in populations of hyper-predators such as the Common Ravens; control and removal of newly introduced and previously existing non-native plants; and control of recreational vehicle use.<br/><br/>2.1. Land/water management -&gt; Site/area management<br/>&#160; &#160; a. The first recovery plan identified site-specific or critical habitat-specific measures to ensure protection of habitat and reduction of deaths of tortoises from anthropogenic sources (USFWS 1994). Most of these recommendations are still relevant. The Recovery Implementation Teams have provided recommendations similar to those in the first recovery plan. Many of these measures remain to be implemented. For example, in the State of California where most desert tortoise habitat and populations occur, acquisition of private land would be beneficial, because a substantial portion of habitat is in multiple private ownership. Both the USFWS and State of California recommend that developers of tortoise habitat acquire replacement habitat for habitat lost to development, and such actions have been occurring for ~20 years. Another topic and critical area that would benefit from protection is the population and hybrid zone with <em>G. morafkai</em> east of the Colorado River in Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). This small population is not protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>2.2. Land/water management -&gt; Invasive/problematic species control<br/>&#160; a. Non-native grasses (e.g., <em>Schismus arabicus</em>, <em>S. barbatus</em>, <em>Bromus tectorum</em>, <em>B. madritensis rubens</em>) and forbs (e.g., <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em>) present serious and severe problems to tortoises because tortoises are selective in the choice of forage (Jennings and Berry 2015). The non-native annuals contribute to changes in forage availability, habitat structure, and increases in fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). These non-native species thrive under disturbance and spread via roads, livestock, military maneuvers, and disturbances created by recreational vehicle use off-road (e.g., D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006). The grasses are highly combustible and fire-prone in wildlands that did not evolve with short-term fire cycles (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). The grasses also compete with native annuals used as forage by the tortoises, and the species of grasses contain little nutrition, require water to metabolize, cause weight loss in the tortoises, and can become embedded in the jaws (Medica and Eckert 2007; Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). Similarly, <em>Brassica tournefortii</em> competes with native species used for forage and often occurs in dense stands, inhibiting movements of tortoises (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).<br/><br/>3.2. Species management -&gt; Species recovery<br/>&#160; a. Species management and recovery are guided by the Recovery Plan and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. On-the-ground management is by the administering agency, e.g., U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Department of Defense, States (for state land), and private owners. That being said, much can be done by implementing actions recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) and by restoring degraded habitat (e.g., Abella and Berry 2016); controlling recreation vehicle use off-road and reducing fragmentation of habitat; limiting spread of invasive, non-native grasses and forbs; controlling hyper-predation in common ravens (USFWS 2008)&#160;and coyotes; preventing dogs and dog packs from running loose in the desert; and acquiring habitat.<br/><br/>4.3. Education &amp; awareness -&gt; Awareness &amp; communications<br/>&#160; a. See Conservation Actions in Place. Expansion of on-going programs to prevent take or shooting in the wild and release of captive tortoises of several species.<br/><br/><br/><strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Research Needed, we provide the following notes:</strong></p>While research on some topics is desirable, more is known about <em>G. agassizii </em>than most other reptiles (Lovich and Ennen 2013b, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016 and references therein). Instead, implementation of previously identified actions to protect populations and habitat is more critical, specifically actions that will reduce deaths and loss or degradation of habitat.&#160;<br/><br/>1.1. Research -&gt; Taxonomy<br/>&#160; a. Genetic relationships between and within populations: human-mediated translocations of tortoises have occurred for decades, some authorized, some not (see Murphy et al. 2007). One recent question is the source of tortoises in Anza Borrego Desert State Park in the Colorado Desert of California. One might expect that the source would be tortoises occurring in the Colorado Desert, but instead tortoises have genotypes typical of the southwestern Mojave Desert population (Manning and Edwards 2019). More information on nearby tortoises (e.g. Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2020) occurring on the east-facing slopes of the Peninsular Range north of the Park may shed light on whether this is a naturally occurring population or a source that came from human-mediated translocations.<br/>&#160; b. Translocation of thousands of tortoises has occurred in the last &gt;20 years. Yet the only information available as to whether these translocated tortoises have been assimilated into the recipient or existing resident populations is research by Mulder <em>et al.</em> (2017) on assimilation of translocated males into the population of resident tortoises. Much more needs to be done on following males and females over a 10- to 20-year period to determine if and when adult males are assimilated into resident populations.<br/><br/>1.2. Research -&gt; Population size, distribution &amp; trends<br/>&#160; a. More information on current population attributes such as size-age class structure, recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, sex ratios of adult tortoises, and causes and contributors to death is highly desirable. Landscape sampling undertaken and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Desert Tortoise Recovery Office has provided valuable region-wide information on adult densities but not on other essential population attributes (i.e., Allison and McLuckie 2018). Resurvey of long-term, mark-recapture tortoise plots has been spotty for the past 20 years while support has increased for line-distance sampling representatively and on a landscape scale (see USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). Nonetheless, it is clear (USFWS 2011) that species recovery cannot be assumed based on patterns of adult counts alone, and active work to describe vital rates across the range will be an important part of assuring tortoise populations reflect healthy population dynamics or determining regional and size-specific recovery needs.<br/><br/>1.3. Research -&gt; Life history &amp; ecology<br/>&#160; a. More information is needed on survival of neonate, juvenile, and immature size classes (first 12 to 15 years of life) and causes of mortality in the wild. Frequent input of new data on causes of and contributors to mortality for all size classes is essential for improving management of the species and for achieving upward trends.<br/><br/>1.5. Research -&gt; Threats<br/>&#160; a. The USFWS developed a model to identify major threats to the species (Darst <em>et al</em>. 2013); the information in this model is based on published research only, and not on the hundreds of reports and manuscripts available in Annual Reports to the USFWS on research permits. The model is outdated and needs major revisions to more accurately reflect available information and more recent priorities. In addition, support could be provided to speed up publication of important research projects that will lead to more protective management actions.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>3.1. Monitoring -&gt; Population trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on population attributes in critical habitat, near highways, and in critical habitat near urban areas.<br/><br/>3.4. Monitoring -&gt; Habitat trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on wildfires, non-native plants, seed beds, and recovery of preferred forage plants.<br/><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Mass coral bleaching occurs in association with episodes of elevated sea surface temperature and results in significant losses of live coral (Hoegh-Guldberg 1999). This reduces habitat complexity, with a consequent decrease in prey abundance (Pratchett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008) and the loss of refuge sites. Climate change may thus threaten all sea snakes which are coral reef specialists (Francis 2006).</p>  <br/>Increased sea surface temperatures, coral bleaching, and resulting changes in sediment structure may be linked to localized population declines of sea snakes on Ashmore Reef, northern Australia (Francis 2006).

This habitat impact was compounded by the removal of at least 20-25% of the total estimated population of adults in the three-year period 2000-2002. Combined, this indicates a minimum of 60% population decline in the past two generations, with a further 30% anticipated for the next generation, qualifying the species as Critically Endangered under criterion A4acd. Population modelling predicting extinction before 2030 is no longer applicable as some of the the modelling assumptions are no longer operational.","The forests inhabited by <em>Pyxis planicauda</em> grow on loose sandy soils and the tortoises take refuge amongst the leaf litter of the forest floor. They burrow and are inactive in leaf litter during dry season (late May through October), but become active in the wet season. They are crepuscular and seek shelter during mid-day (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989, Rakotombololona 1998, Gibson and Buley 2004). Tortoises feed on fallen fruits such as <em>Breonia perrieri</em> and <em>Aleanthus greveanus</em>. (Glaw and Vences 1994, Gibson and Buley 2004). Fungi and fallen flowers have also been reported as diet items (Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/>Adult <em>P. planicauda</em> reach a carapace length of 13.7 cm (Ernst <em>et al</em>. 2000) to 14.8 cm (Pedrono 2008). Based on information from Durrell Wildlife breeding center in northwestern Madagascar females do not reach maturity until ten years of age. Generation time was estimated at the 2008 Madagascar Tortoise and Freswater Turtle workshop as at least 25 years. Mating occurs in the first half of the wet season and females produce 1-3 single egg clutches in the latter half of the wet season (Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2003, Pedrono 2008). Observation of nests in the wild, show incubation periods of 250-340 days (Razandrimamilafiniarivo <em>et al</em>. 2000).","<em>Pyxis planicauda</em> is exclusively associated with closed-canopy dry forest and its major threat comes from habitat loss, particularly from burning and clearing for agricultural lands/cattle grazing, highway development, mining, and petroleum exploration (Tidd <em>et al</em>. 2001, Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bonin <em>et al</em>. 2006). Analyses of satellite imagery by Tidd <em>et al</em>. (2001) between 1963 and 1993 showed a 32% reduction in the primary dry forests. Deforestation rates have increased, and up to 50% of the 76,000 ha remaining in the southern portion of the tortoises range may be destroyed before 2010. A 50% reduction in the remaining 73,000 ha of habitat in the northern portion of its known range may occur by 2040 (Tidd <em>et al</em>. 2001), for a combined forest habitat loss estimated at over 70% in the period 1963-2040. Similar deforestation rates were documented by Harper <em>et al</em>.

Widespread use of herbicide for shinnery oak control and activities associated with oil/gas extraction have the greatest potential to cause significant Sand Dune Lizard population extinction or reduction (Peterson and Boyd 1998, Painter 2004). The short-term effect of these activities is lizard population decline resulting from development of a grassland habitat that is unsuitable for the lizard (unless this new habitat retains large blowouts, in which case it is capable of supporting very small populations of <em>Sceloporus arenicolus</em> for at least ten years after treatment;  e.g., see Snell <em>et al</em>. 1993, Gorum et. al., 1995). The long-term effect of these habitat modifications is unknown, but increased habitat fragmentation results in increased probability of extinction of individual populations (Painter 2004). In the mid-1990s, the BLM Roswell Resource Area placed a moratorium on chemical treatment of shinnery oak - sand dune habitat. However, the long-term future of this moratorium is uncertain.

Analyses of subpopulation changes at 25 Index Sites distributed globally (see W-Figure 1 in Supplementary Material) show an 84 to 87% decline in number of mature females nesting annually over the last 3 Hawksbill generations (see W-Table 1 in Supplementary Material). Numerous populations, especially some of the larger ones, have continued to decline since the last assessment of the species (Meylan and Donnelly 1999).

Index Sites were chosen to represent broad regional subpopulation trends over time and include representative major nesting areas as well as many of the lesser nesting areas for which quantitative data are available. An estimated 41% of the current global population of nesting females is represented by index sites.<br/><br/>The most reliable method of monitoring trends in sea turtle populations are long-term population assessments conducted at the nesting beach (Meylan 1982) and these are used as an appropriate index of abundance for the taxon (IUCN 2001a, 2001b). But, estimating the total number of adult females in a nesting population is complicated by the fact that an individual female typically nests several times within a breeding season, and follows a non-annual breeding schedule, with intervals of two to seven years separating consecutive nesting seasons. Individuals also may be reproductively active for decades (Carr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1978, FitzSimmons et al. 1995, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Long-term monitoring is thus essential to document true population change.&#160;&#160; Few long-term studies of nesting Hawksbills exist, in part because sea turtle research did not become popular until the 1970s, and by then many populations had already been reduced to low levels (Meylan 1999).<br/><br/>Interpretation of long-term data can be complicated.&#160; Because Hawksbills mature slowly, an over-exploited nesting population may already be in decline for decades before the damage manifests itself as a decrease in numbers of nesting turtles on the nesting beach.&#160; Meanwhile, documented increases in numbers of nesting females must be interpreted cautiously, as they do not always reflect an absolute increase in the size of the population. In situations where protection is afforded a breeding population that previously had been subject to intense exploitation, numbers of egg clutches laid are likely to rise precipitously at the newly protected rookery.&#160; This is because, with protection, individual females survive not only to lay their full complement of three to five egg clutches within a single nesting season, but also return to breed in subsequent seasons. <br/>&#160;<br/>Because of the extended and complicated life cycle of the Hawksbill, to quantify only a single stage in the life cycle will not always adequately portray the true status of the entire population.&#160; For example, where over-exploitation of nesting females or eggs has impeded reproduction during long periods of time, estimates of population decline based only on numbers of nests may significantly underestimate the overall population decline at those sites because they will not reflect the absence of juvenile foraging turtles in the wider population (Mortimer 1995).&#160; Although studies on foraging grounds are useful, reliable quantitative data on the size of foraging populations, and especially historical data describing foraging populations, are generally not available.&#160; Interpretation of foraging data is further confounded by the mixing of animals from various nesting populations at the foraging grounds (Broderick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Encalada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996). Similarly, recent increases on some Caribbean nesting beaches demonstrate the difficulty in predicting increasing numbers of sea turtles.&#160; Although reduced effort in the Cuban Hawksbill fishery has spared more than 55,000 large animals on its foraging grounds since the early 1990s (Mortimer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), to date regional nesting increases are still relatively small. <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Data Sources for Index Sites</span>. To assess long term changes in the nesting populations at each of the 25 Index Sites, we used several types of data sources, often in combination with each other.&#160; For sites for which data on annual numbers of nesting females are not available we used other indices of nesting abundance, including numbers of nests recorded, numbers of nesting females killed, numbers of nesting females recorded per unit of patrol effort, and numbers of egg clutches collected for human consumption or for incubation in hatcheries. At some sites, different measures of Hawksbill abundance were used, including tortoiseshell export statistics, and total numbers of slaughtered animals (including both nesting and foraging turtles). The data were derived from a multitude of sources, including published scientific and historical literature and unpublished reports. We are grateful to the numerous researchers, especially the members of the MTSG Hawksbill Task Force, who generously provided their unpublished data and the benefit of their personal experience to ensure that the most up-to-date information be included in this assessment (see Acknowledgements in the Supplementary Material). As noted in the text and accompanying tables, such information is recorded as in lit. citations. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, for sea turtles and other long-lived species, decades of long-term quantitative data are seldom available. Few Hawksbill nest-monitoring projects were carried out in the 20th century on populations that are now depleted or remnants of their former size (Meylan 1999). Nevertheless, to estimate changes in populations over time, the contributions of historically large, but now depleted, populations needs to be considered.&#160; Where quantitative data are lacking, old naturalist’s records, historic egg collection data, and tortoise shell trade statistics are often the best source of information about populations, and can be used to estimate former abundance and subsequent declines.&#160; Unfortunately, while some excellent information about the enormous trade in tortoiseshell is available, in many areas of the world researchers will never know the full extent of the Hawksbill declines that have taken place before and during the 20th century. For example, Hawksbills were likely found in some numbers along the eastern coasts of the Pacific and Atlantic although now they have become scarce.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Extrapolated Data For Index Sites</span>.&#160; In the present assessment, where quantitative data are available, population abundance estimates are based on raw data, and linear and exponential extrapolation functions (IUCN 2001a). In some subpopulations, more than one trajectory was exhibited over the 3-generation interval; changes in subpopulation size are thus often based on a combination of raw data and extrapolations. If no change is believed to have occurred outside the time interval for which published abundance data are available, we use the raw data to determine the change in population size. However, when it appeared that change in subpopulation abundance occurred outside the interval for which raw data were available, we used extrapolation techniques to determine the overall change. Linear extrapolations were used when it was believed that the same amount of change occurred each year, irrespective of total subpopulation size. Exponential extrapolations were used when it was believed that change was proportional to the subpopulation size. In cases where there is a lack of information on the specific rate of change, we used both linear and exponential extrapolations to derive a population estimate. However, when either the linear or exponential function produced an obviously unrealistic number, we included the unrealistic figures in the tables summarizing estimated population change over three generations (and noted them as being unrealistic), but we did not use those unrealistic figures to estimate population changes for the ocean basin under consideration (see IND-Table 3, PAC-Table 3, and ATL-Table 3 in Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Backward Extrapolations of Increasing Populations</span>.&#160; Significant increases in nesting populations during the past two decades have been recorded at a number of nesting localities, particularly in the Atlantic Ocean at the following Index Sites:&#160; Antigua (Jumby Bay), Barbados, Cuba (Doce Leguas Cays), Mexico (Yucatan Peninsula), Puerto Rico (Mona Island), and US Virgin Islands (Buck Island Reef National Monument). The observed population increases correlate with implementation of protective measures at these nesting sites in combination with decreased exploitation at neighbouring foraging grounds (especially in Cuba).&#160; However, most of these now-increasing populations were not monitored prior to implementation of protective measures (the presence of researchers on the beach is often a significant element of the actual protection afforded such sites). <br/><br/>Using only the raw data available for these now-increasing sites, it would be impossible to estimate the overall rate of population change during the past three turtle generations, since in most cases data for the protected sites are only available from the mid-1980s onward. There is no reason to doubt that these increasing populations had suffered the same sort of declines as other nesting populations in the region for which earlier data exist. Rather than eliminate these populations from the summary calculations for the ocean basin (and over-estimate the rate of decline), we incorporated these data by extrapolating backwards from 1985, using the average population trajectory calculated for all the other Index Sites in the region for which there are data prior to 1985. The results of these calculations are presented in ATL-Table 6 (in Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Qualitative Information</span><br/>Numerical historic rates of change in the sizes of nesting populations at the Index Sites describe only one aspect of the global conservation status of the Hawksbill turtle, and tend to be somewhat biased towards those subpopulations for which long-term quantitative data exist.&#160; A wealth of information also exists about the current status of many of the world's Hawksbill nesting populations, as well as the various modern-day factors, both positive and negative, affecting them.&#160; These include:&#160; a) the residual impacts from long-term tortoiseshell trade;&#160; b) current levels of purposeful slaughter and egg collection;&#160;&#160; c) incidental capture in fishing gear; d) destruction of nesting beaches caused by unregulated coastal development, oil pollution, sea level rise and accompanying erosional processes, and elevated incubation temperatures;&#160; e)&#160; damage to foraging habitat caused by sea water warming, and pollution;&#160; and&#160; f) efforts to raise awareness, and to coordinate and legislate protection.&#160; Such information is critical to a complete understanding of the current status of Hawksbill populations around the world. <br/><br/>For 58 countries around the world we have compiled information on current estimated population sizes and qualitative information about current trends in nesting and foraging populations, and the factors influencing them either positively or negatively (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material)&#160; The inclusion of such relatively qualitative information ensures that even those countries with the fewest resources for monitoring and enforcement can be represented in this assessment; and these areas are often the ones where greatest exploitation and declines have occurred (IUCN 2001b).&#160; <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncertainties in the Assessment Process</span><br/>As with any assessment based on historic data or small data sets, there is uncertainty relating to the final results of this report. The sources of uncertainty are rooted in the procedure itself as well as in the stochastic nature of Hawksbill biology. Both sources of uncertainty are ultimately related to a lack of information, and when dealing with an animal as long-lived as a Hawksbill, this can be a particularly acute problem. <br/><br/>Since the last Hawksbill assessment (Meylan and Donnelly 1999), the IUCN Standarads and Petitions Working Group have developed a system of regression equations to address population changes over time and produce estimates of previous population sizes. With care to filter out overly regressed populations, this system appears to be adequate. Scale of population change needs to be cautiously addressed: on the one hand, declines can go no lower than 100%, but potential population increases are limitless. Small population declines that may be difficult to observe annually can be devastating over several generations.&#160; For example, a hypothetical Hawksbill population numbering 1,000 females declining at a steady rate of 1% annually would have declined by 50% in only 68 years and by 75% in 135 years.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>Another issue of concern is the fact that most of the increasing nesting populations in the Caribbean were included as Index Sites in this assessment, while many declining populations were not included due to lack of data. At many sites, the simple process of monitoring a population offers significant protection. Meanwhile, adjacent unprotected and unmonitored nesting sites may be suffering significant decline due to poaching and destruction of nesting habitat that are unrecorded. A case in point is that of Antigua/Barbuda, where the relatively small Jumby Bay nesting population, which has been intensely monitored since 1987, has increased by 79% (+23 turtles) during the past two decades. Meanwhile, the other 35 known Hawksbill nesting beaches of Antigua/ Barbuda neither have been afforded protection, nor has the status of their nesting populations been monitored (see ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).&#160; We are concerned that in the Atlantic Ocean, protected populations are over-represented in our assessment, thus causing the assessment to under-estimate the true rate of regional population decline. <br/><br/>Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean, is one of the few places in the world where records of long-term monitoring of both protected and unprotected beaches are available (see IND-Table 4 in Supplementary Material).&#160; For the inner islands of Seychelles, monitoring was conducted at all 22 islands during both the early 1980s and the early 2000s. Nesting populations at the two islands that had been well-protected since the 1970s increased by 389% during a period of two decades; meanwhile, the nesting populations at 13 islands that had received no protection prior to 1994 declined by 59% during the same period.&#160; When all 22 of the inner islands are considered together, there was an overall decline of 24% in the total nesting population between the early 1980s and the early 2000s.","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Hawksbills nest on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the tropics and subtropics. They are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Witzell 1983). Available data indicate that newly emerged hatchlings enter the sea and are carried by offshore currents into major gyre systems where they remain until reaching a carapace length of some 20 to 30 cm. At that point they recruit into a neritic developmental foraging habitat that may comprise coral reefs or other hard bottom habitats, sea grass, algal beds, or mangrove bays and creeks (Musick and Limpus 1997) or mud flats (R. von Brandis unpubl. data). As they increase in size, immature Hawksbills typically inhabit a series of developmental habitats, with some tendency for larger turtles to inhabit deeper sites (van Dam and Diez 1997, Bowen et al. 2007). Once sexually mature, they undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and breeding areas at intervals of several years (Witzell 1983, Dobbs <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Global population genetic studies have demonstrated the tendency of female sea turtles to return to breed at their natal rookery (Bowen and Karl 1997), even though as juveniles they may have foraged at developmental habitats located hundreds or thousands of kilometers from the natal beach. While Hawksbills undertake long migrations, some portion of immature animals may settle into foraging habitats near their beaches of origin (Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Roles in the Ecosystem&#160; </span><br/>Like other species of sea turtles, Hawksbills contribute to marine and coastal food webs and transport nutrients within the oceans (Bouchard and Bjorndal 2000). Hawksbills are important components of healthy coral reef ecosystems and are primarily spongivorous in the Caribbean (Meylan 1988), but more omnivorous in the Indo-Pacific (review by Bjorndal 1997). They consume relatively large amounts of algae in northern Australia (Whiting 2000 cited in S. Whiting in litt. to J. Mortimer 4 Jun 2007), soft corals in the Great Barrier Reef region (C. Limpus unpublished data), and other combinations of forage depending on habitat (in Seychelles, J. Mortimer and R. von Brandis unpublished data; in Barbados, B. Krueger unpublished data). At sites where they are primarily spongivorous, Hawksbills have been found to support healthy reefs by controlling sponges which would otherwise out-compete reef-building corals for space (Hill 1998, León and Bjorndal 2002, Bjorndal and Jackson 2003).","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Threats</span>: <br/><br/>The most important threats to Hawksbill turtles, described here, are dealt with in greater detail in the section entitled Regional Overview (see Supplementary Material).<br/><ul><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Tortoiseshell Trade</span>. Recent and historical tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Within the last 100 years, millions of Hawksbills have been killed for the tortoiseshell markets of Europe, the United States and Asia. The global plight of the Hawksbill in the latter half of the 20th Century has been recognized by the inclusion of the species in the most threatened category of IUCN’s Red List since 1968 and the listing of all Hawksbill populations on Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, since 1977. Nevertheless, trade continued at exceptionally high levels for years as major trading countries acceded to CITES and Japan, the world’s largest consumer of bekko (tortoiseshell), continued to import shell under a CITES reservation (exception) until 1993. During the period 1950-1992, Japan’s bekko imports were the equivalent of 1,329,044 large turtles (1,408,787 kg). Conservatively estimating that 30% of the turtles taken for the trade were nesting females, nearly 400,000 adult female Hawksbills were killed for the Japanese market in those years, a time frame that approximates a single Hawksbill generation. Significant domestic trade in Hawksbill products continues to be a major problem in many countries and, despite international and domestic prohibitions and the lessening of the volume in the last decade, trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas and southeast Asia (Fleming 2001, Chacón 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Egg Collection</span>. Intense levels of egg exploitation continue in many parts of the world (see IND-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material), especially southeast Asia, where it approaches 100% in many areas (see PAC-Tables 4 and 5 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Slaughter for Meat</span>. Adult and juvenile Hawksbills are still killed for meat in many areas (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).&#160; In some places the meat is used by fishermen as shark bait (J. Mortimer unpubl. data, C. Lagueux, unpubl. data). Fishermen who target lobster and reef fish will commonly take whatever hawksbills they encounter (Carr and Meylan 1980).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Destruction of Nesting Habitat</span>. Tropical coastlines are rapidly being developed for tourism which often leads to destruction of nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Because Hawksbills prefer to nest under vegetation they are particularly impacted by beach-front development and clearing of dune vegetation. Daytime nesting Hawksbills in the Western Indian Ocean are particular sensitive to disturbance from human activity on the coast and in nearshore waters (Mortimer 2004). In other parts of the world such as the Middle East and Western Australia gas and oil refineries seriously disrupt nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5 and PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Destruction of Foraging Habitat</span>. Hawksbills are typically associated with coral reefs, which are among the world’s most endangered marine ecosystems (Wilkinson 2000). Climate change has led to massive coral bleaching events with permanent consequences for local habitats (Sheppard 2006) (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Hybridisation of Hawksbills with Other Species</span>. At certain sites where Hawksbill numbers are particularly low, they regularly hybridise with other species of sea turtles (see ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Entanglement and Ingestion of Marine Debris - including Fishing Gear</span>. Hawkbills are particularly susceptible to entanglement in gill nets (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material) and capture on fishing hooks (Mortimer 1998). Juvenile Hawksbills comprised 47% of all turtles entangled in derelict fishing nets and other debris in northern Australian waters (Kiessling 2003, White 2004). Ingestion of marine debris by Hawksbills is also significant (White 2004).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Oil Pollution</span>. There is evidence oil pollution has a greater impact on Hawksbills than on other species of turtle (Meylan and Redlow 2006). In some parts of the world (especially the Middle East) oil pollution is a major problem (see IND-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).<br/></li></ul><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;""><br/>Tortoiseshell Trade Overview</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">History of the Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the carapace and plastron of the Hawksbill turtle, has been prized since ancient times. Surrounded by legend, tortoiseshell has been described as “one of the romantic articles of commerce, not only because of where it comes from, but because of the creatures from which it is obtained and the people engaged in the trade” (quoted in Parsons 1972). Jewellery and other tortoiseshell objects have been unearthed from pre-dynastic graves of the Nubian rulers of Egypt and excavated from the ruins of the Han Empire which ruled China in pre-Christian times. Over 2,000 years ago Julius Caesar considered the warehouses of Alexandria brimming with tortoiseshell to be the chief spoil of his triumph. By the early years of the 9th Century, caravans of Arab traders carried rhinoceros horn, ivory, and tortoiseshell throughout the Indian Ocean. For the next 1,000 years, the tortoiseshell trade flourished (Parsons 1972). Around 1700, during the Edo Period, the bekko (tortoiseshell) artisans of Japan established themselves at Nagasaki (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987).<br/><br/>The tortoiseshell trade has been closely linked to European discovery, conquest, and commerce around the world. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and English played major roles in the global trade; exploitation occurred throughout the world’s tropical oceans, and especially in the East Indies (i.e., modern day India, Indo China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The East Indies were a major source of the shell of antiquity, and these rich waters fittingly have been called the world’s most productive seas for tortoiseshell (Parsons 1972). In the insular Pacific international trade did not develop until the mid 19th Century, but once established, it took a tremendous toll on the region’s Hawksbills. For the next 150 years, tortoiseshell was a prized commodity in the Pacific, first with the sandal-wooders and then with the whalers (McKinnon 1975).<br/><br/>European Hawksbill fishing in the Caribbean began in the mid-17th Century and intensified throughout the 18th Century as demand increased (McClenachan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). As they decimated local Hawksbill populations in one area after another, turtle fishermen moved from one site to the next. The plentiful Hawksbill resources of Central America were exploited for more than 100 years by traders, including Americans, who established the town of Bocas del Toro on the coast of Panama in 1826 (Parsons 1972). Turtling was still a lucrative business in Cuba in 1885 when the village of Cocodrilos on the Isle of Pines was settled by turtle fishermen who emigrated from the Cayman Islands after its Hawksbills were gone (Carrillo et al. 1999). Over the next 100 years, many tens of thousands of Hawksbills were captured in the rich foraging grounds of the Cuban shelf.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">20th Century Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world.&#160; In the early 20th Century, tortoiseshell was imported for luxury markets in Europe, the United States and Asia as the manufacture of combs and brushes, jewellery boxes, and tortoiseshell ornaments was “an established industry in almost every civilized country” (Seale 1917). Declines in Hawksbill populations were obvious in many areas by the first part of the century, as exemplified by expressions of “wanton destruction” in the Virgin Islands (Schmidt 1916) and over exploitation in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) (Dammerman 1929). Although existing records document an extensive trade in many countries, such as the 8,000 Hawksbills (8,000 kg) taken annually in the Philippines for the shell trade to Japan during World War I (Seale 1917) and 160,700 Hawksbills killed between 1918-1927 in the Dutch East Indies for export to Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands (Dammerman 1929), records for many other areas are incomplete.<br/><br/>During the 20th century, Japan was the world’s largest importer of tortoiseshell (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Although data are not available for imports in the first half of the century, Japanese statistics document the import of shell equivalent to more than 1.3 million large Hawksbills from around the world between 1950-1992 and more than 575,000 stuffed juveniles from Asia between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Local trade in stuffed Hawksbills also flourished in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Americas, especially in tourist areas. When Japanese, European, American and other Asian imports are considered along with the large quantities of tortoiseshell used locally in places like Sri Lanka and Madagascar, it is readily apparent that some millions of Hawksbills were killed for the tortoiseshell trade in the last 100 years.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hawksbills and CITES&#160;&#160; </span><br/>In 1975, in recognition of its threatened status, the Hawksbill was included on Appendices I (Atlantic population) and II (Pacific population) of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, when the Convention came into force. By 1977 the entire species was moved to Appendix I to prohibit all international trade. Nevertheless, the global trade continued for a number of years, in large part driven by Japanese demand. At the end of 1992, Japanese imports ceased, but the industry continues to operate with stockpiled material.<br/><ul><li>In the late 1970s more than 45 countries were involved in exporting and importing raw shell, with annual Japanese imports the equivalent of about 37,700 turtles (40,000 kg).</li><li>Export and import levels remained exceptionally high until the mid-1980s as major trading nations slowly joined CITES. When they acceded to CITES in 1978, France and Italy took reservations (exceptions) to the Appendix I Hawksbill listing; these reservations were withdrawn in 1984 when they joined the EU.</li><li>When Japan acceded to CITES in 1980, it also took a reservation on the Hawksbill and reduced its annual quota to the equivalent of 28,300 turtles (30,000 kg), based solely on the needs of its bekko industry.</li><li>In 1985 CITES proposals by Indonesia and the Seychelles to place their Hawksbill populations on Appendix II to allow trade failed at the 5th CITES Conference of the Parties (COP 5). A similar Indonesian proposal at COP 6 in 1987 was withdrawn before the vote.</li><li>A comprehensive report on the Japanese sea turtle trade by Milliken and Tokunaga in 1987 documented significant amounts of bekko trade with CITES countries. From 1980 to 1985, between 42% and 58% of all bekko imports originated in CITES countries, without proper export documents.</li><li>In 1989 a detailed report commissioned by the CITES Secretariat found that Hawksbill populations were depleted or declining in 56 of 65 geopolitical units for which data were available and estimated that the annual global nesting population was a minimum of 15,000-25,000 Hawksbills. The authors concluded that the listing of the species on Appendix I was “unquestionably appropriate and must be maintained” (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).</li><li>On 1 April 1990, Japan reduced its annual bekko quota to the equivalent of 18,870 turtles (20,000 kg,).&#160; In 1991, in an effort to avoid a U.S. embargo of its fish and fishery products, Japan agreed to further reduce its annual quota to the equivalent of 7,075 turtles (7,500 kg) by August 1991, to establish a zero quota on 1 January 1993, and to drop its Hawksbill reservation in July 1994. Japan also agreed to support the re-training of hundreds of bekko artisans. In the early 1990s, in response to the end of the Japanese trade, Cuba reduced its annual Hawksbill fishery quota from 5,000 turtles to 500.</li><li>Since 1994, officials in Seychelles and Zanzibar have acquired tortoiseshell stocks from local artisans and subsequently burned them to demonstrate a commitment to ending the tortoiseshell trade (Khatib et al. 1996, Mortimer 1999). Cape Verde has shown similar commitment (Fretey et al. 2002).</li><li>In 1997 and 2000, at CITES COP 10 and COP 11, Cuba proposed to sell its stockpiled tortoiseshell to Japan, and also proposed a continuation of the international trade in tortoiseshell taken from the 500 Hawksbills still captured each year. All these proposals failed.</li><li>In response to regional disagreement generated by Cuban interest in moving Caribbean Hawksbills from Appendix I to II, the CITES Secretariat convened two regional Hawksbill dialogues in 2001 and 2002. The Dialogues encouraged regional cooperation by helping to establish Hawksbill priorities. As a result, resources for research, management and conservation have been generated.</li><li>Although the tortoiseshell trade continues to threaten Hawksbills in numerous places, overall volume is substantially reduced. Thirty years after CITES came into force, the ban on international trade demonstrates its value over time in protecting Hawksbills. Above all, nesting increases in the Caribbean coincide with the enormous reduction in Hhawksbill fishing in Cuban waters.</li><li>In June 2007, Cuba informed CITES COP 14 that it would voluntarily institute a moratorium on its sea turtle fisheries in 2008. Although Cuba has a CITES Hawksbill reservation (exception) and reserves its right to dispose of its tortoiseshell stockpile, most nations are members of CITES and therefore cannot legally trade in tortoiseshell.<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Japanese Tortoiseshell Trade</span><br/>Twenty years ago, in their landmark report on Japan’s sea turtle trade, Milliken and Tokunaga (1987) focused on providing estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills (and other species of sea turtles) represented by trade data so that the effect of Japanese exploitation around the world could be assessed. In particular, they cautioned that past exploitation is relevant to understanding and predicting current sea turtle population trends.<br/><br/>Estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills involved in the tortoiseshell trade are based on conversion factors calculated for each region by Milliken and Tokunaga (1987). Globally, the average Hawksbill produces 1.06 kg of tortoiseshell; but regionally, conversions are 0.74 kg in the Indian Ocean; 0.75 kg in Asia; 0.88 kg in Oceania; and 1.34 kg in the Caribbean. A combination of factors likely accounts for these differences, including regional variation in average adult size, as well as the relative proportion of adult and immature turtles represented in the trade. Some reports indicate that in the past the average turtle produced more shell than in recent decades. Adult turtles that survive long enough will continue to grow, so it follows that the average size of nesting animals tends to decline in an over-exploited population. In other cases, once nesting populations have been destroyed, hunters may shift their focus to foraging turtles which usually include immature animals. In the absence of specific historical information documenting the size classes of animals killed, the conversions we use in the present assessment are based on estimates provided by Milliken and Tokunaga. Based on the trade through 1992 (when legal Japanese imports ceased), the following information reveals the extent of the Japanese exploitation of global Hawksbill populations and the percent contribution of different regions to overall imports during 1950-1992.<br/><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Caribbean and Latin America (44.2%)</span>: 29 countries provided the shell of 460,220 turtles (616,695 kg). Exports from Panama and Cuba were the equivalent of 152,070 and 106,948 turtles (203,774 kg and 170,047 kg, respectively), making them the most important sources of bekko in the world for Japan. Panama hosted the region’s largest nesting Hawksbill assemblages until the latter part of the 20th Century. After 1961, Hawksbills in the Cuban trade were captured only at sea, but comprised adult and large immature animals.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asia (20.8%)</span>: nine countries provided the shell of 387,020 turtles (290,265 kg). Exports from Indonesia were the equivalent of 155,654 turtles (116,741 kg), making it the most important source in the region and the third largest global supplier to Japan. Much of the shell exported from Singapore to Japan was probably of Indonesian origin (118,535 turtles, 88,901 kg). Asia was nearly the sole source of Japan’s stuffed juvenile Hawksbill imports, as discussed below.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">North America (15.1%)</span>: the United States provided Japan with the shell of 199,490 turtles (211,463 kg) in two very large shipments, 142,241 kg in 1951 and 68,402 in 1954. The countries of origin are unknown, but in all likelihood some quantity originated in U.S. Caribbean and Pacific territories.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Indian Ocean and East Africa (8.7%)</span>: 15 countries provided the shell of 164,828 turtles (121,973 kg). Kenya and Tanzania, regional collection points, were the major exporters. Countries in the northwestern Indian Ocean are notably absent from Japanese import statistics. As a non-CITES country, Maldives figured prominently in the trade after 1984 despite its national legislation protecting Hawksbills. Japanese imports therefore were in contravention of CITES Conf. Res. 4.25, which requires a nation with a reservation to treat an Appendix I species as Appendix II, with valid export documents from the country of origin.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Oceania (5.8%)</span>: six countries provided the shell of 92,124 turtles (81,069 kg). A significant proportion of this trade is attributed to Australia until 1977 (29,109 turtles; 25,616 kg). Solomon Islands and Fiji were also important suppliers, especially in the final years of trading, with 40,982 and 14,490 turtles (36,064 and 12,751 kg, respectively). Fiji banned all tortoiseshell exports in January 1991 (Daly, 1991) but domestic tourist trade in Hawksbill curios and whole carapaces continues (see PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Europe and West Africa (5.4%)</span>: 10 countries provided the shell of 70,560 turtles (74,793 kg). The Netherlands was the largest exporter with the equivalent of 44,775 turtles (47,461 kg), but the source of this shell is unknown.</li><li>In the 1970s, small lacquered Hawksbills became popular in Japan as symbols of long life. From 1970-1986 Japan imported 576,702 juvenile Hawksbills, mostly from Indonesia and Singapore but also from Taiwan, Province of China (32,075), the Ryukyus (13,438), Philippines (8698), Viet Nam (1195), Hong Kong (3549), and small quantities from a handful of other nations. Japan subsequently prohibited the trade, but continued to allow dealers to sell stocks acquired before July 1994. In December 1999, the dealers reported that they had a total of 135 stuffed sea turtles (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).</li><li>Numerous irregularities in bekko imports occurred in the final years of Japan’s trade under its CITES reservation. These included imports of shell from non-CITES countries that did not legally allow export of shell, as well as imports from countries known to have had too few turtles to supply the shell attributed to them. Based on these data, Japanese bekko imports from 11 of the 14 countries reported by the dealers in 1989 were illegal.</li><li>The bekko stockpile in Japan includes raw shell and finished products. After Japan banned all imports in January 1993, annual Japanese domestic sales from stockpiled supplies remained high. Between July 1995 and July 1998 the stockpile was reduced from 188.4 to 102.73 tonnes (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000). Information on subsequent annual sales and use is not available, but supplies would now be exhausted if utilization had continued at 28 tonnes a year after July 1998.</li><li>Today, however, the bekko industry is intact, and Japanese consumer demand remains high. In January 2000, the valuable raw shell from abdominal plates ranged in price from JPY 30,000 per kg to JPY 150,000 per kg (US $ 294-$1470 at that time) (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">21st Century Global Trade</span><br/>Significant domestic trade in Hawksbill products is a major problem in many countries and, despite prohibitions on international trade and a reduction in its volume in the last decade, international and domestic trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas, Asia, and parts of Africa (Fleming 2001, Chacon 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).<br/><ul><li>Some Japanese dealers have continued to import shell illegally as evidenced by numerous bekko shipments intercepted en route to or in Japan since the ban took effect (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000) and ongoing underground trade in southeast Asia to Japan and other destinations (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004).</li><li>More than a decade after the Japanese prohibition on bekko imports took effect, van Dijk and Shepherd (2004) reported the interest of the Japan Bekko Association in acquiring Indonesia’s remaining stockpiles of bekko.</li><li>Although the volume of trade in Indonesia diminished significantly between 1991 and 2001, it is still substantial.

Viet Nam subsequently instituted full protection for the Hawksbill (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC East Asia 2004).</li><li>In recent reviews of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican Republic, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, researchers provided evidence of extensive clandestine trade in sea turtles, including Hawksbills.&#160; Management and law enforcement are inadequate throughout the region (Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).</li><li>On 1 February 2007, the Kyodo News of Japan reported that Cuba would not seek to re-open the international tortoiseshell trade at the upcoming CITES meeting and noted Japanese disappointment given the long term support provided for the bekko industry. During 1991-2006, the Japanese government spent 735 million yen (US $6M) for research on Hawksbill resources and 140 million yen (US $1.1M) for projects to resume international trade, including trade with Cuba. The article also reported that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will support the bekko industry for another five years.<span times="""" new="""" roman=""""></li></ul>","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Generation Length</span><br/>Generation length is defined as the age to maturity plus one half the reproductive longevity (Pianka 1974). Hawksbills mature very slowly, taking 20 to 40 years, and so are long-lived (Chaloupka and Musick 1997). In the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, Hawksbills may mature in 20 or more years (Boulon 1983, 1994; Diez and van Dam 2002; Krueger in litt. 2006). Age to maturity in the Indo-Pacific requires a minimum of 30-35 years (Limpus 1992; Limpus and Miller 2000; Mortimer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, 2003). In northeastern Australia, first breeding is estimated to occur at 31-36 years for females and 38 years for males (Limpus and Miller 2000).<br/><br/>Data on reproductive longevity in Hawksbills are limited, but becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches.&#160; During the last decade, numerous individual Caribbean Hawksbills have been recorded actively nesting over a period of 14-22 years (C.E. Diez in litt. 2006, Z. Hillis-Starr in litt. 2006, Parrish and Goodman 2006). In the Indo-Pacific&#160; Mortimer and Bresson (1999) and Limpus (1992) have reported nesting over 17-20 years, comparable to other Chelonid turtles which range from 20 to 30 years (Carr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1978, FitzSimmons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995).<br/><br/>Given estimated ages to maturity of 25 years in the Caribbean and 35 years in the Indo-Pacific, with half of reproductive longevity estimated at 10 years, a conservative generation length of 35 years (25 + 10 years) is calculated for the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, and 45 years (35 + 10 years) in the Indo-Pacific. In analyzing the data, declines over three generations are therefore measured for up to 105 years in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic and up to 135 years in the Indo-Pacific. In fact, generation length may well have been longer in the days when population density was higher (Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nesting Population Size and Fecundity</span><br/>Sea turtle population trends are best diagnosed using in-water abundance estimates coupled with estimates of demographic parameters such as survival and recruitment possibilities (Chaloupka and Limpus 2001, Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). However, these data rarely exist for sea turtle populations and so most assessments are based on evaluating nesting trends, which assumes a close correlation between population trends and nesting activity (Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/>&#160;<br/>For this assessment the size of a nesting population is defined as the average number of individual females nesting per year. In some cases, population numbers can be determined by saturation tagging of nesting females or by recording the total number of slaughtered nesters. More often, however, population estimates need to be derived from records of the total number of egg clutches laid during a season. Saturation tagging of nesting females indicates that at most sites the average female Hawksbill lays between three and five egg clutches during a single nesting season (Richardson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999), with indications that newly recruited females lay fewer egg clutches (Mortimer and Bresson 1999, Beggs <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), and possibly fewer clutches in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (Pilcher 1999). Following the pattern of earlier status reviews, the present assessment calculates the annual number of nesting females by dividing the total number of egg clutches recorded, by three to five to produce a bracketed population estimate.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Population Trends and Conclusions</span><br/>In many parts of the world, Hawksbill populations have continued to decline since the publication of the previous Red List Assessment (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Continuing losses in southeast Asia are of particular concern. Hawksbills face multiple, severe threats. The volume of the tortoiseshell trade has diminished, yet it remains active and substantial, and the Japanese bekko industry remains intact.<br/><br/>In 2001 the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee upheld the Critically Endangered listing of the Hawksbill, based on ongoing and long-term declines in excess of 80% within the time frame of three generations and ongoing exploitation (IUCN 2001b). The Subcommittee review cited “convincing evidence of reductions in excess of 80% over the last three generations at many, if not most of the important breeding sites throughout the global range of the species”. Not surprisingly, those declines reflect the intensity of the tortoiseshell trade in the 20th Century. Although some relatively large populations still exist, especially in Australia, this is not inconsistent with long-term global or even regional population reduction over three generations (a point noted by the Subcommittee). Unlike previous reviews of the status of the Hawksbill, the present assessment is quantitative and provides a numerical basis for the global listing of the species as Critically Endangered. The 2001 findings of the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee are as valid today as they were six years ago.<br/><br/>The current assessment clearly demonstrates the importance of protection in both terrestrial and marine habitats. With protection, some populations have stabilized, and others are now increasing, most notably in the Caribbean. The increases documented in the Caribbean coincide with dramatic reductions in take on the foraging grounds of Cuba which have, in effect, spared tens of thousands of large Hawksbills since the early 1990s. Such increases provide hope for the future, but unfortunately are still the exception rather than the rule. Similar results are needed elsewhere.",Decreasing,"<p>The Hawksbill has a circumglobal distribution throughout tropical and, to a lesser extent, subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. Hawksbills are migratory and individuals undertake complex movements through geographically disparate habitats during their lifetimes. Hawksbill nesting occurs in at least 70 countries, although much of it now only at low densities. Their movements within the marine environment are less understood, but Hawksbills are believed to inhabit coastal waters in more than 108 countries (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989, Baillie and Groombridge 1996; see Regional Overviews in Supplementary Material).</p>","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tortoiseshell Trade Overview</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">History of the Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the carapace and plastron of the Hawksbill turtle, has been prized since ancient times. Surrounded by legend, tortoiseshell has been described as “one of the romantic articles of commerce, not only because of where it comes from, but because of the creatures from which it is obtained and the people engaged in the trade” (quoted in Parsons 1972). Jewellery and other tortoiseshell objects have been unearthed from pre-dynastic graves of the Nubian rulers of Egypt and excavated from the ruins of the Han Empire which ruled China in pre-Christian times. Over 2,000 years ago Julius Caesar considered the warehouses of Alexandria brimming with tortoiseshell to be the chief spoil of his triumph. By the early years of the 9th Century, caravans of Arab traders carried rhinoceros horn, ivory, and tortoiseshell throughout the Indian Ocean. For the next 1,000 years, the tortoiseshell trade flourished (Parsons 1972). Around 1700, during the Edo Period, the bekko (tortoiseshell) artisans of Japan established themselves at Nagasaki (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987).&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>The tortoiseshell trade has been closely linked to European discovery, conquest, and commerce around the world. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and English played major roles in the global trade; exploitation occurred throughout the world’s tropical oceans, and especially in the East Indies (i.e., modern day India, Indo China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The East Indies were a major source of the shell of antiquity, and these rich waters fittingly have been called the world’s most productive seas for tortoiseshell (Parsons 1972). In the insular Pacific international trade did not develop until the mid 19th Century, but once established, it took a tremendous toll on the region’s Hawksbills. For the next 150 years, tortoiseshell was a prized commodity in the Pacific, first with the sandal-wooders and then with the whalers (McKinnon 1975).<br/><br/>European Hawksbill fishing in the Caribbean began in the mid-17th Century and intensified throughout the 18th Century as demand increased (McClenachan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). As they decimated local Hawksbill populations in one area after another, turtle fishermen moved from one site to the next. The plentiful Hawksbill resources of Central America were exploited for more than 100 years by traders, including Americans, who established the town of Bocas del Toro on the coast of Panama in 1826 (Parsons 1972). Turtling was still a lucrative business in Cuba in 1885 when the village of Cocodrilos on the Isle of Pines was settled by turtle fishermen who emigrated from the Cayman Islands after its Hawksbills were gone (Carrillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999). Over the next 100 years, many tens of thousands of Hawksbills were captured in the rich foraging grounds of the Cuban shelf.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">20th Century Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world. In the early 20th century, tortoiseshell was imported for luxury markets in Europe, the United States and Asia as the manufacture of combs and brushes, jewellery boxes, and tortoiseshell ornaments was “an established industry in almost every civilized country” (Seale 1917). Declines in Hawksbill populations were obvious in many areas by the first part of the century, as exemplified by expressions of “wanton destruction” in the Virgin Islands (Schmidt 1916) and over exploitation in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) (Dammerman 1929). Although existing records document an extensive trade in many countries, such as the 8,000 Hawksbills (8,000 kg) taken annually in the Philippines for the shell trade to Japan during World War I (Seale 1917) and 160,700 Hawksbills killed between 1918-1927 in the Dutch East Indies for export to Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands (Dammerman 1929), records for many other areas are incomplete.<br/><br/>During the 20th century, Japan was the world’s largest importer of tortoiseshell (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Although data are not available for imports in the first half of the century, Japanese statistics document the import of shell equivalent to more than 1.3 million large Hawksbills from around the world between 1950-1992 and more than 575,000 stuffed juveniles from Asia between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Local trade in stuffed Hawksbills also flourished in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Americas, especially in tourist areas. When Japanese, European, American and other Asian imports are considered along with the large quantities of tortoiseshell used locally in places like Sri Lanka and Madagascar, it is readily apparent that some millions of Hawksbills were killed for the tortoiseshell trade in the last 100 years.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hawksbills and CITES&#160;&#160; </span><br/>In 1975, in recognition of its threatened status, the Hawksbill was included on Appendices I (Atlantic population) and II (Pacific population) of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, when the Convention came into force. By 1977 the entire species was moved to Appendix I to prohibit all international trade. Nevertheless, the global trade continued for a number of years, in large part driven by Japanese demand. At the end of 1992, Japanese imports ceased, but the industry continues to operate with stockpiled material.<br/><ul><li>In the late 1970s more than 45 countries were involved in exporting and importing raw shell, with annual Japanese imports the equivalent of about 37,700 turtles (40,000 kg).</li><li>Export and import levels remained exceptionally high until the mid-1980s as major trading nations slowly joined CITES. When they acceded to CITES in 1978, France and Italy took reservations (exceptions) to the Appendix I Hawksbill listing; these reservations were withdrawn in 1984 when they joined the EU.</li><li>When Japan acceded to CITES in 1980, it also took a reservation on the Hawksbill and reduced its annual quota to the equivalent of 28,300 turtles (30,000 kg), based solely on the needs of its bekko industry.</li><li>In 1985 CITES proposals by Indonesia and the Seychelles to place their Hawksbill populations on Appendix II to allow trade failed at the 5th CITES Conference of the Parties (COP 5). A similar Indonesian proposal at COP 6 in 1987 was withdrawn before the vote.</li><li>A comprehensive report on the Japanese sea turtle trade by Milliken and Tokunaga in 1987 documented significant amounts of bekko trade with CITES countries. From 1980 to 1985, between 42% and 58% of all bekko imports originated in CITES countries, without proper export documents.</li><li>In 1989 a detailed report commissioned by the CITES Secretariat found that Hawksbill populations were depleted or declining in 56 of 65 geopolitical units for which data were available and estimated that the annual global nesting population was a minimum of 15,000-25,000 Hawksbills. The authors concluded that the listing of the species on Appendix I was “unquestionably appropriate and must be maintained” (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).</li><li>On 1 April 1990, Japan reduced its annual bekko quota to the equivalent of 18,870 turtles (20,000 kg,). In 1991, in an effort to avoid a U.S. embargo of its fish and fishery products, Japan agreed to further reduce its annual quota to the equivalent of 7,075 turtles (7,500 kg) by August 1991, to establish a zero quota on 1 January 1993, and to drop its Hawksbill reservation in July 1994. Japan also agreed to support the re-training of hundreds of bekko artisans. In the early 1990s, in response to the end of the Japanese trade, Cuba reduced its annual Hawksbill fishery quota from 5,000 turtles to 500.</li><li>Since 1994, officials in Seychelles and Zanzibar have acquired tortoiseshell stocks from local artisans and subsequently burned them to demonstrate a commitment to ending the tortoiseshell trade (Khatib et al. 1996, Mortimer 1999). Cape Verde has shown similar commitment (Fretey et al. 2002).</li><li>In 1997 and 2000, at CITES COP 10 and COP 11, Cuba proposed to sell its stockpiled tortoiseshell to Japan, and also proposed a continuation of the international trade in tortoiseshell taken from the 500 Hawksbills still captured each year. All these proposals failed.</li><li>In response to regional disagreement generated by Cuban interest in moving Caribbean Hawksbills from Appendix I to II, the CITES Secretariat convened two regional Hawksbill dialogues in 2001 and 2002. The Dialogues encouraged regional cooperation by helping to establish Hawksbill priorities. As a result, resources for research, management and conservation have been generated.</li><li>Although the tortoiseshell trade continues to threaten Hawksbills in numerous places, overall volume is substantially reduced. Thirty years after CITES came into force, the ban on international trade demonstrates its value over time in protecting Hawksbills. Above all, nesting increases in the Caribbean coincide with the enormous reduction in Hawksbill fishing in Cuban waters.</li><li>In June 2007, Cuba informed CITES COP 14 that it would voluntarily institute a moratorium on its sea turtle fisheries in 2008. Although Cuba has a CITES Hawksbill reservation (exception) and reserves its right to dispose of its tortoiseshell stockpile, most nations are members of CITES and therefore cannot legally trade in tortoiseshell.<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Japanese Tortoiseshell Trade</span><br/>Twenty years ago, in their landmark report on Japan’s sea turtle trade, Milliken and Tokunaga (1987) focused on providing estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills (and other species of sea turtles) represented by trade data so that the effect of Japanese exploitation around the world could be assessed. In particular, they cautioned that past exploitation is relevant to understanding and predicting current sea turtle population trends.<br/><br/>Estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills involved in the tortoiseshell trade are based on conversion factors calculated for each region by Milliken and Tokunaga (1987). Globally, the average Hawksbill produces 1.06 kg of tortoiseshell; but regionally, conversions are 0.74 kg in the Indian Ocean; 0.75 kg in Asia; 0.88 kg in Oceania; and 1.34 kg in the Caribbean. A combination of factors likely accounts for these differences, including regional variation in average adult size, as well as the relative proportion of adult and immature turtles represented in the trade. Some reports indicate that in the past the average turtle produced more shell than in recent decades. Adult turtles that survive long enough will continue to grow, so it follows that the average size of nesting animals tends to decline in an over-exploited population. In other cases, once nesting populations have been destroyed, hunters may shift their focus to foraging turtles which usually include immature animals. In the absence of specific historical information documenting the size classes of animals killed, the conversions we use in the present assessment are based on estimates provided by Milliken and Tokunaga. Based on the trade through 1992 (when legal Japanese imports ceased), the following information reveals the extent of the Japanese exploitation of global Hawksbill populations and the percent contribution of different regions to overall imports during 1950-1992.<br/><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Caribbean and Latin America (44.2%)</span>: 29 countries provided the shell of 460,220 turtles (616,695 kg). Exports from Panama and Cuba were the equivalent of 152,070 and 106,948 turtles (203,774 kg and 170,047 kg, respectively), making them the most important sources of bekko in the world for Japan. Panama hosted the region’s largest nesting Hawksbill assemblages until the latter part of the 20th Century. After 1961, Hawksbills in the Cuban trade were captured only at sea, but comprised adult and large immature animals.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asia (20.8%)</span>: 9 countries provided the shell of 387,020 turtles (290,265 kg). Exports from Indonesia were the equivalent of 155,654 turtles (116,741 kg), making it the most important source in the region and the third largest global supplier to Japan. Much of the shell exported from Singapore to Japan was probably of Indonesian origin (118,535 turtles, 88,901 kg).

From 1970-1986 Japan imported 576,702 juvenile Hawksbills, mostly from Indonesia and Singapore but also from Taiwan, Province of China (32,075), the Ryukyus (13,438), Philippines (8698), Viet Nam (1195), Hong Kong (3549), and small quantities from a handful of other nations. Japan subsequently prohibited the trade, but continued to allow dealers to sell stocks acquired before July 1994. In December 1999, the dealers reported that they had a total of 135 stuffed sea turtles (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).</li><li>Numerous irregularities in bekko imports occurred in the final years of Japan’s trade under its CITES reservation.

Nevertheless this may be a species of serious conservation concern locally, particularly in Nigeria due to reported population declines and habitat loss resulting from this country's level of industrialization.","This species occurs in savanna and forest. It is exclusively associated with watercourses and other permanent waterbodies, including lakes and marshes with gallery forest (Trape and Mané 2006). It can occur at similar densities in mature forest and plantation-forest mosaics, but ""very rarely"" enters heavily-altered habitats (Luiselli <em>et al. </em>2002). It is active mostly by day but also nocturnally, and fish are its preferred prey although it will also take amphibians, reptiles, bird eggs and small rodents (Trape and Mané 2006).&#160;This is an oviparous species, laying 15 to 26 eggs.","As a highly venomous snake this species is likely to be persecuted throughout its range, which may place some localized pressure on subpopulations of an animal that occurs at low abundance. Habitat loss represents a threat to this snake, both directly as this snake occurs at low densities (Luiselli <em>et al. </em>2002), and indirectly by facilitating the expansion of the more adaptable spitting cobra <em>Naja nigricollis</em>, which is a superior competitor in modified habitats (Luiselli <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Nigeria, where this species has undergone apparently severe declines, rapid population growth and heavy industrialization, including oil and gas exploration as well as infrastructure development, are the leading causes of forest loss (L. Luiselli pers. comm. 2012).","This species is regularly observed throughout its range, although as a top predator it naturally occurs in relatively low densities. In Nigeria, where this species was formerly very common, the population has been reduced as a result of forest loss, and it appears to be rare or have been lost entirely from many areas over a period of ""just a few decades"" (Luiselli <em>et al.</em> 2002).",Decreasing,"This species has a distribution centred on the Congo Basin, from where it ranges west at least to southwestern Nigeria, although its western range limits are poorly-known, and south to northern Angola (Wüster&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).

These threats are considered imminent and of high magnitude throughout the species' entire range. USFWS (2011) had no information indicating that the magnitude or imminence of these threats is likely to be appreciably reduced in the foreseeable future, and in the case of pipeline disturbance, USFWS expected this threat to become more problematic over the next several years as natural gas development continues to intensify.<br/><br/>Suitable habitat has declined due to impoundment (see Mitchell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002).

14871490,22823,Ursus maritimus,Vulnerable,A3c,2015,2015-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Loss of Arctic sea ice due to climate change is the most serious threat to Polar Bears throughout their circumpolar range (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stirling and Derocher 2012, USFWS 2015). We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term “management units” may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (M’Clintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89°46’N, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52°35’N (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bears’ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party “…shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,…” and according to Article VII, “The Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bears…” and&#160; “...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...”. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Further, the Parties shall consult with each other on the management of shared Polar Bear subpopulations, and exchange information on research and management programs. The PBSG has reiterated that all management actions be based on the best scientific information. The PBSG has identified these management elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Protection of essential habitats</li><li>Use of scientific evidence</li><li>Monitoring, prevention and sound management of human-bear conflicts</li><li>Development of inter-jurisdictional agreements for shared populations</li><li>Development of management strategies to minimize impacts of human activities (e.g. mining, shipping, oil and gas activities, tourism and other human-caused disturbance)</li><li>Management of sustainable harvest</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of the local public living in polar bear areas in developing and achieving the goals of the action plan </li></ul><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Surviving subpopulations remain  threatened by ongoing and increasing habitat loss due to the planting of  oil palm and illicit crops, expanding cattle ranching, increased oil  exploration and mining, and fires.","Night monkeys typically occur in primary and secondary forest (including disturbed forest and selectively logged forest), seasonally flooded and <em>terra firma</em>, lowland forest, and submontane and montane (cloud forests) in Colombia and the Andes to 3,200 m above sea level (the specifically montane forms are <em>Aotus lemurinus</em> and <em>Aotus miconax</em>) (Hernández Camacho and Cooper 1976, Aquino and Encarnación 1994a, Defler 2004). Aquino and Encarnación (1994b) reviewed the habitat and forest preferences of the genus. A research in San Martin area, in 100 forest fragments, found <em>A. brumbacki </em>groups in fragments of gallery forest, lowland rainforest and <em>Mauritia flexuosa</em> swamps (Carretero-Pìnzon and Defler in prep.)<br/><br/>Night monkeys are nocturnal: they are most active at dawn and dusk.  The only exception is <em>Aotus azarae azarae</em> of the Chaco of southern Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, which is cathemeral (active during night and day). They are frugivorous; their diet includes fruit, nectar and flower (seasonally important for the <em>A. a. azarae</em> in the Chaco), leaves, and small animals prey such as insects (Wright 1989; Fernandez-Duque 2007). <em>Aotus azarae</em> has been observed to include a significant portion of leaves in its diet (Ganzhorn and Wright 1994, Wright 1985, Arditi and Placci 1990, Giménez and Fernandez-Duque 2003), as has <em>Aotus zonalis</em> on Barro Colorado Island in an early study by Hladik and Hladik (1969).<br/><br/>They are socially monogamous, living in small groups of an adult pair and offspring of different ages (infant, one or two juveniles and sometimes a subadult. In <em>A. a. azarae</em>, a significant number of adults range alone. They may be subadults that have left their natal groups or older adults which have been evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernandez-Duque and Huntington 2002, Fernandez-Duque 2004). Both sexes disperse. Males care for the infants (carry them) (Rotundo <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2005). Lone adults were observed by Villavicencio Galindo (2003) in northern Colombia. Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 5-18 ha (depending on the species and location) (Wright 1978, Fernandez-Duque 2007). Solano (1995) estimated a home range of 17.5 ha for <em>A. brumbacki</em> on the Río Duda in Tinigua Natural National Park, Colombia. Wright (1994) and Fernandez-Duque (2007) review the behaviour and ecology of the genus.<br/><br/>Captive male <em>A. lemurinus</em> reach sexual maturity when two years old, and captive female <em>A. vociferans</em> and <em>A. nancymaae</em> first breed when 3-4 years old (Dixson 1983; Fernandez-Duque 2007). In the wild, male <em>A. azarae</em> reach adult weight only when about 4 years old, and age at first reproduction is about 5 years of age (Juárez <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernandez-Duque 2004). A female <em>A. azarae</em>was found to breed for the first time at 58 months of age (Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2002). Single offspring are the rule. Wright (1985) recorded births between August and February for <em>A. nigriceps</em> in Peru (Manu National Park), and Aquino <em>et al.</em> (1990) indicated a birth season between December and March) for <em>A. nancymaae</em> in north-eastern Peru. In the Argentinean Chaco, <em>A. azarae</em> shows a peak of births between March and June (Fernandez-Duque 2007).<br/><br/>Size: Hernández-Camacho and Defler (1985) recorded a weight of 875 g for one individual (sex unknown), and 455 g for a female, probably not fully grown.","Although the distribution of <em>Aotus brumbacki</em> remains poorly known, much of this Colombian endemic’s presumed range lies within regions of savanna habitats, already cleared forest, fragmented forest and ongoing ‘hotspots of deforestation’ (Etter <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sanchez-Cuervo and Aide 2013).&#160; Three of four sub-populations inhabiting protected areas remained threatened; El Cocuy National Park lies within a region characterized as a deforestation hotspot (Sanchez-Cuervo and Aide 2013), while Serranía de la Macarena Natural National Park and Tinigua Natural National Park are surrounded by areas that are already more than 70% deforested (Etter <em>et al</em>. 2006, Carretero-Pinzon 2013) and/or subjected to high levels of armed conflict (Morales 2017).

17945814,4229,Cercopithecus sclateri,Endangered,A2cd,2019,2019-01-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Endangered because Sclater’s Monkey is estimated to have undergone a population decline exceeding 50% over the past three generations (about 27 years, assuming a generation length of nine years),&#160;resulting from a decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality, and high levels of exploitation. This decline is projected to continue into the future, and its rate will probably intensify due to continuing widespread habitat loss and degradation and hunting.&#160;Additionally, the species does not occur in any officially gazetted wildlife conservation area. In large part, Sclater’s Monkey persists due to its small size, cryptic nature, adaptability and general non-preferred status among hunters relative to other monkeys. Close population monitoring should take place. However, such monitoring may be hampered by insecurity in the Niger Delta and in other parts of the species’ range and by the lack of an organised national programme in Nigeria focusing on Sclater’s Monkey.","<p>The original habitat of Sclater’s Monkey is moist tropical lowland forest, but due to severe habitat degradation, this species now persists in remnant secondary, gallery/riparian and freshwater swamp forests. The species is also found in marginal forest and farm-bush in communities where monkeys are regarded as sacred (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992, Tooze 1995, Baker 2005). Sclater’s Monkey is likely omnivorous, with a diet similar to other members of the <em>C. cephus</em> group: mostly fruits, insects and young foliage (Oates and Baker 2013).</p>","The rapidly growing human population of Nigeria is expected to be the third largest globally by 2050. This growth has been accompanied by widespread environmental degradation and will continue to negatively affect natural habitats. Across Nigeria, land area devoted to agriculture and plantations (crop and grazing lands, floodplain agriculture, irrigation and livestock projects, and tree and forest plantations) increased by nearly 84,000&#160;km²&#160;between 1976 and 1995. More than half of the country’s undisturbed lowland moist forest was lost during that same time frame (from 25,951 to 12,114                    km²) (Geomatics International <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160;From 1990–2015, net forest loss across Nigeria continued at a rate of 3.5% annually, resulting in a loss of ~4,100&#160;km²&#160;each year – more than any other African nation. During this period, Nigeria lost 59.4% of its forested area and 98.7% of its primary forest (FAO 2015). During the latter part of this period, from 2000–2015, the rate of forest loss across Nigeria accelerated (5%) (FAO 2015), and the percent of forest cover declined from 14.4% to 7.7% (World Bank 2017).&#160;Conversion of forested areas to farmland is a major contributor to this decline; for the decade ending in 2008, Nigeria converted more land to annual crops than did any other tropical nation (Phalan <em>et al.</em> 2013). The southeastern region of Nigeria, where Sclater’s Monkey occurs, has among the highest human population densities in the country and one of the highest in Africa. As a result, most natural forest across this species’ range has been converted to cultivated land; unregulated logging and activities associated with oil exploration and production have added to the destruction (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992, Baker and Olubode 2008). Of particular concern for Sclater’s Monkey is severe habitat fragmentation, resulting in a lack of connectivity among existing populations and associated loss of heterozygosity in population isolates.&#160;Additionally, the species does not occur in any official wildlife conservation area or have any effective protection from exploitation outside of the very few sites where it is protected by local communities owing to social taboos.","<p>Given widespread habitat loss across this species’ range, many of the remaining populations of Sclater’s Monkey are isolated, and most occur in&#160;highly&#160;degraded, unprotected forests. This degradation, combined with hunting pressure and lack of official protection, has led to decline of the population. The species’ persistence in southeastern Nigeria can be attributed to the species’ small size, shy nature and adaptability, and preferential hunting of larger-bodied primate taxa (Baker and Olubode 2008). Until the 1990s, Sclater’s Monkey was thought to be very rare, but extensive surveys since then have revealed its presence at a number of formerly unknown sites. In one regional survey, Baker and Olubode (2008) did not encounter any localities of recent extirpation (or sites where local reports indicated that populations of this species had been extirpated even though suitable habitat remains). Nevertheless, encounter rates were low: 0.18 detections per km surveyed.<br/><br/>In the very few sites where it is not hunted, or where hunting is less commonly practised (such as the Niger Delta where some communities rely on fish as their main protein source), this species may fare relatively well compared to larger primates. In the Edumanom Forest Reserve, a comparatively large forest block in the Niger Delta, one study found Sclater’s Monkey to be the most abundant diurnal primate encountered, occurring in an estimated 3.1 groups per&#160;km² (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011). In three village sites where Sclater’s Monkey is protected by social taboos&#160;(i.e. monkeys are not killed), populations appear to increase: 1) Lagwa, Imo State (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a); 2) Akpugoeze community complex, Enugu State (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2018); and 3) Ikot Uso Akpan, Akwa Ibom State (Eniang and Egwali 2011). However, the survival of these populations requires them to adapt to living in heavily deforested, urbanizing environments. Although apparently increasing, these populations are also relatively small: 178 individuals in Ikot Uso Akpan (Eniang and Egwali 2011), 206 individuals in Lagwa (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a), and 339 individuals in the Akpugoeze community complex (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to southern Nigeria. It ranges from the eastern Niger Delta in Bayelsa State east to the Cross River, and north to Enugu and Ebonyi States; the most northerly known populations occur in southern Anambra-Enugu States and central Ebonyi State (Baker and Olubode 2008). Sclater’s Monkey was feared extinct until it was sighted southwest of Oguta, Imo State, in 1988 (Oates and Anadu 1989). Additional populations were subsequently discovered in the early to mid-1990s (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992; Tooze 1995, 1996). In a 2004 regional survey, the species was located in several sites where it had not been previously recorded (Baker 2005, Baker and Olubode 2008). Across its range, this species has generally been recorded in fragmented, degraded forests (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1992, Tooze 1995, Baker and Olubode 2008).","Being the smallest diurnal primate across its range (along with <em>Cercopithecus erythrogaster</em>), Sclater’s Monkey has the lowest economic value as bushmeat relative to other diurnal primates. While it is sought after by hunters, some hunters consider the species more difficult to kill due to its size and cryptic nature, and some do not bother hunting Sclater’s Monkey given the lower profit it brings (Baker and Olubode 2008).",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is currently listed as Class B under the African Convention and under Appendix II of CITES.<br/><br/>There are no formally protected areas in the range of Sclater’s Monkey. Important conservation measures suggested by Baker (2005) include: 1) elevating the species to Schedule I of the Nigerian Endangered Species Act (this change may not be considered unless the species is elevated to CITES Appendix I); 2) raising awareness about the species and its uniquely Nigerian status through publicity and education; and 3) enhancing protection of key forests, including the Edumanom Forest Reserve in Bayelsa State, Upper Orashi Forest Reserve in Rivers State and the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve in Akwa Ibom State.<br/><br/>Communities where Sclater’s Monkey receives cultural protection (through social taboos) are also very important, although forest cover in these sites has been greatly reduced over time.&#160;These include Ikot Uso Akpan and other communities in the Itam region (Akwa Ibom State), Lagwa (Imo State) and the Akpugoeze community complex (Enugu State). In Lagwa and Akpugoeze, previous and existing conservation measures include school-based awareness programmes, stakeholder workshops,&#160;documentation and publishing of folklore and oral histories related to the cultural value of monkeys, and population and forest monitoring (Baker 2013; Baker <em>et al.</em> 2009; 2014a,b; 2018). Forest restoration and conservation awareness efforts have also been conducted in Ikot Uso Akpan (Jacob <em>et al.</em> 2013). Development of small-scale ecotourism in these communities should be explored, given how readily monkeys can be observed at these sites.<br/><br/>Other potential areas for enhanced protection are the Niger floodplain and Osomari Forest Reserve (Oates <em style=""font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.</em> 1992), as well as the Blue River (Azumini, Abia State) and Enyong Creek/Ikpa River (Akwa Ibom State) (Tooze 1995).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It is suspected that these threats have resulted in a population decline exceeding 30% over the past 24 years (<em>ca</em> three generations) and which is unlikely to abate in the near future. The taxon therefore qualifies as VU under criterion A2cd.","Mandrills are found in evergreen rainforest, stretching between 100 and 300 km inland from the Atlantic coast, as well as in montane forest, and secondary forest. They avoid thick undergrowth areas and marshes. Mandrills are known to cross areas of savanna&#160;up to 180 m across to access forest fragments and have been known to enter plantations. They are semi-terrestrial and usually forage at less than 5 m above ground. Mandrills are omnivorous and their diverse diets&#160;include fruits, buds, leaves, roots, insects, fish, meat, crustaceans, fungus and seeds (Rogers <em>et al. </em>1996). Seeds form a more important part of the diet than the flesh of fruits, and large seeds are usually consumed (not dispersed).<br/><br/>Data on the home range of a group which is not hunted come from only one site: Lopé National Park in Gabon, where a horde of ~720 individuals has remained stable over 20 years, using 182&#160;km²&#160;of forest-savanna mosaic habitat, including 89&#160;km²&#160;of suitable forest habitat. The group used gallery forests and isolated forest fragments with high botanical diversity far more intensively that the continuous forest block (White <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">et al. </em>2010). Males travel with the female and offspring horde only during breeding (June–September) and range alone at other times of the year, visiting the group occasionally if any females become reproductively fertile outside the usual season (Abernethy <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">et al. </em>2002).&#160;Day range length for the Lopé horde averages 4.9 km per day, but for&#160;lone males&#160;is only 1 km per day.&#160;<br/><br/>Humans are the&#160;Mandrill's&#160;major predator. Leopards and pythons are also known to predate Mandrills, but Crowned Hawk Eagle is not known to. Golden Cat and smaller carnivores are also not known to take Mandrills.","Mandrills appear to be most seriously threatened in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea.This species is affected by the destruction of its evergreen forest habitat since this reduces the capacity of environments to support Mandrill populations. However, the most immediate threat is posed by poaching for their meat (Abernethy and White 2013, Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013). Large males are preferentially targeted. Commercial bushmeat hunters pose a particular threat to populations that are located close to main roads and towns. Annual offtakes per hunted horde&#160;are likely to be lower&#160;for modern day hunters using guns and snares than in the past when hunters used dogs and nets, which could result in very high offtakes (&gt;20% of the group in one hunt). However, impacts are more widely spread across the species' geographic range.","Total numbers of mandrills are unknown, but it is suspected that the species has declined significantly in recent years. Mandrills range in large hordes of several hundred individuals (Abernethy <em>et al. </em>2002, Hongo 2014), but groups in areas suffering intense subsistence hunting pressure (notably Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea) are reported to be much smaller and they have been extirpated from some areas. The largest remaining populations are to be found in Gabon.&#160;Intact forest can support densities of around 10 individuals/km², but distribution is likely to be patchy and densities much lower in areas that have experienced long-term hunting pressure.",Decreasing,"Mandrills are found in moist evergreen rainforest in central west Africa, south of the Sanaga River (Cameroon) through to mainland Equatorial Guinea, much of southern Gabon, and south-western Republic of Congo to the Kouilou River, and down to the Congo River. Inland, the lower Ivindo River and Ogooué River in Gabon limit its distribution to the east, but on two occasions mandrills have been recorded in the Garabinzam area of northwestern Congo, east of the Upper Ivindo (Fay 1989, Allam<em> et al. </em>2016). In Cameroon, mandrills have been recorded in the Dja&#160;Biosphere&#160;&#160;Reserve using with camera traps, and this appears to be at the northwestern limit of their range (Bata <em>et al</em>. 2017). Camera traps have also recorded mandrills at the source of the Ogooué,&#160;extending the species' range a little into the Batéké Plateaux National Park in Gabon (Hedwig <em>et al. </em>2017). Mandrills do not occur in south-east Cameroon or east of the Congo River. The Ogooué River bisects the species range, separating them into two distinct populations: i) Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and northern Gabon and ii) southern Gabon and Congo (Telfer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003).","Mandrill carcasses have been recorded for sale in both rural and urban markets in all four range states in each of the past 15 years (www.offtake.org).

It is estimated to have lost at least 20% of its habitat in the last 10-15 years (about three generations, based on a generation length of 4.6 years given by Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013); based on this habitat loss, it is suspected that the population size has also declined by at least 20% over the last three generations. More research is required to establish whether this species qualifies for a threatened category.","<p>The Calabar Angwantibo is most often found in areas of dense, low undergrowth with abundant lianas and vines below 5 m in the understorey of primary and secondary rainforest; it particularly favours the growth that springs up in clearings, trees falls, and along forest edges (Jewell and Oates 1969). Therefore, wherever it is already established, small-scale forest clearance, selective tree-felling and road-making probably favour this species. In such areas it can becomes relatively abundant in thickets and patches of dense secondary growth. Its diet is invertebrates and fruits; based on the ecology of its sister taxon <em>Arctocebus aureus</em> in Gabon, it is likely that caterpillars form an important part of its diet. This species is able to produce two single young in a year, with a minimum inter-birth interval of about 4.5 months (Oates and Ambrose 2013).</p>","The biggest threats to the Calabar Angwantibo are the clearance of forest for cultivation, as well as some hunting for meat. Although this species can adapt to low-level habitat disturbance (if some dense undergrowth remains and inter-tree distances are not too great), major forest conversion to intensive and/or industrial agriculture is likely to eliminate it because of its weak capacity to disperse. Such forest destruction is increasing dramatically in many parts of its range, and especially in eastern Nigeria, as the human population continues to grow and economic development intensifies. For instance, in the period 1990–2015, Nigeria suffered an estimated 59.4% loss of forest cover, while the loss in Cameroon was 22.6%; in 1990–2000 the rate of forest loss was 2.7% per annum in Nigeria compared with 0.9% per annum in Cameroon, but in 2010–2015 these rates had increased to 5.0% per annum in Nigeria 1.1% per annum in Cameroon (FAO 2015). As other wildlife has declined, hunting pressure on smaller mammals has increased, and angwantibos now feature in many bushmeat reports (Svensson and Friant 2014, Svensson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). In some areas they may also be killed when encountered because they are considered a bad omen (E.L. Gadsby pers. comm. 2016), and they feature in small quantities in trade as pets and for body parts (Svensson and Friant 2014, Svensson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).","The Calabar Angwantibo is a cryptic species that can be locally abundant within its patchy distribution. In southeastern Nigeria in the 1960s it was encountered at a rate of 0.7 individuals per km (Jewell and Oates 1969). Originally, angwantibos were probably adapted to tree-fall gaps in the forest and to forest edges (Charles-Dominique 1977); as high forest has suffered increasing anthropogenic disturbance, habitats resembling tree-fall gaps and forest edge have become more widespread. However, with forest disturbance by humans in Nigeria and Cameroon giving way to wholesale forest clearance, and hunting pressure increasing, populations of Calabar Angwantibos are almost certainly declining.",Decreasing,The Calabar Angwantibo has a very patchy and localised distribution within the lowland rainforest block between the Niger River and the Sanaga River in eastern Nigeria and western Cameroon.,This species is hunted for meat.,Terrestrial,"<a name=""_GoBack""></a>This species is listed as Class B under the African Convention, and under Appendix II of CITES.

It is also found in Cape Verde. It is found at depths ranging from 10 to 70 m.&#160;It is dependent on estuaries for spawning, larval and juvenile habitat, and may be also be dependent on mangrove systems. Adults are found in inshore waters adjacent to sandy beaches.&#160;<em>Galeoides decadactylus</em> is a commercially important species, which is taken primarily in beach seines, with gillnets, and in shallow hauls and shallow trawls. It appears to be managed as two stocks shared between nations.&#160;In the last 10-12 (three generation lengths from 2000-2011) FAO reported landings have increased by 8%. During this same time frame, scientific surveys in Mauritania show fluctuating but stable capture, and in Nigeria CPUE has remained stable. In Ghana, this species is reported as mixed-catch threadfin, but is considered to be less commonly observed than in previous years. In at least one subsection of CECAF, best models currently estimate this species to be over-exploited. Several studies prior to 2000, show a 50-75% decline in average body size, and up to 75% decline in catch (in Guinea). This species appears to have undergone severe population decline in at least some parts of its range prior to 2000, and is now present at lower levels, but is continued to be targeted with increasing effort.&#160;Throughout&#160;the region, both adults and juveniles of this species are taken in the fishery year-around. This species already been overexploited for many years, appears to have greatly declined prior to 2000, and we infer that this species is still declining over the past 10 years with increasing effort. Although better management and a reduction in effort is needed, in the absence of effective fisheries management and stock assessments, this species will likely become threatened within five years given the current rate of catch. It is listed as Near Threatened and is conservation dependent.

It is usually found over muddy bottoms in shallow coastal waters, in estuaries and in lagoons. It is considered a marine-estuarine&#160;species&#160;(Simier<em> et al. </em>2006). Mangrove wetlands are an important habitat for larval and juvenile stages of this species (Moses 2000). It does not appear to penetrate below the thermocline, and occurs in inshore waters adjacent to sandy beaches. It is a semi-diadromous fish which migrates to spawn into estuaries and the lower reaches of rivers (CECAF/ECAF Series 1986). This species generally feeds on crustaceans and small fishes. Detritus accounted for about 30% of food contained in the stomachs of estuarine specimens (versus zero percent in open sea specimens). About 25% of females&#160;developed&#160;directly from the juvenile stages, the others&#160;developing&#160;female gonads after passing through a non-functional hermaphroditic stage arising in apparently normal males. Spawning of the species occurs in all months, peaking in the dry season, but almost ceasing during the rainy season in Nigerian waters. Lengths ranged from 150 mm total length for males to 255 mm for secondary females, and this species grows rapidly during the first year. At one year, the species averages 207 mm total&#160;length, 317 mm at two years, and 390 mm at three years&#160;(Motomura in press).&#160;<em>Galeoides decadactylus</em>&#160;co-exists with&#160;<em>Pentanemus quinquarius</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Polydactylus quadrifilis</em>&#160;in brackish waters of the the Warri River in Nigeria.

In other countries, length at first maturity is estimated to be in 13.7 cm (Senegal), Congo 18.5 cm, Guinea 11-13 cm and Cameroon 13 cm (Sidibe 2003), which means that the age of first maturity is likely less than one year. At eight years, this species have been found to reach 34.55 cm in Guinea and 35 cm in Nigeria (Sidibe 2003). Generation length is conservatively estimated to be approximately four years.<br/><strong><br/></strong><u>Family Polynemidae</u><br/>Polynemids are epibenthic fishes which occur on sandy or muddy bottoms in coastal waters and estuaries. Juveniles are found in seagrass beds or tidepools. As major predators of coastal and estuarine ecosystems, most polynemids feed on a variety of fishes and crustaceans. The pectoral fins of polynemids are divided into an upper part, with rays joined by membrane, and a lower part with four to 11 separate rays, which are thought to act as a sense organ to be used for searching for food in turbid waters. Most polynemids are protandrous. Information on &#160;the larval&#160;development&#160;of polynemids is minimal. Eggs are spherical and pelagic. Polynemids are commercially important in the eastern central Atlantic. The annual catch of polynemids from the area averaged about 39,000 tonnes in the period from 2000 to 2006.

As of 2004, the&#160;<em>G. decadactylus</em> stock shared between Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia were also were also considered to be over-exploited (FIRMS 2000-2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Stocks of demersal fishes, including&#160;<em>G. decadactylus</em>, which are available to artisanal fisheries were seriously depleted between 1984 and 1987, underwent a slight recovery between 1988 and 1991, and are still considered to be in a depressed state in Nigeria (Moses 2000). <em>Galeoides decadactylus</em> is also taken as by-catch in the commercial octopus fishery operating off the coast of Guinea (FIRMS 2012-2013).&#160;The best model (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin) was considered to be overexploited with an Bcurrent/B0.1 of 825%, and Fcurrent/F0.1 is 20%.<br/><strong><br/></strong>Mangroves are an important habitat for larval and juvenile <em>G. decadactylus. </em>In Nigeria,<em>&#160;</em>large tracts of mangrove are being lost through oil pollution, felling by local communities for fuelwood and building materials and clearing by the oil companies to make way for well location, oil pipelines and flow stations. Additionally, the exotic palm <em>Nypa fruticans</em> is rapidly replacing native mangroves (Moses 2000).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><u><br/></u>Additionally, the targeting of juvenile fishes and by-catch of finfish from shrimp trawls are serious management problems in the artisanal fisheries of Sierra Leone, and this is likely the case in other parts of West Africa (Baio 2010). <br/><br/>This species used to be abundant, but is now considered uncommon in many parts of its range.&#160;In Ghana, it is reported in mixed-species Threadfin catch and in 2009 combined threatfin species catch in artisanal species 1,857 tonnes. It is taken in a wide variety of fisheries, with the beach seine representing the largest catch of mixed-species threadfin.","This species is considered to be very common and is likely the most common species of this family. &#160;FAO landings of <em>G. decadactylus </em>are reported from the following West African nations, in order of increasing reported landings in 2011: Mauritania (81 tonnes), Togo, Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Gambia, Gabon, Cote D'Ivoire,&#160;Liberia, the Republic of Congo, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria (4,524 tonnes). Total landings of <em>G. decadactylus</em> have increased continually, with minor fluctuations, from 1950 to the present. In 2011, the total catch for this species was&#160;18,557 tonnes. In the last 10 years, landings have increased by 8%.<br/><br/>The abundance of&#160;<em>G. decadactylus&#160;</em>varies seasonally by depth. The species is more abundant in the dry season in coastal zones at depths ranging from 5-15 meters, and at depths of 15-40 m during the wet season (Gascuel and Laurans 2001).<br/><br/><u>Model stock assessments</u><br/>In Guinea, annual catches of <em>G. decadactylus </em>increased from 992 tonnes to 1,824 tonnes over the time span of 1995 to 1999, with the large majority of catches&#160;coming&#160;from the industrial rather than the artisanal fishery. Depending on the model used and the location, global evaluations of the stock based on catch/effort/abundance information was considered fully exploited or overexploited by the end of the time series (calculated value of mf<sub> </sub>MSY&#160;=0.9 or 1.4 in Guinea; 0.4 in Senegal, 0.6 or 1.4 in Cape Verde). Annual indices of abundance have&#160;deceased&#160;from 1985 to 1994 in Guinea. Fishing effort, which was calculated as the ratio of captures over indices of abundance, have increased from 1985 (0.35) to 1999 (7.04). A rapid depletion (70% decline) of biomass of five indicator species (including<em> G. decadactylus</em>,<em> Pseudotolithus elongatus</em>, <em>Pseudotolighus typus</em>, <em>Pseudotolightus senegalensis</em>&#160;and <em>Arius </em>spp.) was seen&#160;corresponding&#160;to increasing effort (doubling every three years in&#160;Guinea; Gascuel and Laurans 2001).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Galeoides decadactylus</em> was found to be low in relative abundance in beach seine landings taken in various coastal locations off central Ghana (Aggrey-Fynn and Sackey-Mensah 2012). Artisanal fishery production of <em>G. decadactylus</em> has increased from 2002-2006, with a 2,500.2% increase in production from 39.5 tonnes to 425.4 tonnes from 2002-2004, and a 87.8% increase in production from 1,025.8-1,926.0 from 2004-2006 (Baio 2010).<br/><br/><u>Trends in demersal fisheries off the continental shelf of Mauritania<br/></u>The fisheries of the northwestern African continental shelf have developed over the past several decades from low levels of fishing to intense exploitation, leading to severe decreases in biomass and serious signs of over-exploitation. In general, the abundance of demersal resources of northwest Africa has declined by a factor of four over the past 20 to 30 years. Although this species is not a component of fisheries in Mauritania, many trends in Mauritania are reflective of those in Senegal and Guinea. Over the Mauritanian continental shelf, reductions in biomass of up to 75% have been recorded. Using data from scientific surveys conducted in Mauritanian waters, trends in species biomass were&#160;modelled&#160;for 24 taxa, 15 of which showed significant decreasing trends, and only one of which showed increases in abundance. In Senegal and Guinea, abundance indices for this species have remained low, with shallow declines from 1985-1999 (Gascuel<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007).<br/><br/>In Nigeria, CPUE for this species from 1990 to 2010 is fluctuating but relatively stable (Williams pers. comm. 2013). Length at age one is 18 cm, age two is 23 cm, age three is 27, and length&#160;infinity&#160;is 54 cm in Nigeria (Abohweyere 1989).<br/>In the ISTAM database from 1965 to 1998, mean sizes have decreased from 0.4 kg to around 0.1-0.2 kg in 1998.<br/><br/>From 1985-1995, based on indices of abundance, this species declined and then started to increase until 2002 (Sidibe pers comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Mauritania, from 2000 -2001, landings from scientific surveys are fluctuating from 29 metric tonnes in 2000 to a high of 93 metric tonnes in 2008, and a decline to 10 metric tonnes in 2011 (Camara pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Senegal, there has been no observed decrease in juveniles in studies since 2003 (Morais pers. comm. 2013).<br/><br/>In Ghana, this species is very scarce in markets, and it used to be more abundant. &#160;However, it is still considered common in Senegal and Nigeria. &#160;It is not that abundant in markets in&#160;Mauritania.",Unknown,"<em>Galeoides decadactylus</em> is distributed from Morocco to Angola on the west coast of Africa, and also rarely occurs in Algeria, northern Africa and Namibia, southern Africa. It is found at depths ranging from 10-70 m &#160;(Motomura in press). It is also found in Cape Verde (Silva 2009). It generally only occurs between the Canary Islands and Angola.","<em>Galeoides decadactylus</em>&#160;is an important component of the commercial trawl fishery in eastern Atlantic, constituting between 10 and 20% of the total landings by weight. The annual catch from the area averaged 15,600 tonnes from 2000-2006, mainly caught by Nigeria, Ghana, and Gabon (Motomura in press). It is a major coastal resource in Senegal.

They are the only sirenians restricted to freshwater systems.&#160;<em>T. inunguis</em>&#160;occurs in waters with temperatures above 23<sup>o</sup>C (Gallivan <em>et al.</em> 1983), living in the three types of water in Amazonian rivers (white, black and clear), being more abundant in white waters, where there is greater primary production (Best 1984, Rosas 1994).</p><p>Individuals engage in long seasonal movements, moving from flooded areas during the wet season to deep water bodies during the dry season (Arraut <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kendall <em>et al.</em> 2014). While the whitewater rivers (murky water) provide them with plentiful food, deep lakes function as refuges during the low-water season, where animals are less vulnerable to hunting.</p><p>Only one calf is produced at a time. Although no specific studies are available for the species in the wild, it is believed that the reproductive cycle is similar to the West Indian Manatee’s, with a long gestation and lactation period (up to 24 months), and a birthing interval of 2 to 3 years (Best 1983); age at sexual maturity is suggested to be between 6 and 10 years (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>  <p>Generation length is 25 years, based on what is known for <em>T. manatus.</em></p>","<p>The commercial large scale capture of Amazonian Manatee was the main reason for the reduction of the populations of the species. The main current threats for Manatees are hunting for meat consumption (Denkinger 2010, Brice <em>et al.</em> 2011, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013, Sandoval 2015), entanglement in fishing nets and habitat alterations.</p>  <p><em>Illegal hunting</em>, for both subsistence and local use, is considered the main threat to Manatees in the Amazon. Manatee populations have supported a tremendous take in past centuries and, although not at commercial levels, hunting still takes place throughout the region (Barbosa <em>et al. </em>2010a, b; Franzini <em>et al. </em>2013; Silva <em>et al. </em>2014; M. Marmontel pers. obs). Most hunting is practiced with the use of traditional harpoons, but in Ecuador Manatees may be caught in traps set for <em>Arapaima</em> (Hidalgo 2010).</p>  <p>Hunters usually sell products to neighbors and nearby communities, but the meat is sometimes sold in local produce fairs or markets in the interior, or by order directly with the hunter. Public markets in Brazil (Manaus, Manacapuru, Beruri, Novo Airão, Tefé, Silves, Itapiranga, Itacoatiara, Santarém, Belém, Monte Alegre and Almeirim, Benjamin Constant, Atalaia do Norte) and Ecuador also illegally offer the meat for sale. Meat is sold in natura, or as ""mixira"" or subproducts such as sausage. The mixira, which is the meat preserved in its own fat, is one of the products that prolongs the pressure on the species, since it commands a high price.</p>  <p>Take estimates are available only for a few sites where conservation and research projects are taking place. Between 2002 and 2004, 64 Manatees were estimated to have been killed in the Amanã-Castanho area (3,000 km<sup>2</sup>) of Amanã SDR (Calvimontes 2009), most of them adult males. Between 2011 and 2015, the hunt count for the same area was 42 Manatees. Some 195 Manatees were estimated to have been killed between 2011 and 2015 in the Uatumã River valley (Brazil) through the expeditions of Project Protecting Life in Uatumã (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016). In the Urucu region of Brazil 20 Manatees were captured between 2004 and 2007, 14 harpooned and 6 entangled (Franzini <em>et al.</em> 2013). Pantoja (2015) estimated 92 Manatees hunted in the area of the lower Javari river, Brazil, between 1980 and 2014. Based on interviews conducted in the Piagaçu Purus SDR (Purus river, Brazil), approximately 460 Manatees were killed in the protected area between 2004 and 2014 (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Based on 48 interviews, 36 manatees were captured in the Region of the Middle Madeira and Aripuanã Rivers (Amazon, Brazil) between 1986-2004: 89% poached and 11% entangled (Castelblanco-Martínez<em> et al</em>. 2007).</p><p> </p>  <p>The Natütama Foundation, which has a year-round Manatee monitoring program in place since 2002, registered three Manatees hunted in Colombia from 2003 to 2013 (Kendall 2013) and more than six in Peru from 2010-2015. Manatees are still being hunted in the river Putumayo upstream from Tarapaca and above the mouth of the Igaraparana, according to interviews with local Colombian fishermen, who say most of the hunters are Peruvian (S. Kendall pers. obs.). </p>  <p>In the Pacaya Samiria Reserve (Peru), Soto (2007) estimated an average of 35 Manatees killed in the basins of the Punahua, Ucayali and Marañon rivers.</p>  <p><strong>Incidental mortality, orphaned calves, and illegal captivity</strong></p>  <p>In addition to specific gillnets to hunt Manatees, the high use of fishing nets in the Amazon has increased incidental calf mortality in the past few years. These events have been documented in all Amazonian Manatee range countries (Reeves<em> et al. </em>1996, Orozco 2001, Franzini 2008, Souza 2015), and this is now a major threat for the species (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>When calves survive drowning in nets, they may be kept alive for later sale<span lang=""EN-US""> as pets, kept in pools or areas close to water bodies, and sold or given to influential persons. The number of rescued calves every year has been increasing, but the number recorded represents a small sample of occurrences in the Amazon.</p>  <p>Between 2008 and 2010, in the Brazilian state of Pará, 28 stranded Manatees were rescued, of which only one was an adult (Sousa <em>et al. </em>2010). An important threat in Pará is the use of fishing corrals, as they are usually built over submerged aquatic vegetation beds, where Manatees feed, and have already trapped a Manatee (M. Sousa, pers. com. 2016).</p>  <p>Presently, several institutions in Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia, Centro de Pesquisa e Preservação de Mamíferos Aquáticos, Mamirauá Institute and Zoofit) care for over 150 Manatees in captivity, mostly orphans. Between 2005 and 2015, INPA received an average of 10 calves per year. Of the 98 animals rescued during this period, 30% were accidentally caught in fishing nets (D. Souza pers. obs). In the past 10 years CPPMA received 39 calves for rehabilitation (S.M. Lazzarini pers. comm. 2016).</p>  <p>From 2010-2015, 3 calves died in nets or captivity in Peru (S. Kendall pers obs). It is estimated that two Amazonian Manatees are presently in captivity in Colombia (Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p>Between 2007 and 2010, Centro de Rescate Amazónico (Iquitos, Peru) rescued 28 Manatees (Perea <em>et al. </em>2011), and until 2013 successfully rehabilitated 25 individuals (Landeo-Yauri <em>et al. </em>2013). Since 2011 &#160;the Centro released and monitored 11 of those rehabilitated animals (Landeo and&#160;Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;2015, Velásquez Varela <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>  <p><strong>Habitat alteration and disturbance</strong></p>  <p>Other anthropogenic actions have resulted in pollution, loss, alteration, degradation and fragmentation of habitats used by the Amazonian Manatee (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). </p>  <p>Changes in the aquatic environment as habitat degradation due to deforestation, pollution, contamination of the rivers by mercury for the gold exploration (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 2000), pesticides and heavy metals from agricultural waste and oil spills are potential hazards to the Manatee´s food supply (Rosas <em>et al. </em>1991). These elements are absorbed by aquatic weeds and may directly affect the staple diet of the species (Rosas 1994). Roots of floating and rooted aquatic plants (<em>Paspalum, Eicchornia, Salvinia</em>) have been shown to be important methylation sites (Guimarães <em>et al. </em>2000).&#160;Over 300 dams are planned for the Amazon (Winemiller <em>et al. </em>2016), two of which are mega-enterprises in Brazil (Madeira and Xingu rivers). The building of dams can interfere with habitat quality, altering water speed, nutrient load and dynamics of macrophyte production (Junk and Nunes de Mello 1987). Brazil has extensive plans for navigation (Fearnside 2001, Brazil, PR, 2011) with dams allowing the opening of the waterway in the Tapajos river (Fearnside 2015) planned for soy transport, giving access to the Amazon river and the Atlantic ocean (Brazil, PR 2011, Millikan 2011).&#160;Amazonian Manatees are very sensitive to noise, and intense boat traffic on the Amazonian rivers can affect their behaviour and habitat use.</p>  <p>Oil spills may be a particular problem in Ecuador (Brice <em>et al. </em>2011, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013, Brice 2014), where oil exploitation has been permitted in important refuges for the species (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013). The use of fertilizers and weed control products in extensive monocultures (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2013), incidental captures in fishing nets, the use of dynamite, the increasing use of motorized boats including in the Cuyabeno and Jatuncocha systems where there are nature tourism activities (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, b) are additional threats in Ecuador.</p>  <p>On the Peru-Colombia border, wood extraction activities are clogging lakes and stopping normal migrations of Manatees in the Atacuari area (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p>Amazonian human populations are generally at low densities except in the large capital cities, but all of the issues above could be magnified by the increase in human population.</p><p>Tourism and transport are interfering more and more with low water resting places in the area around Puerto Nariño (Kendall <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p><p>Around the city of Belém and estuary of the Amazon River, boat traffic is intense and even ferries and cargo ships may interfere with Manatee movement (Miranda Leão <em>et al. </em>2014).</p>  <p><strong>Natural disasters, drought, climate change</strong></p><p>Extreme droughts may help make the Manatee an easier prey item for hunters, by causing isolation and entrapment. During the 2010 drought in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Purus River, Brazil), 180 Manatees were estimated killed (Souza <em>et al. </em>2014), but only a few cases of Manatees trapped by drought in the eastern Peruvian frontier area were recorded, and none in Colombia (S. Kendall pers obs).</p>  <p></p>","<p>Most of the waters inhabited by Amazonian Manatees are very murky and, probably as an adaptation to the past and ongoing hunting pressure, Amazonian Manatees are extremely secretive.&#160;T<span class=""alt-edited"">remendous<span class=""shorttext""> research efforts have been made,<span lang=""EN""> but&#160;there are no reliable population estimates available, although numbers are almost certainly lower than historical figures due to centuries of hunting. Analysis of feeding patches, direct sightings of <em>T. inunguis</em> and interview surveys have been used to try to estimate population numbers with limited results, due to opportunistic sightings and small samples without standardized effort. Traditional mark-recapture studies are not appropriate due to the species’ secretive nature. More recently there have been efforts to estimate populations with the use of rotary or side-scan sonars, but still with inconclusive results (Brice 2014, Francisco <em>et al.</em> 2015), which hinders the development of conservation strategies for the species. Magor empirically estimated a minimum population of 10,000 Amazonian Manatees for the Amazon basin (Husar 1977). Based on the analysis of mtDNA control region, Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>(2005) suggested a genetic estimate of the effective female population size of <em>T. inunguis</em> of approximately 455,000 individuals, indicative of a recent large population size. Genetic studies do not show a population structure throughout the region (Cantanhede <em>et al. </em>2005).</span></p><p>In Colombia, due to conservation efforts with local communities, a reduction in hunting levels and an apparent increase in&#160;Amazonian&#160;Manatee population in specific sites has been noted in the last few years. In the Colombian Amazon, the population may have stabilized, but hunting continues on the Peruvian side of the river and this affects the Colombian population. During 2010-2015, Natütama registered 3 to 4 new calves every year in Colombia. Fishermen insist that there are more Manatees now, mainly because they see groups of 7 to 10 Manatees more often (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2014). Systematic monitoring with former Manatee hunters recorded 364 sightings around Puerto Nariño in 2014, including five different calves (<span lang=""EN-US"">Castelblanco-Martínez&#160;</span><em>et a</em><em>l. </em>2015).</p><p>A study conducted 1996-1999 in Cuyabeno Reserve (Ecuador) contradicted Timm <em>et al.</em>'s<em>&#160;</em>(1986) prediction of extinction in 10 years. However, relative abundance in Cuyabeno River was 0.01 animal / h effort and 0.007 animal / h effort in Lagartococha River. A total 40-49 animals were sighted in the Cuyabeno Reserve between 1996 and 1998, where they are considered rare (Denkinger 2010). The use of sonar produced estimates ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 individuals / 10 km in three sites (Parque Nacional Yasuni, Lagartococha and Cocaya lake systems); no animals were detected in 58 km of the Cuyabeno lagoon system (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013). Brice (2014), using side-scan sonar observed 24 individuals in 70 hours of sampling in the same region. In Ecuador the species is considered Critically Endangered (CR) according to IUCN criteria C2a(i), which indicates an estimated population of less than 250 mature individuals, and no subpopulation with 50 mature individuals (IUCN 2001).</p><p>Guzmán (2014), also using a side scan sonar, recorded 14 Manatees in 65 km of rivers and lagoons, or 2.15 ind / 10 km in the Lagartococha river, on border Peru-Ecuador, an area partially surveyed by Utreras <em>et al. </em>(2013). Bodmer <em>et al. </em>(2006) believed the population in the Pacaya Samiria Reserve was stable due to a slight increase in counts between 2003 and 2006. However, Soto (2007) points out that the estimation method has not yet been proven.</p><p>In some sustainable development reserves (SDR) in Brazilian Amazon, hunting has been decreasing over the recent years. This is probably a reflection of the conservation actions that have occurred in the region, and the lack of interest among young fishermen for hunting the Manatee. The frequent records of sightings of adults and females with calves during the rainy and dry seasons in the Piagaçu-Purus SDR (Souza 2015) suggest that populations of <em>T. inunguis</em> may be stable or increasing in these regions.</p><p>Sixty two per cent&#160;of hunters interviewed by Calvimontes (2009) in Amanã SDR (Brazil) believed the population is decreasing, although they attribute this to Manatees having moved away (due to habitat alterations and increasing levels of noise) rather than hunting. Calvimontes also reported that most hunters are turning into farmers, which should decrease the pressure on the species.&#160;Seventy three&#160;per cent of interviewees in the Belém region (mouth of the Amazon) considered the Manatee population is decreasing, due to hunting, pollution, boat traffic and noise (Miranda 2014). Half of the respondents in Franzini <em>et al.</em>'s&#160;(2013) study believed Manatee numbers are declining.</p><p>Seventy&#160;per cent&#160;of interviewees in the Ucayali region of Peru believed the population is decreasing (Silva <em>et al. </em>2014). In a preliminary survey of Manatees in the Lagartococha region, in 6.9 km of canoe transects Hidalgo (2010) observed 16 Manatees and 25 feeding patches, which lead him to evaluate that Manatees in the Lagartococha river basin may be stable due to the almost null human presence.</p><p>The progressive increase in the number of young calves arriving at rehabilitation centres in Brazil in the past five years has also led several researchers to suspect that the species may be undergoing some recovery, or that the increase is simply a reflection of the awareness campaigns implemented, with a concomitant increase in the number of rescued calves (Rosas and da Silva pers. comm. 2005). Alternatively, it may also suggest that calf takes are on the rise.</p><p>Although Manatees are widespread through a large area, there is a high level of uncertainty about population size, as no reliable method for determining abundance has been defined so far. Whatever the current population size, the overall population trend is most likely to be decreasing, given the species’ slow reproduction (sirenian populations grow at an annual rate of approximately 5-6%; Marsh<em> et al. </em>2004, 2011) and levels of exploitation (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 1992). In summary, although the population may be stabilizing in some parts of the Amazon region due to local awareness building and other conservation efforts, the overall trend is of a decreasing population.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Amazonian Manatees occur in northern South America, and are endemic to the Amazon Basin. Amazonian Manatees occur through most of the Amazon River drainage, in river and lake systems, from the headwaters, in Colombia (Domning 1981), Ecuador (Timm <em>et al. </em>1986) and Peru (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1996) to the mouth of the Amazon (close to the Marajó Island) in Brazil (Best and Teixeira 1982, Miranda 2014) over an estimated seven million square kilometres. However, they are patchily distributed, concentrating in areas of nutrient-rich flooded forest, which covers around 300,000 km² (Junk 1997), but are limited by troubled waters (rapids and falls) and aquatic vegetation (Best 1983).</p>  <p>In Ecuador most records are from the extreme northeast, below 250 m altitude. From north to south there are records for the Güeppi river (tributary of Putumayo, in the border with Colombia), the Aguarico river and its Cuyabeno and Lagartococha systems, where most of the records come from (Denkinger 2010, Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a, Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013) and in tributaries such as the Yanayacu, Cocaya and Zancudococha lagoon; in the Napo region they are found in the Añangu, Challuacocha and Yuturi lagoon systems, as well as in the Tiputini river and Yasuní basin, including the Jatuncocha and Tambococha lagoon systems (Utreras <em>et al. </em>2011a). In Peru they occur in the Loreto region in the Samiria, Pacaya, Marañón, Pastaza, Ucayali, Huallaga, Purus, Tapiche, Yarapa and Yanayacu rivers, as well as in the lower Puinahua and Iricahua rivers in the Ucayali basin; their occurrence has been mentioned for the Nanay, Orosa, Yavarí, Yaguas and Putumayo rivers, and in the Reserva&#160; Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo, and in the Yanayacu-Pucate river (Silva 2010); in Colombia in the Putumayo, Amazon and lower Caquetá rivers; in Brazil they occur in most major river basins such as Solimões, Japurá, Juruá, Purus, Negro and Tapajós.</p>  <p>Although there are no records in the Guyana, the species may occasionally penetrate into southern Guiana close to the boundary with Brazil (Bertram and Bertram 1963). This possibility is enhanced by a Manatee rescue done by INPA in Takutu River border Brazil and Guyana (D. Souza pers. obs).</p>","<p>The historical main use of <em>T. inunguis</em> was to obtain oil, skin and meat (Domning 1982). In remote areas of the Brazilian Amazon, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 Manatees were killed between 1935 and 1954, not counting subsistence hunting (Best 1983, Rosas and Pimentel 2001), which still persists in modern times.</p><p>  </p><p>Currently, the main use of the species is for food. Manatee meat is highly valued, but all the other products are used as well (fat and skin are used in cooking and as medicine, bones are turned into utilitarian pieces and charms, and the skin produces very resistant leather).

45176532,3326,Bunolagus monticularis,Critically Endangered,C2a(i),2019,2016-05-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Riverine Rabbit is endemic to the semi-arid central Karoo region of South Africa (estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) is 54,227 km² and area of occupancy (AOO) is 2,943 km²). Recent population estimates of 157-207 mature individuals indicate an alarmingly small species population size, with no subpopulation having &gt; 50 mature individuals. The current assessment suggests that the Riverine Rabbit should, under a precautionary purview, remain listed as Critically Endangered C2a(i) due to its inferred small population size and inferred continuing decline from habitat loss and degradation, including ongoing loss of mature individuals. There are an estimated 12 subpopulations (nine in the northern range and three recently discovered south of the historic known range) determined by clusters of &gt;6 sightings within 10 km of each other. Large numbers of surveys throughout the distribution range have confirmed current subpopulations but failed to detect subpopulations in some areas of the historic range (indicated by museum records). Only current subpopulations are used to estimate population size. No subpopulation is estimated to exceed 50 mature individuals (range: 8-46 mature individuals). Subpopulation size was determined by summing independent sightings (non-repeat sightings) from survey data collected between 1999 and 2013. This estimate thus represents minimum sizes and it is possible that subpopulation size is higher, given that this is a cryptic species and difficult to detect. Monitoring work should be continued to improve subpopulation estimates and trends, and this species should be reassessed once further data have been generated. However, we suspect maximum subpopulation size could not be significantly higher, given that previous studies found low densities of the species on the Klipgat farm, Victoria West (0.06–0.17 individuals / ha). Subpopulations are presumably further fragmented and isolated by anthropogenic barriers to dispersal, such as impoundments in river channels and fencing, and are threatened by illegal hunting and predation by domestic animals. Total mature population size (assuming 70% adults) is estimated to be between 157 and 207 individuals.&#160;Additionally, both climate change and fracking are emerging threats to Riverine Rabbits: an initial assessment of climate change indicates that a net reduction of 89% in habitat is likely for the northern population. Fracking of the Karoo region is also likely to further reduce suitable habitat and the two threats may synergise. Thus, although population size in this analysis is likely an underestimate as it is based solely on confirmed current sightings, the Critically Endangered listing is retained (over a possible Endangered listing) as emerging threats are likely to severely threaten the already small population. Systematic monitoring and evidence for conservation interventions are desperately needed. Additionally, as the southern subpopulation may be genetically distinct from the northern animals, genetic work and subsequent taxonomic revision may require a possible reassessment of the two putative subspecies.<br/><br/>This species will require reassessment in the near future as recent citizen science records indicate significant increases in known EOO both southwards and eastwards. Conservation agencies are currently establishing camera traps in the areas to confirm the existence of subpopulations in these areas and once these new data are available, the assessment of this species will be updated and possibly revised.","The Riverine Rabbit inhabits dense riparian growth along the seasonal rivers in the central Karoo (Nama-Karoo shrubland). Specifically, it occurs in riverine vegetation on alluvial soils adjacent to seasonal rivers. The habitat is highly fragmented and transformed. Studies show the habitat to be 61% fragmented in certain areas (Duthie 1989). Observations from the more recently discovered southern Cape population include new records spread over thirteen sites (within three subpopulations), of which nine sites are managed as game reserves/nature reserves. The majority of Riverine Rabbit occupancy lies in the Upper Karoo Bioregion (approximately 80%), with about 12% in the Rainshadow Valley Karoo Bioregion, 4% in the Trans-Escarpment Succulent Karoo Bioregion, 3% the in Western Fynbos-Renosterveld Bioregion and 1% in the Lower Karoo Bioregion (Mucina and Rutherford 2006). For the southern population found within the Little Karoo, the presence occurs within the habitat types as described by Vlok and Schutte-Vlok (2010) including Transitional Shrublands Vegetation Type, Arid Renosterveld Habitat Type, Succulent Karoo Vegetation Type, Apronveld Habitat Type and the Randteveld Habitat Type. However, they are not restricted to the alluvial floodplains in the southern Cape (C. Bragg pers. obs. 2014) and can also occur in old lands not associated with riverine vegetation. Further habitat studies are required.<br/><br/>It should be noted that these are broad habitat types whereas subpopulations in the northern part of the distribution are always associated with alluvial floodplains and narrow belts of riverine vegetation adjacent to seasonal rivers on a scale that is unlikely to fit within these broader habitat types. They are thus highly reliant on the critical resource areas of Karoo riparian ecosystems. These descriptions do, however, give an indication of the general vegetation structure and composition within various parts of its range. Home range has been estimated as 12 ha (Duthie 1989). This species is elusive and nocturnal, spending daylight hours in a scrape beneath riparian vegetation. They are solitary, and will only be found in breeding pairs for short periods, or in female-juvenile pairs for rearing purposes (Duthie 1989).<br/><br/>This species is predominantly a browser, but is known to occasionally feed on grasses during the early wet rainy season when short, green grasses become available (Duthie 1989). When browsing, they have been found to show a particular selection for <em>Pteronia erythrochaetha, Kochia pubescens, Salsola glabrescens</em> and species of Aizoacae. They are unable to survive on heavily overgrazed or agriculturally transformed habitats, but have been found feeding on lucerne fields at night.<br/><br/>Ecosystem and cultural services: It is both a flagship species for the Karoo, as well as an indicator species of riparian habitat fringing the rivers of the Nama (Upper and Central Karoo) and the Succulent Karoo where its presence is associated with ecosystem integrity (healthy ecosystem services, such as water infiltration, vegetation cover, and soil health). Its unique habitat is of economic importance to landowners in terms of cultivation and small-stock grazing. Threats to the river ecosystems include overgrazing and anthropogenic land and river &#160;transformation, which leads to the degradation and fragmentation of Riverine Rabbit habitat.","Both populations face significant threats from ongoing habitat degradation and fragmentation due to detrimental land-use practices and new emerging habitat-transforming land uses, such as climate change and energy development (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Over the last century, <em>c</em>a 40-60% of the fertile alluvial floodplains and riparian habitat has been lost as a result of cultivation (for example, winter wheat production, mostly in the past) and livestock farming (ongoing) (Duthie 1989; Duthie <em>et al</em>. 1989, Duthie and Robinson 1990, Coetzee 1994, Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Other threats to the species include hunting (hunted for sport and for bushmeat by farm workers), and accidental mortality in traps set for ‘pest’ animals on farmlands. There is also the potential that the dominance of sheep farming and emerging wildlife ranching for economically valuable species may increase the frequency of both overgrazing (and thus reduction in vital vegetation cover) and predation rates (for example, by higher Black-backed Jackal <em>Canis mesomelas</em> densities). Similarly, habitat degradation through fuel-wood collecting and overgrazing may have led to an increase in predation (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>There are also several emerging threats that could threaten this species. An initial assessment of climate change indicates that a net reduction of 89% in habitat is likely for the northern population (Hughes <em>et al</em>. 2008). Hence further study is urgently required as to potential effects of projected climate change over the entire distribution.<br/><br/>Fracking of the Karoo region is also a major emerging threat to Riverine Rabbit habitat due to ancillary activities associated with fracking, which could lead to increased roadkill mortalities, habitat fragmentation and altered hydrology of Karoo river systems, which in turn impacts on the species’ habitat. Similarly, wind farms are also likely to have a significant impact on the species.<br/><br/>Habitat quantity and quality is declining through overgrazing by livestock, resulting in reduced cover from predators and lack of sufficient forage. Reduction in streamflow owing to the construction of dams upstream has presumably also reduced habitat quality (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). High livestock, and in some cases, wildlife, stocking rates have resulted in large areas of the Karoo having reduced vegetation cover and becoming dominated by unpalatable species, which have further reduced vegetation biodiversity and stocking &#160;potential for livestock and game. Additionally, continued rural settlement expansion on the Northern Cape Province, estimated to be 9% from 2000 to 2013 (GeoTerraImage 2015), will presumably increase rates of poaching and predation by dogs. However, stewardship schemes for this species in the Karoo have also been initiated and cover 350,000 ha in the Greater Karoo. Anecdotal evidence suggests improved biodiversity and Riverine Rabbit populations on these farms, as well as greater landowner awareness of the requirements to protect Riverine Rabbits (C. Bragg unpubl. data). Continued biodiversity stewardship expansion will help to mitigate habitat loss and deterioration.","Riverine Rabbits have a critically low population size. For example, Duthie<em> et al</em>. (1989) found low densities of the species on the Klipgat farm, Victoria West (0.06-0.17 individuals / ha). However, this sample represented too few home ranges to extrapolate to population level. Duthie <em>et al</em>. (1989) speculated that remaining habitat might potentially support around 1,435 individuals. However, densities may vary widely among river systems. For example, there is remaining natural habitat on the Ongers River but there is no evidence of Riverine Rabbit occupancy (Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Thus the population size may be very much lower (Duthie<em> et al</em>. 1989).<br/><br/>There are an estimated 12 subpopulations, three in the southern population and nine in the northern population. Subpopulations are isolated from each other by jackal-proof fencing and severe land transformation through agricultural practices. All these subpopulations are estimated to contain less than 50 mature individuals (8–46 mature individuals, based on independent sightings in each river system). There are also an additional five possible historic subpopulations that are represented by five separate museum specimens collected in the past, but no surveys in the past 30 years have confirmed any sightings in those localities, so those five subpopulations are assumed to be locally extinct. To estimate total population size, we used survey data representing confirmed sightings along rivers to indicate size of individual subpopulations along river systems. For population size estimates, the total number of sightings across all 12 subpopulations was 380 individuals, yielding a total population estimate of 207 mature individuals (assuming 70% adults). The alternative estimate, derived from the average density of sightings per 1 km river buffer for all subpopulations multiplied by the total area (AOO), was 224 individuals in total, or 157 mature individuals (Collins and Toit 2016).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is two years (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2004). This species has a single litter per year with 1-2 young per litter in a fur- and grass-lined subterranean chamber excavated in stable soils (Duthie 1989). Reproductive periodicity occurs from August through May (Duthie and Robinson 1990). Gestation time is 35-36 days (Duthie 1989). Longevity in captivity is five years (K. Collins unpubl. data).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the central Karoo region of South Africa. It is associated with the dense, discontinuous vegetation fringing the seasonal rivers. It is the only indigenous burrowing rabbit in Africa, and is dependent on soft and deep alluvial soils along the river courses for constructing stable breeding stops. Approximately 40-60% of habitat was lost or fragmented during the 1930s to 1970s due to agricultural expansion on the seasonal river flood plains across its distribution range (Robinson 1981b, Duthie <em>et al</em>. 1989, Duthie and Robinson 1990). Historically, this species was known to occur in five localities towards the northwestern portion of its range, along the Vis and Renoster Rivers, as well as their tributaries near Calvinia (Duthie 1989). The lack of sightings data during the last 30 years, suggests that <em>Bunolagus monticularis</em> is now locally extinct in these regions (Collins and Toit 2016). This is likely to be a direct consequence of the extensive agricultural expansion along riverine floodplains (Duthie <em>et al</em>. 1989).<br/><br/>A large number of surveys from 1999-2013 throughout the distribution range has improved our estimates of location and sizes of the various subpopulations, and identified a new southern population in 2004, which now consists of three known subpopulations. The southern population is distributed within three catchments: the Breede, Gouritz and Olifant River systems.<br/><br/>Subpopulations are defined as being made up groups of confirmed sightings along first-, second- or third-order rivers that are within a maximum of 10 km of each other. If the groups of sightings are more than 10 km from each other they are not taken as being from the same subpopulation. Due to limited information about dispersal ability of this species and the fact that known densities where home range studies were carried out showed approximately one Riverine Rabbit for every 400 m of river length, 10 km between confirmed sightings was estimated as a reasonable distance to separate subpopulations. A minimum of six sightings was taken to represent a subpopulation (potentially representing up to three breeding pairs). Where less than six sightings occurred in isolation from survey data, these were assumed to be part of the nearest subpopulation based on connectivity along the rivers.<br/><br/>The approximate ranges of both the northern and southern populations was calculated using Kernel Density home range estimation (buffered by 5 km) and combined to give a total extent of occurrence (EOO), estimated as 54,227 km². To calculate area of occupancy (AOO), all rivers inside the EOO were buffered by 1 km on either side. Similarly, all&#160;sightings points were buffered by a 1 km radius and were used to clip the river buffer providing a total estimate of AOO. A buffer of 1 km was chosen as most of the larger patches of riverine vegetation do not occur more than 1 km from rivers, and by buffering all rivers by 1 km, all known sightings were located within these buffered areas. AOO was thus calculated as 2,943 km².&#160;<em></em>","The Riverine Rabbit is suspected to be opportunistically hunted for sport and for bushmeat by farm workers (Duthie and Robinson 1990, Coetzee 1994).",Terrestrial,"<em>&#160;</em>This species occurs mainly outside of formally protected areas. However, it was recently discovered (2013) on the formally protected Anysberg Nature Reserve (C. Birss unpubl. data), and there is a healthy subpopulation based in the private Sanbona Wildlife Reserve (both sites in the Western Cape Province), which is in the process of achieving formal protected status through the CapeNature biodiversity stewardship programme. There is also a substantial proportion of the species’ habitat from the northern population informally protected within the Riverine Rabbit conservancies. The primary conservation interventions involve further protected area expansion, especially through stewardship programmes, and active habitat restoration.<br/><br/>The Drylands Conservation Programme of the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT-DCP) was established in August 2003 and coordinates all conservation efforts on the Riverine Rabbit and its habitat. The programme aims to conserve the biodiversity of the Karoo region, to encourage private landowners to participate in conservation stewardship and to promote integrated land management practices that can sustain the Riverine Rabbit, its habitat and many other species while providing employment for communities and facilitating ecosystem restoration on landowners’ farms. The current projects are:&#160;<br/><ul><li>Riparian habitat restoration: Initiated in 2007, the Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project develops and implements strategies to regenerate degraded riparian habitat in order to re-connect remaining riverine habitat fragments. Riparian zones perform a variety of functions including storing water, reducing floods, stabilizing river banks, improving water quality by trapping sediment and nutrients, and providing shelter and food for animals. They provide corridors for movement and migration of different species, including Riverine Rabbits, and act as a buffer between aquatic ecosystems and adjacent land uses. Additionally, maintaining the integrity of riparian areas will help mitigate the effects of climate change, which could potentially heavily impact this semi-arid region. To date, the programme has undertaken restoration interventions, including soil and water erosion control, re-vegetating, grazing reduction, and soil health technologies, of 350 ha of <em>Bunolagus </em>habitat, and is monitoring the recovery of the species in these areas, as well as the subsequent improvement of ecosystem services.</li></ul><ul><li>Establishing alternative livelihoods: Labour for the rehabilitation project is sourced locally, thereby creating employment and developing skills in poor rural communities with few other social upliftment opportunities. Through this approach a strong component of the Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project lies in the conservation of water resources and regional biodiversity through community involvement. The EWT-DCP established the Indigenous Karoo Plant Nursery in Loxton (Northern Cape) to support the plant needs of the Riparian Habitat Rehabilitation Project. Community members employed by the nursery are trained to propagate indigenous plants needed for the re-vegetation of Riverine Rabbit habitat within riparian zones in the Karoo. Seed is produced on the production plot within the nursery grounds and are supplemented with seeds harvested in the veld by community members. <br/></li></ul><ul><li>Expanding Riverine Rabbit conservancies and stewardship: Little of the Riverine Rabbit’s remaining habitat is protected within nature reserve or national parks; the survival of the Riverine Rabbit is in the hands of private landowners, consisting mostly of farmers. Therefore the EWT‐DCP works in partnership with provincial conservation departments to involve private landowners in biodiversity conservation through the process of ‘stewardship’. Stewardship refers to the wise use, management and protection of that which has been entrusted to the landowner. Within the context of conservation, stewardship means protecting important ecosystems by effectively managing aspects such as invasive alien species, fires, and grazing and cultivation practices. The EWT-DCP works closely with the four Riverine Rabbit conservancies, encompassing an area of approximately 350,000 ha in the Northern and Western Cape provinces. The long‐term goal of the EWT‐DCP is to use these existing conservancies as a stepping stone to upgrade and declare specific and key properties as Protected Areas in terms of South Africa’s National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act (No. 57 of 2003). A critical component of the work is to promote and encourage sustainable land-use practices amongst landowners and land managers in the Karoo through developing partnerships with the relevant stakeholders. Thus the EWT-DCP strives to mainstream sustainable land management principles into agricultural practices in the Karoo and into decisions made by policymakers.</li></ul><ul><li>Environmental Education and Awareness: The EWT-DCP creates awareness about Riverine Rabbit conservation efforts with farmers, farm workers and their families, school learners, teachers, and the general public. It aims to establish custodianship by cultivating a sense of ownership for the Riverine Rabbit, its habitat and the river ecosystems of the Karoo.&#160;</li></ul>Recommendations for land managers and practitioners:<br/><ul><li>Further surveys are needed to identify Riverine Rabbit habitat and occupancy. Hughes <em>et al</em>. (2008) developed a habitat model that showed potential suitable habitat east of Victoria West that might contain isolated subpopulations or offer re-introduction opportunities. The results of such surveys should feed into conservation planning. For example, the work of the Drylands Conservation Programme has succeeded in mitigating impacts of high-risk wind farms through dedicated interventions, particularly in regards to stopping development within suitable habitat. These data would also be used to develop a broad habitat map of the entire distribution range.</li></ul><ul><li>Develop public recognition schemes to encourage private landowners to form conservancies and protect the Riverine Rabbit. Presence on private land should lead to the the exclusion of ranching activities in key habitat areas. This should include developing riparian grazing guidelines to inform sustainable management of riparian areas, and a user-friendly manual of cost-effective sustainable land management technologies to encourage farmers to adopt restoration and sustainable farming practices. Finally, incentives should be identified to encourage landowners to adopt such practices that benefit the species (<em>sensu </em>Pasquini <em>et al</em>. 2010).</li></ul><ul><li>Develop a Riverine Rabbit monitoring tool to facilitate improved conservation outcomes, such as monitoring the impacts of conservation interventions (for example, restoration) on the density of subpopulations and prioritising resources to subpopulations that are declining.</li></ul><ul><li>Development of a legal tool to address Riverine Rabbit conservation: a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (No. 10 of 2004). This includes investigating the genetic and ecological differences between the southern and northern populations and the development of separate conservation strategies for both.</li></ul><ul><li>Although captive breeding was recommended by Collins <em>et al</em>. (2004), captive breeding trials in the 1990s were largely unsuccessful (Dippenaar and Ferguson 1994, Ahlmann <em>et al</em>. 2000). Thus, the current conservation strategy for the species does not include captive breeding as an option due to the difficulty of breeding this sensitive species in captivity and the higher chance of improving populations in the wild through concerted conservation interventions such as stewardship and habitat restoration.&#160;</li></ul>Encouraged citizen actions:&#160;<br/><ul><li>Landowners can create or join conservancies to protect this species and its habitat.</li></ul><ul><li>Landowners can lower stocking levels to improve riparian ecosystem grazing systems; reduce the number of dogs on farms; and restore riparian habitats through Working for Water and/or the EWT-DCP.</li></ul><ul><li>Landowners and the public can report sightings of individuals on virtual museum platforms (for example, iSpot and MammalMAP) or provincial conservation authorities to enhance the distribution map. For example, new sightings recorded by the public and landowners are recorded in the CapeNature database.&#160;</li></ul>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Occasionally, it is also present in secondary and montane forest (Van Rompaey and Colyn 2013). In Nigeria, Angelici and Luiselli (2005) found that the presence of this species was statistically correlated with the presence of primary dry forest and bush–mango plantations inside the forest, and to a lesser extent secondary dry forest, and primary flooded forest but negatively influenced by the presence of suburban areas, pineapple plantations, bushlands, and oil-palm plantations.","Habitat loss is probably a major threat to this species, since the Cross River State forests are rapidly being converted into farms or wastelands and the Niger Delta is exploited as an oil-production area.

45224420,2061,Arctocephalus townsendi,Least Concern,,2015,2014-10-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The range of Guadalupe Fur Seals was considerably reduced by exploitation. Previously, they occupied an area from the San Benito Archipelago to the islands in southern California. Past abundance estimates range from 100,000 to 200,000 animals. In the 1950s they numbered 200-500, but numbers have increased steadily to around 20,000 in 2010. The relatively small population, limited area of occupancy, and reduced genetic variability of this species, make them vulnerable to a variety of threats. However, they do not qualify for threatened listing under any IUCN criteria and are therefore listed as Least Concern.","Guadalupe Fur Seals are sexually dimorphic, with territorial males being 3.8 to 4 times larger than adult females (Gallo-Reynoso and Figueroa-Carranza 1996). Fourteen adult females averaged 148.2 cm standard length (tip of nose to tip of tail) and their weight averaged 49.1 kg. Twelve territorial males averaged 219 cm (Gallo-Reynoso and Figueroa-Carranza 1996), and males averaging 180 cm weighed 160-170 kg (Bonner 1994).<br/><br/>Guadalupe Fur Seals are polygynous, with males establishing territories that are occupied by a small number of females (Peterson et al. 1968). Pups are born from mid-June to August with a median birth date of 21 June (Wickens and York 1997). From 1991 to 1993 the median peak pupping date was 3 July at Guadalupe Islands (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). For up to 31 days, males defend their territory with vocalizations, displays, and mutual displays with neighbouring bulls (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). Guadalupe Fur Seals prefer shores with abundant large rocks and lava blocks, often at the base of large cliffs.They inhabit caves and recesses, which provide protection and cooler temperatures, especially during the warm breeding season. This segregates them from other pinniped species (Peterson <em>et al</em>. 1968, Pierson 1987, García-Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Oestrus occurs 5-10 days after a female gives birth, and females can leave for their first foraging trip right after mating, or stay at the colony for a few days before departing (Peterson <em>et al</em>. 1968, Pierson 1987, Gallo-Reynoso 1994). Foraging and attendance patterns are not well-known but the limited information from four instrumented adult females indicates they travel a total mean distance of 2,375 km. The average distance to the feeding grounds was 444 km and the duration of feeding trips averaged 14.4 days. Diving records for one animal showed a deepest dive of 82 m (Gallo-Reynoso <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Feeding habits are poorly known, particularly for the main colony on Guadalupe Island where the few scats samples analysed to date included remains of the cephalopods <em>Onychoteutis banksi</em>, <em>Eucleoteuthis luminosa</em>, and <em>Dosidicus gigas</em>, as well as several fish, including <em>Scomber japonicus</em>, <em>Auxis thazard</em>, and <em>Sardinops sagax</em> (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). A study conducted during 2000-2001 on the San Benito Islands examined 218 Guadalupe Fur Seal scat samples in which 95.6% of the prey were cephalopod beaks including mostly <em>Loligo opalescens</em> and in lesser abundance <em>Gonatus</em> sp. and <em>Dosidicus gigas</em>. The few fish remains (4.4%) identified were mostly from <em>Merluccius productus</em>, <em>Engraulis mordax</em> and <em>Sardinops sagax</em> (Aurioles-Gamboa and Camacho-Ríos 2007). A similar diet was described in another study conducted during the summer of 2007 (50 scats) and winter of 2008 (56 scats) with the squid <em>Loligo opalescens</em> and <em>Gonatus</em> sp., making up 74% of the summer diet. In winter, these two squid species, along with <em>Dosidicus gigas</em> composed 87% of the prey. The fish <em>Argentina sialis</em>, <em>Merluccius productus</em>, and <em>Sebastes</em> spp. complemented the Guadalupe Fur Seal diet in both seasons (Pablo-Rodríguez 2009). Esperón-Rodríguez and Gallo-Reynoso (2013) and Gallo-Reynoso and Esperón-Rodríguez (2013) also found <em>Loligo opalescens</em> as the main summer prey for juveniles and subadult males at San Benito Islands.&#160; <br/><br/>Contents of faeces and gastrointestinal tracts from several individuals stranded off the coast of northern California near Farallon Island included <em>Loligo opalescens</em>, <em>Gonatopsis</em> sp., <em>Onychoteuthis borealis japonica</em>, as well as several fish species: <em>Citharichthys sordidus</em>, <em>Lampanyctus</em> sp., <em>Protomyctophum</em> sp., and <em>Scopelogadus</em> sp. (Hanni et al. 1997).<br/><br/>Killer Whales and Sharks, particularly Great White Sharks, are regularly seen around Guadalupe Island during the summer, and are most likely predators of Guadalupe Fur Seals. These two predators are rarely seen around the San Benito Islands.","Although the Guadalupe Fur Seal population is steadily growing, the species is still at risk because the total population remains relatively low and nearly all pup production occurs on only one island. Since the species passed through a genetic bottleneck and recovered from a very small number of individuals, genetic diversity was suspected to be low. Bernardi <em>et al</em>. (1998) tested both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in a sample of 36 individuals finding high levels of genetic variability relative to other species that experienced similar bottlenecks. However, when pre-bottleneck material is compared to material from animals in the surviving population, a significant loss of genetic variability is evident (Weber <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>The feeding grounds of the species include the region around Guadalupe Island and the San Benito Islands and the lower part of the California Current. This region is influenced by human population centres with contaminant runoff, extensive oil tanker traffic, and offshore oil extraction activity in southern California. Like all fur seals, Guadalupe Fur Seals are vulnerable to oil spills because of their dependence on their thick pelage for thermoregulation.&#160;<br/><br/>El Niño events may cause negative effects on the Guadalupe Fur Seal population dynamics due to high pup mortality caused by storms and hurricanes (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). Most of the temperate Eastern Pacific pinnipeds are exposed in some degree to deleterious effects of the El Niño (Trillmich and Ono 1991, Gerber and Hilborn 2001). Guadalupe Fur Seals share most of their haul-out and breeding sites with California Sea Lions, which have suffered from viral disease outbreaks in the past, and could be a vector for the transmission of diseases from terrestrial sources to Guadalupe Fur Seals. Additionally, human populations on the Guadalupe and San Benito Islands have the potential to introduce exotic fauna and diseases.<br/><br/>No conflicts with commercial fisheries are apparent at present time, although gillnet and set-net fisheries probably take some animals, as is likely also the case for entanglement in marine debris. There is a possibility for negative interactions between Guadalupe Fur Seals and Lobster fishermen particularly if the Fur Seal population continues to increase.","Guadalupe Fur Seals were abundant prior to seal exploitation, when they were likely the most abundant pinniped species on the islands of southern California (Walker and Craig 1979). Sealers harvesting Fur Seals in California and Mexico did not distinguish between Northern and Guadalupe Fur Seals in their harvest records, which makes it difficult to reconstruct former populations and geographic ranges. However, at least 52,000 Guadalupe Fur Seals were killed on several islands off the Pacific coasts of Mexico and the United States from the late 1700s to 1848, and the last few were harvested in Mexican waters in the late 1800s (Townsend 1931).<br/><br/>The species has recovered from near extinction when only a few dozen animals remained. Recent censuses (2008-2010) indicate that the population on Guadalupe Island numbers approximately 17,581 individuals. Another 2,503 individuals were estimated at San Benito Islands during the same years (García-Capitanachi 2011), bringing the minimum population size to 20,084. The species' overall population is slowly increasing and spreading with minor, temporary, decreases associated with El Niño events. The population clearly continues to be only a small fraction of the population size reached prior to the seal exploitation period, which has been estimated at around 200,000 (Hubbs 1979).&#160;<br/><br/>For most of the 20th century, the species only inhabited Guadalupe Island and showed a population growth of 13.7% annually from 1955 to 1993 (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). In 1949 an emaciated adult male was sighted at San Nicolas Island (Bartholomew 1950), followed by more frequent observations on other islands in southern California since 1969 (Seagars 1984, Stewart 1981, Stewart <em>et al.</em> 1987) including a territorial male and female with a pup at San Miguel Island (Melin and DeLong 1999). In 1997, a small group was discovered at the former rookery on the San Benito Islands, southwest of Guadalupe Island, near the Baja California coast. The numbers on the San Benito Islands for 2010-2011 have increased to around 3,000 individuals, but few pups are born there, indicating that this colony is mostly the result of immigration from the Guadalupe Island (Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>From 1991 to 1993, the breeding population on Guadalupe Island was composed of 35.7% adult females, 22.1% pups, 9.7% juveniles, 26.4% adult males, 4.7% sub-adult males and 1.3% undetermined individuals (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). &#160;During the 2007 and 2008 breeding seasons, the San Benito Islands population structure was 23.4-34.5% adult females, 0.4% pups, 18.6-29.1% juveniles, 6.2-12.6% sub-adult males, 23.4-34.5% adult males and a large proportion of undetermined (33.3-39.2%) individuals (Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Sexual maturity is attained by about 4-5 years of age and maximum longevity is approximately 20 years. Age-structure data are not available for the Guadalupe Fur Seal population, thus parameters like generation time are not reliable.",Increasing,"The distribution of the Guadalupe Fur Seal is centred on Guadalupe Island (Fleischer 1987, Gallo-Reynoso 1994, Belcher and Lee 2002, Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al</em>. 2010). A small breeding colony was discovered on the east side of the easternmost part of the San Benito Islands in 1997 (Maravilla and Lowry 1999); now animals are present and spreading on all three San Benito Islands (Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al</em>. 2010, García-Capitanachi 2011, Esperón-Rodríguez and Gallo-Reynoso 2012). Since the 1980s, Guadalupe Fur Seals have been observed more frequently on San Miguel Island and other southern California islands including, the Farallon Islands off the coast of northern California (Bartholomew 1950, Stewart 1981, Stewart <em>et al</em>. 1987, Stewart <em>et al</em>. 1992, Hanni <em>et al</em>. 1997). Guadalupe Fur Seal vagrants have been sighted and recorded stranded in California, Oregon, and Washington, USA, particularly during El Niño years (Hanni <em>et al</em>. 1997, Etnier 2002). Since 2009, around 50 Guadalupe Fur Seals have been found on the beaches along the west coast of Magdalena Island, located around 25ºN, approximately 500 km south of the San Benito Islands (Aurioles, unpublished data). The species' distribution at sea is poorly known, but records from a few satellite-tracked adult females suggest they may travel several hundred kilometres during feeding trips (Gallo-Reynoso 1994). Guadalupe Fur Seals have been sighted regularly in the Gulf of California, Mexico (Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al</em>. 1999) at the southern extent of their distribution.<br/><br/>Guadalupe Fur Seals were the most frequently encountered pinniped in archaeological deposits on the San Miguel Island prior to the seal exploitation period (Walker and Craig 1979). Indeed, its abundance in deposits dating from 3,500 years to the present, between 32°N and 50°N latitude, suggests that the highest density of sites and individuals occurred on the Channel Islands and southern parts of the mainland (34-36°N), with densities declining north of Point Conception (Rick <em>et al</em>. 2009).","Guadalupe Fur Seals were hunted to near to extinction by the late 19th century. There were no reports of the species until 1926, after which all animals that could be found were harvested for fur with the last reported kill in 1928. Although the species was declared extinct for a second time, scattered, unconfirmed reports during the 1930s raised suspicions that Guadalupe Fur Seals might have survived. In 1954 expedition to Guadalupe Island confirmed the species' survival (Hubbs 1956) and the Mexican government fully protected the species.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Guadalupe Fur Seal and its habitat are protected by the Mexican government and tourist visits to breeding islands are regulated and very limited. In the United States, the species is protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Fish and Game Code of the State of California.

45225150,6204,Cystophora cristata,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2015-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although there is no reliable, current estimate for Hooded Seal abundance, the population is thought to be relatively large, numbering some few hundreds of thousands. The West Ice stock has been surveyed four times in the last 15 years, most recently in 2012, and it has been declining at a rate of 3.7%/year. The stock in Canadian waters increased during the 1980s and 1990s but the rate of increase was declining over time and with no surveys since 2005 there is no way to know the recent or current trend. However, with changing sea ice conditions reducing the pack ice habitat needed by all Hooded Seals for pupping and molting, there is good reason to believe that numbers in all stocks might be declining. Assuming that the entire population will decline at 3.7%/year (which is the West Ice rate of decline currently), the three generation reduction would be 75% which qualifies Hooded Seals for listing as Endangered under criterion A3c. Even if the overall rate of decline were only 1%/year the three generation decline would be 32%, which would qualify Hooded Seals as being Vulnerable. Given that the population is still relatively large, and there are uncertainties about the rate of future decline we opt for the more modest listing of Vulnerable under criterion A3c for Hooded Seals at this time.","Hooded Seals are a sexually dimorphic ice-breeding pinniped. Adult males average 2.5 m in length and weigh 300 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986), with large animals reaching over 400 kg (Kovacs 2002). Adult females are smaller, averaging 2.2 m and 160 kg, but can reach 300 kg. Pups are born at approximately 1 m in length and 24 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals pup on pack ice late in the spring season, when the pack is already breaking up. The breeding season for this polygynous species is very short, usually lasting only about 2.5 weeks. Males attend a single female and her pup at a time, sequentially re-establishing with a new female if the male is competitively successful (Kovacs 1990). Mating takes place in the water (Boness <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1988). Hooded Seals have the shortest lactation period of any mammal, with most pups nursing for only four days (Bowen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985). Pups weigh an average of 48 kg at weaning, and on average double their birth mass in the short nursing period (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Lydersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1997). The short reproductive period is energetically advantageous to both males and females, with relative losses in body mass being small for both sexes compared to other phocid Seals (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Kovacs <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lydersen and Kovacs 1999).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals moult in July, with each breeding stock congregating on sea ice north of their respective whelping areas. If mixing does occur, the degree to which it takes place is unknown. Following the moulting period they disperse in the North Atlantic (Folkow and Blix 1999, Folkow <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Kovacs <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a). Apart from the breeding and moulting periods when Hooded Seals form loose aggregations in specific areas, they are thought to live quite solitary lives. However, little is known about them outside those periods. Groups of females and young animals have been seen at the northern ice edge in summer, but it is not known whether the groups are socially facilitated or solely the result of concentrations of prey. Hooded Seal longevity is 25-30 years (Kovacs 2002).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals are very capable divers that spend extensive periods at sea without hauling out (e.g., Folkow and Blix 1999, Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Most of their dives are from 100-600 m in depth and last 5-25 minutes, however, very deep dives to over 1,000 m and dives lasting almost an hour have been recorded (Folkow <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lydersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpubl. data). Similar to Elephant Seals, Hooded Seals perform drift dives, in which buoyancy controls their movements through the water column (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Hooded Seals feed on a wide variety of fish and invertebrates, including species that occur throughout the water column (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Examples of typical prey are pelagic Amphipods (<em>Parathemisto </em>sp.), Greenland Halibut, members of the Cod family such as Polar and Atlantic Cod, Redfishes, Sand Eels, Herring, Capelin, Squid (e.g., <em>Gonatus fabricii</em>), and Shrimp (Haug <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, 2007).<br/><br/>A recent study of foraging habitat selection by Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic documented significantly different preferences by adult males and females with the former occupying areas with complex seabed relief while the latter concentrated their foraging search effort along shelf areas (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Productivity (measured as chlorophyll a) was the most important single factor influencing habitat selection across all age groups.<br/><br/>Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known Hooded Seal predators (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). These predators are thought to be having increased impacts on Hooded Seals in the West Ice following the deterioration of breeding ice used by this species (Foote <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Øigård <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014); Greenland Sharks also take at least young Hooded Seals (Leclerc <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).","By-catch of Hooded Seals in coastal net fisheries has been reported from the USA, from trawl fisheries off Norway and Newfoundland, and from salmon drift nets used off Greenland (Woodley and Lavigne 1991, Reeves <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1992, Waring <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). Competition for food with commercial fisheries and other predators has been suggested as a factor that may limit population growth or lead to declines of Hooded Seals (Reijnders <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993). This factor may be playing a role in the continuing decline of Hooded Seals in the Northeast Atlantic given that abundance of Redfish, which are favoured prey of Hooded Seals, has declined in the late 1990s in both the Barents and Norwegian Seas due to excessive fishing pressure. No targeted catch is allowed for some Redfish species in this region and juvenile fish are being protected to attempt to promote recovery (ICES 2013b).<br/><br/>Impacts of oil spills on Hooded Seals have not been reported; however as an ice breeding species, they might be at risk of mortality from spills during the pupping season when newborn and newly weaned pups could be fouled (St. Aubin 1990). Hooded Seals have been exposed to <em>Morbillivirus </em>(Duignan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997), but are not known to have suffered fatalities during the mass die-offs of Harbour Seals in European waters from phocine distemper virus in 1998 and 2002. Subsequent testing revealed antibodies to the virus in 18-24% percent of the Hooded Seals sampled indicating exposure to the virus (Harkonen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Hooded Seals in the northeast Atlantic have high organohalogen contaminant burdens that are thought to be impacting thyroid homeostasis (Villanger <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>The Hooded Seal is a pack ice species, and is dependent on ice as a substrate for pupping, moulting, and resting and as such is vulnerable to reduction in extent or timing of pack ice formation and retreat (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Johnston <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Learmonth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). The very short, intense breeding season of Hooded Seals that is timed right at the end of the sea ice season, has likely put them at heightened risk of impacts arising from changes in the duration of the sea ice season (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, 2012; Stenson and Hammill 2014). The Barents Sea region’s sea ice cover is declining at twice the rate of other arctic areas with a shortening of &gt;20 weeks having taken place in the last few decades (Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015), so it is not surprising that the West Ice stock is the first to be heavily impacted.<br/><br/>The productivity of the ice-edge ecosystem is also dependent on the dynamics and seasonality of arctic ice, and alterations to the cycle of formation and retreat of the ice could be having negative effects on important Hooded Seal prey. For example, Polar cod abundance has declined markedly in the last decade in the Barents Region within a broad, rapid “borealization” of the fish community in this sector of the Arctic (Fossheim <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Decreases in sea ice cover could also lead to more shipping and development of extraction based industries in the Arctic (gas, oil, mining, etc.) which in turn could negatively affect Hooded Seals through increased exposure to contaminants and pollution, increased disturbance, and increased risk of shipping accidents and spills (Pagnan 2000).<br/><br/>Predation by Polar Bears is thought to be an increasing issue of concern with respect to the West Ice stock’s conservation status. Polar Bear diets have shown an increase in Hooded Seal consumption by 9.5% per decade since the mid-1980s in East Greenland along with a concomitant decrease in the consumption of Ringed Seals (McKinney <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). These changes are likely primarily due to changes in sea ice distribution and extent (but could also reflect a declining Ringed Seal population).","Hooded Seal populations are usually assessed based on aerial survey counts of pups at whelping areas in the pack ice, combined with population models to extrapolate to total population size. In Canadian waters, pup production estimates for the Front have been: 1978—26,000 (Winters and Bergflodt 1978); 1984—62,400 (Bowen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987); 1985—61,400 (Hay <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1985); 1990—83,100 (Hammill <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1992); and 2005—107,013 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). These figures indicate an increase of 5.2%/year during 1978-2005, 2.6%/year during 1984-2005, and 1.7%/year during 1990-2005. Pup production estimates for Gulf region in Canada have been: 1991—2,006 (Hammill <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1992); 1998/99—2,000 (ICES 2001); and 2005—6,620 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). Comparing counts in 1991 and 2005 suggests that the number of animals in the Gulf increased by 8.5%/year during that period. Only two estimates are available for Davis Strait, 19,000 pups in 1984 (Bowen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987) and 3,346 in 2005 (Hammill and Stenson 2006); this suggests a decline of 8.2%/year. Hammill and Stenson (2006, 2007) concluded that these estimates suggest a moderate increase both in pup production and population size between the mid 1980s and 2005 in the northwest Atlantic as a whole. Surveys carried out at all three whelping areas in 2005 produced an estimate of 116,900 pups born. The size of the whole population, modeled based on the pup counts, was estimated as 592,000 (Waring <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007). No more recent survey information is available for the northwest Atlantic breeding areas (ICES 2013a) and the down-turn in the number of animals in the Davis Strait in the 2005 survey is concerning, especially given its magnitude and the continued high hunting levels of this species in West Greenland.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals in the West Ice have shown, and continue to show, a declining trend. Pup production estimates have been: 1997—23,762 (ICES 2013a); 2005—15,250 (Salberg <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008); 2007—16,140 (ICES 2013a); and 2012—13,655 (Øigård <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Comparing the estimates for 1997 and 2012 indicates a population decrease of 3.7%/year and a reduction in population size of 43% in 15 years (1.2 generations using the generation time of 12.8 years calculated by Pacifici <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The most recent estimate of the total size of this population is 82,830 (SE=8,028) and models suggest a continued decline of approximately 7% per year in the coming decade (Øigård <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This stock is less than 10% of its abundance observed some 60 years ago (ICES 2013a). Overhunting was clearly involved in the collapse of this stock as quotas were being set for a population size much larger than it actually was. However, the cause of the significant, on-going decline in this population is thought to be related to climate change induced alternation of its sea ice breeding habitat and increased predation by Polar Bears and Killer Whales in the pupping areas (Øigard <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014) but prey availability might also be an issue.<br/><br/>Summing the most recent estimates for all stocks (three regions in the northwest Atlantic–2005; West Ice stock–2012) gives a total Hooded Seal population size estimate of approximately 675,000. However, with no recent surveys in Canada or Greenland this estimate cannot be considered reliable.<br/><br/>Available data show clearly that the Greenland Sea population has declined in recent years. With no surveys in the past 10 years, the trend for the northwestern stocks is unknown. Pup counts at the Front increased through until 2005, but with the rate of increase declining over time. With 15 years between surveys, it is possible that the population had peaked and started to decline before 2005. Since 2005, there have been several years with bad ice conditions when few Hooded Seals were sighted on the ice and it is not known whether any successful reproduction at all took place for the Gulf segment of the population (Stenson and Hammill 2014). Given the available data, the best estimate for the current population trend for Hooded Seals is -3.7%/year.<br/><br/>Because of their preference for heavy sea ice conditions for breeding, it is unlikely that Hooded Seals will continue to breed in their southern-most breeding areas in future. This species has been deemed one the most sensitive Arctic/subarctic marine mammal species to the impacts of climate change (Laidre <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008).",Unknown,"Hooded Seals are found at high latitudes in the North Atlantic, and seasonally they extend their range north into the Arctic Ocean. They breed on pack ice and are associated with it much of the year, though they can spend significant periods of time pelagic, without hauling out (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Folkow and Blix 1999, Anderson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Folkow <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Kovacs <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011a). There are four major pupping areas: near the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, north of Newfoundland in an area known as the Front, in central Davis Strait, and in the West Ice in the Greenland Sea near the island of Jan Mayen (Sergeant 1974). Hooded Seals sometimes wander extensively; young animals have come ashore as far south as Portugal and the Canary Islands in Europe and south into the Caribbean in the West Atlantic (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986, Rice 1998). They have also been found outside the Atlantic Region, in the North Pacific and even as far south as California (Burns and Gavin 1980, Dudley 1992, Fay 1995). Since the mid 1990s, large numbers of vagrant Hooded Seals have been found outside the Arctic in some years (Mignucci-Giannoni and Haddow 2002, Harris and Gupta 2006). Stranded Hooded Seals are increasingly common on Sable Island, Canada, and along the New England coast and in the Saint Lawrence River area, particularly in years with sparse sea ice conditions (Harris <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Lucas and Daoust 2002, Truchon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).","Hooded Seals were subjected to intense commercial hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries. Harvests were often conducted in association with Harp Seal harvests and commercial fisheries for Greenland Sharks. Norway, the Soviet Union (now Russia), Canada, and Greenland have all been involved in the commercial harvests of this species. Following World War II the hunt was primarily focused on pups because of their highly prized blue-back pelt, however, many adult females were taken while defending their pups until killing of mothers in the breeding areas was prohibited in the various areas (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988).<br/><br/>The abundance estimate for Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic is now a decade old; the last survey was conducted in 2005 (ICES 2013a), and the stock is now treated as a data-poor stock in terms of management protocols. Total allowable catch was set at 8,200 in 2007 and remained unchanged through to 2015 despite the lack of new information on stock sizes or trends in the region. However, Canadian catches are reported to be very low, some few 10s of animals per year.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals are also harvested in Greenland at a current level of a few thousand animals per year. It is assumed that most of those animals are from the northwest Atlantic breeding groups (Davis Strait, Gulf, and Front) given that most of the harvest takes place in West Greenland. However, some animals are also taken on the east coast of Greenland, and these animals are likely from the West Ice stock.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals have been harvested in the West Ice (Greenland Sea, north of Jan Mayen) for centuries. This hunt increased substantially after World War II, to levels that were clearly not sustainable. Regulatory measures were introduced in 1958 to reduce effort, and quotas were imposed in 1971 (Sergeant 1976, ICES 2006). Based on catch per unit effort analyses and mark-recapture pup production estimates it was assumed that the stock increased from the 1960s through to the 1990s at an unknown rate (Ulltang and Øien 1988). In hindsight this almost certainly was not the case (ICES 2013a). Aerial surveys in 1994 failed to produce an abundance estimate (Øritsland and Øien 1995). Recent modelling efforts suggest that a very substantial decrease in population abundance took place from the late 1940s up to the early 1980s (ICES 2006). This decline has continued through to the present and predictions suggest an ongoing decline of 7% over the coming decade (Øigård <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Total pup production in this stock was estimated to be 24,000 in 1997 and this number dropped to 15,250 in 2005 (Salberg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008) and has continued to decline to 13,655 in 2012, despite a complete cessation of commercial harvesting (Øigård <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Numerous conservation measures, international management plans, harvest quotas, agreements, and treaties have been developed for the conservation of Hooded Seals dating back to the 1870s. Molting Seals in the Denmark Strait have been protected since 1961. Harvest quotas at Jan Mayen began in 1971. Hunting was banned in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1972 and quotas were placed on the rest of the Canadian harvest beginning in 1974. A European Economic Community ban on importation on Seal products in 1985 reduced the harvest of blueback Hooded Seals through the loss of the primary market for the furs (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1992). Greenlandic hunting is not limited, and might be at levels that are not sustainable, given deteriorating breeding conditions. The northeast Atlantic stock has experienced close to a 90% decline and the decline is ongoing. Population information for the northwest Atlantic is a decade old, leaving trends unknown for this segment of the population.<br/><br/>Based on population size, geographic range, habitat specificity, diet diversity, migration, site fidelity, sensitivity to changes in sea ice, sensitivity to changes in the trophic web, and maximum population growth potential Hooded Seals were rated to be among the top three arctic marine mammal species in terms of sensitivity to climate change (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008). This species should be re-evaluated as soon as new data are available for Canada and Greenland.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45228501,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"While Walruses occur over a vast area and are common in some regions, their future is by no means secure. Climatic warming will surely require them to live in a much different environment as sea ice recedes and disappears from many of the areas they have used in past centuries (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, 2012, 2015; Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2015). All reasonable scenarios expect that such drastic changes to their habitats will cause Walrus populations to decline throughout most of their range. Because of the expectation of a decline the IUCN SSC Pinniped Specialist Group has recommended that the Atlantic Walrus be listed as Near Threatened under criterion C1, and they have recommended that the Pacific Walrus be listed as Data Deficient. Models suggest that Pacific Walrus abundance declined by 50% between 1980 and 2000 (Udevitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009), and there is ongoing concern about female body condition and possible impacts on calf survival (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Considering both the certainty of future decline in their habitat quality and the limitations of abundance and trend data, the Walrus as a species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.","The Walrus’s most distinctive feature is the external tusks, which are possessed by both males and females. The tusks can grow to be a meter long and can weigh 5 kg in large bulls. They are one of the largest pinnipeds with Pacific Walrus males reaching 3.6 m in length and weighing 880-1,557 kg; adult females are about 3 m and 580-1,039 kg. Atlantic Walrus adults are slightly shorter and lighter. Newborns are 1-1.4 m long and weigh 33-85 kg (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).<br/><br/>Walruses are extremely social animals, and when on land or ice they are normally found in tight groups ranging in size from a few individual up to thousands. At sea they usually travel in groups as well (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). There is significant sexual segregation outside the breeding season, with males often being found in areas away from females and their calves. Walruses have a narrow ecological niche. They depend on: 1) the availability of large areas of shallow water with suitable bottom substrate to support a productive bivalve community, 2) the presence of reliable open water over rich feeding areas, particularly in winter when access to feeding areas is limited by ice cover, and 3) the presence of haul out areas in reasonably close proximity to feeding areas. The preferred haul out platform is sea ice, although both subspecies routinely use terrestrial haul out sites in the summer and autumn (Fay 1981, Hamilton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Because they feed in shallow, coastal areas Walruses usually perform only relatively shallow, short dives (Fay and Burns 1988, Born 2005). The Walrus’s main prey is bivalve mollusks that they search for using their sensitive whiskers on or in soft-bottom substrates. In addition to Clams, their diet can include Worms, Snails, soft shell Crabs, Amphipods, Shrimp, Sea Cucumbers, Tunicates, and even slow-moving Fishes (Born 2005, Sheffield and Grebmeier 2009). Some Walruses prey on birds and other marine mammals, eating a variety of Seal species (Lowry and Fay 1984, Fox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Seymour <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Walrus make foraging trips that last from a few hours to several days; in the Pacific, trips are shorter in duration and distance when they originate from sea ice versus land (Udevitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occur in the winter. Walruses are polygynous and the males establish small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes (Sjare and Stirling 1996, Sjare <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Most births occur in May of the following year. Most female Walrus give birth at 7-10 years old and usually they only produce one calf every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>The primary predators of Walrus are Polar Bears and Killer Whales (Killian and Stirling 1978, Fay 1981).","Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.<br/><br/>Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers <em>et al.</em> 2006, Skoglund <em>et al.</em> 2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.<br/><br/>Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011, Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova <em>et al.</em> 2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.","The Pinniped Specialists Group assessed the abundance and trend of the two Walrus subspecies as follows:<br/><ul><li>Atlantic Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;25,000, some subpopulations increasing but overall trend unknown</li><li>Pacific Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;200,000, trend unknown</li></ul>Considering these results, the abundance of the Walrus species as a whole is likely &gt;225,000 and the trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and are mostly found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas (Fay 1981, Rice 1998). The Atlantic Walrus occurs from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2014). Within that region nine stocks are generally recognized. Historically, Atlantic walruses occurred south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northwestern North Atlantic, but they were extirpated in this region by excessive harvesting (McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2014). Vagrants have been reported from New England, Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay in France/Spain. The Pacific Walrus normally ranges from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, which constitute the center of its range, to the Laptev Sea in the west and the Beaufort Sea in the east, with vagrants south into the North Pacific Ocean to Japan and southcentral Alaska (Fay 1982).","Native people of the Arctic have depended on Walrus for food, hides, ivory and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests continue today in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia. All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been managed under numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been well within sustainable limits (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010, Henriksen and Hilmo 2015). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland, and additionally females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Walrus are listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which allows for control of global trade in Walrus ivory.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia; they are on the Norwegian Red List (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and they are listed in the Russian Red Book (Boltunov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland (Wiig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated the Atlantic Walrus as a species of “special concern”, which acknowledges that they are at risk of becoming threatened in this region; this classification is attributed to climate change impacts on sea ice (COSEWIC 2006).<br/><br/>Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) generally prohibits taking of Walrus unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. MMPA regulations are used to control impacts caused by commercial fishing, oil and gas development, and other human activities. The Pacific Walrus is currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act which would provide additional protections. Within the US there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Russia, Walruses were commercially harvested through the 1980s, but harvests ended in 1991 due to economic collapse of the industry. The “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Pacific Walruses by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a quota is determined annually. Russian legislation prohibits sport hunting of Pacific Walruses, and a variety of types of protection are afforded to major haulout sites along the Russian coast (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Average body length reaches 126-129 cm, with a maximum body length of approximately 140 cm (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Both sexes become sexually mature at about 6 years of age, with most breeding females (74% in a 1974 sample) aged between 8 and 17 years (Popov 1979, 1982). The pregnancy rate for females older than 9 is reported to be as low as 0.2-0.33 (Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Miyazaki 2002), and Krylov (1990) reports a similar low rate of 0.34 for females aged 10-14 years. Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012), acknowledge that the reproductive rate is low in females &gt;20 years old, but suggest that the reproductive rate is &gt;0.5 for females &lt;20 years old taken together as a group. Since females &lt;20 years old make up approximately two-thirds of the population of adult females, they probably drive the overall reproductive rate for the population up to about 0.5. Both Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1999) and Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012) attribute the lower reproductive rates of older females to the effect of long term exposure to organochlorine contaminants in the older animals. Accumulation of contaminants with age has been documented in Caspian seals, but most animals appear to be below thresholds associated with reproductive pathologies (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Pups are generally born from mid-January to late February on the ice, with a birth weight of around 5 kg (Popov 1979), and are nursed for 4-5 weeks. In contrast to ringed seals, females do not usually construct lairs (Frost and Lowry 1981), possibly because sufficient amounts of snow overlying the ice are normally lacking. Pupping on the ice without lairs has allowed direct counts of pups to be made in the recent aerial surveys (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Pups do not enter the water until the ice melts in mid to late March.<br/><br/>The first documented observations of small numbers of Seals breeding in other parts of the Caspian were made in 1982, with females reported pupping on small sand islands in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, although it is likely this behaviour was not new (Krylov 1990). Large numbers of mostly nonbreeding Seals spend the winter in the middle and southern Caspian, with one estimate of 15,000 Seals along the Turkmenistan coast (Krylov 1990).<br/><br/>A post-breeding moult occurs from April to early May, during which the Seals first use the ice and then islands, sand bars, and reed beds for hauling out (Badamshin 1970, Krylov 1990). Presently, Komsomolets Bay and the Durnev Islands in Kazakhstan and Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj island in Russian waters represent the most important moulting habitats (Dmitrieva 2013). Aggregations of several tens of thousands of individuals can be found in Komsomoletz Bay during this period, and around ten thousand at Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj.<br/><br/>During late spring, summer, and early autumn, Caspian Seals are distributed throughout the Caspian Sea. They feed throughout the region, exploiting both the shallow basin in the north and the deep middle and southern basins (Krylov 1990). Recent satellite telemetry studies indicate about 60% of animals move to the middle and southern Caspian, with the remainder staying in the north, primarily around the inflow of Volga and Ural rivers (Dmitrieva 2013). The telemetry studies suggest considerable individual variation in summer migratory and foraging behavior, with individuals spending the summer period separated among shallow, intermediate, and deep water locations. This may reflect individual specialization or niche partitioning in relation to habitat or prey types (Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015a). <br/><br/>During the post-moult summer period Seals rarely haul out, spending several months at sea feeding. In late autumn the breeding adults gather in the northeast, hauling out on sandy islands and reed beds in increasing numbers until ice begins to form (Krylov 1990). When the surface freezes over, females form aggregations on the ice to give birth to their pups, tending to gather along cracks in the ice giving them ready access to the water, although like Ringed Seals they also construct and maintain holes in the ice for water access (Heptner <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Diving capacity for Caspian Seals is comparable to other small phocids, with maximum dive depths exceeding 200 m and dive times exceeding 20 minutes, but most dives are typically shallower than 15 m and shorter than 5 minutes. During the summer foraging areas are not limited by proximity to haul out sites, and animals may spend up to six months at sea. Foraging appears to be primarily benthic (Dmitrieva 2013).<br/><br/>Caspian Seals feed on a variety of fish species. During the summer and autumn, Seals move to and congregate where prey are abundant, particularly Caspian Kilka (<em>Clupeonella </em>sp.), Caspian Silverside (<em>Atherina mochon</em>), and Caspian Gobies (<em>Gobidae</em>) (Krylov 1990), with <em>Clupeonella </em>species historically making up a major proportion of their total annual diet (Kosarev and Yablonskaya 1994). A report on fish found in the stomachs of Seals in the northern Caspian in 1986-1987 (Piletskii and Krylov 1990) suggested that fish eaten in order of frequency were Roach (<em>Rutilus rutilus</em>), Zander (<em>Lucioperca lucioperca</em>), Gobies (<em>Knipowitschia </em>sp., <em>Neogobius kessleri</em> and <em>Benthophilus </em>sp.), and Bream (<em>Blicca bjoerkna </em>and <em>Abramis brama</em>), followed by C. deliculata and other species. A preliminary study from faecal samples collected on the Apsheron Peninsula in June 2001 and March 2002 suggested that Gobies, Silverside, and shrimp were important constituents of the diet of Seals at those times (Eybatov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). New studies of diet in Caspian Seals are required in order to get an accurate picture of current prey in different areas of the Caspian in light of potential changes to the abundance of fish species due to recent ecological changes occurring in the region.","Unsustainable hunting was the main driver of Caspian Seal decline during the 20th century (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012), and human caused mortality continues to be the main ongoing threat to the population. Recently, by-catch of Seals, primarily in illegal Sturgeon fisheries has been identified as a major cause of Seal mortality (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on semi-structured interviews conducted in fishing communities from Dagestan (Russia), Astrakhan region (Russia), and Atyrau region (Kazakhstan), Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2013) documented a minimum by-catch of 1,215 Seals during the 2008-2009 fishing season, 93% of which occurred in illegal Sturgeon fisheries. However, the study sampling reflected less than 10% of the overall poaching activity in the north Caspian, so the actual by-catch is likely to be substantially higher, and to exceed the Potential Biological Removal level (Wade <em>et al.</em> 1998) for the population (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Moreover, the survey did not cover fisheries in the middle and southern Caspian. Iranian commercial fisheries cause an estimated mortality of 500 Seals annually (Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). Further work is needed to fully quantify Seal by-catch rates throughout the Caspian Sea, and its implications for population demography. Fishermen frequently sell skins and blubber from bycaught Seals.<br/><br/>Natural sources of mortality include predation and disease. The primary non-human predators are Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and Sea Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus </em>spp.). Krylov (1990) estimated that Wolves killed 17-40% of Caspian Seal pups on “some breeding grounds from 1974 to 1976”, while Eagles took less than 1% of pups. The reverse was found during recent aerial surveys (Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). Few Wolves were observed each year between 2005-2012, but up to 3,100 Eagles. Eagles are likely to primarily scavenge afterbirth and dead pups, but may also be capable of killing unaccompanied unweaned pups.<br/><br/>Mass mortality events occurred in 1997 and 2000-2001, killing several thousand Seals each time, and have since been attributed to canine distemper virus (CDV). Presence of a hitherto unknown strain of CDV was confirmed in one dead Seal in 1997 (Forsyth <em>et al.</em> 1998), and the same strain was confirmed as the primary cause of death in Seals dying in 2000 in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (Kennedy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Examination of archived stranding records in Azerbaijan since 1971, show an increased mortality every few years, suggesting the possibility of previous outbreaks of CDV (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). A serology study of archived samples indicated that CDV was present in Caspian Seals in 1993, 1997, and 1998 (Ohashi <em>et al.</em> 2001). There have been no further mass mortalities since 2001, but disease would become a concern should they reoccur.<br/><br/>Degradation of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and overexploitation of primary food resources may also be threats to Caspian Seals (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993, Barannik <em>et al.</em> 2004). An invasive of Comb Jellyfish, <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, arrived in the Caspian Sea via ship ballast water in the Volga-Don Canal in 1999 (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000). Comb Jellyfish consume zooplankton rapidly, leading indirectly to a reduction in fish stocks and a substantial impact on local fisheries. A 70% reduction in commercial landings of three species of Kilka was recorded within three years of the Comb Jellyfish invasion (Kideys <em>et al.</em> 2005). Kilka are thought to be important prey for Caspian Seals in the central and southern parts of the sea, and the invasion of Comb Jellyfish is considered a threat to the Seals (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). In addition to impacts from Comb Jellyfish, most commercial fisheries in the Caspian are considered to be severely depleted or extinct due to unsustainable fishing practices and/or loss of fish habitats such as spawning grounds (Strukova and Guchgeldiyev 2010). While Caspian Seals are known to feed to on commercially important fish species, commercial catch rates are not necessarily an indicator of prey availability, and Seals have a varied and adaptable diet which includes non-commercial species such as Gobies. To date is has not been possible to make any quantitative assessment on potential impacts from changes in Caspian food webs and Caspian Seal energetics and demography. Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2015) did not find a significant correlation when testing for association between annual pup production and net primary productivity 2005-2012, but a longer time series of surveys is required to achieve adequate statistical power.<br/><br/>The Caspian Sea has no outlet and receives most of its input from the Volga, Ural, and other rivers. Contamination of the Volga with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s, but levels in Seals do not appear to be elevated, with the exception of zinc in some diseased animals that may have suffered homeostatic disturbance of trace metal levels (Anan <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Organochlorine levels (principally polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs)) have been assessed for Caspian Seals dying in the 1997-2001 CDV epizootics (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1999; Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2008; Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most animals were found to have levels below thresholds believed to cause toxic effects in mammals. Overall levels in Caspian Seals were lower than those seen in European Seal species, comparable to Baikal Seals, and higher than those reported for Arctic species (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Presently there is no evidence that organochlorine burdens in Caspian Seals cause reproductive or immune impairment, or contributed to the 1997-2001 CDV outbreaks at a population level, although some individual Seals may have high burdens (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002,&#160;Härkönen&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Organochlorine accumulation was found to be primarily age related, which means animals at the older end of the age distribution may be at risk of crossing toxicity thresholds towards the end of their reproductive lifespan (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It has been recommended that levels of persistent organic pollutants should be monitored in the future due to the continuing industrial development around the Caspian region and time elapsed since the last survey following the CDV epizootics (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Combined juvenile mortality from continued hunting, natural predation, and fisheries by-catch is believed to be unsustainable. Overall mortality before breeding from all sources is likely to be in the region of 50% (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). Demographic models indicate such a high rate of juvenile mortality would be capable of causing a continuing decline in the Caspian Seal population, with lowered fertility due to organochlorine contamination being a relatively minor factor (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Variation in annual pup production determined from aerial surveys makes empirical estimation of current population trends uncertain (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b), and a longer time series is necessary to assess the demographic trajectory directly.<br/><br/>As a landlocked ice-breeding species with no option to migrate to alternative habitats, Caspian Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). Warming may cause a reduction in the spatial extent, temporal duration, and stability of the winter ice breeding habitat. Premature break-up of the ice sheet before pups are moulted will cause significant mortality among pups of the year. January-March 2007 was one of the mildest winters in the Caspian in recent years, with ice cover suitable for breeding limited to a narrow strip along the coastline of the north-east Caspian. Storms in mid-February may have caused ice-flows with large numbers of pups to be swept out to sea, and pup counts for that year were less than one third the maximum observed for 2005-2012 (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). It has also been suggested that poor ice conditions may play a role in the epidemiology of CDV outbreaks due to Seal crowding on limited haulout space and poor condition of weaned pups (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Long term trends in Caspian Sea ice cover and the implications for population demography remain to be fully assessed.<br/><br/>Through the geological history of the Caspian, there have been several substantial fluctuations of sea level (Dumont 1998), which will have affected the relative amounts of shallow and deep water habitats available to Seals. The population adapted to those past changes, but there is some concern about whether the same will be possible for future sea level changes given added pressures of habitat loss and human impacts.<br/><br/>Further threats to the Seals on shore and on ice now come from increasing disturbance due to offshore and shoreline developments. One of the largest oil fields in the world is currently being developed in the Caspian, with the construction of numerous offshore oil drilling islands, pipelines, shipping access to these, and onshore logistics facilities. A recent study found that breeding Seals are using shipping channels as artificial leads into the ice and are giving birth close to the edge of these channels. A significant proportion of the breeding population and pups may therefore experience disturbance by shipping traffic depending on the ice conditions (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). More research is required to quantify the likely impacts of this intensive oil development. The coasts of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran have also seen increased development for domestic and leisure use in recent years, with many previously undisturbed stretches of coast now being developed.<br/><br/>Disturbance of island and reef haulout sites by illegal fishing activities and opportunistic Seal hunting are another ongoing problem. Recent surveys have found that the Caspian Seal has effectively disappeared from Azerbaijan, with the once important haulout sites of the Apsheron Peninsula and Archipelago abandoned. These sites were used by many thousands of Seals until the 1930s when they were heavily hunted (Krylov 1990). However, between 1997 and 2002 a few hundred Seals were still counted regularly at these sites (e.g., Allchin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Few live Seals have been seen in this area since 2004 (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). The overall Caspian Seal population decline since 2002 is unlikely to account for this total disappearance, which is most probably due in part to severe disturbance by illegal fishing and other coastal activities (T. Eybatov, unpublished data). Similar declines in the regularity of Seal occupancy have also been noted recently at other sites, such as South West Island near the Ural Delta and Osushnoy Island (Kazakhstan), Bautino (Kazakhstan), and in Turkmenbashi Bay (Turkmenistan). The number of Seals at Ogurchinsky Island (Turkmenistan) has also declined from several thousand in the 1980s to a few hundred (P. Erokhin, unpublished observations). The only previously recorded haulout site in Iran, at Ashoora Island, is no longer used by Seals (H. Asadi pers. comm.). There is a need to develop an inventory of all haulout sites throughout the Caspian together with archived and current records of Seal occupancy (Wilson and Goodman 2012).","Historically, the population of Caspian Seals was estimated to have exceeded one million (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). The most recent estimates of abundance are based on aerial surveys of the breeding population on the northern ice field conducted annually in February between 2005 and 2012 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). During this period estimated annual pup production ranged between 8,200 (95% confidence intervals 7,130-9,342) and 34,000 (95% confidence intervals 31,275-36,814). This would suggest there are currently approximately 68,000 reproductively mature individuals (male and female, based on the greatest observed pup production), with the total population in the region of 104,000 to 168,000 individuals derived from an age structured model (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2012; Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). Variation in weather conditions during surveys may account for some of difference in pup counts between years, but additional contributions from biological factors affecting fecundity cannot be excluded at this time (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). The variability in annual pup makes the current population trend uncertain, and a longer time series is necessary to directly assess the demographic trajectory (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). However, if pup mortality exceeds 50% due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes (a realistic scenario), this could be sufficient to result in ongoing declines (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>The population decline throughout the 20th century has been reconstructed by a demographic model using hunting statistics. By the 1950s–1960s, the population was estimated from this model to have been reduced to between 400,000-500,000 Seals (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), while an estimate based on a harvest of 86,000 pups in 1966, believed to be most pups born that year, also produced an estimate of 500,000 Seals for that year (Krylov 1990). Aerial surveys conducted in 1976 and 1980 suggested an estimate of 450,000 animals (Krylov 1990), although the hind-casting analysis suggests a population of only about 200,000 Seals remaining at that time (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Surveys in 1987 and 1989 resulted in an estimate of approximately 360,000-400,000 (Krylov 1990), but again the hind-casting analysis suggests this might again have been an over-estimate, with perhaps only about 130,000 Seals remaining by the late 1980s. Overall, the hind-casting analysis indicated a population reduction of about 66% during 1867-1964 and a further reduction of 73% during 1965-2005 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) estimated the total population of adult females as 354,210 in 1945 and 21,000 in 2005, later revised to 34,000 by Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015b) after accounting for survey observation errors. Although pup production has been revised upwards in more recent publications, this would not affect the relative decline, since it would imply correspondingly higher historical population sizes. The IUCN Criterion A calculator was used to project declines over a three generation period 1955-2015, indicating adult female numbers declined 91.5%. However, the scale of decline is dependent on estimated values for parameters such as pup survival and fertility rates, about which there is some uncertainty (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Therefore a more conservative position for the purposes of IUCN classification would be to accept a relative decline of at least 70% until more data are available to refine the historical demography.<br/><br/>Generation time from Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) is 18.8 years.",Unknown,"Caspian Seals are confined to the Caspian Sea. They range throughout the sea with seasonal migration between the southern, middle, and northern basins. More than 99.9% of breeding takes place on ice, which covers the shallow northern parts of the Caspian Sea in from late December to early April in typical years (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013, Dmitrieva <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015a). Occasional observations have been made of low numbers (a few tens of individuals) breeding on islets off Turkmenistan (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013).","Caspian Seals have been commercially exploited since the late 18th century. Harvests averaged 119,000-174,000 per year throughout the 19th century, with peaks of 300,000 having been recorded. In the 20th century, harvest levels peaked in the 1930s with an average annual harvest of 164,000 and a maximum single year take of 227,600. The numbers of Seals taken fell during World War II to an average of 60,800 per year, and subsequently ranged between a low of 41,400 and a high of 108,300 for the period 1951-1975 (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Commercial harvesting was temporarily halted in 1996 after a much-reduced estimated take of 14,000 Seals. Since the start of the 21st century smaller scale commercial and scientific hunting has taken place in Russia, typically with recorded hunts of tens or hundreds of individuals per year, with a maximum of 4,600 (in 2003-2004), reported for the period up to 2010. Official hunting is conducted under a quota system administered by an inter-governmental body, the Caspian Bioresources Commission. Typical annual quotas are for 18,000 Seals, with 8,000 allocated to Russia, and the remainder divided among the other Caspian states. The scientific rationale for the quotas is not clear. Currently only Russia actively pursues official hunting under the quota, but large scale hunting does not appear to be commercially viable at present and recorded takes are far below the official quota levels (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). The level of ‘unofficial’ or illegal hunting is poorly documented, but illegal hunting on ice on the scale of hundreds of Seals is known to take place periodically (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Seal skins are used for hats and other clothing in Russia, while Seal blubber is used as a medicinal tonic, fishing bait, and cattle feed in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The total economic value and trading networks for Seal products remain to be fully determined, but high quality individual seal skins may sell for up to $100 US dollars at the point of origin, while seal oil can sell for $14.00 per litre in local markets (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Various prohibitions, quotas, and protective measures have been taken to conserve the Caspian Seal, beginning in 1940 when seal nets were prohibited. The harvest of moulting Seals in the spring was ended in 1946, and in 1952 the Apsheron Archipelago in Azerbaijan was closed to sealing. Female harvesting on the breeding grounds was stopped in 1966 and all take was prohibited on the eastern islands of the northern Caspian in 1967. These last two changes led to a complete change in the commercial harvest, resulting in a switch to newborn and moulted pups. Quotas on harvest of pups, purportedly based on biological data, began in 1970 (Krylov 1990), although in retrospect the quotas were at unsustainable levels. The Russian Federation continues to consider the Caspian Seal to be a ‘harvested’ species, with quotas set through the Caspian Bioresources Commission (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2012).<br/><br/>A Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan was approved by the nations bordering the Caspian Sea, pursuant to the 2003 Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Caspian Environment Programme 2007), but it had no legally binding actions. The action plan recommended cessation of hunting, measures to reduce by-catch in legal and illegal fisheries, and the strategic creation of protected areas of sea, ice, and shore. However, to date none of the Caspian states have taken steps to implement the action plan. In 2012 the CaspEco Project, a UNDP funded follow up to the Caspian Environment Programme, published a framework report and road map for the establishment of a network of protected areas for Caspian Seals, including suitable locations (Wilson and Goodman 2012), but no further action has yet taken place. A number of small non-governmental organizations within Caspian countries are involved in producing educational materials and promoting awareness of Caspian Seals. In Iran, localised work with fishing communities has been conducted promoting release rather than killing of live animals found entangled in fishing gear, and a stranded seal rehabilitation facility has been established. In 2014 the Caspian States banned all catching of wild Sturgeon and in recent years Kazakhstan has increased maritime patrols to counter Sturgeon poaching which in principle may have potential to also help reduce seal by-catch.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Cuzin pers. obs.). Annual rainfall is less than 100 mm per year on the northern fringe of their distribution. On the southern fringe, it may be found up to the Sahelian areas that receive as much as 300 mm rainfall per year. In the Sahara, Fennecs occur in vast treeless sand seas with sparse vegetation often dominated by <em>Aristida </em>spp. and <em>Cyperus </em>spp., with shrubs such as <em>Ephedra alata</em>&#160;or (in the central Sahara) <em>Cornulaca monacantha</em>. Typically they are the only canid in large sand dune habitats. In small sand dunes or fixed vegetated dunes, Fennecs typically occur in areas dominated by <em>Panicum turgidum</em>&#160;or <em>Zygophyllum</em> spp., and sometimes by trees like <em>Acacia </em>spp. and <em>Capparis decidua</em> (Asa and Cuzin 2013) and they may share these habitats with Rueppell’s Fox and Golden Jackal <em>Canis aureus</em>.&#160;Studies at Termit in Niger suggested that although sympatric with other canids, they appeared tolerant of a wide range of habitats, including, but not limited to, drier and higher temperature zones than other species (Burruss 2014); ability to burrow in sandier substrates than other canids may also provide Fennecs with a competitive advantage in dune systems (Cuzin and Lenain 2004).","Currently there are no major range-wide threats to the species. However, human activity is rising rapidly in many parts of the Sahara. Construction of new roads, bettering of non-asphalted roads and new human settlements increase the disturbance and risk to some populations. Ongoing seismic surveys, exploratory drilling and oil field developments, coupled with increasing development of commercial transport and migration routes across recently remote parts of the region, create further pressure. The impact of major oil field development on local populations has not been assessed. Direct impacts include increased risk of ‘roadkills’ and risk to naïve desert living Fennecs, which can show lack of fear and curiosity when approached by vehicles. Locally, in North Africa, the main threat appears to be trapping for exhibition or sale to tourists. Though restricted to marginal areas, new permanent human settlements such as those in southern Morocco have resulted in the disappearance of foxes in these areas (F. Cuzin pers. obs.).","They are common throughout the Sahara (Harrison and Bates 1991). The only documented regression concerns northern Moroccan Sahara, where the species disappeared during the 1960s from four localities, which were restricted sandy areas close to permanent human settlements (Asa and Cuzin 2013). Otherwise,&#160;the population is assumed to be adequate based on the observations that the Fennec is still commonly trapped and sold commercially in North Africa and was regularly encountered during field work in desert areas of Chad and Niger during 2010 and 2015. In southern Morocco, they are commonly seen in all sandy areas away from permanent human settlements (Asa and Cuzin 2013).&#160;In extensive opportunistic camera trapping studies across central Chad, Fennecs were the most frequently recorded species, present at 32 out of 94 widespread camera trapping locations north of 14.5°N ,with none recorded at 30 localities south of this line (M. Hassan, T. Wacher and J. Newby pers. comm. 2015)",Stable,"This species is widespread in the sandy deserts and semi-deserts of northern Africa, ranging from Western Sahara and Mauritania to northern Sinai (Asa <em>et al</em>. 2004, Asa and Cuzin 2013); it may occur south to around 14°N (Dragesco-Joffé 1993, Granjon <em>et al</em>. 1995). The species' expected range has been modelled from combined topographical-climatic and habitat variables (Brito <em>et al</em>. 2009). The occurrence of this species in the Arabian Peninsula (not mapped here) is unclear because of confusion with locally used names, and with the pale and large-eared young of the Arabian subspecies of Ruppell’s Fox, <em>V. rueppellii sabaea</em>&#160;(T. Wacher pers. obs). In these circumstances, records dependent on tracks (e.g., Thesiger 1949) are doubtful. There is a specimen from Kuwait in the Natural History Museum in London (Harrison and Bates 1991), though it is uncertain if this individual was collected from the wild. Another specimen was recorded from southern Iraq (Al-Robaae 1982), a short distance to the north. Mallon and Budd (2011) reported the results of interviews by Salah Behbehani that local communities in Kuwait had observed a species known under the local name ‘hosni fennec’, and that people used to catch them for the tails which were hung in their cars; they also referred to reported sightings and photographs (not yet published or reviewed) of the species from northwest Saudi Arabia, close to the documented range in Sinai, but in habitat more typical of Blanford’s Fox <em>V. cana</em>. References to sightings of Fennec Fox in the United Arab Emirates were based on an animal in the Al Ain zoo (Al-Robbae 1982), which was, in fact, a Rüppell's Fox (Gasperetti <em>et al</em>. 1985).","In Morocco and Tunisia, and presumably elsewhere, young foxes are sometimes captured for sale to tourists and for photographic exhibition; adults are sometimes taken for their fur (Asa and Cuzin 2013, B. d'Amicis pers. comm. 2015).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Legal protection</strong><br/>It is listed in CITES – Appendix II.

As of June 2014, there were 156 individuals in 42 AZA institutions (Knobbe 2014), and 130 in 50 EAZA institutions (Mekarska 2014), both in actively managed programmes. Although there is no studbook or formal species management programme for Fennecs in Australian zoos, there are 16 individuals living in five zoos managed by the ZAA, all of which descend from the AZA or EAZA populations. Fennecs are kept in private collections within the Middle East and are also bred privately in the United States where they are sometimes kept as pets, but these records are not available.&#160;<br/><br/>Since 2001, Fennec Fox populations have been managed in zoos for the purposes of captive breeding, research and education (Bauman <em>et al</em>. 2004, Bauman 2010, Van der Meer 2011). Captive populations are managed using genetic and demographic goals so that they are as self sustaining as possible. Research projects with Fennec Fox are varied; some are specific to the species itself since there is a dearth of data and Fennec Fox husbandry has been challenging, whereas other projects utilize the Fennec as a model for other foxes (Bauman <em>et al</em>. 2010). Basic work on nutrition (Dempsey <em>et al</em>. 2009) and disease (K. Ross, K. Bauman, A. Moresco, D. Agnew and C. Asa pers. comm. 2015) and husbandry (Mekarska 2006) has been completed. Genetic work, assessing the relatedness within the AZA and EAZA populations, using mtDNA haplotypes (blood) and microsatellites (blood and hair), also have been recently completed (J.A. Ivy, K. Bauman and C. Lynch, pers. comm. 2015, A. Mekarska pers. comm. 2015). In-depth studies of reproduction in Fennecs (Asa and Valdespino 1998,&#160;Asa and Valdespino&#160;2003, Asa <em>et al</em>. 2014, Valdespino <em>et al</em>. 2002) continue, along with new initiatives to documenting circadian rhythms using remote activity monitors, validation of a glucocorticoid assay, and the development of personality assessment tools. Many of these projects were recommended action items from the 2010 International Fox Husbandry Workshop. These projects have contributed greatly to our knowledge of Fennec Fox, but also help develop and validate techniques for use in other species such as the Darwin’s Fox, where there is interest in potentially setting up captive breeding facilities within Chile (K. Bauman, pers. obs.). Finally, in AZA, one-third of the Fennec Fox population are dedicated to educational roles. Fennec Foxes are charismatic and one of the few carnivore species available for this purpose. Zoo-based education programmes for Fennecs are varied, but include: 1) discussions about canid biology and ecology, 2) discussions about the differences between wolves, dogs and foxes, and 3) talking about desert adaptations and ecosystems.&#160;<br/><br/>There is tremendous opportunity for future work with Fennecs to be integrated along a continuum of <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> strategies under the emerging One Plan approach, a method of metapopulation management developed by International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)’s Conservation Breeding Specialist Group (Byers <em>et al</em>. 2013). This would facilitate discussion on all the various strategies and tools that could be utilized by&#160;<em>in situ</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>ex situ&#160;</em>managers, and provide opportunities for joint decisions and complimentary actions, thus making species-based conservation more effective and efficient.<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Gaps in knowledge</strong><br/>While studies of captive Fennec Fox have gone some way towards improving our knowledge of this little-known species, there is still a paucity of data regarding their basic ecology and behaviour in the wild. Thus, in 2009 the Saint Louis Zoo (USA) initiated a carnivore project in Niger to study Fennec Fox, Pale Fox <em>Vulpes pallida</em>&#160;and Ruppell’s Fox <em>Vulpes rueppellii</em>, as well as several other sympatric carnivores. Zoos from AZA and EAZA worked with the IUCN Canid Specialist Group, University of Oxford WildCRU, and the Sahara Conservation Fund on this first ever Fennec Fox field project; an excellent example of how zoos can directly fund and contribute to <em>in situ</em> efforts. &#160;Nonetheless, much remains unknown of the basic ecology and behaviour in the wild of Fennecs. The study in Niger was an important first step, yet further work is needed, and research on habitat use and population dynamics in the wild is overdue. No data are available regarding the impact from the increasing human presence within the Fennec range, and this should at minimum be monitored, but ideally future ecological studies should be designed such that data are collected from disturbed and non-disturbed sites to provide more information about human impacts.&#160;<br/><br/>A new study initiated in southern Morocco (formerly Western Sahara) in 2015, mainly targeted at <em>Felis margarita</em>, but investigating the whole guild of small carnivores (including the Fennec Fox) should contribute to further understanding of habitat use by Fennec Fox, movement patterns and interactions with other small carnivores (F. Cuzin pers. obs.).&#160;The recent deployment of a pilot long term camera trap study in north-western Saudi Arabia, coupled with follow up museum visits to establish the background of the two implicated museum specimens, should help resolve uncertainty about the status of Fennec in Arabian peninsula area (T. Wacher pers. obs.).",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

However the species has recovered from historical over-fishing in the 1970-1980s, and spawning biomass is increasing. The species is widely distributed and proved to be resilient to over-exploitation, and is considered Least Concern.","<strong>Habitat</strong><br/>This is a medium sized flatfish that is distributed in waters from less than 1 m down to c.100 m, although occasionally specimens may be found down to 500 m. Small fish are concentrated in shallow waters, while large fish occur in deeper waters. Found in sea water and in estuaries, rarely entering freshwaters.<br/><br/><strong>Biology</strong><br/>Spawns at sea, in January-June, in deep water, at temperatures of around 6°C. Eggs and larvae are pelagic and drift with current. At about 10 mm SL, left eye moves to right side, pigmentation develops, and juveniles switch to a benthic habit.<br/><br/>The maximum size is 90-100 cm (Muus and Nielsen 1999). The maximum age observed in the biological samples taken routinely in the North Sea since the 1950s are 30 years in females and 25 years in males (A.D. Rijnsdorp pers. comm. 2013). Age at maturation is 2-3 years in males and 4-5 years in females, with plaice from northern areas maturing at an older age and larger size than plaice from the south (Rijnsdorp 1989). Length and age at maturation has gradually reduced since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, most likely due to a fisheries-induced evolutionary change (Grift <em>et al. </em>2003, van Walraven <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/><br/>The species has a complex life cycle with life stages inhabiting specific and spatially segregated habitats (Wimpenny 1953). Spawning occurs in offshore waters (Harding <em>et al.</em> 1978, Nielsen<em> et al.</em> 2004, Fox <em>et al. </em>2000, Taylor e<em>t al. </em>2007). Eggs and larvae are pelagic until metamorphosis. At metamorphosis the larvae move to the sea bed and migrate to their nursery grounds in estuaries and along sandy coasts (Rijnsdorp <em>et al. </em>1985). Juveniles spend their first years of life in the coastal nurseries and gradually move to deeper waters. In the White Sea, juveniles enter freshwater to forage in mid-June in the Kanin Peninsula. Once mature, the animals migrate between spawning grounds and feeding areas (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2004, Bolle <em>et al. </em>2005). Juvenile plaice show a clear preference for fine sandy sediments, which allows them to bury in the sediment and hide for predators (Gibson 2005, Gibson and Robb 2000). The preference for sandy sediments remains during the entire lifespan, although older age groups may be found on coarser sand.<br/><br/>Plaice is a benthivore feeding on a variety of benthic invertebrates such as bivalves, polychaetes, crustaceans (e.g. amphipods, mysids and small shrimps). Large plaice feed on molluscs and sandeels (de Clerck and Buseyne 1989, Rijnsdorp and Vingerhoed 2001).<br/><br/>Due to the specific habitat requirements of the early demersal stages of plaice in combination with the relative small size of these habitats, nursery habitat may limit the population size that can occur in a specific sea area (Rijnsdorp<em> et al. </em>1992, Gibson 1994, van der Veer <em>et al.</em> 2000).","The species is currently recovering from over-exploitation, and spawning stock biomass shows an increasing trend over the last 5-10 years (ICES 2013).&#160;The species is mainly exploited in mixed fisheries using bottom trawls, and locally in a directed fisheries using gill nets. Substantial numbers of undersized plaice are caught in small meshed fisheries directed at brown shrimps, sole and Nephrops (ICES 2013).<br/><br/>Oil and gas exploitation occur in the distribution area of the species. Since the species critically depend on the size and quality of their nursery grounds, any anthropogenic activities that adversely impact nursery areas will have a negative impact on the species.","<strong>Populations</strong><br/>An abundant species.&#160;Population biomass is highest in the North Sea (Wimpenny 1953).<br/><br/><strong>Population trends</strong><br/>The species is exploited throughout its range.

Numbers continue to decline due to poaching and disturbance from oil exploration. Latest field surveys indicate that the species has probably already reached the threshold for Critically Endangered under criterion D (&lt;50 mature individuals).","The most desert-loving large ungulate, occurring in areas of extreme temperature and aridity (less than 100 mm annually) (Newby 2013). With the exception of truly mountainous areas, Addax have been recorded from all major habitat types in the Sahara, from gravelly and sandy plains, to dune fields, sandy basins and depressions, pans and wadi systems; their preference is for harder, packed sands and flatter areas within and between dune fields that support perennial vegetation (Newby 2013, and references therein).<br/><br/>Addax are nomadic, wandering over large areas in search of grazing. In the Sahel, movements tend to be north-south in direction, for example from the more arid desert to the less arid sub-desert and Sahel (Gillet 1965, Newby 1978). In central Niger, movement may also be east-west, for example from the open desert towards the better-wooded and more varied habitats of the Aïr and Termit mountains (Hue 1960). The Addax is well known for its utilisation of extremely desolate, inhospitable, and arid habitats (Dragesco-Joffé 1993).","The primary factor in the decline of Addax is uncontrolled hunting over many years, a process accelerating with the arrival of motor vehicles and modern weapons in the 20th century. Drought and the extension of pastoralism into desert lands, thanks to the increase in wells, have also taken a heavy toll, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s (Beudels-Jamar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Newby 2013). In recent years, the only near-viable population in Termit Tin Toumma NNR has been subject to disturbance by oil exploration and production and to shooting by their military escorts (Duncan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Finally, political instability in Libya has caused an increase in traffic in the core area of Addax distribution and a new kind of opportunistic hunting has been developed by traffickers (T. Rabeil pers. comm).","Although long extinct in North Africa, Addax were still present in fair numbers in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad up until the late 1960s and early 1970s (Newby 2013). In 2013 the total global population was estimated at probably fewer than 300 animals surviving in the wild, distributed unevenly along a narrow, 600-km-long band lying between Termit/Tin Toumma in Niger and the Djourab sand sea in Chad (Newby 2013).&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma appears to be&#160;the last&#160;viable population of Addax in the world, with ground and aerial surveys carried out in 2004&#160;indicating a population of around 200 individuals&#160;(Wacher&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Sightings of Addax have declined since 2007. During a field trip carried out in June 2015 by the Sahara Conservation  Fund&#160;in&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma, no animals were seen during a thorough survey including all the shade trees, and only footprints of around 25 adults and three  calves were found (SCF 2015a)&#160; An aerial survey in March 2016 located only three living animals; remains of Addax and Dorcas Gazelle were also found, left by poachers (Rabeil 2016). The remaining animals are assumed to have been destroyed or dispersed. It is highly probable that there are now &lt;100 Addax left in the wild,  and perhaps many fewer. The species is at serious risk of becoming  extinct in the wild.",Decreasing,"Addax were formerly widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley, and present in suitable habitats in all countries sharing the Sahara Desert (Newby 2013). As with other ungulates of the Sahelo-Saharan fauna, the Addax has undergone an unprecedented reduction in geographical range&#160;(up to 99%)&#160;over the past century (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2013). The only known remaining population thought to be viable survives in the Termit/Tin Toumma region of Niger. However, there are sporadic records of small isolated groups and individuals from eastern Aïr Mountains/Western Ténéré desert in Niger, and from the Djourab region of western Chad (Newby 2013). Possible rare vagrants from these areas may be seen in northern Niger, southern Algeria and Libya (Newby 2013). There have been rumours of Addax along the Mali/Mauritania border (Majabat Al Koubra), but no confirmed sightings for several years. In early March 2007, the fresh tracks of about 15 Addax were seen in central Mauritania, in an area where they had not been reported for over 20 years (R. Vernet in Newby 2013), but these reports have not been followed up and it is unclear whether any Addax survive in Mauritania.","<p>Addax are subject to&#160;uncontrolled hunting for their meat, horns and hide; and levels of&#160;poaching have increased by both the armed forces and the local&#160;community (SCF 2015b).<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"Listed on CMS (the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals) Appendix I and CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I, and included in the CMS Sahelo-Saharan Antelopes Action Plan (Beudels-Jamar <em>et al.</em> 2005).

50347659,2467,Balaena mysticetus,Least Concern,,2018,2018-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The global (pan-arctic) population of the Bowhead Whale appears to be increasing, due primarily to the well-documented increase in the large Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation (also known as the Western Arctic population or stock). The global population size, at over 25,000 animals, is well above the IUCN Red List Vulnerable threshold for a non-declining population. The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation (estimated to be over 16,000 and increasing at 3% per year or more) may have recovered to near or even above its level prior to commercial whaling. The East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation is estimated to exceed 4,000, and has probably been increasing but is still below its pre-whaling level. Bowhead Whale numbers in the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation remain at a small fraction of pre-whaling abundance with no estimate of trend. The main reduction in the global population occurred before the three-generation time window that would trigger the Red List population reduction (A) criterion. The East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea and Okhotsk Sea  subpopulations have separate Red List assessments, in addition to being included in this global assessment.</p>  <p>  </p>","Small to medium-sized crustaceans, especially krill and copepods, form the bulk of the Bowhead Whale diet (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pomerleau <em>et al</em>. 2011). Bowheads also commonly feed on mysids and gammarid amphipods, and the diet includes at least 60 species (Lowry 1993).<br/><br/>The seasonal distribution of Bowhead Whales is strongly influenced by prey availability and pack ice conditions (Moore and Reeves 1993). During the winter, they occur within areas of sea ice (Stafford <em>et al.</em> 2012) and appear to feed mainly near the bottom (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). During the spring, they use leads and cracks in the ice to penetrate areas that were inaccessible during the winter due to heavy ice coverage. During the summer and autumn, they concentrate in areas where zooplankton production is high or where large-scale biophysical processes create local concentrations of calanoid copepods (Finley 1990, Finley <em>et al</em>. 2000) and appear to feed mainly in mid-water and near the surface (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Pacific Arctic, six feeding hotspots have been identified including two in the Bering Sea and one in the Chukchi Sea along the northern coast of Chukotka where there is evidence of winter feeding, and three in the Beaufort Sea where most of the feeding occurs in summer and autumn (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The Bowhead Whale may be the longest-living mammal, possibly capable of living for over 200 years (George <em>et al.</em> 1999, Keane <em>et al. </em>2015, Wetzel <em>et al.</em> 2017). Nearly all life history data come from the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas population. Female age at sexual maturity is estimated at 18-33 years (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2013). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated the mean generation time for Bowhead Whales to be about 52 years, assuming an age at first reproduction of 20 years. Females give birth every 3-7 years (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 1992) and calves are weaned at 9-12 months of age (Koski <em>et al. </em>1993).<p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Extensive commercial hunting, beginning in the 1500s, depleted Bowhead Whales throughout their range. Commercial whaling for the species has been prohibited under international conventions since the 1930s. The limited subsistence whaling by indigenous communities  mentioned above has not impeded the recovery of the affected populations.</p><p>Accidental human-caused deaths are relatively few. During 2010-15, two dead-stranded and one live Bowhead were observed to be entangled with fishing gear but it was unclear whether the entanglement was the cause of death. Of the Bowhead Whales taken in Alaskan hunts during 1990-2012, 12% showed scars or wounds from fishing gear and 2% showed scars or wounds from ship strikes (George <em>et al.</em> 2017a).</p>  <p>There has been concern since the 1970s that disturbance from oil and gas exploration and extraction activities in the Arctic region would affect Bowhead Whales. Effects on diving behavior (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2013) and calling rates (Blackwell <em>et al.</em> 2015) in the vicinity of seismic surveys have been observed, but to date there has been no discernible population-level impact. Examination of whales taken in subsistence hunts off Alaska since 1980 found relatively low levels of morbidity, which would be consistent with an increasing population and good individual animal health (George <em>et al</em>. 2017b).</p>  <p>During this century, a profound reduction in the extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic has occurred and this reduction is predicted to continue, possibly leading eventually to the complete disappearance of sea ice in summer as mean Arctic temperatures rise faster than the global average (Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The short-term effects of reduced ice cover on Bowhead Whales in the western Arctic appear to be positive, due to increased feeding opportunities (George <em>et al</em>. 2015, Moore 2016). However, the long-term effects are less clear. The emergence of Bowheads as a separate, ice-adapted species may have coincided with the appearance of sea ice in the late Pliocene, and Bowheads could lose out to non-ice-adapted species in the long term, but no projections of the time scale of such an eventuality are available (Harington 2008, IWC 2016).&#160; </p>  <p>There is also concern that, as the sea ice diminishes, the opening up of the Arctic to increased vessel traffic, fishing activities, and extractive industries will increase human-caused impacts on Bowhead Whales (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014).&#160; </p>","<em><strong>Current Population sizes</strong></em><br/>The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation is estimated to have numbered 16,900 (15,700-18,900) in 2011 from shore/ice-based counts (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2016) or&#160;19,000 (12,400-28,500) from photo-identification capture-recapture (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160; Numbers in the East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation are estimated at 4,000-10,500 in 2013 from aerial surveys (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al.</em> 2015) or 4,500-11,000 in 2008-12 from genetic mark-recapture (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Given the increasing trend in the large Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation, the total range-wide population likely exceeds 25,000 individuals. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation is estimated to be only about 200, and the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation probably also numbers in the hundreds (see separate listings).<strong><em><br/> <br/> <strong>Population trends<br/></strong></em></strong>The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation has been monitored for more than 30 years and has been increasing over that period at an estimated annual rate of 3.7% (range 2.8–5.4%) in the presence of subsistence hunting (Givens <em>et al. </em>2016). The East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation has probably also been increasing. Based on aerial surveys and genetic capture-recapture, Rekdal <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that the number of Bowhead Whales using West Greenland waters in the winter-spring period increased from 1998 to 2006 and has levelled off since then. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation may be declining (Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2017). No estimates of trend are available for the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation.<strong><em><br/><br/>Pre-whaling population sizes</em></strong><em></em><br/>Commercial whaling for Bowhead Whales in the Bering Sea began in 1848 and expanded rapidly, depleting the worldwide population (Bockstoce and Burns 1993). Brandon and Wade (2006) estimated the initial abundance of the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation at 10–20,000. Using a different kind of population model, Witting (2013) estimated pre-whaling abundance to be 13-24,000. Therefore, the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation appears to have reached or exceeded estimates of its size prior to commercial whaling. All models indicate that the population reached a minimum size around 1914.<br/><br/>Basque whalers took Bowhead Whales in the northwestern Atlantic in the 16th century, but ambiguities over the species identity of whales taken in early commercial whaling have made interpretation of old catch records difficult. Genetic analysis of bones from 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century shore stations in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St Lawrence found that, contrary to previous assumptions, almost all bones were from Bowhead Whales rather than North Atlantic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena glacialis</em>) (Macleod <em>et al.</em> 2008). This suggests that 25-40,000 Bowhead Whales were taken in the eastern Canadian Arctic by Basque whalers during 1530-1610, followed by approximately 28,000 during the pelagic whaling phase during 1719-1915 (Ross, 1993).<br/><br/>The pre-whaling size of the East Canada – West Greenland population was thus probably at least 25,000, well above the likely current level.The pre-whaling size of the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea population has been estimated to be 33,000-65,000 using a simple population model (Allen and Keay 2006) applied to historical catch data from Dutch, German, and British sources compiled by de Jong (1983). The current population size, therefore, is a small fraction of the pre-whaling size.  The pre-whaling population size in the Okhtosk Sea has been variously estimated as between 3,000 and 20,000 depending on assumptions about past catches (Ivashchenko and Clapham 2010). The current population size is a small fraction of those estimates.",Increasing,"<p>Bowhead Whales are found only in Arctic and subarctic regions. Until recently they have spent much of their lives in and near sea ice and they migrate seasonally to avoid ice entrapment and to take advantage of food concentrations (Moore and Reeves 1993). With the reduction of sea ice cover, Bowhead Whales now occur increasingly in open water during the summer (Moore 2016).<br/> <br/> The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has traditionally recognized five stocks named for the regions in which Bowheads occur: Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas; Hudson Bay – Foxe Basin; Davis Strait – Baffin Bay; Svalbard – Barents Sea (Spitsbergen); and Okhotsk Sea (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 2003). Movements of tagged Bowheads indicating somewhat overlapping ranges, and lack of clear genetic differences, has discredited the traditional distinction between the Hudson Bay – Foxe Basin and the Davis Strait – Baffin Bay populations (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2006, Postma <em>et al.</em> 2006, Alter <em>et al.</em> 2012, IWC 2012). Four main subpopulations are now recognized: Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas; East Canada – West Greenland; East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea; and Okhotsk Sea. The boundary between the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas and Eastern Canada – West Greenland subpopulations is liable to become more porous as sea ice cover diminishes (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>With the exception of the Okhotsk Sea, genetic divergence between Bowhead Whales in different parts of their range appears to be low, and there is some evidence of movement between the main areas of occurrence (IWC 2013). The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation appears to be genetically and geographically isolated.</p>  <p>Based on direct observations and telemetry, the summer range of the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation extends from Chaunskaya Guba (Russian Federation) in the western Chukchi Sea through the Beaufort Sea and east to Amundsen Gulf (Canada) and Viscount Melville Sound (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Most of the whales appear to migrate into the Bering Sea in winter (IWC 2013, Quakenbush <em>et al.</em> 2012, Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, substantial catches were also taken in summer in the Bering Sea,&#160;but the climatic conditions were quite different then than at the present (IWC 2013) </p>  <p>Bowhead Whales belonging to the East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation are observed in Hudson Bay, Foxe Basin, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, Gulf of Boothia, Prince Regent Inlet, and other waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Tracking of satellite-tagged whales has confirmed movements from Foxe Basin through Fury and Hecla Strait into the Gulf of Boothia and Prince Regent Inlet, and from Cumberland Sound into Prince Regent Inlet, Gulf of Boothia, Foxe Basin, and Hudson Strait, while animals tagged in West Greenland moved to Prince Regent Inlet and Hudson Strait (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2012). The whales move out of the summering areas as ice forms in autumn to wintering areas in polynyas (Holst and Stirling 1999), unconsolidated pack ice, and open water near the ice edge off West Greenland (Reeves and Heide-Jørgensen 1996) and eastern Baffin Island. Sightings and strandings have occurred in recent years in the western North Atlantic as far south as Newfoundland (Ledwell <em>et al.</em> 2007) and the Gulf of Maine (Accardo <em>et al.</em> in press).</p>  The East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation occurs from the east coast of Greenland across the Greenland Sea, including the Northeast Water polynya off northeastern Greenland, in the Barents Sea, in the Franz Josef Land Archipelago, and in the Kara Sea at least as far as far as Severnaya Zemlya. There have also been sightings further south, exceptionally reaching Iceland and the coast of Finnmark. Vagrants have been observed as far south as the western British Isles and France (de Boer <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation occurs in the northern and western Sea of Okhotsk from Shantarskiye Zaliv east to Zaliv Shelikova, Gizhiginskaya Guba, and Penzhinskaya Guba (Moore and Reeves 1993,&#160;Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is no evidence of migration into or out of the Okhotsk Sea.","<p></p><p></p><p>Limited subsistence whaling on the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation by indigenous people of Alaska and Chukotka is permitted by the IWC on the basis of advice from its Scientific Committee (under its aboriginal subsistence whaling management procedure). Small&#160;hunts are also authorized in Canadian waters under co-management agreements between federal agencies and indigenous communities, and in West Greenland under the IWC management procedure. The reported average annual take in Alaska and Chukotka during 2006-15 was about 55 animals struck of which about 75% were successfully landed (Allison 2017, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>",Marine,"<p>Bowhead Whales were legally protected from commercial whaling under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) since its entry into force in 1948, and by its predecessor the Convention on the Regulation of Whaling since the 1930s. All range states except Canada are parties to the ICRW. Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling of Bowhead Whales is allowed by the IWC (the regulatory body established under the ICRW) from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock and off West Greenland on the basis of scientific advice (see <em>Threats</em> section). Hunting by indigenous people in Canada is co-managed by the federal government and regional bodies created under land-claim agreements. The Bowhead Whale has been included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Appendix I since 1975 and it is listed on the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals Appendix I. Bowhead Whales are managed under national threatened species legislation in the U.S.A., Canada, and the Russian Federation.</p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Recent research indicates a relatively large population at the southern limit of the species range: estimated population size is 6,345 individuals (95% CI 3,573–11,267) along ~ 390 km of coastline from Table Bay to Lambert’s Bay (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009), with further unpublished research indicating similar population densities at two sites in Namibia (Elwen unpublished data). Thus, it can be inferred that there are certainly &gt;1,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The species does not appear to clearly meet any of the Red List Criteria for a threatened status. However, there is considerable uncertainty around both population structure and total population size and there is no information on trend. Several threats have been identified, including entanglement in a variety of inshore fishing gears (e.g., beach seines, purse seines, trawls, and gillnets). Additionally, competition with Hake (<em>Merluccius</em> spp.) fisheries may represent an indirect threat, as although Heaviside’s Dolphins remain largely inshore of the fishing activity, juvenile hake are significant prey. Potentially emerging threats include an experimental mid-water trawl fishery for Horse Mackerel (<em>Trachurus capensis</em>) operating off the west coast of South Africa and industrial development, notably marine phosphate mining on the Namibian shelf, and port and mining infrastructure expansion projects in both Walvis Bay and Lüderitz, two high-density areas for Heaviside’s Dolphins. As this species is limited by water temperature, climate change represents an additional emerging threat.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Guidelines state that “if LC, NT, and VU are considered to be equally plausible categories, the taxon may be categorized as NT.” In the absence of quantitative data from areas outside the Table Bay–Lambert’s Bay segment of coastline, the possibility that there are &lt;10,000 mature individuals cannot be ruled out, nor can a projected continuing decline of at least 10% over three generations given the known and emerging threats. Therefore, it is plausible that the species meets criterion C for VU but it is also plausible that number of mature individuals in unstudied parts of the range would push the total above 10,000. As a near-shore species with a very restricted range in a poorly studied region, Heaviside’s Dolphin is considered Near Threatened. This lends emphasis to the importance of quantifying mortality rates and improving estimates of abundance for the total species range.</p>","<p>Heaviside’s Dolphin is a coastal, shelf-dwelling species seen mainly in waters less than 100 m deep (Best and Abernethy 1994) throughout the cold, northward-flowing Benguela Current. More than 85% of sightings have been in water with surface temperatures of 9-15°C (Best and Abernethy 1994). Evidence from photo-identification (Elwen 2008, Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b) and satellite-linked tagging (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2014) indicated small home ranges between 50 and 80 km along shore, but with some animals also moving offshore to at least the 100 m isobath.<br/><br/>Throughout most of their range, Heaviside’s Dolphins show a strong diurnal <span class=""msoIns"">i<span class=""msoDel"">nshore-offshore movement pattern (Elwen <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2010) driven by resting and socializing inshore by day and nocturnal foraging in deep water on prey associated with the deep scattering layer. The dominant prey taken by Heaviside’s Dolphins are shallow-water species or life-stages, for example juvenile Hake (<em>Merluccius capensis</em>), Goby (<em>Sufflogobius bibartus</em>) and Horse Mackerel, as well as cephalopods, including octopus (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 1992). Most fish eaten by Heaviside’s Dolphins are well below the modal length of commercially caught fish (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 1992), and there is little spatial overlap in fishing effort and dolphin habitat (Fairweather <em>et al.</em> 2006).</span></p>","<p>In general, Heaviside’s Dolphins appear to face fewer threats than other members of its genus. Although fully protected legally, some killing with hand-thrown harpoons or guns was reported in the past (Rice and Saayman 1984, Best and Abernethy 1994). Heaviside’s Dolphins are susceptible to entanglement in inshore fishing gears such as beach seines, purse seines, trawls, and gillnets (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Bycatch in commercial fisheries appears to be low, although an experimental mid-water trawl fishery for Horse Mackerel operating off the South Africa west coast is of concern. Heaviside’s Dolphin bycatch must be monitored and the potential effects of the full-scale operation should be considered if there is evidence of significant mortality of dolphins in this fishery.<br/><br/>Information on organochlorine pollutant levels in a small sample of Heaviside’s Dolphins from the South African west coast indicated no significant exposure to DDT (De Kock <em>et al</em>. 1994). A more recent analysis of heavy metals in the skin of Heaviside’s Dolphins from South Africa and Namibia revealed that while levels were higher than expected for some metals, sampled individuals were deemed to be at low risk of lethal poisoning (Serot 2013). The scarcity of arable land, low rainfall and scarcity of rivers throughout the species range may help to limit pollutants entering the marine environment.<br/><br/>The impacts of marine mining, notably sediment dredging for phosphates, on the marine environment are not well understood but include direct destruction of the seabed and benthic fauna, release of hazardous material into the ocean, and reduced light penetration (Currie 2012). In addition, proposed onshore processing plants, at least in Namibia, are in or near known high use areas for the species at the ports of Walvis Bay and Lüderitz.<br/><br/>Due to the limited range of temperatures occupied by the animals within the Benguela Ecosystem (a cold-water system surrounded by warmer waters), Heaviside’s Dolphins have been identified as one of the cetacean species most at risk from large perturbations associated with global climate change (MacLeod 2009).<br/><br/>Low human population densities and the scarcity of large ports along most of the species’ range probably help reduce adverse effects from boat traffic at a population level, although high site fidelity of the species may result in localized impacts.</p>","<p>No range-wide survey has been conducted for Heaviside's Dolphins. However, abundance estimates from photographic mark-recapture studies are available at several locations in South Africa and Namibia. A three-year study between Cape Town and Lambert’s Bay, South Africa estimated 527 animals (95% confidence interval (CI) 272–1,020) using 20 km of coastline in western Saint Helena Bay over six weeks of survey effort; 3,429 animals (95% CI 1,721–6,828), using the 150 km of coastline around Saint Helena Bay, over three summer seasons; and 6,345 animals (95% CI 3,573–11,267) using the full ~390 km of coastline from Table Bay to Lambert’s Bay (estimated between two summer field seasons; Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b). Sighting rates within this latter area ranged from 0 to nearly 2 groups per km (mean group size = 4.5, for 10 km long sections of coastline; Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Estimates are also available from two high-use areas in Namibia (Walvis Bay: 508 animals, 95% CI 461–833, over eight weeks; and Lüderitz: 494 animals, 95% CI 403–607, 14 survey days within one year).<br/><br/>The species has exhibited high site fidelity over several years (Elwen <em>et al.</em> 2009b) and this may affect population structure and limit gene flow between high-density sites. An assessment of genetic diversity and population genetic structure was conducted for this species using both mtDNA control region sequences and 13 microsatellite loci using 395 biopsy skin samples collected from free-ranging dolphins along the South African (Table Bay, Saint Helena Bay, Lambert’s Bay, Hondeklipbaai, and Port Nolloth) and Namibian (Lüderitz and Walvis Bay) coastlines. Both genetic markers rejected the hypothesis of one homogeneous population, but results were somewhat contrasting. MtDNA control region data indicated six genetically differentiated putative populations among the seven sampling sites, with Hondeklipbaai and Port Nolloth grouping as one subpopulation, whilst the microsatellite data provided a different, but not mutually exclusive, signal, clustering the dolphins into a northern population (comprised of Lambert’s Bay, Hondeklipbaai, Port Nolloth, Lüderitz Bay, and Walvis Bay) and a southern population that included the animals in Table Bay and St. Helena Bay (Gopal 2014). Overall, there appear to be two primary populations (northern and southern), but within each there is some limited structure suggesting that gene flow is not entirely open between sites. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution of the mitochondrial sequences indicated a departure from mutation-drift equilibrium due to a population expansion at the two extremes of the geographic range, but not towards the middle of the distribution. Small but significant genetic differentiation was indicated by the two markers (Gopal 2014). Whilst considerable progress was made towards understanding the population genetic structure of Heaviside's dolphins in this first study that covered a large geographic range, further genetic research, including information on relatedness, kin associations, and mating patterns, would improve understanding of population status and facilitate identification of management units for conservation.</p>",Unknown,"Heaviside’s Dolphins have a limited range, restricted to southwestern Africa (southern Angola to Cape Point, South Africa), with records from about 17°S to the southwestern tip of the continent. They are commonly seen along the west coast of South Africa in the Cape Town region (Rice 1998, Dawson 2002). Records extend along the entire west coast of South Africa and Namibia, and into southern Angola (Best 2007), with the exact northern limit of the species range poorly known, but possibly variable due to natural fluctuations in water temperature at the northern end of the Benguela ecosystem.","Some illegal hunting has been reported, but it is probably not at a significant level (Best and Abernethy 1994, Best 2007). There is presently no known trade in the region, although some localized, illegal hunting or opportunistic use of by-caught animals may still take place on the South African west coast. No data are available on directed catches or bycatch in Angola.",Marine,"<p></p><p></p><p>Heaviside’s Dolphins are  listed in Appendix II of the Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species.<br/> <br/> More information is needed on the distribution of the species in Angolan waters in particular, as well as on the nature and extent of incidental catches. More research emphasis should in future also be placed on possible detrimental interactions due to the overfishing of prey stocks, especially Hake. Increased inshore fishing pressure will inevitably increase interactions between the fisheries and Heaviside’s Dolphins (Peddemors 1999).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Combining the most current abundance estimates for the various subpopulations results in a total of more than 195,000 whales. Given that there are no estimates for most of the Russian High Arctic, total abundance is likely more than 200,000. At least four subpopulations number more than 20,000 individuals. Some subpopulations are reduced below historical levels and some small subpopulations are declining but data are not adequate to assess overall population reduction or trend. As a species, Beluga Whales do not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and are listed as Least Concern.</p>  <p>Belugas in Cook Inlet have been assessed by IUCN as a separate subpopulation and are classified on the Red List as Critically Endangered (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2012). Several other subpopulations are small, declining, and/or occupy restricted areas, and warrant Red List assessment at the subpopulation level.</p>","Belugas are relatively well-studied as a result of carcass sampling conducted in association with hunting (Heide-Jørgensen and Teilmann 1994, Suydam 2009) along with a considerable amount of satellite-linked radio-tracking (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005), and aerial survey efforts (Moore, 2000, Belikov and Boltunov 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/> Belugas occupy estuaries, continental shelf and slope waters, and deep  ocean basins in conditions of open water, loose ice, and heavy pack ice  (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). In summer, they are found in coastal waters as shallow as 1–3 m deep and also in offshore waters thousands of meters deep. They typically enter estuaries and sometimes move upstream into rivers; there are records of individuals or small groups ranging hundreds of kilometers from the sea (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Belugas generally prefer to overwinter in areas with light or highly moveable ice cover (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2001, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017) and may occur as fully Arctic subpopulations (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998b, <em></em> 2001; Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or Subarctic subpopulations (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> Some Belugas undertake large-scale annual migrations between summering and wintering sites (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while others remain in the same area year-round, shifting offshore only when excluded from coastal habitat by fast-ice formation (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). Large numbers of migratory Belugas occur along the northwestern and northern Alaskan coast, in the Canadian high Arctic, and in western Hudson Bay. At certain times of the year, those whales migrate thousands of kilometers, in some cases as far as 80°N into dense pack ice (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or thousands of kilometers into the North Water polynya or to the pack ice off West Greenland (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). In some areas, beluga distribution appears to be determined by sea ice extent, with belugas shifting offshore during low-ice years to maintain associations with the marginal ice zone (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Non-migratory Belugas that generally make seasonal shifts in distribution of less than a few hundred kilometers are found in Cook Inlet, Cumberland Sound, Svalbard, and the St. Lawrence Estuary (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Kingsley 2002, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> While the general features of Beluga Whale habitat can be described for the relatively well-studied subpopulations, the importance of those features is not well understood (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). For example, the summer occupation of nearshore/estuarine waters has been ascribed alternatively to feeding (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1982), to warm water providing a thermal advantage to neonates (Sergeant and Brodie 1969), and to the presence of fresh water and coarse substrates facilitating skin shedding during molt (St. Aubin <em>et al</em>. 1990, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993). The relative importance of each of those factors likely varies according to the environmental conditions (e.g., water temperatures and prey availability) specific to each of the summering areas (Frost and Lowry 1990). Similarly, it is unclear why Belugas sometimes move into deep, ice-covered waters (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2016). One potential reason would be to avoid predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992). However, movements into the ice appear excessive for what would be needed to avoid Killer Whales (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and actually could expose Belugas to predation by Polar Bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987) as well as increase the risk of entrapment in the ice. It is possible that Belugas move into ice-covered offshore regions for feeding, primarily on Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), but few data are available to test this hypothesis (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, the associations of Belugas with features such as the continental shelf break and slope (Moore 2000, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017) may be related to biophysical processes that produce good feeding conditions (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/> <br/> Beluga dives may last more than 20 minutes and can reach depths of more than 900 m (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Beluga has a diverse diet, which varies greatly from area to area. Although various species of fish are considered to be the primary prey items (including Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.), Herring (<em>Clupea </em>spp.), and Arctic Cod), Belugas also feed on a wide variety of mollusks (such as squid and octopus) and benthic crustaceans (shrimps and crabs) (Quakenbush <em>et al</em>. 2015, Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas throughout their Arctic range (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992).","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease. Belugas are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance varies among the many Beluga subpopulations.</p><p>Hunting for human consumption is the biggest known threat to Belugas  across certain portions of their range. The most immediate concerns  relate to continuing harvests from small and depleted subpopulations (IWC  2000). The strong philopatry of Belugas, which causes them to return to  the same estuaries year after year, makes them highly vulnerable to  overexploitation. This behavioural trait is undoubtedly the most  important natural factor that has led to the extirpation of Belugas from  some parts of their range by a combination of commercial and  subsistence hunting (e.g., in southwestern Greenland and some river  mouths in Ungava Bay, Canada). In nearly all regions hunting is now  being controlled by limiting takes to sustainable levels (see  the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section).<br/> </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial reduction in the seasonal extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as changes in timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Belugas occur only in regions where sea ice occurs at least seasonally, suggesting a strong connection with sea ice influenced habitat. However, Belugas from some subpopulations spend many months in open water far from any ice while others spend most of their time in regions with sea ice concentrations up to 90%, indicating that the species as a whole has substantial flexibility in its relationships with ice (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). Belugas that occupy ice covered areas may do so for feeding on abundant ice-associated species such as Arctic Cod (<em></em>Loseto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Changes in the distribution and characteristics of sea ice will result in changes in productivity and prey species types and abundance (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008, Haug <em>et al</em>. 2017) but the potential costs or benefits to Belugas of such changes are not known. Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992) and it is generally assumed that concentrated sea ice provides Belugas some degree of refuge from predation. There is good evidence that Killer Whales are expanding their range in Arctic regions where sea ice has been declining (Higdon and Ferguson 2009, Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Belugas are susceptible to entrapment when sea ice conditions change rapidly and if they cannot escape they may die or be preyed upon by Polar Bears <em></em> and/or humans (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/></p>  <p>Known or potential threats include a variety of human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is allowing increases in the scale and distribution of some of those activities in areas previously covered with heavy ice. Ongoing and expanding oil and gas development, along with commercial shipping, is likely to impact habitats used by Belugas. Such impacts may be especially acute in shipping routes such as the Northwest Passage which traverses much of the summering habitat of belugas in Canada and Greenland (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas such as the Mackenzie Delta, West Greenland, and the Barents Sea are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which may include seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by icebreaking and shipping. Much of this activity is undertaken in the summer months in the same areas occupied by Belugas. In a study of responses of Belugas to icebreaking ships, the whales typically moved rapidly along ice edges away from approaching ships and showed strong avoidance reactions to approaching ships at distances of 35–50 km (Finley <em>et al</em>. 1990, Erbe and Farmer 2000). Expansion of commercial fisheries into new Arctic regions may have implications for bycatch of Belugas in fishing gear and depletion of Beluga prey resources. Construction of dams for hydroelectric development in the Hudson Bay area and along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence may have affected Belugas because of their dependence on estuarine conditions (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p> Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants from those sources that are high enough to cause impacts on health (Ross 2000). Threats from contaminants are of concern for Belugas in some areas. High levels of several contaminants have been found in Belugas sampled in the Canadian Arctic (Braune <em>et al</em>. 2005). Studies of the SLE Beluga subpopulation have found that concentrations of both total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated PCB congeners are much higher than in Belugas in the Arctic. Some scientists believe that the increased occurrence of opportunistic bacterial infections, parasitic infestation, gastric ulcers and other disorders in SLE Belugas is evidence of a link between immune system dysfunction and PCB exposure (Martineau <em>et al</em>., 1994). SLE Belugas also have elevated tissue levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (flame retardants) (Lebeuf <em>et al</em>. 2004). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Belugas are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2005). Significant epizootics have not been recorded in Belugas, but serological screenings document pathogen exposure (e.g., Alekseev <em>et al</em>. 2009) and necropsies find a variety of health issues (e.g., Martineau <em>et al</em>. 1988). Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. (2016) found low level exposure to biotoxins (domoic acid 2 of 15 tested and saxitoxin 1 of 12 tested) in Beluga samples from Cook Inlet. A mass mortality event in summer 2008 in the SLE, which included several Belugas, was linked to an intense bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate <em>Alexandrium tamarense</em> (Starr <em>et al.</em> 2017).  Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could impact disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p>The global Beluga population consists of multiple subpopulations with varying degrees of differentiation and abundance (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to the lack of sampling, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee organized information on Belugas on the basis of 29 provisional management stocks (IWC 2000), and a recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 21 stocks (NAMMCO in prep.).<br/></p>    <p>Stocks are generally based on nearshore areas (principally fjords, bays, and estuaries) where Belugas congregate during part of the open water season. Satellite telemetry, genetic studies, and organochlorine analyses have shown that Belugas have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2002; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, de March <em>et al</em>. 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Palsbøll <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some stock boundaries overlap spatially and seasonally during winter and during the spring and fall migrations (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014). For stocks that winter in the Bering Sea, limited satellite tracking data suggest that areas used generally do not overlap in the same year, suggesting that Belugas from different stocks have traditional winter ranges that are mostly exclusive (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/></p>  <p>While good abundance estimates are available for some Beluga subpopulations, the sizes of others are virtually unknown or only roughly approximated (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Available information is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Okhotsk Sea</strong></p>  <p>Belugas occur in two well-separated regions of the Okhotsk Sea.<em> </em>In the northeastern region, they summer along the coast and in estuaries of Shelikhov Bay and winter along the ice edge of the Bay and northwestern Kamchatka.<em> </em>Based on surveys in 2010, Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated there were 1,333 surface-visible Belugas in the northeastern Okhotsk Sea, resulting in an estimate of 2,666 total whales when corrected for availability bias (animals not seen because they were diving). In the western Okhotsk Sea, Belugas occur in the northern Sakhalin Bay and Amur River region as well as several smaller bays along the Shantar coast (Ulbansky Bay, Udskaya Bay, Tugursky Bay and Nikolskaya Bay.<em> </em>There Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated 4,780 visible Belugas and 9,560 in total. The population trend is unknown in both regions. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Alaska and Western Canada</strong></p>  <p>Five subpopulations of Belugas are known to occur in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. All five winter in the Bering Sea (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations migrate northward in spring and spend summer and early fall well north of Bering Strait (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while the Bristol Bay, Anadyr Gulf, and eastern Bering Sea subpopulations remain in the Bering Sea south of Bering Strait (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2016, NAMMCO in prep., Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC) unpublished data). </p>  <p>Bristol Bay Belugas have been counted using aerial surveys conducted periodically between 1993 and 2016.<em> </em>Correction factors to account for animals missed were applied to counts made in 2004 and 2005 (Lowry <em>et al. </em>2008) which produced an abundance estimate of 2,887 whales (Muto <em>et al. </em>2016).<em> </em>Similar correction factors applied to the 2016 count resulted in a population estimate of 3,166 whales (ABWC unpublished data). Lowry <em>et al. </em>(2008) reported that counts of Bristol Bay Belugas increased by 4.8% per year during 1993-2005 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–7.5%). The estimate based on 2016 counts was similar to 2004/05 suggesting that the increasing population trend had leveled off (ABWC unpublished data). </p>  <p>Belugas in Anadyr Gulf have never been surveyed adequately. An analysis of Beluga sightings obtained opportunistically during a survey for Pacific Walruses (<em>Odobenus rosmarus divergens</em>) conducted in the western Bering Sea in April 2006 estimated 15,125 Belugas in the area (with availability correction factor applied). However, the survey did not cover all areas known to be used by Anadyr Belugas, and it is possible that individuals from other subpopulations were also in the survey area. The maximum count along the coast in Anadyr Bay was 241 whales, and expert opinion suggests that the total Anadyr subpopulation is about 3,000 whales with fairly stable abundance (NAMMCO in prep.). </p>  <p>Aerial surveys for Belugas were flown in the eastern Bering Sea periodically during 1992-2001. Data collected in 2000 were used in distance sampling analysis that resulted in an estimate of 3,497 surface-visible Belugas in the survey area. The total abundance estimate was 6,994 whales (95% CI 3,162-15,472) when a correction factor for availability was applied (Lowry <em>et al</em>. in press). There are currently no data with which to estimate population trend, but another survey of the subpopulation was conducted in 2017. </p>  <p>Early estimates of the size of the eastern Chukchi Sea Beluga stock relied on June-July counts of whales in and near coastal lagoons with correction factors applied to account for animals missed.<em> </em>Those studies resulted in abundance estimates of roughly 2,000-4,000 whales (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1988, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>Subsequent tagging of whales with satellite depth recorders (SDRs) showed that during summer they had a very broad distribution, including considerable time spent in offshore areas where they were missed during coastal lagoon surveys (Suydam 2009). Further analysis of SDR data from eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea Belugas (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014) showed there is a date range and region where data from offshore marine mammal surveys (Aerial Surveys of Alaskan Marine Mammals (ASAMM); Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2013) could be used to estimate abundance of the eastern Chukchi subpopulation.<em> </em>That analysis (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2017) estimated there were 5,547 (CV 0.22) surface-visible Belugas in the study area in 2012. Data from SDRs were used to develop correction factors to account for animals that were missed because they were outside of the study area or diving too deep to be seen, resulting in a total abundance estimate of 20,752 whales (CV 0.70). Trend in abundance is unknown but there are several other years of ASAMM survey data that could be analyzed to look for changes over time. <br/></p>  <p>The most recent estimate of abundance for the eastern Beaufort Sea Beluga stock is 39,258 whales (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>This number was derived from aerial surveys conducted in the Mackenzie Delta and eastern Beaufort Sea in 1992 that estimated 19,629 (CV 0.23) surface visible Belugas (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 1996) and a correction factor to account for submerged whales.<em> </em>Synoptic surveys for Belugas were conducted in the region only in 1992, but Beluga sightings were recorded during offshore Bowhead Whale (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) surveys in 1982, 1984, 1985, and 2007-09. The number of Belugas counted at the surface was substantially higher during the 2007-09 surveys but it is unclear whether this was due to a shift in distribution or population increase (Harwood and Kingsley 2013). <br/></p>  <p>An isolated subpopulation of Belugas occurs in Cook Inlet, Alaska where they reside throughout the year (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005, Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2012, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Sightings are occasionally made outside of Cook Inlet in the Gulf of Alaska (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2000), and there is a small group (&lt; 20 animals) that is apparently resident in Yakutat Bay approximately 600 km to the east (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is considered to be part of the Cook Inlet stock (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Beluga abundance in the Inlet, including corrections for availability and sightability, is determined using aerial counts and video analysis of whale groups (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2000). The 2014 survey produced an estimate of 340 whales (CV 0.08; Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<em> </em>Abundance declined by nearly 50% between 1988 and 1994, and by about 1.3%/year during 1994-2014 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2015, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Canada and Greenland</strong></p><p>There are currently three main population centers for Belugas in Arctic Canada, High Arctic-Baffin Bay (HA-BB), Cumberland Sound, and Hudson Bay. A subpopulation that once occurred in southwest Greenland in winter is likely extirpated (NAMMCO in prep.). HA-BB Belugas summer mostly in nearshore waters around Somerset Island (Koski and Davis 1980, Smith and Martin 1994) and winter in northern Baffin Bay and off West Greenland (Doidge and Finley 1993, Heide-Jørgensen and Laidre 2004). An aerial survey of the Canadian High Arctic in summer 1996 produced an availability-adjusted abundance estimate of 21,213 whales (95% CI 10,985-32,619; Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>A 2012 winter survey off West Greenland resulted in a corrected estimate of 9,072 Belugas (CV 0.32) (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling by Innes and Stewart (2002) indicated a major decline in HA-BB Beluga abundance occurred between 1981 and 1994.<em> </em>Current trend in abundance is unknown. </p>  The Cumberland Sound Beluga subpopulation remains in the Cumberland Sound area throughout the year (Richard and Stewart 2008). Aerial surveys were conducted in typically used portions of the Sound in 2014, and abundance was estimated using a combination of visual surveys and photographic counts.<em> </em>The total abundance estimate (corrected for availability bias) was 1,151 whales (95% CI 761–1,744; Marcoux <em>et al</em>. 2016). Marcoux and Hammill (2016) constructed a model of this subpopulation using survey data collected during 1980-2014 and harvest data for 1920-2015.<em> </em>Results indicated that current abundance is substantially reduced compared to 1960 and that abundance is still declining.          <p>Four Beluga stocks occur in the Hudson Bay region.<em> </em>The eastern Hudson Bay (EHB) and western Hudson Bay (WHB) stocks summer in the regions for which they are named and winter principally in Hudson Strait (NAMMCO in prep.). Although some interbreeding occurs on the wintering grounds (Turgeon <em>et al</em>. 2012), genetic studies show that the two groups are distinct (deMarch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Colbeck <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that cultural transmission of migration routes exists which likely acts to minimize interchange between the groups.<em> </em>Systematic aerial surveys of EHB Belugas have been flown seven times since 1985. Surveys flown in 2015 produced an availability-corrected estimate of abundance of 3,819 whales (CV 0.43; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling of the series of survey estimates and harvest data for 1972-2016 indicates that abundance declined during 1974-2002, but has been stable since then (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Abundance of WHB Belugas was most recently estimated from visual and photographic aerial surveys flown in summer 2015. The availability-corrected estimate of total abundance was 54,473 whales (95% CI 44,988-65,957; Matthews <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Because of bad weather conditions, this estimate did not include the Ontario coast where nearly 15,000 whales were estimated in 2004 (Richard 2005). A comparison of surface abundance estimates from 2015 and 2004 for five strata surveyed in both years showed that 2015 counts were about 6% higher (NAMMCO in prep.). Belugas use James Bay in large numbers during the summer and remain in that region during winter (Bailleul <em>et al</em>. 2012).<em> </em>The 2015 aerial survey estimated availability-corrected abundance as 10,615 (CV 0.25; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Estimates from similar surveys conducted from1985 to 2011 ranged from 4,720 to 19,439 whales so the trend in abundance is unclear. Belugas were once abundant in Ungava Bay, with summer aggregations in and near several rivers.<em> </em>Numbers are now greatly diminished with no animals sighted on-transect during aerial surveys conducted there since 1983 (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>However, some Belugas still occur occasionally in the area as indicated by off-transect sightings during aerial surveys (Kingsley 2000) and land-based sightings (Doidge <em>et al</em>. 1994). Using data from surveys conducted during 1985-2008, Doniol-Valcroze and Hammill (2012) estimated Ungava Bay Beluga abundance to be 32 individuals (95% CI 0-94).   </p><p>&#160;A relict subpopulation of Belugas occurs in the Saint Lawrence River estuary (SLE) that is isolated from all other subpopulations both geographically and genetically (Brown Gladden <em>et al</em>. 1999; de March and Postma 2003). Both the core range used in summer and the total range of SLE Belugas have shrunk considerably since the 1930s (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2010). The size of the SLE subpopulation is believed to have declined from 7,800 whales in the 1866 to about 1,000 in 1985 (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2007).<em> </em>Abundance has been monitored since 1988 using photographic aerial surveys.<em> </em>An integrated population model using survey counts and vital rates indicated that abundance increased slowly between the 1960s and early 2000s then declined to an estimated 889 in 2012 (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Svalbard and Russian Arctic </strong></p>  <p>The Svalbard Beluga subpopulation is geographically isolated and genetically differentiated from subpopulations to the east and west (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2010). During the ice-free season Belugas in the archipelago are found very nearshore, often at the faces of glaciers (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>During winter, sea ice formation causes them to move offshore somewhat but they remain in the Svalbard area (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>Currently there is no abundance estimate for Svalbard Belugas but the first ever survey was to be conducted in summer 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>The Beluga subpopulation in the White Sea is genetically differentiated from other subpopulations (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>In summer, the whales are seen in several aggregation areas in the major bays (Andrianov <em>et al</em>., 2009, Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010a, Alekseeva <em>et al</em>., 2012). While some investigators believe that in winter Belugas move to the Barents Sea, they are seen in the White Sea in March (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and all of the Belugas tracked with satellite-linked tags have stayed in the White Sea (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2012, Svetochev and Svetocheva 2012, Kuznetsova <em>et al</em>. 2016). Aerial surveys for belugas were flown in the White Sea in July six times during 2005-2011. The abundance estimate for 2011 was 5,593 whales (CV 0.14), and estimates from prior years ranged from 5,009 to 7,464 (Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012a). Available data suggest that abundance is stable. <br/></p>  <p>Belugas have been recorded at many other locations along the Arctic coast of Russia, including the Kara, Barents, Laptev, and East Siberian seas as well as Nova Zemlya and Franz Josef Land (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964, Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012b). A compilation of observations made during 1958-1995 from sea ice reconnaissance flights showed many sightings in coastal and offshore waters from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea but few observations in the East Siberian Sea (Belikov and Boltunov 2002). Boltunov and Belikov (2002) considered that the primary summer habitats are near Franz Josef Land and in the Kara Sea and western Laptev Sea, and that most of Belugas from this region winter in the Barents Sea. There are no estimates of current abundance, but given the size of the area and the number of animals taken by historical whaling (Boltunov and Belikov 2002), it is likely that Belugas were once numerous there.<em></em><br/></p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p>Summing the various estimates above gives a total of approximately 195,000 Belugas in the surveyed subpopulations. Because no abundance estimates are  available for Svalbard and the Russian High Arctic and the estimate for the White Sea is not corrected for availability, it is nearly certain that total rangewide abundance is more than 200,000. Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) calculated that in a pristine Beluga population 68% of all individuals would be mature. Using that value the total number of mature Belugas is estimated at about 136,000. The number of mature Belugas in the largest subpopulation, WHB, is about 37,000.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Generation time is an important parameter for several of the IUCN Red List criteria, and calculations of generation time require an accurate method for determining or estimating ages of individuals. For Beluga Whales, this has been done primarily by counting layers in the teeth of harvested or stranded animals. Counts of growth layer groups (GLGs) have usually been converted to age in years assuming there were two GLGs formed each year (Brodie 1971, Sergeant 1973, Burns and Seaman 1988, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Formation of two GLGs per year was supported by examination of teeth from captive, known age, individuals (Brodie 1982, Goren <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Stewart <em>et al</em>. (2006) measured the incorporation of atomic bomb radiocarbon into Beluga tooth GLGs, and used those measures to estimate age. When those estimates were compared to ages based on formation of one GLG versus two GLGs/year, the data fit the one GLG/year assumption. Lockyer <em>et al</em>. (2007) examined 10 teeth from captive Belugas and found clear support for one GLG/year in six of the specimens, but results for the others were equivocal.  Hohn <em>et al</em>. (2016) considered that the bomb radiocarbon study and long-term photoidentification studies showed that GLG deposition is “unquestionably annual.” (also see Matthews and Ferguson 2014). However, Brodie <em>et al</em>. (2013) continued to argue for two GLGs/year, based on field observations of Beluga life history parameters in Cumberland Sound, captive animal studies, and suggested problems with studies that support one GLG/year. Using the assumption of two GLGs/year, Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated generation time for belugas as 16.4 years for a population in a pre-disturbance state. If one GLG/year is actually the case, generation time would be much longer, but calculations using that assumption have not been done.</p><span lang=""EN-CA""><p>Data on historical sizes of Beluga subpopulations are sparse. Innes and Stewart (2002) estimated the historical carrying capacity (K) of the HA-BB  subpopulation as 39,790 whales. Bettridge <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated K for Sakhalin - Amur Belugas as between 13,200 and 20,800. Cumberland Sound Belugas were estimated to number 3,100 in 1960 (Marcoux and Hammill 2016). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated that there were 6,663 Belugas in EHB in 1974. Abundance of                    Cook Inlet Belugas  in 1979 was estimated at 1,293 (NMFS 2003). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated that there were 7,800 Belugas (standard error 600) in the SLE in 1866. Comparing these figures with those for the most recent abundance estimates given above suggests a reduction of 88% for SLE belugas, and 28-74% for the other five subpopulations. While these comparisons show that some stocks have been substantially depleted and remain in that state, a species-wide reduction in abundance cannot be calculated. The difficulty of such a calculation is compounded by the lack of agreement on calibration of tooth layers for age estimation, which is central to determining generation length and the amount of depletion over time. The combined abundance of those six subpopulations known to be depleted constitutes less than 20% of the current species-wide abundance estimate, and there is no reason to think that all of the remaining subpopulations are similarly depleted.    </p><span lang=""EN-CA""></span>",Unknown,"<p>Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. (1964) correctly noted that “The Beluga is widely distributed throughout the northern seas.”<em> </em>More recent and more detailed mapping (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014) confirms that Belugas are widely distributed in Arctic regions, occurring nearly throughout northern waters of Russia, Alaska, Canada, West Greenland, and Svalbard. Gaps in the distribution occur off North and East Greenland and perhaps in central Russia. Sightings and telemetry studies show that Belugas occur north of 80° N latitude at Svalbard (Vacquié-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017), and north of western Russia (Belikov and Boltunov 2002) and Alaska (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>Subpopulations in the Okhotsk Sea and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence occur in Subarctic waters as far south as 50° N (Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2010) and 47° N (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2012) respectively. Belugas have been recorded as vagrant at Japan, New Jersey and Washington State USA, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Scotland, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark (Rice 1998).</p>","<p></p><p>In the past Belugas were hunted commercially at several locations but that is no longer the case. They are legally hunted for food by indigenous communities in several parts of their range, including western and northern Alaska (Frost and Suydam 2010), western and eastern Canada (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2017), some parts of Russia (D. Litovka pers. comm.), and Greenland (Heide-Jørgensen and Rosing-Asvid 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Legally-harvested Beluga products may be sold in Alaska Native communities. Some illegal hunting may also occur, particularly in parts of Russia (NAMMCO, in prep.). Russia allows Belugas in the White Sea and in the Sakhalin Bay - Amur River delta region to be live-captured for public display.<em> </em>Numbers taken in the White Sea are small (probably 5-6 or fewer per year, NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>The number live-captured at Sakahlin is more substantial, 0-81 per year during 2000-2017 (Shpak and Glazov 2014, NAMMCO, in prep.). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (2011) calculated the sustainable annual removal of Belugas from the Sakhalin subpopulation to be 29 whales. Records of historical kills were used in a population model to estimate that the Sakhalin - Amur subpopulation meets the definition of depleted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, which disallows imports for live display into the U.S. (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; <br/></p>",Marine,"<p>Although Belugas were hunted intensively on a commercial basis for oil and leather in many parts of their range during the 20th century, the only known direct removals at present are for food (subsistence use) and the aquarium trade. The Canada-Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga (JCNB) is expected to ensure the conservation of shared stocks of Belugas while NAMMCO is a regional management body to which Canada, Greenland, and Norway belong. Catch limits and other recommendations on conservation of belugas are made on the basis of advice from joint meetings of the JCNB’s Scientific Working Group and NAMMCO’s Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic. Catch levels from hunted Beluga subpopulations range anywhere from less than ten to a few hundred animals per year. There is concern that Cumberland Sound Belugas are being hunted at unsustainable levels (NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>Removals from the Bristol Bay, Eastern Bering Sea, Eastern Chukchi Sea, and Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations are considered sustainable (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). In both Canada (Richard and Pike 1993) and Alaska (Adams <em>et al</em>. 1993), indigenous peoples’ organizations have entered into co-management agreements with government agencies to work on conservation of Beluga stocks. Harvests from the Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulation occur in both Alaska and Canada, and that is managed by an agreement between the North Slope Borough (Alaska) and the Inuvialuit Game Council (Canada).</p><p></p><p>As a species, the Beluga is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

This was changed to Data Deficient in 2008 because the information available on threats, ecology, and population numbers and trends was “limited” (Reeves <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011). However, improved information on all of these aspects is now available and it is clear that the species qualifies for a threatened category.<br/><br/>Although it has long been recognized that <em>Inia</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> die from entanglement (‘bycatch’) in fishing gear over much of their range and that their habitat in many areas has been modified and degraded by human activities in addition to fishing (dam construction, port development, mining, ship traffic, etc.), a relatively new threat has emerged since 2000: the deliberate killing of dolphins for bait in a fishery that expanded rapidly until at least the second decade of this century. That threat has contributed to a precipitous decline in dolphin abundance in the central Brazilian Amazon and a less certain decline in the western Colombian Amazon. These declines, and others inferred or suspected elsewhere in the species’ range, are directly due to human activity, and since the human population in Amazonia, Orinoquia, the Tocantins River basin (which includes the Araguaia River),</span><span class=""st""><sub> </sub><span class=""apple-converted-space"">and the rest of <em>Inia</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">’s range is growing rapidly and fisheries that cause dolphin mortality, either accidentally (bycatch) or deliberately (killing to obtain bait) are likely to continue not only in Brazil but also in the other range states, there is no reason to expect the pressures on the species to diminish unless major changes are made in the political, economic, and human demographic landscape.</span><br/><br/>In a closely monitored index area within the 11,240 km² Mamirauá Reserve (Brazil), the <em>Inia</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> population was estimated to have declined by 70.4% over the last 22 years (da Silva <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2018), a period of slightly less than one generation (24.8 years; Moore <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2018). The authors and reviewers of this assessment discussed in detail whether extrapolation of a similar decline rate to other parts of the species range would be justified. The only other area with quantitative data on trend is in the Amazon mainstem near the Colombia-Peru border, where Williams <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2016) found evidence suggestive of a decline in abundance between 1993 (well before the direct killing for bait is believed to have begun) and 2007. Although there are no credible estimates of abundance or trend in the vast majority of the species’ range, an overall decline of at least 50% in the total rangewide population over the 75-year (3-generation) period beginning around 2000 is plausible.</span></span></span><br/><br/>The two areas for which trends are available together represent a very small proportion of the species’ total range. However, the likely primary causes of the declines in those areas – directed hunting for bait and as retaliation for perceived competition for fish resources, and accidental mortality due to human fishing practices – are present throughout much of the range of <em>Inia</em>. Other persistent threats that are likely to influence the species' conservation status include habitat fragmentation due to dams and other forms of water basin management, pollution, and a reduction in the availability of prey due to competition with humans.<span class=""apple-converted-space""> Unfortunately, there is no reason to expect documentation of absolute abundance and trends, or the true scale of the threats facing <em>Inia</em>, to become available in the immediate future or even in coming decades, and this makes precautionary reasoning in the assessment of status particularly appropriate.<br/><br/>Based on the above and the other evidence summarized below, it is concluded that <em>Inia</em> is Endangered due to a suspected reduction of 50% or more in total population size over a period of three generations (75 years) that includes the past and the future (from 2000, when directed killing for bait began to proliferate, to 2075): criterion A4. There is evidence of (i) declines in abundance (subcriterion a); (ii) population fragmentation and the deterioration of habitat quality as a result of water basin management (e.g., dam construction), human demographic changes, and economic development (subcriterion c); and (iii) exploitation – i.e., directed hunting to obtain bait and for predator control, together with incidental mortality in fishing gear (subcriterion d). All of the causes of the suspected reduction in population size are continuing and some of them (those related to subcriterion c in particular) may not be reversible due to the increasing human population and the associated increase in demand for resources throughout most of the species’ range.<br/><br/>It is emphasised that if the decline rate estimated for the small part of the central Amazon region (Mamirauá area) were representative of the entire range of <em>Inia</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">, and if declines were to persist, the species would qualify for Critically Endangered. Because of this possibility, the status should be reconsidered as soon as ongoing research provides improved documentation of trends in population size and extent and severity of threats (e.g., bycatch and killing of dolphins for bait). Also, separate assessments of subspecies and subpopulations, regardless of the clarity of their taxonomic status, is strongly encouraged.</span></p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><p></p>","<p>The biology and ecology of <em>Inia</em> are strongly related to the seasonal variation in water levels (Martin and da Silva 2004b, Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Their physical adaptations allow them to swim into the flooded forests in the high-water season (Layne 1958, Best and da Silva 1989a) in search of prey among the roots and trunks of partially submerged trees (da Silva 1984). Mark/recapture studies have shown that some individuals are resident to specific areas year-round (Martin and da Silva 2004a, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2011), whereas others move several tens to hundreds of kilometres within the rivers, but there does not appear to be any seasonal migration as such (Martin and da Silva 2004a).<br/><br/>The use of habitat by <em>Inia</em> is affected by the water level for all age classes, however habitat preferences differ among age and sex classes (Martin and da Silva 2004b, Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2016). Sexual segregation is common; females with dependent calves spend more time inside the flooded forest and in lakes and small tributaries during the high-water season, while most adult males at any one time occur in the main rivers. The preference of nursing females for lake systems is likely due to factors favourable to calves, such as low current, abundance of small fish, and protection against predation such as by large sharks (Martin and da Silva 2004b). The predominant presence of mother-calf pairs and juveniles in lakes has been observed in much of the species’ range (Trujillo 1997, McGuire and Winemiller 1998, Denkinger 2001). Also, Mintzer <em>et al</em>. (2016) proposed that bays are important habitat for early life stages due to the high productivity, low current, and availability of ample water during the low-water season. Genetic analyses of control region mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites of samples obtained from the Mamirauá Reserve suggested that females have a restricted distribution while males mediate gene flow among groups (Hollatz <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>During the low-water season, <em>Inia</em> are often concentrated below channel confluences (Best and da Silva 1989a,b, Leatherwood 1996, Vidal <em>et al</em>. 1997, McGuire and Winemiller 1998, Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the main rivers they occur most often within 150 m of the banks, with lower densities in the centre of large rivers (Martin <em>et al</em>. 2004a, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2012a). As the water starts rising, their affinity for confluences diminishes, probably because the animals move into appended lakes and flooded forests (Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 2000, Aliaga-Rossel 2002, Martin and da Silva 2004a,b) which become more important habitats during the high-water season due to their high productivity and prey diversity (Martin and da Silva 2004b). When the water is receding, dolphins leave the lakes and the shallow habitats, perhaps in order to avoid getting trapped (Martin and da Silva 2004a,b, Mintzer <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Due to intense intraspecific interactions, <em>Inia</em> bear marks and scars that have potential for being used in photo-identification studies (Martin and da Silva 2006). However, Trujillo (1994), McGuire and Henningsen (2007), and Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> (2014) found that only a small proportion of the population could be identified correctly, not only due to the turbidity of the water, but also because of the behaviour, morphology, and ecological characteristics of the species (McGuire and Henningsen 2007, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2014). Great effort is required to obtain accurate data.<br/><br/><em>Inia</em> feed on more than 43 species of fishes (Best and da Silva 1993, da Silva 2009).</p>","<p>Longstanding threats to <em>Inia</em> include incidental mortality in fishing gear, deliberate killing for fish bait or predator control, damming of rivers, and environmental pollution from organochlorines and heavy metals (see Best and da Silva 1989a,b; da Silva 2009, IWC 2007, Trujillo <em>et al. </em>2010b).<br/><br/> Incidental mortality has not been systematically monitored in most areas but is known to be a major threat throughout the species’ range (Best and da Silva 1989b, Trujillo <em>et al. </em>2010b). Similar to other small cetaceans, <em>Inia</em> are vulnerable to entanglement in a variety of nets (lampara seine nets, fixed gill nets, drifting gill nets) (Best and da Silva 1993, Martin <em>et al</em>. 2004, Siciliano <em>et al.</em> 2016a). They also die in drop traps intended to catch large fish or Amazonian Manatees (<em>Trichechus inunguis</em>) in the flooded forest in Peru (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1999). Carcasses of dolphins with evidence of fishery involvement have been observed in the Japurá and Amazon rivers and in the Orinoco River basin (Iriarte and Marmontel 2013b, Trujillo <em>et al. </em>2010b). The proportion of carcasses found by observers is believed to be very small because most of them would be expected to be taken by scavengers or disposed of by fishermen within hours of death. In Tefé, at least 176 dolphins were estimated to have died in 2010 due to interactions with fisheries (Brum 2011, Brum and da Silva 2016).<br/><br/>The deliberate killing of <em>Inia</em> for use as bait in the Piracatinga fisheries (<span class=""s1"">Estupinan <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2003, da Silva and Martin 2007, 2017; Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2008, Trujillo <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2010b, da Silva <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2011, Mintzer <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2013, Iriarte and Marmontel 2013a, Brum <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2015) is probably the most serious human-caused threat to this species, though incidental drowning in monofilament fishing nets is also likely to cause widespread mortality. The directed hunt, which appears to have begun in Brazil, has been noticed since around 2000 when it was believed to be expanding to other regions. The government of Brazil reported the killing of 354 dolphins in 2006 but this number is thought to be an underestimate because it was solely based on interviews with fishermen (IWC 2007). Estimates of the numbers of dolphins killed are very difficult to obtain, and those that have been attempted have varied between 300 dolphins/year in just one area (Tefé, Brazil) to more than 4,000 dolphins/year for the whole Brazilian state of Amazonas (Serrano <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2007, da Silva <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2011, Brum <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2014). An evaluation of the Piracatinga fishery suggested that almost 1,200 tons of this fish was traded from Brazil to Colombia every year and that a substantial proportion of the catch was made using dolphins for bait. The main market was formerly in Colombia, but for the years 2008-2014 this fish was also sold in the states of Amazonas, São Paulo, Bahia, Minas Gerais, and elsewhere in Brazil under the name of “Douradinha” among others (Flores <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2008, Trujillo <em>et al</em><span class=""s1"">. 2010b,c; Brum <em>et al</em><span class=""s1"">. 2015, Cunha <em>et al</em><span class=""s1"">. 2015). </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/><br/>Despite a ban on commercial Piracatinga fishing introduced by the Brazilian government in 2015, there is evidence that this activity continues (da Silva and Martin 2017). It is important to emphasize that this directed hunting is in addition to the longstanding problems of bycatch (see above) and control killing (see below) and the directed hunting to obtain bait may be widespread in areas where Piracatinga are common, mainly in areas close to Colombia, the main market center (Trujillo <em>et al. </em>2010b, Brum <em>et al. </em>2015). Killing of dolphins for use as bait has also been confirmed in Venezuela (Aya <em>et al. </em>2010, Diniz 2011) and reported in media and unpublished reports in Peru (F. Trujillo, unpublished data) and Bolivia (M. Escobar-WW, G. Rey Ortiz, C. Coca Mendez, L. Cordova and P.A. Van Damme, pers. comm).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk503964763""><em>Inia</em></a> are also killed deliberately in some areas because they damage fishing nets and are regarded as competitors for fishery resources (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1999, Araújo and Wang 2012, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2016, Siciliano <em>et al.</em> 2016a). At least one dolphin found dead at Tefé Lake, Brazil, had injuries consistent with an intentional human attack (Loch <em>et al. </em>2009). Similar conflicts have been reported in Colombia (Bonilla <em>et al. </em>2008, Trujillo <em>et al.</em> 2010b).<br/><br/>Fishing with explosives, although illegal in most countries, was common in some areas of the Amazon Basin. In Venezuela, this practice is still in use and has been reported as a threat to river dolphins due to the concussive effects (Aya <em>et al. </em>2010). Fishermen also reportedly attempt to kill dolphins that are attracted to fishing operations to prey on stunned or dead fish (Best and da Silva 1989a). At least in Peru, fishermen attempt to kill dolphins by injecting live fish with toxins and tossing them into the water near the animals (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1999, McGuire and Aliaga-Rossel 2010). The killing of 22 <em>Inia</em> in Caballo Cocha, Peru, was reported in 2008 (F. Trujillo, unpub. data).<br/><br/>Water development projects are another major concern and an increasing threat to <em>Inia</em> (Araújo and Wang 2014, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015, Pavanato <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Brazilian Amazon alone, 91 dams are planned that, if constructed, would flood about 10 million hectares, representing approximately 2% of the Legal Amazon region and about 3% of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon forest. Added to these, 74 dams are already in operation and 31 are under construction. Over 400 dams could be constructed in the Amazon basin eventually (Finer and Jenkins 2012). Despite the high number of operating dams and projects in the Amazon region today and knowing that dolphins occur above and below rapids in some rivers, of the 83 rivers with operating hydroelectric dams in Brazil only 13 had any kind of study involving <em>Inia</em> (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015). Most of these studies have shown that the dams fragmented, isolated, and eliminated connectivity of dolphin populations (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 1998, Araújo and Wang, 2014, Pavanato <em>et al</em>. 2016). Dams in the Amazon basin, and the Guri and Tocoma dams in the Caroní, an Orinoco tributary, have probably degraded downstream habitat due to their effects on flow and temperature regimes although in the short term, observations of dolphins feeding on concentrations of fish immediately downstream of some dams may be seen as “beneficial,” especially if protective measures are better enforced there (Araújo and Wang 2014). Additional dams are bound to restrict dolphin movements, contribute to more fragmentation of populations, and continue to alter and degrade the habitat by opening commercialization networks, improving navigability, and increasing road access (Best and da Silva 1989a, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Chemical contamination is another potential threat to <em>Inia</em>. Mercury is often used to separate gold from soil and rock in mining operations along the Amazon. A study of mercury in the sediments and floating plants in the Tucuruí Reservoir in the Tocantins River, Brazil, emphasized the risk of mercury accumulation in the bed of non-flowing waters. Total mercury content in dolphin milk from one individual sampled near the city of Manaus (176 ng/ml = 0.176 ppm) was considered close to the minimum level of methylmercury toxicity in human adults (Rosas and Lehti 1996). Recent evaluations of mercury in river dolphins have been carried out in the Amazon and Orinoco basins. Concentration values <span lang=""EN-CA"">​​of total mercury in river dolphin muscle from the Amazon and Orinoco basins varied from 0.003 to 3.990 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> Hg, with the highest values found for <em>Inia</em> from the Orinoco (Trujillo <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>High concentrations of organochlorine compounds (DDT, PCB, HCH, HCB, Mirex) and organobrominated compounds (PBDE) were also found in <em>Inia</em> samples from different areas of Brazil, including the Solimões, Japurá, Negro, and Madeira rivers (Torres <em>et al.</em> 2007, José Lailson pers. comm. 2018). All milk samples (n=62) from dolphins in the Mamirauá Reserve contained evidence of organochlorine accumulation (PCBs were present in 100% of the samples, DDT in 64%, HCHs in 95%, HCB in 64%, and Mirex in 66%) (José Lailson pers. comm. 2018). Pesticide concentrations measured in these samples were similar to those verified in the milk of other aquatic mammals and humans, indicating substantial exposure of calves to organochlorines at a critical developmental stage. The effects of bioaccumulation of mercury and other chemical contaminants in dolphins are unknown but the high levels recorded in the Amazon ecosystem are a reason for concern.<br/><br/>The Tocantins-Araguaia Basin has been significantly altered over the past few decades by dams, deforestation for cattle ranching, logging, road building, and the use of Agent Orange to clear pathways for power lines (Siciliano <em>et al.</em> 2016b). In addition, unregulated feeding and touching of wild dolphins by visitors and locals occurs near Mocajuba on the lower Tocantins River (Melo-Santos <em>et al</em>. 2015). Human feeding can be a health risk for the dolphins and also increase their risk to vessel strikes.</p>      <p></p>","<p>There is limited information on population structure of <em>Inia</em> throughout their range. The taxonomy is not completely resolved and the taxonomic status of the currently recognized subspecies <em>I. g. boliviensis</em> and the putative new species <em>I. araguaiaensis</em> needs further evaluation.<br/><br/>There is no range-wide estimate of abundance or trends in abundance. Surveys have been conducted since 1979 in various areas within the species’ range in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Some of these studies resulted in estimates of abundance for relatively small areas. The estimates varied from a few dozen to a few thousand individuals (e.g., Vidal <em>et al</em>., 1997, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2012b, Pavanato <em>et al.</em> 2016, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2016) depending on the size of the survey area, but the interpretation of these estimates in the context of this assessment is difficult given potential biases associated with the different survey methods used and the limited understanding of the movements and the population structure of the species across different parts of its range including the entire Amazon system, the Araguaia-Tocantins system, and the Orinoco system. A multi-season survey of dolphins in the 11,240 km² Mamirauá reserve between 1999 and 2001 (i.e., before the rapid decline referred to below) estimated <em>Inia</em> abundance at 13,000 (Martin and da Silva 2004a). A range-wide program to estimate abundance was carried out from 2006 to 2016, involving 26 expeditions and covering nearly 28,000 km of rivers in all range states. Some of the results of this program revealed that density was low in rivers in Ecuador and in parts of the Orinoco River whereas densities were relatively high in rivers such as the Itenez/Guaporé at the border of Brazil and Bolivia and the Samiria River in Peru (Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2012a,b; Pavanatto <em>et al</em>. 2016, Williams <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/><br/>Trends in abundance have been assessed in only two small geographical locations (relative to the vast total range of the species), as follows. Standardized transect surveys were conducted in the Amazon River in Colombia in 1993 (covering 259.7 km²) (Vidal <em>et al.</em> 1997), 2002 (276.7 km²) (Gómez-Salazar <em>et al. </em>2012a,b), and 2007 (592.6 km²). In analysing these data, Williams <em>et al</em>. (2016) used a Bayesian framework to estimate the probability of a decline conditional on a range of priors for process variance to accommodate the fact that the data were collected from three independent survey programs rather than from a single coordinated program, and as a way of attempting to account for uncertainty associated with seasonal movements. The probability of a decline was estimated to be greater than 0.75. A bootstrapped regression analysis to estimate the rate of decline revealed “no compelling evidence of population growth or decline for this species using this method.”<br/><br/>Standardized transect surveys conducted monthly since 1994 in the Brazilian Amazon (in and around the 11,240 km²<sup> </sup>Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve) revealed that between 2000 (the year in which a rapidly expanding fishery for the Piracatinga<em> </em>(<em>Calophysus macropterus)</em>, a species of economically valuable catfish, using dolphin carcasses as a source of bait began in Brazil) and January 2017 there was an annual average rate of decline in <em>Inia</em> encounters of 6.7% (95% confidence interval 5.7-7.7%) in the Mamirauá study area, which implies a halving of the population each decade (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2018). Further exploration of these data revealed that the overall decline between 2000 and 2017 was driven primarily by a precipitous decline between 2000 and the following decade.<br/><br/>There is evidence that the survival of <em>Inia</em> that spend at least some of their time in the Mamirauá study area but range more widely may have been affected by the Piracatinga fishery. Time-dependent models estimated that apparent annual survival rate of dolphins after the first reports of directed hunting (0.899; standard error (SE) 0.007) was significantly lower than in years prior to the hunting (0.968; SE 0.009). This decline in apparent survival suggests that current (or at least recent) removal rates exceed conservation limits and are unsustainable (Mintzer <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p><p></p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p><em>Inia</em> occur throughout the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, from the deltas upstream to where impassable rapids, waterfalls, lack of water, and possibly low temperatures block their movement (Best and da Silva 1989a,b). In Brazil, they have been recorded in the central region, in the Araguaia-Tocantins River basin and in several tributaries such as the das Mortes and Verde, Paranã, Vermelho, Peixe, Crixas-Açú, and Água Limpa rivers and the dos Tigres and Rico lakes, all in the state of Goiás. They occur in Lake Montaria in the state of Mato Grosso, the Araguaia-Tocantins River basin, as well as mangrove habitats in Marajó Bay (Araújo and Wang 2012, Araújo and da Silva 2014, Hrbek <em>et al</em>. 2014, Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2016a,b). <em>Inia</em> have also been observed in the following rivers and tributaries of the Amazon basin in Brazil – Juruá, Purus, Madeira, Tapajós, Xingu (only below Belo Monte falls), Içá, Caquetá-Japurá, Negro-Branco and Trombetas. In addition, in Brazil they have been reported along the Madeira mainstem above and below the Teotônio rapids (Gravena <em>et al.</em> 2014a). In Bolivia, they have been reported from the Beni (and Orton tributaries), Iténez or Guaporé (the Brazilian name) Basin (Verde, Machupo and Iporuporé tributaries), and Mamoré Basin and its tributaries -- Pirai, Grande, Ichilo, Chapare, Ibaré, Matucaré, Tijamuchi, Apere, Yacuma, and Yata (Pilleri and Gihr 1977, Aliaga-Rossel <em>et al.</em> 2006, Aliaga-Rossel 2010). In Colombia, they occur in the Orinoco and Amazon systems – in the Caquetá-Japurá River, from the Araracuara rapids to the mouth of the Apaporis River at the border with Brazil, the Putumayo-Içá River from Puerto Leguizamo to the east, and in the Amazon River. In the Orinoco, they are found in the rivers Meta, Arauca, Casanare, Bita, Vichada, Tomo, Tuparro, Orinoco, Guaviare (and the Guayabero affluent), Inírida, and Atabapo. <em>Inia</em> have been seen crossing the first set of rapids at Puerto Ayacucho (Atures-River Orinoco) during high water<strong> </strong>as well as the Cordoba rapids in the Caquetá River during low water (Trujillo <em>et al.</em> 2010c). In Ecuador, they are widely distributed in the main rivers and some lacustrine systems at elevations below 260 m in the rivers Payamino (near Napo River), Napo, Pastaza, Tigre, and Santiago (Best and da Silva 1993, Trujillo and Diazgranado 2002, Utreras <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Ecuadorian Amazon, the only important river system in which <em>Inia</em> have not been recorded is the Morona River (Utreras 2001). In Peru, they can be found in the Ucayali and Marañon (and Samiria affluent) tributaries flowing generally north, and in the Napo, Tigre, and Pastaza tributaries flowing generally south (partial list from Best and da Silva 1989a,b; Leatherwood 1996, McGuire and Aliaga-Rossel 2010, Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Venezuela, they occur in the Orinoco system – in the delta region upstream at Ciudad Bolivar, Caicara del Orinoco, and near Puerto Ayacucho as well as in the Apure, Portuguesa, Guanare, Guaritico, Capanaparo, Cinaruco, and Caura rivers (Portocarrero-Aya <em>et al.</em> 2010). They occur in the Cassiquiare Canal, which connects the Orinoco with the Negro River (a tributary of the Amazon in Brazil), and also above and below the two sets of rapids at Puerto Ayacucho, which may (or may not) separate the Amazon and Orinoco populations (as summarized in Pilleri and Gihr 1977, Best and da Silva 1989a,b; Meade and Koehnken 1991). </p><p>  The map shows where the species occurs or may occur. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are included in the list of native range states.</p><p></p>","<p>Indigenous people in some parts of the Amazon may have hunted <em>Inia</em> for food in the past but such hunting is not known to have been common or widespread. There is no market for or frequent use of dolphins for human consumption, at least in the Brazilian Amazon (Alves <em>et al.</em> 2012) and in the Orinoco basin (Trujillo <em>et al.</em> 2010b).<br/><br/>Since the 1950s and into at least the 1970s, numerous <em>Inia</em> were live-captured and exported, mostly to the U.S.A. and Europe (Allen and Neill 1957, Layne 1958, Layne and Caldwell 1964, Caldwell and Caldwell 1989). Two animals went to Japan (Tobayama and Kamiya 1989). Some have also been brought into captivity in South America. In Venezuela, the Valencia Aquarium kept wild-caught<em> </em>dolphins in captivity for display from the 1970s and into at least the mid-1990s (Boede 1990, Boede <em>et al.</em> 1998). No live-captures or exports have been reported in recent years. <br/><br/>In markets around Amazonian cities in Brazil, it is possible to find products labeled as being from Botos, such as eyes and genitals, dry or in perfume solutions, to be used as love charms. This is despite the fact that such commercialization of <em>Inia</em> products violates Federal law. Recent molecular studies have revealed that these products are mainly either from domestic animals such as pigs and sheep (Gravena <em>et al.</em> 2008) or from Guiana Dolphins (<em>Sotalia guianensis</em>) from the coasts of Pará and Amapá States that were caught in fishing nets and sold by the fishermen (Santos <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/><em>Inia</em><span class=""s1""> have been used as bait in a fishery for a scavenging catfish, the Piracatinga, in Brazil since 2000 (Estupinan <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2003, da Silva <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2011). In the Japurá River, on the border with the Mamirauá and Amanã Sustainable Development Reserves, Iriarte and Marmontel (2013a) confirmed 114 Piracatinga fishing events in eight communities during one year, from which 32 events (31%) used dolphins as bait. Near Mamirauá Reserve, on the Solimões River, all interviewed Piracatinga fishermen (N=17) confirmed using dolphins as bait for this activity, while on the Purus River, 70% of 40 Piracatinga fishermen interviewed in 24 communities also confirmed using them as bait (Brum <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2015). Records of these practices throughout the Amazon mainstem (between Manaus and Tabatinga) and the widespread sale of Piracatinga in the region (Cunha <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2015) suggest extensive use of <em>Inia</em><span class=""s1""> as a source of fish bait not only in Brazil but also in other parts of the species range (see the Threats section).</span></span></span></p><span class=""s1""><span class=""s1""><span class=""s1""><span class=""s1""><p></p></span></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>In July 2014, the Federal Government of Brazil published a rule (Normative Interministerial nº 6/2014) establishing a five-year moratorium on the fishing and marketing of <a name=""_Hlk485920902"">the Piracatinga </a>in Brazilian waters, effective from January 2015, intended to reduce the pressure on dolphins and other wild species (especially caimans, <em>Caiman </em>spp.) used for bait in this fishery (ICMBio-CEPAM 2017,&#160;IWC 2016). The report of the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee in 2016 stated the following (IWC 2017:355): “The Ministry of Environment (MMA) is responsible for evaluating the success of the moratorium. A working group was established by the MMA … to define procedures and monitor the fishing and marketing of piracatinga during the moratorium period. … three inspections to assess compliance with the ban were completed in 2016 and included: ‘Routine Operation’ in the municipalities of Iranduba, Itacoatiara, Manacapurú and Manaus in February, ‘Operation Golden Dragon’ in the municipalities of Maraã, Tefé and Fonte Boa in March-April and ‘Operation Federal Rios’ in the municipalities of Jutaí, Tabatinga, Coari, Fonte Boa and Tefé also in March-April.” The report went on to note (IWC 2017:355): “Brazil has established a National Action Plan for the Conservation of Small Cetaceans which lists <em>Inia geoffrensis </em>as an endangered species. This plan is intended to reduce human impacts and increase knowledge on small cetaceans in Brazil. Furthermore, the Brazil Government is cooperating with Colombia and Peru to support sustainable development of fishing activities. Several meetings and workshops involving these countries have included discussions on the catch and sale of piracatinga."" Based on documentation of high levels of mercury in Piracatinga, the government of Colombia announced in August 2017 a permanent ban on the trade of this fish within the country.<br/><br/>The status of<em> </em><em>Inia</em> has been evaluated in different range states during the last 10 years following the IUCN criteria and those national assessments have classified the species as Endangered (Trujillo <em>et al</em>. 2006, Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tirira 2011, Rodríguez and Rojas-Suarez 2015).

50361589,11143,Lagenorhynchus australis,Least Concern,,2019,2018-07-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>There has been considerable improvement in the amount and quality of information about Peale’s Dolphin&#160;(<em>Lagenorhy</em><em>nchus australis)</em><em> </em>since the previous assessments in 1996 and 2008, both of which resulted in listing the species as Data Deficient. The currently available information is still somewhat limited making a rigorous evaluation against the Red List criteria challenging, particularly with regard to population size, trends, and threats. However, since the last assessment, abundance estimates have become available for the South Atlantic part of the species’ range indicating that Peale’s Dolphins number in the low tens of thousands (~21,800 combined point estimates for the Patagonian shelf and the Falkland Islands). Equivalent information for the South Pacific is not available. Based on existing sighting records, Peale’s Dolphins are the most frequently encountered small cetacean in the southern Chilean fjords. Overall, there is no evidence for significant population declines or high levels of anthropogenic mortality that might be cause for concern anywhere in the species’ range. There is reasonable evidence to suggest that Peale’s Dolphin is widespread, abundant, and not in decline in any major part of its range. Therefore, the species is assessed as Least Concern.<br/><br/>Further research is needed to obtain abundance estimates for the South Pacific part of the species’ range as well as more up-to-date quantitative information on human-caused mortality.</p>","<p>Peale’s Dolphins occur in coastal neritic (shelf water) habitats. In the South Atlantic they range widely over the Patagonian shelf from the wave-washed shoreline out to the 200 m isobath several tens of km offshore (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Dellabianca <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Tierra del Fuego and southern Chile, they inhabit deep channels and fjords, but are most frequently seen along the rocky shores rather than in the deep sections of the channels (Goodall <em>et al.</em> 1997a, Zamorano-Abramson <em>et al.</em> 2010). In the Chiloé archipelago Peale’s Dolphins prefer shallow waters (&lt;30 m) along more exposed shorelines or over shoals (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> submitted). Around the Falkland Islands Peale’s Dolphins are found both close to shore as well as offshore to the 100 m isobath (Costa <em>et al</em>. 2018). This wide range of neritic habitats suggests some degree of ecological flexibility.</p>  <p>The diet of Peale’s Dolphins is not well known, but stomach analyses from individuals in the southwestern South Atlantic identified mostly demersal and bottom fishes, and octopus and squid species (Schiavini <em>et al.</em> 1997) which commonly occur over the continental shelf and in kelp beds. Observational studies support the notion that Peale’s Dolphins strongly associate with coastal kelp beds (<em>Macrocystis</em> sp.) (de Haro and Iniguez 1997, Viddi and Lescrauwaet 2005, Viddi <em>et al.</em> 2011). Stable isotope analyses of dolphin bones suggested that coastal-benthic species such as zoarcids and nototheniod fishes and nearshore pelagic species (e.g., <em>Odonthestes</em> spp.) are important food sources for this species in Tierra del Fuego (Riccialdelli <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p>Over much of their range Peale's Dolphins are broadly sympatric with Dusky Dolphins (<em>Lagenorhynchus obscurus</em>) although their habitat usage differs sufficiently to provide some spatial separation (Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2010). The two species co-occur and sometimes form mixed groups in the Beagle Channel, at the southern extreme of the distribution of Dusky Dolphins (Dellabianca <em>et al</em>. 2018). Peale’s and Dusky Dolphins can be difficult to differentiate at sea (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a,b) leading to some uncertainty about species identification for sightings reported further offshore or from the extreme northern and southern parts of the range. Peale’s Dolphins frequently associate with other cetacean species, especially Commerson’s Dolphins (<em>Cephalorhynchus commersonii</em>). They are also known for their boat-positive behavior, readily approaching moving vessels to ride the bow wave (Cipriano 2018).</p>  <p>Limited evidence from individual identification studies suggests that some Peale’s Dolphins are resident in nearshore waters throughout the year, but some might also range widely alongshore (Lescrauwaet 1997, Heinrich 2006). Calves have been reported from spring through autumn, but population biology and dynamics remain poorly understood.</p>","<p>From the 1970s to the late 1980s Peale's Dolphins were hunted extensively with harpoons in the Strait of Magellan and around Tierra del Fuego, where the meat was used as bait in crab traps set for Centolla (Southern King Crab, <em>Lithodes antarctica</em><em>) </em>and Centollon (False King Crab, <em>Paralomis granulosa</em>) (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994, Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1994). Sielfeld <em>et al</em>. (1977) estimated that some 2,350 dolphins, including both <em>Peale’s </em>and <em>Commerson’s Dolphins</em>, were killed during the 1976/1977 crab-fishing season in the Strait of Magellan and the Chilean part of the Beagle Channel. This level of take across a number of years could have had a significant impact on the Peale’s Dolphin population in that area. Dolphin takes in the Argentinean sector were also significant (Goodall and Cameron 1980) but are thought to have stopped by the mid-1980s (Cipriano 2018). In Chile, exploitation for bait appears to have ceased later, by the mid-1990s (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994, Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 2008). However, some degree of uncertainty remains as alternative bait sources might not always be readily available, alternative bait prices fluctuate and official monitoring of bait usage and dolphin mortality remains sketchy (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 2008). Direct hunting of dolphins has been prohibited in Chile since 1977. Although all dolphin deaths in fisheries should be reported to the Chilean Fisheries authorities, this is not always the case. </p>  <p>Peale's Dolphins were reported to become entangled incidentally and drown in coastal gillnets along the open coasts of southern Chile and Tierra del Fuego, southern Argentina (Goodall <em>et al.</em> 1994, Reyes and Oporto 1994). In all areas, entanglement cases involving Peale’s Dolphins were reported less frequent than cases involving sympatric small cetaceans. There are no reports of incidental entanglements for the northern parts of Peale’s Dolphin’s Atlantic range (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1994) or in offshore trawl fisheries that are known to catch substantial numbers of other small cetaceans (Crespo <em>et al</em> 1997). Most of the entanglement information is now more than 30 years old, and current levels of bycatch of Peale’s Dolphins are not known. However, there do not appear to be particular fisheries or regions where they form a noticeable part of the incidental catch of small cetaceans. </p>  Other human activities with the potential to affect Peale’s Dolphins include the already large-scale and expanding aquaculture operations, particularly those involving farming of salmonids in southern Chile, and continued oil and gas development off southern Argentina. There is no information at present to consider if these industries are having substantial direct effects on Peale’s Dolphins, but their potential effects on the local ecosystem and the species that depend upon it mean that such activities should be monitored closely.","<p>The first abundance estimates for Peale’s Dolphins recently became available for the South Atlantic part of their range. Using density surface modelling with non-systematically collected vessel-based survey data gathered between 2009 and 2015, Dellabianca <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated 19,924 individuals (coefficient of variation (CV) =0.2) to occur over the Patagonian shelf. The study could not account for the likely strong attraction bias arising from Peale’s Dolphins readily approaching vessels (i.e., possibly biasing estimates high) and also might have underestimated uncertainty. For inshore waters of the Falkland Islands, Costa <em>et al.</em> (2018) estimated 1,896 Peale’s Dolphins (CV=0.33) using design-based line transect methods and systematic aerial survey data collected in 2017. </p>  <p>No comparable abundance estimates exist for the South Pacific part of Peale’s Dolphin’s range. However, this species is reportedly the most commonly sighted cetacean in the Chilean fjords (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Gibbons <em>et al.,</em> 2002, Viddi <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zamorano-Abramson <em>et al.</em> 2010). Although observed group sizes tend to be small (average number of individuals 4-5, range 1-15), the number of dolphins seen during boat surveys in the main navigation channels adds up to hundreds of individuals. Gibbons <em>et al.</em> (2002) used simple encounter rate measures to generate a crude estimate of around 2,400 individuals for the Magallanes region (49°-56°S). In addition, during the period 2001-2004 around 200 Peale’s Dolphins were estimated in the nearshore waters of southern and central Chiloé island (42-43°S) using photo-identification and mark-recapture techniques (Heinrich 2006). The species’ distribution and abundance along the open coast in the northern part of their range in Chile (Chiloé to Valparaíso) remain poorly known.</p>",Unknown,"Peale's Dolphins appear confined to shelf waters off southern South America, ranging from Valparaíso, Chile (33°S) south to Cape Horn (56°S) and along the Patagonian Shelf to northern Argentina (38°S) (Goodall <em>et al</em>. 1997a, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Cipriano 2018). Their South Atlantic range extends east to the Falkland Islands where the species is regularly observed near the coast. Peale’s Dolphins are also occasionally sighted over the continental shelf south of Cape Horn.","The Peale’s Dolphin was hunted for use as bait in crab fisheries (Lescrauwaet and Gibbons 1994). The current scale of this taking is unknown, but if it persists, is likely to be small and sporadic.",Marine,<p>The Peale's Dolphinis on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). <br/> <br/> Recommended actions for conservation include cooperative research on biology and abundance and a thorough assessment of anthropogenic threats throughout the species’ range. Given the extensive range of this species population genetic studies should be a priority. Ongoing genetic studies indicate some differences in the mtDNA control regions of Peale’s Dolphins in the East and West Falkland Islands raising the possibility of population structuring along the continental coasts (Baker <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>,Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The current global population is estimated at 135,000 and the mature population at about 84,000, which is higher than the level of three generations ago. This is true of the global population as well as the three main regional populations individually – North Pacific, North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. The species does not, therefore, qualify for a Red List threatened category, and is listed as Least Concern. The Arabian Sea subpopulation appears to be isolated, is very small, and is listed separately as Endangered (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p></p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>With few exceptions, such as the Arabian Sea population, Humpback Whales undertake long migrations between breeding grounds in tropical coastal waters in winter to feeding grounds in middle and high latitudes (Clapham 2018).<br/> <br/> In the Southern Hemisphere, they appear to feed mainly in the antarctic and subantarctic, where the diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids (Krill, <em>Euphausia superba</em>) (Mackintosh 1970), although some feeding has been observed in the Benguela Current ecosystem on the migration route west of South Africa (Best <em>et al</em>. 1995); suspected prey species in that region are euphausiids (<em>E. lucens</em><em>)</em> and amphipods (<em>Themisto gaudichaudii</em><em>)</em>. Some Humpback Whales feed in summer in mid-latitude (41°-44°S) Chilean waters (Hucke-Gaete<em> et al</em>. 2013) <br/> <br/> Few data on diet in other areas are available. Humpback Whales caught off Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1950s and 1960s were consuming mainly Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) (Mitchell 1973). Those caught off California in the early 20th century were eating mainly euphausiids and sardines (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1997). Humpback Whales caught in the northern North Pacific in the 1950s were feeding mainly on euphausiids and fish (Nemoto 1959). In areas of Alaska and the North Atlantic, Humpback Whales have also been observed feeding in coordinated fashion on schools of Pacific Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), Sand Lance (<em>Ammodytes</em> spp.), and (more rarely) Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>), herding the school together with bubble nets, clouds or curtains (Hain <em>et al</em>. 1982).<br/> <br/> The timing of acquisition of tooth rake marks attributable to Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) indicates that Humpback Whale calves, but usually not subadults and adults, are subject to predation (Mehta <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Although modern commercial whaling seriously depleted all Humpback populations, some of which had already been reduced by pre-modern whaling, the species has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and there have been substantial increases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. Humpback whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling worldwide since 1966, and there have been few catches since 1968. It is unclear whether there has been any recovery in the small, isolated population in the Arabian Sea.<br/><br/>Today, small numbers only are taken for local consumption in Greenland (up to 10 annually) and the island of Bequia (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) (up to four annually), with occasional takes elsewhere (IWC 2018b).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales, along with North Atlanatic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena</em> <em>glacialis</em>), seem to be the most vulnerable of the large whales to becoming accidentally entangled, often fatally, in fishing gear and sometimes other debris. They are also vulnerable to injury by ship strikes, which can also be fatal. In most areas, the majority of entanglements (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also the majority of ship strikes, are likely to go undetected, but there is no generally accepted method for extrapolating from the observed events to estimate totals.<br/><br/>State members of the IWC are encouraged to report bycatches and ship strikes annually to the IWC, but few do so. The figures submitted in 2018 for entanglements include: USA 78 (26 in the Atlantic in 2015, 52 in the Pacific in 2016); Australia 46; Greenland 5, Japan 3, and New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, and Spain (1 each) (Hughes 2019). The reported ship strike numbers were: USA 13, Australia 5, and Brazil 1. &#160;The figures include some potentially non-fatal incidents (such as whales entangled and released).<br/><br/>Minimum estimates of average annual deaths in US waters are: west coast (2012-16) - 16.7 from entanglement and 2.1 from ship strikes (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2018); east coast (2010-14) ­– 7.2 from entanglements and 1.8 from ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Alaska and Hawaii (2011-15) − 18 from entanglements in fishing gear, 2.8 from unspecified marine debris, and 4.4 from ship strikes (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018). Urbán <em>et al</em>. (2017) reported 95 cases of entanglement of Humpback Whales on the Mexican Pacific coast during 2004-2017 of which 42 were released, 6 died and the fate of the others was either unknown or considered not to be severely injured.<br/><br/>In a study of Humpback entanglements in Scottish fishing gear during 1992-2016, Ryan <em>et al</em>. (2016) found that most Humpback Whales spent only brief periods in Scottish waters, but that the entanglement rate per day of whale presence was such that it would be unsustainable for a population that fed regularly in Scottish waters.<br/><br/>The distribution of Humpbacks in the Arabian Sea overlaps that of fisheries known to be dangerous to Humpbacks, and 30-40% of the photographed whales showed entanglement-related scars (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The last comprehensive assessment of North Atlantic Humpback Whales was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2002 (IWC 2003), but more recent data are available for some areas. The abundance estimate for the West Indies group of breeding aggregations, obtained from photographic capture-recapture, was 10,752 whales in 1992-93 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.07) with an estimated annual rate of increase of 3.1% (standard error (SE) 0.5%) over the period 1979-93 (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2003). The latest abundance estimate for part of the Cape Verde Island population is 260 during 2010-2013, also from&#160;photographic capture-recapture&#160;(Ryan<em> et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The most recent estimates of abundance in the individual summer feeding grounds are: Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy - 823 in 2008 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Canadian Atlantic (Newfoundland, Labrador, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and Scotia Shelf) - 2,080 (CV 0.22) in 2007 (Lawson <em>and</em> Gosselin 2009); West Greenland - 993 (CV 0.46) in 2015 (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); East Greenland coastal and central North Atlantic (Iceland, East Greenland, Faeroes, Jan Mayen) 10,031 (CV 0.36) in 2015 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018); northeastern Atlantic (British Isles, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea) 1,450 (CV 0.29) in 2001 (Øien <em>et al</em>. 2009). These estimates total about 15,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.25.<br/><br/>The abundance of Humpback Whales in the Gulf of Maine and northwestern Atlantic was estimated to be growing at 6.5% per year during 1979-91 (Barlow and Clapham 1997) but the rate of increase was less than 4% per year during 1992-2000 (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003). Abundance in the central North Atlantic (East Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands) increased sharply from 1987 to 1995 but there has been no clear trend since then (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were subject to significant removals by pre-modern whalers especially in their wintering grounds in the West Indies and Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Reeves 2003). Whaling in the West Indies (including Bermuda) is partially documented from 1664, but the main period was 1826-1928, during which about 8,600 whales were estimated to have been killed (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001). Whaling in the Cape Verde Islands occurred primarily during 1850-1912 with a total estimated kill of about 3,000 animals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Humpbacks were exploited by modern whalers in their summer feeding grounds from the 1860s, especially off Iceland and Norway (Jonsgård 1977<em>,</em> Allison 2017). About 3,200 Humpback Whales were recorded taken by early modern whaling during 1880-1916, mainly off northern Norway and Iceland. Allowing for a substantial struck and lost rate in early modern whaling, and considering that about 20% of the recorded catch of whales was unspecified to species, the total kill in this period may have exceeded 5,000 Humpback Whales.<br/><br/>About 1,500 Humpback Whales are reported to have been killed in the North Atlantic since 1916, from a variety of areas including the British Isles, Faeroes, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, and eastern Canada, as well as Norwegian pelagic catches. Humpback Whales were protected from commercial whaling in the North Atlantic from the 1955 season by the IWC, except for small catches off Greenland (IWC 1954). However, catch levels had become very low by the 1920s, despite continued high catches of Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>). This suggests that the Humpback population was low at that time.<br/><br/>Attempts to estimate pre-whaling populations from catch, abundance and trend data have yielded inconclusive results (IWC 2003<em>,</em> Punt <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, the current population level is probably considerably higher than the 1942 level because only a small number of Humpbacks (377) were caught between 1942 and the start of the period (from 1979) over which an increase has been documented.<br/><br/>Using genetic methods, Roman and Palumbi (2004) estimated the pre-whaling population of&#160;Humpback Whales in the North Atlantic to be 240,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 156,000-401,000). However, their method assumed that North Atlantic Humpback Whales form a single clade, which they do not (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hence, the Roman and Palumbi estimate would be expected to reflect the global abundance of Humpback Whales prior to whaling rather than the North Atlantic population.<em><strong><br/><br/>North Pacific</strong></em><br/>The total abundance of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific was estimated by photographic capture-recapture at 21,063 (CV 0.04) during 2004-06 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). A comparable estimate from 1993-96 data, calculated retrospectively, was 9,500. The population appeared to have been increasing since 1980 at rates of 5-8% per year in each of the areas with sufficient data to estimate trend (Calambokidis and Barlow 2017). More recent data from the U.S. west coast suggest that numbers there have levelled off (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Using a different model for the relation between summering and wintering grounds applied to the same data as Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2011), Wade <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2016, revised by Wade 2017) estimated a total of 15,805 for the wintering grounds and 16,225 for the feeding grounds. It is not clear why Wade’s totals are lower than Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>.’s, but all evidence indicates that the Hawaiian group is the largest of the wintering populations, comprising 10,000-12,000 whales and making up at least half of the total North Pacific population. Estimates for the other breeding populations are Mexican (2,000-5,000), Asian (1,000-2,000) and Central American (300-1,000); no estimate exists for the Western Pacific (Mariana Islands) area.<br/><br/>Independent of the above data, the abundance of Humpback Whales in the eastern North Pacific (170°E to 135°W) and the eastern Bering Sea has been estimated from the Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment (POWER) series of sightings surveys at 14,407 (CV 0.56) (Inai <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Humpback Whales are also abundant west of these areas, in the western Bering Sea and near the western Aleutian Islands, eastern and western Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands (Miyashita <em>et al</em> 2006<em>,</em> Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>,</em> Gushcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were hunted in Japan at least since 1570 and catching probably increased with the development of net-assisted whaling from circa 1677 (Kasuya 2018). The number taken is very uncertain because detailed catch figures prior to the 20th century are available from only two of about a dozen locations where whaling occurred in southern Japan, on both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts (Omura 1986).&#160;The proportion of whales killed but lost is also unclear: although quite high rates of escape were indicated, it is unclear how many of these would have been mortally wounded. A single whaling firm operating in Kyushu (southwestern Japan), among several known to have been active, took 21,790 whales between 1725 and 1874, of which the majority were likely Humpbacks judging from the species breakdown at neighbouring locations. The data suggest a decline towards the end of the 19th century, but not as marked as for North Pacific Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena japonica</em>).<br/><br/>Building on the works of Maury (1852) and Townsend (1935), Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted by month the positions of about 250 catches and a few sightings of Humpbacks in the North Pacific from a sample of logbooks of American sail whalers in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.&#160;Humpback Whales occurred in most of the summering and wintering areas known today, including the Sea of Japan and Okhotsk Sea. The logbooks are thought to comprise about 10% of all American voyages, but it is unclear how representative they are, especially of the earlier voyages. Furthermore, at least some European vessels were also active in the North Pacific.&#160;It is possible that a few thousand Humpback Whales were taken. Also in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, American shore-based whalers operating on the coast of California killed an estimated 2,000 Humpback Whales between 1854 and 1899 (Reeves <em>and</em> Smith 2010).<br/><br/>Modern whaling began in Japan in 1898 and catches by species are recorded since 1911. Humpback Whales made up only 2.0% (950 out of 47,343) of the catch of large whales in Japan (including the occupied Kuril Islands) during 1911-45, and only 0.2% (90 out of 48,010) of the catch of large whales in Japan during 1946-65 (Allison, 2017). Thus, the Asian migratory population was likely already depleted before the start of modern whaling, and already commercially extinct by the time the catching of Humpbacks in the North Pacific was prohibited by the IWC from 1966 (IWC 1965). Subgroups of the Asian wintering population that used more oceanic migratory corridors probably survived a bit longer, given that over 800 Humpbacks were taken in Ogasawara (Bonin Islands) between 1922-1945, nearly 800 in Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands) during 1958-62, and over 700 in Taiwan during 1920-39.<br/><br/>Approximately 18,000 Humpbacks are recorded as being taken by modern whaling along the American coasts during 1911-65 (5,000 in Alaska, 6,000 in British Columbia, 5,000 in California and Washington, and 2,000 off Baja California, Mexico) (Allison 2017). &#160;Modern pelagic whaling began in the 1930s and a total of over 8,000 Humpback Whales were taken, including 7,714 by fleets of the USSR, which illegally took 248 Humpback Whales after catches had been prohibited by the IWC (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Estimated catches of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific since 1942 total approximately 10,700 whales (Allison 2017). Given the evidence of an increase of over 10,000 whales between the 1980s and the early the 2000s, it is likely that the current population size in the North Pacific as a whole is above the 1942 level.<br/><br/>The Hawaiian wintering population is today the largest of the extant wintering populations. The 19<sup>th</sup> century records include relatively few catches or sightings of Humpbacks in this area, even though Hawaii was a major staging area for long-distance whalers in the Pacific. The thesis of Herman (1979) that Humpbacks were uncommon in Hawaii in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and earlier, based on the paucity of references to Humpbacks in contemporary accounts and local folklore, is controversial. However, it is plausible that Humpbacks were historically less abundant in Hawaii than they are today.<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Population estimates derived from photo-identification conducted in the Arabian Sea during 2000-04 were all less than 100 animals (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011). Provisional analysis of data collected during 2000-2015 yielded an abundance estimate of 89 whales (CV 0.26) in 2015, which may be negatively biased due to heterogeneity (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Soviet whaling fleet <em>Sovetskaya Ukraina</em> illegally took 238 Humpback Whales off the coasts of Oman, Pakistan, and northwestern India in November 1966 (Mikhalev 1997). The current population is very small and its current trend is not known. This population is listed separately as Endangered under Red List criterion D (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>Results of the IWC Scientific Committee’s multi-year “comprehensive assessment” of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, completed in 2015, are summarized by IWC (2016). The estimated total population size in 2015 was 97,000 (CI 78,000-118,000),&#160;obtained from a mix of photographic and genetic capture-recapture, aerial surveys, and shore-based censuses. The estimated total population size in 1942, from a fitted population model, was about 60,000 (confidence interval not given) while the estimated “pre-whaling” population size in 1900 was 138,000 (CI 112,000-198,000). All breeding populations were estimated to have recovered to a substantial fraction of their pre-whaling abundance, except for the West South Africa (BSB2) population, which may still be quite depleted.<br/><br/>The IWC comprehensive assessment assumed that catches by pre-modern whalers were small enough, or long enough ago, to be ignored. However, de Morais <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated catches of 11,000-33,000 Humpback Whales from pre-modern land whaling stations (armações) in Brazil during 1830-1924, and considered it likely that there had been similarly sizeable catches in the preceding century. From samples of logbooks of late 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century sail whalers, Townsend (1935) and Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted positions for about 2,000 Humpback catches and sightings in the Southern Hemisphere. These show presence of Humpbacks in most of the wintering grounds known today, except for northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef probably made access too risky. The 19<sup>th</sup> century whalers did not follow their prey to their Antarctic summering grounds. No attempt has yet been made to estimate total removals from the logbook samples.<br/><br/>The recorded catches by 20<sup>th</sup> century whaling in the Southern Hemisphere total about 220,000, after allowing for some Humpbacks among the 5,000 unspecified whales taken in the early years (Allison 2017). Of the total, about 83,500 were taken by pelagic whaling fleets in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, which started in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century mainly south of 55°S; about 40,000 from land stations in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, mainly at South Georgia; about 29,000 along the west coast of southern Africa (Gabon, Angola, Namibia, and western South Africa); about 20,000 in the southwestern Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mozambique, and Natal (South Africa); over 28,000 off western Australia; over 14,000 off eastern Australia and New Zealand; about 2,500 in the Southeast Pacific (Chile, Peru, and Ecuador); and about 2,000 off Brazil.<br/><br/>Attempts by the IWC to manage the hunting of Humpbacks in the Southern Hemisphere had limited effect. Takes of Humpbacks by pelagic fleets in the Southern Ocean (south of 40°S) were prohibited in the initial Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling that was adopted in 1946 and came into force in 1948. This ban was relaxed from 1950 to allow an annual catch of 1,250 Humpbacks, but the numerical limit was often exceeded and was dropped from 1954 when Humpback catching was instead limited to four days in February. From 1959, increasingly restrictive area limits were imposed. The report of an IWC expert group in June 1963 inferred from the continuing steep decline in the Humpback population that substantial unreported catches had occurred (Chapman 1964). The IWC finally banned all catching of Humpbacks throughout the Southern Hemisphere from 1964 (IWC 1965). Subsequently, it emerged that Humpback catches by the USSR fleets had indeed exceeded the reported values by about 46,000 whales, and had continued until 1968, with small takes continuing until 1973 (Zemsky <em>et al</em>. 1996<em>,</em> Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even before the 1964 Humpback ban, almost all of the additional Soviet catches had been illegal in at least one respect: they were either outside the permitted season, outside the permitted areas, below the minimum allowed body size, or of mothers with calves.<br/><br/>The IWC Scientific Committee’s recent comprehensive assessment, which took account of the previously unreported catches, showed that the current hemispheric population was, by now, very likely above its 1942 level. The assessment probably reflects the current population size and the trends over recent decades quite well, but both the estimates of pre-whaling population size, and the projections of future recovery, are probably more uncertain than the assessment results suggest, for the following reasons; firstly, as noted above, the pre-modern catches may not have been insignificant; secondly, simulation studies by Leaper <em>et al</em>. (2011) showed that alternative assumptions about density-dependent limitation can yield substantially different estimated population trajectories for both the past and the future; finally, Clapham and Zerbini (2015) cautioned that a key model assumption, that all historical breeding areas will be repopulated, may not hold when social factors are considered.<em><strong><br/><br/>Global Assessment</strong></em><br/>The mean age at first reproduction for Humpback Whales is estimated to be 10-12 years in the Southern Hemisphere (Best 2011) with a similar value in the North Pacific (Gabriele <em>et al</em>. 2007). Clapham (1992) reported a value of 5-7 years for Humpbacks in the Gulf of Maine, North Atlantic, but this increased to about 9 years for cohorts born in 1987 and later (Robbins 2007). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) cited 6 years as a reasonable default value, based on Clapham (1992). Taking a compromise value of 10 years, the generation time of 21.5 years estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) would become 25.5 years. Hence the 3-generation time window for applying the reduction criterion (A1) for a threatened category is 1942-2018.<br/><br/>Using the proportion mature of 0.62 estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007), the recent global population contains approximately 84,000 mature individuals out of a total of 135,000 whales. The population in 2018 is estimated to be above the 1942 level in each of the major ocean regions (North Atlantic, North Pacific, Southern Hemisphere). The small Arabian Sea population is probably below the 1942 level, because of the illegal catches taken in the 1960s.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p></p><p>The Humpback Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all the major ocean basins, and all but one of the subpopulations (that of the Arabian Sea) migrate between mating and calving grounds in tropical waters, usually near continental coastlines or island groups and productive colder-water feeding areas in temperate and high latitudes (Dawbin 1966, Clapham and Mead 1999). There tends to be strong, maternally directed fidelity to feeding and breeding grounds, but with some interchange between grounds, especially of males but also of females (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>Humpbacks in the North Atlantic range in summer from the Gulf of Maine in the west to the British Isles and Norway in the east. The northern extent of the Humpback's range includes the Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Davis Strait, but unlike Bowhead Whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>), they do not enter the pack ice. A number of main feeding grounds have been identified: Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, west of Greenland, west of Iceland, northeast Iceland, Jan Mayen, northern Norway, Bear Island, and western Svalbard (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Smaller numbers have been observed feeding in other areas such as the Hudson River Estuary (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2018). Humpback Whales are rare in the central and southern North Sea and there are very few records from the Baltic Sea. Humpback Whales were previously very rare in the Mediterranean Sea; there has been a notable increase in sightings since 1990, but they are still not common (Russo <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The main wintering grounds are in the West Indies and wider Caribbean region where they are found along the entire Antillean arc from Cuba to Venezuela (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The largest aggregations occur on Silver and Navidad Banks near the Dominican Republic, with much lower numbers in Samana Bay (Dominican Republic), off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico, and around the Virgin Islands and the eastern Antilles. Smaller numbers winter around the Cape Verde Islands (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009). There is some interchange of individuals between the eastern and western Atlantic wintering grounds (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2016), and some whales may remain in colder, more northern waters throughout the winter (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1993<em>,</em> Magnúsdóttir <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>,</em> Kowarski 2018).<br/><br/>While whales wintering in the Caribbean region have been matched photographically or genetically with whales in each of the summer feeding grounds, whales from the smaller Cape Verde Islands wintering group have to date been matched only with the northeastern feeding grounds. Individuals from the Cape Verdes have also been observed in spring in the Azores, where they appear to stop over to feed while on their way north (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009<em>,</em> Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011). The genetic and photographic evidence suggests that some of the whales on the Icelandic and Norwegian feeding grounds migrate in winter to an unknown area other than the West Indies or the Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Pike 2009).<br/><br/>The Humpback Whales that occur in the austral winter north of the equator along the African coast from Gabon to Guinea are known or presumed to be Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales (Bamy <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong></strong><br/>In the North Pacific, the Humpback Whale’s summer range covers shelf waters from southern California to the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, the Aleutian chain and Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, and northeastern Japan (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Humpbacks were hunted in the Sea of Japan and the Okhotsk Sea and in the past (Kasuya 2018<em>,</em> Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012). They were for some time rare in the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), but recently have been seen in the eastern and northern Okhotsk Sea (Guschcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>,</em> Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Humpbacks are not common in the Sea of Japan but continue to be taken occasionally as bycatch in Korean waters. Recent occurrence in the Beaufort Sea may be linked to warming climate trends (Hashagen <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds identified to date include (from west to east) are: 1) Asian – Ogasawara (Bonin Islands), Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands), and northern Philippines; 2) west-central Pacific (presumed to be the area of the Mariana Islands, including Guam); 3). Hawaiian; 4) Mexican - Baja California, Gulf of California, Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Mexican mainland; and 5) Central American – Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia (IWC 2018a).<br/><br/>The least well-known wintering area is the west-central Pacific, because only a few whales have been observed there (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017), but the existence of a substantial wintering ground had been inferred from the substantial proportion of Humpback Whales in the Aleutian Islands that could not be matched to other known wintering grounds (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). It remains to be determined whether this is the Marianas region, which was a Humpback whaling ground in the 19<sup>th</sup> century (Townsend 1935).<br/><br/>The Central American wintering ground overlaps the winter range of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, but there is probably not much temporal overlap because the Southern Humpback Whales occupy the area in the austral winter (Rasmussen <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Small numbers of Humpbacks have recently been seen at previously unknown winter locations such as Amami-Ohshima Island (28°N 129°E) and Hachijō-jima Island (33°N 140°E, about 300km south of Tokyo, Japan) (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The various wintering populations have different summer distributions but with considerable overlap. The whales wintering off Central America and mainland Mexico feed mainly off the coasts California, Oregon and Washington (USA), while whales from the Revillagigedo Islands feed mainly in the Gulf of Alaska (Urbán <em>et al</em>. 2017). Whales wintering off Hawaii are found in summer mainly in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska (including Southeast Alaska) and the waters of British Columbia (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Most of the whales summering off Kamchatka migrate to the Asian wintering grounds, a lower number to the Hawaiian grounds, and a few to the Mexican grounds (Titova <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Movements between wintering grounds have also been documented (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008) but these appear to be sufficiently few that the wintering populations remain genetically differentiated, especially with respect to mtDNA, which reflects maternal lineages (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><em></em><br/>The majority of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales migrate to the Antarctic in summer. They are abundant throughout the Antarctic in summer south to the ice edge, but not within the pack ice zone. There are also subantarctic summer feeding grounds around South Georgia (Dawbin 1966<em>,</em> Engel <em>and</em> Martin 2009) and the Fuegian archipelago (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Some mothers with calves remain in mid-latitude waters in the Chilean fjords in the summer (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the winter, Southern Hemisphere whales aggregate in specific nearshore breeding areas in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, at least two of which extend north of the equator, i.e. off Colombia and Central America in the eastern Pacific and in the Bight of Benin (5°N, 2°E) in the eastern Atlantic. Some wintering grounds are fairly localized, for example around island groups, and some are more diffuse, such as along the west coast of southern Africa and the coast of West Africa. As evidenced by acoustic detections, part of the population remains in the Antarctic in winter (van Opzeeland <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The currently known wintering grounds, with the names originally assigned by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (IWC 1998) but with some subsequent regrouping (IWC 2017), are:<br/><br/>A. Western South Atlantic: Coast of Brazil from Cabo São Roque (5°S) to Cabo Frio (23°S), but especially on the Abrolhos Bank (17-20°S);<br/><br/>B. Eastern South Atlantic: Benin Bight and Gulf of Guinea, from the waters of the Republic of Congo to the waters of Guinea (B1), West coast of southern Africa, including waters of South Africa, Namibia and Angola (B2);<br/><br/>C. Southwestern Indian Ocean: Coast of Natal, northeastern South Africa &#160;East Africa, including waters of Mozambique, Tanzania (incl. Zanzibar), Mayotte and the Comoros Islands (C1+C2), Eastern and southern Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius (C3+C4);<br/><br/>D. Western Australia: migration along the west Australian coast to wintering grounds off northwestern Australia;<br/><br/>E. Eastern Australia and Southwest Pacific: Eastern Australia (E1),<br/><br/>F. Oceania: New Caledonia (E2), Fiji and Tonga (E3), Cook Islands (F1), French Polynesia (F2);<br/><br/>G. Eastern South and equatorial Pacific: &#160;Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The groups A-G were originally considered to represent main breeding populations with the numbered sub-groups representing subpopulations. However, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently grouped subgroups E2, E3, F1 and F2 together as the Oceania breeding population. Subgroups C1 and C2 were combined, as have C3 and C4.<br/><br/>The feeding ranges of the different populations overlap in the Antarctic, with some movement of individuals around the Antarctic (IWC 1998), but overall the whales appear to feed preferentially in the sectors nearest to their wintering grounds. The sex ratio in the wintering areas tends to be biased towards males, potentially reflecting a reduced presence of females in their non-calving years or a generally shorter residence time of females (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). Rare movements of both sexes between breeding populations have been observed (e.g., western Africa to Madagascar (Pomilla and Rosenbaum 2005) and Brazil to Madagascar (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2011)).<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><em><strong></strong></em><br/>There is a resident year-round population in the Arabian Sea, whose range includes the waters of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011) and which is genetically isolated from other Humpback Whales (Pomilla <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, song types characteristic of Humpback Whales in the southwestern Indian Ocean have been detected off Oman (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2018); this could indicate the presence of Humpbacks from different populations in the Arabian Sea, or that Arabian Sea Humpbacks sometimes venture further afield and acquire new songs.<br/><br/>Only a few calves have been seen in the Arabian Sea, but from foetus sizes in pregnant whales captured in November 1966, Mikhalev (1997) concluded that the peak calving season is probably in February, with some spread. This is in contrast to Southern Humpback Whales, where peak calving occurs in July-August (Clapham and Mead 1999).<br/><br/>There have been a few records in the Persian Gulf, including the type specimen for <em>M. indica</em> (Gervais 1883) assumed to be a Humpback Whale; these were previously regarded as vagrants, but it is now thought that the regular range extends into the Persian Gulf (Dakhteh <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales seem to be quite rare in Indian waters (Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008) but there have been occasional strandings (Sutaria 2018) and acoustic detections (Madhusudhana <em>et al</em>. 2018) along the west coast. Of 14 individuals satellite-tagged off Oman during 2014-17, one was tracked to Goa and thence to the southern tip of India by January 2018 and back to the tagging site by March 2018 (Willson <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two specimens from the west coast of Sri Lanka (a bycatch in 1981 and a stranding in 1990) (Ilangakoon 2006) and Humpback Whale songs have been during February and March 1982 in the Gulf of Mannar, NW Sri Lanka (Whitehead 1985). Humpback Whales seem to be rare or absent in the northeastern Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.<br/><br/>There have been several sightings over the past 10 years in the northern Red Sea, including the Gulf of Aqaba, but the provenance of those Humpback Whales is unclear (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Large-scale exploitation of this species has ceased, but hunting for local consumption continues in Greenland and the island of Bequia (eastern&#160; Caribbean) (IWC 2018b).

The last substantial catches occurred in 1968. Despite having been severely depleted to a world population in the low thousands at that time, Humpbacks have recovered strongly to a world population that is estimated at over 80,000 mature animals and is increasing.<br/><br/>Humpback Whales enjoy additional protective measures, such as sanctuaries, in a number of countries.

In some parts of this range during summer they may aggregate at tidewater glacier fronts (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2014, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). In autumn, Narwhals migrate with the forming fast ice to wintering areas that tend to be deep, offshore, ice-covered habitats along the continental slope (Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are highly adapted to winter habitats with limited open water (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). Few other cetaceans use areas with such dense sea ice cover, and Narwhals have remarkable site fidelity to these areas. They may dive to depths of over 1,500 m multiple times per day and spend over 3 h per day at depths of 800 m (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003,<em></em> 2010). A double-platform visual aerial survey over a Narwhal wintering ground in West Greenland found high densities of whales in the leads and cracks of the Baffin Bay pack ice, up to an average density of about 77 Narwhals/km² (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011).</p>  <p></p><p>In the winter, Narwhals feed intensively at the sea floor (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, <em></em>2004; Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a) but some subpopulations may also feed on pelagic prey (Watt and Ferguson 2014). A major portion of the annual energy intake is obtained during the winter. Although there seems to be relatively little feeding activity during the summer, Narwhals apparently feed opportunistically during this time. Narwhal sighting probability in winter in habitats with &lt;50% open water is significantly higher than sighting probability in habitats with &gt;50% open water, suggesting that the animals select for optimal foraging areas in dense pack ice regardless of the availability of open water (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). In the autumn and winter Narwhals are vulnerable to ice entrapments, or sassats, when rapidly changing conditions cause open-water areas used by the whales to freeze over and trap them, sometimes leading to suffocation (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). Calving occurs in spring during the northbound (or in some populations inshore) migration that coincides with the receding sea ice. There is remarkable consistency across Narwhal subpopulations in the types of habitat used, in site fidelity to migration routes and summering and wintering areas, and in feeding patterns (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Fish, squid, and shrimp make up the Narwhal’s diet (Hay and Mansfield 1989, Heide-Jørgensen 2009), especially Arctic fish species, such as Greenland Halibut (<em>R</em><em>einhardtius hippoglossoides</em>), Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), and Polar Cod (<em>Arctogadus glacialis</em>) (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a).</p>  <p></p>","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease (see also Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance among the many Narwhal subpopulations varies. </p>  <p>Narwhals were never the targets of large-scale commercial hunting except for a brief period of several decades of the early 20th century in the eastern Canadian Arctic (Mitchell and Reeves 1981). They were hunted opportunistically by commercial whalers, explorers and adventurers in many parts of their range. At present, Narwhals are hunted only in some indigenous communities in Canada and Greenland – for both human consumption and for ivory (see Use and Trade). In some communities Narwhal carcasses are at least partially used as dog food. The strong fidelity of Narwhals, which causes them to return to the same nearshore areas each summer, makes them highly vulnerable to overexploitation. In nearly all parts of their range, hunting is now controlled by limits on harvest levels that are judged to be sustainable (NAMMCO in prep.) (also see the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section) </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial loss of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), including changes in the timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015, Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The effects of climate change on Narwhals are uncertain. Broad changes in the ecosystem may influence the distribution of their prey. Narwhals are well adapted to a life in the pack ice as indicated by the fact that there is very little open water in their winter habitat (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005b), and they can be found in high densities in areas with more than 98% ice coverage (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). They spend much of their time in heavy ice and in some areas are vulnerable to ice entrapments where hundreds can become trapped in a small opening in the sea ice and die (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). This occurs when sudden changes in weather conditions (such as shifts in wind or rapid drops in temperature) freeze shut leads and cracks that the Narwhals were using, and such entrapment may be occurring more often as autumn freeze-up occurs later in the year and on an unpredictable schedule (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). When entrapped whales are discovered by hunters, they normally are harvested. Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) are known to prey on Narwhal in summering areas (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the presence Killer Whales in such areas can greatly affect Narwhal behavior (Breed <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sea ice normally inhibits movements of Killer Whales, and Higdon and Ferguson (2009) documented substantial increases in Killer Whale presence in Hudson Bay when sea ice reduction allowed them to pass through Hudson Strait. An assessment of the sensitivity of all arctic marine mammals to climate change ranked the Narwhal as one of the three most sensitive species, primarily due to its narrow geographic distribution, specialized feeding and habitat choice, and high site fidelity (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p>Known or potential threats to Narwhals include a variety of commercial human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is facilitating increases in the scale and distribution of those activities. Oil and gas development is ongoing and expanding, and along with commercial shipping is likely to modify and degrade habitat used by Narwhals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas in Greenland and arctic Russia are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which often includes seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by ice breaking and shipping. Finley <em>et al</em>. (1990) found that Narwhals at an ice edge reacted strongly to ice-breaking ships, and Cosens and Duek (1993) concluded that Narwhals would likely be able to detect the high-frequency components of icebreaker noise 25-30 km from the source. Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> (2013) speculated that noise from seismic surveys, at least in some contexts, could enhance the susceptibility of Narwhals to ice-entrapment.</p>  <p>Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants that are high enough to cause impacts on health and reproductive performance (Ross 2000). Organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants have been found in Narwhals in several areas (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2004). At Svalbard, Wolkers <em>et al</em>. (2006) found that levels of contaminants in Narwhals were higher than those in Beluga Whales (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>). </p>  <p></p><p>Commercial fisheries for Greenland Halibut operate in both the Canada and Greenland sides of Baffin Bay/Davis Strait and have done so on the inshore Greenland side for several decades (Treble and Bowering 2002). This fishing overlaps spatially with where Narwhals winter and feed extensively on the target species, Greenland Halibut (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Narwhals are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2006), but significant epizootics have not been recorded. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2001) found a low prevalence of exposure to <em>Brucella</em> spp. in Narwhals sampled in arctic Canada. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2000) found no serological evidence of exposure to morbilliviruses, and speculated that because they are immunologically naïve, Narwhals are at considerable risk of a serious epidemic if they become exposed. Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could influence disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The global Narwhal population consists of about 12 subpopulations with varying degrees of genetic differentiation and geographical isolation (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to incomplete sampling in parts of the range, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee recognized two stocks of Narwhal but noted that there were probably more that were not yet recognized (IWC 2000). A recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids (GROM) hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 12 Narwhal stocks (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>Discrimination and definition of subpopulations are based mostly on nearshore areas (principally fjords and bays) where Narwhals congregate during summer. Genetic studies, satellite telemetry, traditional ecological knowledge, stable isotope values, and contaminant analyses have shown that Narwhals have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (e.g., Palsbøll <em>et al.</em> 1997, Riget <em>et al</em>. 2002, de March <em>et al</em>. 2003, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2013). <br/></p>  <p>Available information on sizes of Narwhal subpopulations is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Northern Hudson Bay</strong></p>  <p></p><p>Narwhals from the Northern Hudson Bay subpopulation summer in northwestern Hudson Bay, particularly in Repulse Bay and in waters around Southampton Island. They winter in eastern Hudson Strait (Richard 1991, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010). The abundance of Northern Hudson Bay Narwhals in 2011, corrected for perception bias (animals that were at the surface but not seen by observers) and availability bias (animals too deep to be seen by observers), was estimated as 12,485 (CV 0.21; Asselin <em>et al</em>. 2012). Richard (1991) reported results of surveys conducted in 1982, 1983, and 1984 that were limited to areas with less than 20% ice cover and his estimates were not corrected for availability. Abundance estimates from Richard (1991) ranged from 1,038 to 1,517 but were certainly biased negatively. A similar survey in 2000 estimated uncorrected abundance as 1,780 (Bourassa 2003). Abundance of this subpopulation is believed to be fairly stable (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Somerset Island</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Somerset Island subpopulation range over a large area in the eastern Canadian Arctic. During summer, satellite-tagged animals were mostly concentrated around Somerset Island and they spent winter in Baffin Bay (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). The abundance of Somerset Island Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 49,768 (CV 0.20; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Previous abundance surveys were flown in 1982, 1996, and 2002. The corrected estimate for 1982 was 27,656 (CV 0.54; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggests that abundance has been increasing. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Admiralty Inlet</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals from the Admiralty Inlet subpopulation remain in and near the Inlet during summer, and spend winter in the Baffin Bay region (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2012). The most recent abundance estimate for Admiralty Inlet Narwhals comes from aerial line-transect surveys flown in 2013 (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). When corrected for perception and availability biases the abundance estimate for this stock was 35,043 (CV 0.42). Four previous surveys in 1975, 1985, 2003, and 2010 yielded lower mean abundance estimates with wide confidence intervals. Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggested that abundance has been stable. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eclipse Sound</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Eclipse Sound subpopulation generally stay in and near the Sound in the summer, and winter in Baffin Bay (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). The abundance of Eclipse Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 10,489 (CV 0.24; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). A previous survey in 2004 produced a higher corrected estimate of 20,225 with wide confidence limits (95% CL 9,471-37,096; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Available data are insufficient to detect any trend in abundance for this subpopulation (Witting 2016). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Baffin Island</strong></p>  <p>The Eastern Baffin Island Narwhal subpopulation summers in Cumberland Sound and along the Baffin Island coast to the north, and winters in northern Davis Strait (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). Abundance in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 17,555 (CV 0.35; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys in 2003 that had similar coverage of the eastern Baffin Island fiord area produced a corrected estimate of 10,073 (SE 3,123) Narwhals in the surveyed region (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Available data are insufficient to detect any trend in abundance for this subpopulation (Witting 2016).&#160;  </p><p><strong>Jones Sound</strong></p>  <p>  </p><p>The Jones Sound subpopulation of Narwhals summers between Devon Island and Ellesmere Island and in fiords of western Ellesmere Island. Jones Sound Narwhals have not been tagged and tracked, and their distribution at times of year other than summer is unknown (NAMMCO in prep.). The abundance of Jones Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 12,694 (CV 0.33; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). That is the only abundance survey conducted in Jones Sound so <a name=""_Hlk486932453"">there is no information on trend for this subpopulation</a>. </p>    <p><strong>Smith Sound</strong></p>  <p> </p><p>The Smith Sound Narwhal subpopulation summers along the southeastern coast of Ellesmere Island (Richard 2010); its wintering area is unknown. Abundance of Smith Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 16,360 (CV 0.65; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). That is the only abundance estimate for Smith Sound so there is no information on trend for this subpopulation. </p>  <p><strong>Inglefield Bredning</strong></p><p>This subpopulation of Narwhals summers in Inglefield Bredning which is its major concentration area in northwestern Greenland (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994). Little is known about distribution at other times of year. Abundance of Inglefield Bredning Narwhals in 2007, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 8,368 (CV 0.25; Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). Previous surveys of this subpopulation were conducted in 1985-86 (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994) and 2001-02 (Heide‐Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2004) with generally similar results, and abundance appears to be stable (Witting 2016).&#160; <br/></p>  <p><strong>Melville Bay</strong></p>  <p> </p><p>The Melville Bay Narwhal subpopulation spends the ice-free season in and near Melville Bay, and may spend significant time at the fronts of coastal glaciers that are important habitats for them (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). With freeze-up they move south to the southern part of Baffin Bay for overwintering (Dietz and Heide-Jørgensen 1995). Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported that the range of Narwhals in Melville Bay contracted over the period from 2007 to 2014. Abundance in 2014, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 3,091 (95% CI 1,228-7,783). Previous surveys resulted in estimates of 5,605 whales (95% CI 1,319-23,815) in 2007 and 2,983 (95% CI 1,452-6,127) in 2012 (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2014). Confidence limits for all three surveys overlap broadly and abundance appears fairly stable (Witting 2016). </p>  <p><strong>Northeast Greenland</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals assigned to the Northeast Greenland subpopulation are frequently seen during May-August in Young Sound (74°N) and along the coast as far north as Nordost Rundingen (82°N; Boertmann <em>et al</em>. 2009). There has been no attempt to estimate abundance of Narwhals in north-eastern Greenland, but surveys of the area were planned for 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.).<strong>&#160; </strong><strong><br/></strong></p>  <p><strong>East Greenland</strong></p>  <p></p><p>In summer Narwhals occur along the east coast of Greenland mostly from about 64° to 72° N, but they have been reported at more than 81° (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994), which means the distinction between Northeast and East Greenland Narwhals is uncertain. Narwhals are relatively common in Scoresby Sound and the Kangerlussuaq fjord (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). They winter in sea ice in the Greenland Sea and Fram Strait, but winter observations are sparse (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Aerial surveys conducted in Scoresby Sound in 1983-84 and from Tasiilaq to Scoresby Sound in 2008 and 2016 resulted in conflicting results, leading to the conclusion (as of summer 2017) that Narwhals off East Greenland are widely scattered and may number fewer than 1,000 individuals (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Svalbard- Russia</strong><br/></p><p>Narwhals that occur around Svalbard and in the northwestern Russian High Arctic have been little studied but they are thought to be widely distributed in low numbers throughout this region (Heide-Jørgensen 2009). Gjertz (1991) described previous observations and catches that were largely west and north of Svalbard. In August 1998, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. (2007) tagged three subadult Narwhals at Svalbard with satellite-relay data loggers and tracked them for up to 46 days. The whales spent time in fiords in western Svalbard, then moved north and east to deep offshore waters north of 80°N. A survey in the marginal ice zone north of Svalbard in August 2015 produced a corrected estimate of 837 (CV 0.50) Narwhals, but this estimate is negatively biased because the study area did not include the whole range used by Narwhals around Svalbard (Vacquie-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are no estimates of abundance for other areas and overall abundance and trend for this subpopulation are unknown (NAMMCO in prep.). &#160;  </p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p></p><p>The sum of the abundance estimates for the 12 Narwhal subpopulations listed above is 173,134. There is no estimate for Northeast Greenland and the figure for the Svalbard-Russia region is known to be an underestimate because only a portion of the known range was surveyed. If 71% of the overall Narwhal population consists of mature animals (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), the minimum number of mature individuals would be 122,925. The number of mature individuals in the largest subpopulation (Somerset Island) is estimated as 35,335. For the six subpopulations for which there is some information on trend, one is thought to be increasing and five are likely stable. </p>  <p>The generation length for the Narwhal was estimated as 21.9 years by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) and as 30 and 33 years in East and West Greenland, respectively, by Garde <em>et al</em>. (2015) using aspartic acid ageing. Using these estimates, three generations is 66-99 years. For most subpopulations, abundance estimates for years prior to 2000 do not exist, so trends in abundance over a three-generation period cannot be calculated.</p>  <p></p><p>  </p><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p></p>",Unknown,"Narwhals primarily inhabit the Arctic, including northeastern Canada, northern Greenland, Svalbard, and waters of northern Russia as far east as the East Siberian Sea. Their principal distribution is from the central Canadian Arctic (Peel Sound – Prince Regent Inlet and northern Hudson Bay) eastward to Greenland (Rice 1998). In the Canada-Greenland region in summer, Narwhals spend approximately two months in the high Arctic, largely in bays and fjords; they overwinter in offshore, deep, partially ice-covered habitat along the continental slope (Heide-Jørgensen and Dietz 1995). Narwhals migrate annually between these disjunct seasonal concentration areas, with the migratory periods lasting approximately two months (Koski and Davis 1994, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). Vagrants have been recorded at Newfoundland, the British Isles, Germany, and the Netherlands in the east, and in the Chukchi and Bering seas as far south as the Alaska Peninsula and Commander Islands (Rice 1998).","<p>Narwhals are hunted in Canada and Greenland for human and animal food and for tusk ivory. They supply various staples in the traditional subsistence economy. Today the main products are mattak (skin with some blubber attached) and ivory (Reeves 1993, Reeves and Heide-Jørgensen 1994, Heide-Jørgensen 1994). Narwhal tusks from Canada and Greenland are sold in specialty souvenir markets domestically and are also exported, either as whole tusks or as carved items. </p><p>In the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012), intense hunting of Narwhals (including associated loss due to wounding and sinking) in Greenland and Canada was described as a cause for concern, particularly given the lack of reliable data on hidden mortality and serious injury (see Finley and Miller 1982). Statistics on the number of Narwhals reported as landed by the hunting communities are available starting in the 1950s for Greenland and the 1970s for Canada (NAMMCO in prep.).​ Data summarized by Shadbolt<em> et al</em>. (2015) for the period 2007-2011 show a mean annual retrieved catch of 358 in Greenland and 621 in Canada. The Canadian catch was unusually large due to 624 Narwhals being taken from an ice entrapment event in 2008. Watt and Hall (2016) presented Canadian harvest data that had been corrected for estimated struck and lost. Those data indicate that the total number of Narwhals killed in Canada averaged 620/year (range 515-768) during 2011-2015. <br/></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>The Narwhal is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). As a result, a non-detriment finding (NDF; analysis showing that the taking and trade is not detrimental to the species’ survival or to maintenance of the species “throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystems in which it occurs”) by the Scientific Authority of the exporting country is required for export. This requirement has had the effect of forcing both Canada and Greenland to document catch and trade levels and to provide data on abundance and trends of hunted Narwhal stocks. Negative NDFs were issued for both countries (Greenland in 2005, Canada in 2010; Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015) making exports of Narwhal ivory from several stocks in Canada illegal for a brief period in 2010-11 and leading to a temporary export ban in Greenland in 2006. This ban remained in effect through at least February 2014 despite the fact that new information reported in 2009 indicated that removal levels for at least some stocks in Greenland were sustainable (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015). The NAMMCO Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic and the JCNB [Canada/Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga] Scientific Working Group meet jointly every other year to review new information on the biology of Narwhals and Belugas, update assessments, and provide advice to the Canada and Greenland governments based, in part, on a catch allocation model designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of removals from the various stocks (NAMMCO 2016, in prep.). Greenland’s annual report to NAMMCO in 2016 (NAMMCO 2017) noted that the NDF for 2016 compared catches and advice for 2013, 2014, and 2015, concluding that, “as a whole, in the period 2013-2015, catches … followed the advice from NAMMCO, JCNB or IWC for all stocks, except Narwhals in Inglefield Bredning, Melville Bay, Ittoqqortormiit and Tasiilaq.”<br/> <br/> The European Union established an import ban on Narwhal tusks in December 2004. This ban apparently was lifted in February 2010 in response to the fact that Greenland had introduced a quota system “based on scientific advice and more accurate population abundance numbers” (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Killer Whales are numerically abundant (at least tens of thousands of mature individuals) and very widely distributed. Experts agree that the present taxon likely includes more than one subspecies, and possibly multiple species. Some small regional populations are known to have declined significantly and would easily qualify for a threatened status if assessed individually (e.g., ENP southern residents, the Bluefin Tuna-dependent population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar), but there is insufficient evidence to support a global decline in the species abundance that would make it meet Criterion A. However, the statement in the previous species assessment (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2013) still holds: “The combination of potential declines driven by depletion of prey resources and the effects of pollutants is believed sufficient that a 30% global reduction over three generations (77 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out for some ‘groups’ that may [eventually] be designated as species.” <br/></p>  <p>Although considerable effort continues to be made on improved understanding of the taxonomy of the genus <em>Orcinus</em>, the taxonomic issues have not been fully resolved. This is especially problematic due to the occurrence of sympatric, non-interbreeding ecotypes in the ENP, Antarctic, and possibly elsewhere. The taxon has previously been listed by IUCN as Data Deficient due to taxonomic uncertainty, and that listing should be continued until proper taxonomic units are described and Red List assessments of them can be carried out.</p>","<p>Killer Whales are known to   feed on a wide array of prey, including most marine mammal species (except river dolphins and Manatees), seabirds, sea turtles, many species of fish   (including sharks and rays) and cephalopods (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Ford   and Ellis 1999, Ford 2009). They have a diversity of foraging tactics,   including intentional beaching to capture pinnipeds on shore, creating waves   to wash seals off ice floes, and using cooperative techniques to herd fish   and to attack large prey such as Tuna and large whales (Dahlheim and Heyning   1999, Baird 2000, Pitman and Durban 2012).</p><p>Although Killer Whales are a generalist as a species, at least some   subpopulations (ecotypes and/or morphotypes) specialize on particular types   of prey (Bigg <em>et al</em>. 1990, Baird 2000). Studies in coastal waters of   the ENP, from California to Alaska, have described three distinct ecotypes of   Killer Whales, referred to as residents, transients (or Bigg’s Killer Whales),   and offshores. Although distinguished by ecological differences, there are   also differences in coloration, external morphology, behavior and acoustics   (Ford and Ellis 2014). The three ecotypes maintain social isolation from each   other (<em>i.e</em>., no interbreeding)   despite sometimes overlapping ranges. The ENP residents are Pacific Salmon   specialists and have a strong preference for one species, the Chinook Salmon   (Ford and Ellis 2006). Transients in coastal waters of the ENP focus their   foraging on pinnipeds and small cetaceans but also take large whales, especially   calves, opportunistically. Killer Whales in coastal Norway specialize on Herring   (Simila <em>et al</em>. 1996) and in the Strait of Gibraltar on Bluefin Tuna   (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006). Some Killer Whales in New Zealand may forage   selectively on rays and other elasmobranchs (Visser 1999), and in Western   Australia, Killer Whales take scores of Humpback Whale calves for several   months a year (Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2015).   Off the south coast of Western Australia one group of Killer Whales forages,   at least seasonally, on Beaked Whales (Wellard <em>et al</em>. 2106). In the Antarctic, there are five described ecotypes   of Killer Whales, each of them morphologically distinct with different   habitat and prey preferences. One type specializes on Minke Whales and Elephant   Seals taken in open water, one eats mostly ice-associated seals taken off ice   floes, another regularly preys on penguins but is probably mainly a   fish-eater, another rarely seen form has only been observed depredating Patgonian   Toothfish from commercial longlines, and the smallest form appears to be   entirely a fish-eater (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durban <em>et al.</em>   2016). <br/></p>   <p>Long-distance migrations   have been documented for high-latitude Killer Whales. Matthews <em>et al</em>. (2011) satellite-tracked an   individual for 5,400 km (and 38° of latitude) from the eastern Canadian   Arctic into the central North Atlantic. Durban and Pitman (2012) tracked Killer   Whales from the Antarctic Peninsula to southern Brazil and back – a non-stop   roundtrip of almost 9,400 km, and Pitman <em>et   al</em>. (in prep.) tracked fish-eating ecotype Killer Whales from the Ross   Sea to north of New Zealand and back – a &gt;11,000 km roundtrip covering 48°   of latitude. Many Antarctic Killer Whales appear to be highly philopatric. In   the Antarctic, some ecotypes readily enter areas of floe ice in search of   prey, while others hunt only in open water (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman and   Durban 2012). Killer Whales in some areas congregate seasonally in coastal   channels to forage and occasionally enter river mouths.</p>","<p>Killer Whales have been exploited (i.e., deliberately hunted) in several regions. Norwegian whalers in the eastern North Atlantic took an average of 56 whales per year from 1938 to 1981. Whalers in Japan took an average of 43 per year in coastal waters from 1946 to 1981. Soviet commercial whalers took an average of 26 Killer Whales annually from 1935 to 1979, primarily in the Antarctic, and then took 916 animals in the 1979/80 Antarctic season (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999,). Killer whales are also taken in small numbers for food (or as a population control measure) in coastal fisheries in Japan, Greenland, Indonesia, and the Caribbean islands (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/> Fishermen in many areas see Killer Whales as competitors, and intentional shooting is known to occur. This problem was especially serious in Alaska, where depredation of longline fisheries is extensive (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, Yano and Dahlheim 1995, Donohue <em>et al</em>. 2003), and retaliation for depredation was credited with contributing to a temporary population decline at Crozet Island, in the Southern Ocean (Poncelet <em>et al</em>. 2010). Depredation of longline catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., Aleutian Islands and Southeast Alaska, South Georgia, Crozet Islands, and several other Southern Ocean Subantarctic island areas, Australia, and other locations in the South Pacific). Increased depredation of Toothfish hooked in fisheries in the Crozet Archipelago appears to have had a positive effect on calving rates of female Killer Whales (Tixier <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> Incidental mortality in trawl, longline and driftnet fishing operations occurs, but is considered rare (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> Persistent bio-accumulating contaminants present a serious potential risk to some Killer Whale populations. Ross <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were very high in three Killer Whale populations (2 resident and 1 transient) frequenting the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada. Transient Killer Whales were particularly contaminated due to their high trophic position in the marine ecosystem. PCB levels in most Killer Whales sampled were greater than levels established at which adverse effects occur in Harbor Seals, suggesting that the majority of free-ranging Killer Whales in this region are at risk of toxic effects. The southern resident and transient Killer Whales of British Columbia and Washington are considered among the most PCB-contaminated cetaceans in the world (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2000). &#160;More recently, Jepson <em>et al</em>. (2016) found very high mean blubber PCB concentrations in Killer Whales in Europe. Small or declining populations of Killer Whales in the northeastern Atlantic (e.g., the very small population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar) have been associated with low recruitment, which is consistent with PCB-induced reproductive toxicity. Also, increasing levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers which, like PCBs, can cause immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive impairment, have become a concern in the southern resident population in British Columbia and Washington (Mongillo <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p><br/> Disturbance is another concern in areas where Killer Whales are subject to whale-watching tourism. Moving boats can disrupt foraging and resting, and underwater boat noise can affect social and echolocation signals of the whales or otherwise interfere with foraging (Erbe 2002, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, Noren <em>et al.</em> 2009). For example, close approaches by whale-watching vessels have been shown to result in avoidance responses by resident Killer Whales in British Columbia, which presumably has energetic costs to whales that are frequently subjected to this activity (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2006). Fast-moving boats in the proximity of Killer Whales also present a risk of vessel strikes (e.g., Visser 1999). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Potential disturbance and acoustic masking effects of increasing ambient noise levels associated with shipping and other vessel traffic is a growing concern in some regions (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Disturbance responses and masking of echolocation signals in areas with heavy ship activity have the potential to disrupt foraging behavior and reduce prey acquisition with possible population-level consequences (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014, Veirs <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/> <br/> </p>  <p>The <em>Exxon Valdez</em> oil spill in Alaska in March 1989 was strongly correlated with the subsequent loss of Killer Whales from transient and resident pods that had been seen swimming near or through oil slicks early in the spill (Dahlheim and Matkin 1994). The AT1 pod had at least 22 individuals when first censused in 1984, before the spill. Eleven individuals have been missing from this pod since 1990 and two more since 1992. Four more whales from this pod died in the early 2000s and there have been no recorded births within the pod since 1984. As of 2012, only 7 of the original 22 AT1 pod members remained. A resident Killer Whale pod affected by the oil had failed to recover 16 years after the spill (Matkin <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2012). Oil spills may also have indirect effects on Killer Whales by reducing prey abundance. </p>  <p><br/> There have been large-scale reductions in predatory fish populations (Myers and Worm 2003; Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003) along with overfishing and collapse of several important “prey” fish stocks worldwide (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2001). There have also been large declines in some marine mammal populations but many of those populations have recovered or are recovering under protection, and this may mean that some mammal-eating populations of Killer Whales are recovering as well. The same is not likely true of many fish-eating populations, however. </p>  <p><br/> Due to their dietary specialization, some populations of Killer Whales could be especially vulnerable to a reduction of their food supply. In British Columbia and Washington State, many Pacific Salmon stocks have significantly declined as a result of overfishing, habitat degradation, and reduced survival at sea. Declines in survival and reproductive rates of resident Killer Whales were found to correlate with a multi-year reduction in Chinook Salmon abundance in coastal British Columbia and Washington State (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ford <em>et al.</em> 2010). Mammal-eating Killer Whales along the west coast of North America likely experienced periods of reduced prey availability due to depletion of pinniped populations prior to 1970 (Ford and Ellis 1999). Depletion of Bluefin Tuna stocks in the Mediterranean Sea has almost certainly had a serious impact on the survival of Killer Whales near the Strait of Gibraltar (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006, Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> How global climate change and its impacts on the marine environment will affect the different populations and ecotypes of Killer Whales is uncertain (e.g., Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, in the Arctic, declining extent and duration of sea ice has given Killer Whales more access to marine mammal prey (Belugas, Narwhals, Bowhead Whales) that depend on ice for refuge from predation (Ferguson <em>et al.</em> 2010, Higdon <em>et al</em>. 2012, George <em>et al.</em> 2015). Similarly, in the Antarctic, the abundance and availability of Killer Whale prey is mediated through the presence of ice (<em>e.g</em>., Pitman and Durban 2012), which means that many species, including both Killer Whales and their prey, face an uncertain future.</p>","<p>Killer Whale populations   have been relatively well-studied in the North Pacific. In the Eastern Tropical   Pacific, a line-transect survey resulted in an estimate of 8,500 (CV=0.37) in   1986-1990 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). A catalogue of 86 individuals was   compiled for waters around the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, from   1972-1997 (Guerrero-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 1998). A shipboard line-transect   survey of the Hawaii EEZ in 2002 resulted in an estimate of 349 (CV = 0.98) Killer   Whales (Barlow 2006). The southern resident population that inhabits the   inland waters of Washington State and southern British Columbia numbered 77   whales in June 2017 (K.C. Balcomb, Center for Whale Research, pers. comm., 13   June 2017); it is depleted due to past live removals and is listed as   endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and Canada’s Species at Risk   Act. The northern resident population in British Columbia numbered 290 in   2014 and had been increasing at a mean rate of 2.2% per annum since 1974   (Towers <em>et al</em>. 2015). A   photographic catalogue of the west coast transient population in British   Columbia and Southeast Alaska included 272 individuals in 2012 (Towers <em>et al.</em> 2012). This population was   estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of about 2% in the two   decades ending in 2006 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2007). Bayesian mark-recapture modelling estimated that there were 300   offshore-type Killer Whales (95% CL 257–373) in the region from Alaska to   California in 2012 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2014). Shipboard line-transect surveys extending out to 300 nm offshore in   2005 and 2007 resulted in an estimate of 691 (CV=0.49) off California, Oregon   and Washington (Carretta <em>et al</em>.   2016); these estimates likely include whales from the aforementioned west   coast transient, southern resident, northern resident, and offshore   populations. A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of   Alaska resulted in an estimate of abundance for transient Killer Whales of   251 (CV=0.51) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007), while the AT1 transient   population (which inhabits Prince William Sound and waters of the Seward   Peninsula, Alaska) numbered only 7 animals in 2010 (Matkin <em>et al</em>.   2012). Over 700 unique individual resident Killer Whales were   photo-identified over the course of a field study during 1984-2010 in coastal   waters of the Gulf of Alaska (Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a subset of   pods within this population were regularly encountered, and those pods   increased in abundance at an average rate of 3.5% per annum during the study.   A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of Alaska   resulted in an estimate of 991 (CV=0.52) resident Killer Whales and 251 (CV=0.51)   transient Killer Whales (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/></p>   <p>The following figures are   available for Killer Whales in the Russian Far East, all representing   photo-identified individuals and therefore “minimum” counts (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014, Erich Hoyt, Whale and   Dolphin Conservation, pers. comm. 12 June 2017): Avacha   Gulf/eastern Kamchatka (1999-2013) – resident type 688, transient type 26   (note that rate of new discovery is very low indicating this may be close to   actual levels of abundance, and site fidelity is much higher than in the   Commander Islands); Commander Islands (2008-2013) - residents &gt; 800,   transients 18 (note that rate of new discovery is high so actual abundance is   certainly higher and about 80% of the identified individuals were encountered   in only one year); western Okhotsk Sea (from Udskaya Gulf to Sakhalin Gulf,   mainly Academiya Gulf) (2011-2013) – residents none, transients 55 (note that no dedicated study was carried out, only   opportunistic sightings along with beluga research; also this is the   population that has been subject to live-capture since 2010).<br/>   <br/>   Line-transect surveys have resulted in high estimates of abundance in several   regions in the North Atlantic, 3,100 (CV=0.63) in Norwegian waters in the   1980s (Øien 1990) and 6,618 (CV=0.32) in Iceland and Faroe Islands waters   also in the 1980s (Gunnlaugsson and Sigurjónsson 1990, Sigurjónsson <em>et al</em>.   1989). A long-term photo-identification study in coastal northern Norway   resulted in an abundance estimate of 731 (CI = 505-1059) in 2003 (Kuningas <em>et al</em>. 2014). In central and southern   European waters there are only two known populations of Killer Whales – one   in the Strait of Gibraltar with 39 individuals in 2011 (Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016) and the other a pod of   nine individuals regularly seen around western Ireland and northwestern   Scotland (Beck <em>et al</em>. 2013). Killer   Whales are not common in the waters off the eastern United States. Line-transect   surveys yielded an estimate of 133 (CV=49%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico in   the early 2000s (Waring <em>et al</em>.   2006).<br/>   <br/>   Several analyses of line-transect surveys have yielded abundance estimates   for Killer Whales around Antarctica (Hammond 1984, Kasamatsu and Joyce 1995);   however, some of the estimates have been considered biased by methodology and   survey coverage (Branch and Butterworth 2001). More recent analyses that   account for some of these biases resulted in an estimate of about 25,000 for   waters south of 60°S (Branch and Butterworth 2001); however, there are still   uncertainties related to coverage of areas in the pack ice, so true abundance   could be higher. Densities are known to vary locally within Antarctic waters,   ranging from very abundant to uncommon (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pitman   and Ensor 2003), and it has been recognized that Killer Whale densities are   higher closer to the ice edge and within the marginal ice zone where the   smaller, fish-eating Killer Whales can occur in aggregations of tens to   hundreds of animals (Berzin and Vladimirov 1983, Pitman and Ensor 2003). A   photo-identification study of type C Killer Whales (a small, fish-eating   form) in McMurdo Sound from 2001-2015 estimated a population of at least 370   animals including 70 that were resident in the Sound each year during the   summer; the remainder were mostly just passing through (Pitman <em>et al</em>. submitted). In the Antarctic   Peninsula area, a photo-identification study of the three different ecotypes   that occur there has to date (June 2017) identified at least 372 type A Killer   Whales (specialist predators of Minke Whales; R. Pitman unpublished data).   Photo-identification studies in the Prince Edward Island Archipelago (mainly   around Marion Island) from 2006-2009 estimated a local population there of   around 42 individuals (95% CI=35-50) that prey seasonally on Penguins and Elephant   Seals (Reisinger <em>et al</em>. 2011). In   other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, 119 (CV=0.20) Killer Whales have been   estimated in New Zealand waters (Visser 2000), and 30 were identified off northern   Patagonia, Argentina, during 1975-1997 (Lopez and Lopez 1985, Iñíguez 2001). No   abundance estimates have been made for type D Killer Whales in the Southern   Hemisphere.<br/>   <br/>   According to Forney and Wade (2006), although the available data are far from   complete, abundance estimates for sampled areas provided a minimum worldwide   abundance estimate of about 50,000 Killer Whales of all types. Those authors   noted that the total was likely higher, because estimates were not available   for many high-latitude areas of the northern hemisphere and for large areas   of the South Pacific, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Killer Whale is the most cosmopolitan of all cetaceans and may be the second-most widely ranging mammal species on the planet, after Humans (Rice 1998). Killer Whales may occur in virtually any marine habitat but are most common in cold-water areas of high marine productivity, particularly at higher latitudes and near shore (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Forney and Wade 2006). Sightings range from the surf zone to the open sea with no clear restrictions of water temperature or depth on their range. The distribution extends to many semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf.<br/></p>  <p>Although Killer Whales occur worldwide, reported densities are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower in the tropics than in the highest latitudes in the Arctic and Antarctic where there has been sampling (Forney and Wade 2006). Killer Whales tend to be more common along continental margins; however, there is some variation in this general pattern that appears linked to ocean productivity. Killer Whales appear to be less common in warm western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio Current, than in more productive eastern boundary currents, such as the California Current. However, they are also common in cold-water western boundary currents such as the Oyashio and Falkland Currents.<br/> <br/> The map shows the inferred range based on a very large number of observations at sea.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>During the period 1962-1977, at least 65 Killer Whales were live-captured in British Columbia and Puget Sound, Washington (Bigg 1982). In addition, from 1976-1988, 59 Killer Whales were captured alive off Iceland: eight were released, three died and 48 (average 3.7 per year) were exported (Sigurjónsson and Leatherwood 1988). Small numbers of Killer Whales have also been live-captured in Japanese waters (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Killer Whales are still in demand for display in aquariums and amusement parks, especially in China. Most recent captures and exports have been of animals in the Russian Far East (Fisher and Reeves 2005, Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014). Of 21 Killer Whales known to have been live-captured in the western Sea of Okhotsk from 2012-2016, at least 13 of them were exported to China between 2013 and 2016 (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). The eastern North Atlantic as well as the ENP populations are included in Appendix II of CMS. <br/> <br/> Further studies on subpopulation structure, abundance and life history are needed for most regions. Regional populations of Killer Whales can be small and highly specialized, and therefore vulnerable to over-exploitation, disturbance, prey reductions and habitat deterioration. Several small populations are already recognized as having a high risk of extinction. Many similarly small and threatened populations may exist worldwide but have not yet been adequately studied and described (e.g., Foote <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50373865,20730,Stenella clymene,Least Concern,,2018,2018-02-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Clymene Dolphin is a pelagic species that is widespread throughout tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Because of its largely offshore distribution, the species is very poorly studied in the majority of its range and it is one of the least well-known delphinids. Abundance has been estimated at approximately 12,000 in the U.S. portion of the northern Gulf of Mexico and along the U.S. east coast, where it was one of the less abundant tropical delphinids (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2012, 2014). Abundance has not been estimated anywhere else in the species’ extensive range, which includes the Caribbean Sea, Atlantic coast of South America, and West Africa. A recent compilation of records from the eastern Atlantic concluded that the Clymene Dolphin is one of the more common species in West African pelagic waters (Weir <em>et al.</em> 2014, Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2009). Almost nothing is known of population structure (Jefferson 2018).</p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>There is known fisheries bycatch, of unknown scale, in many parts of the range. In Ghana, Clymene Dolphins are the most commonly bycaught cetacean species in pelagic fisheries (Debrah <em>et al. </em>2010). </p>  <p></p>  <p>The species was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. It remains extremely data-poor and DD was still considered potentially applicable in this assessment. However, the clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD”. Critically Endangered and Least Concern are not both plausible categories for listing the Clymene Dolphin and therefore DD does not apply. </p>  <p>Given the moderate abundance level of Clymene Dolphins (at least tens of thousands, and possibly hundreds of thousands), their wide distribution in the Atlantic Ocean and greater Caribbean region, and the lack of evidence of threats that are pervasive throughout this distribution, the species is assessed as Least Concern. The Clymene Dolphin is, however, data-poor throughout its range so the assessment must be considered provisional pending better information. Threats in some parts of the range are of concern.</p>","<p>The Clymene Dolphin is a deep-water, oceanic species, not often seen near shore (unless deep water occurs close to the coast). It generally occurs on or beyond the edge of the continental shelf in water depths of up to at least 5,000 m (Jefferson and Curry 2003, Weir <em>et al.</em> 2014). In the eastern Atlantic, Weir <em>et al.</em> (2014) compiled 89 sightings in water depths ranging from 437 to 5,000 m and at distances from shore of 20.6 to 937.4 km. Clymene Dolphins often occur in schools of dozens to about a thousand animals (Weir <em>et al.</em> 2014), and they are active bow-riders (this makes them vulnerable to harpooning).<br/> <br/> Very few stomachs have been examined, and even fewer observations of feeding behaviour are reported in the literature. Clymene Dolphins apparently feed predominantly on small fish (including myctophids) and squid at moderate depths (Jefferson and Curry 2003; Jefferson 2018). Little else is known of their ecology, and this species remains one of the most poorly known of all delphinids (Weir <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>","<p></p><p>Although they are known to be taken by harpoon occasionally in dolphin fisheries in the Caribbean (especially Saint Vincent in the Lesser Antilles), and incidental captures in fishing nets occur throughout much of the range, Clymene Dolphins are not known to be heavily exploited at present (Jefferson and Curry 2003, Jefferson 2018). The sole possible exception is Ghana, West Africa, where 25-35% of the cetaceans documented as caught in artisanal fisheries (52 dolphins from 1995-2010) were Clymene Dolphins (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2009, Debrah <em>et al.</em> 2010). By contrast, Clymene Dolphins have not been recorded as bycatch in Senegal, despite the fact that cetacean stranding and bycatch rates appear to be very high along the coast (Keith-Diagne <em>et al</em>. 2017) and the species has been documented as resident (Weir 2014). The Clymene Dolphin is among the cetacean species likely to be caught in significant numbers in tuna purse seine nets in the Gulf of Guinea, but quantitative data are not available (Jefferson 2018). Clymene Dolphins are captured incidentally in gillnets in Venezuelan waters and reportedly have been used as bait on longlines set for sharks, as well as for human consumption (Perrin and Mead 1994, Jefferson 2018). Some level of take is likely in pelagic longline fisheries that operate in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and tropical Atlantic Ocean (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>Other potential threats include routine activities and accidental oil and chemical spills associated with oil and gas exploration and extraction in the Gulf of Mexico (Jefferson and Curry 2003), and such potential threats also exist in the Caribbean Sea, the western South Atlantic, and off parts of West Africa.</p>","<p>There is no estimate of range-wide abundance for Clymene Dolphins. Abundance has been estimated only for the northern Gulf of Mexico (Mullin 2007 cited in Waring <em>et al</em>. 2014) and U.S. east coast (Mullin and Fulling 2003), with the best available estimates being 6,575 in 2003-2004 (coefficient of variation (CV) 36%) and 6,086 in 1998 (CV 93%), respectively. There are no estimates of density or abundance from the eastern part of the species range, but Weir <em>et al.</em> (2014) reviewed records for West Africa and concluded that Clymene Dolphins are widespread in pelagic waters, and that the scarcity of earlier records was likely due to a paucity of survey effort and confusion with other delphinids. Based on capture records, the Clymene Dolphin appears to be the most common cetacean in Ghana's coastal waters (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2000). Considering the difficulty of distinguishing Clymene Dolphins at sea from similarly marked species, they may not be as rare as it was initially assumed (Perrin and Mead 1994, Fertl <em>et al</em>. 2003). </p>",Unknown,"The Clymene Dolphin is found only in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Gulf of Guinea (Fertl&#160;<em>et al</em>&#160;2003, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1995, Jefferson 2018). The species has a notable warm-water preference, although there are records from as far north as New Jersey on the U.S. east coast and as far south as southern Brazil in the southwestern Atlantic (Zerbini and Kotas 1998). The distribution limits on the West Africa coast are not as well known, but records extend from Angola north to at least Mauritania (Weir 2006, 2010). The Clymene Dolphin is not known to enter the Mediterranean Sea (Perrin and Mead 1994, Jefferson and Curry 2003, Fertl <em>et al</em>. 2003).",<p>Clymene Dolphins are among the target species of a multi-species directed fishery for local consumption in Saint Vincent and other islands of the Caribbean (Jefferson and Curry 2003; Jefferson 2018).

50381766,41754,Neophocaena asiaeorientalis,Endangered,A2bcde+3bcde+4bcde,2017,2017-08-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although the data are insufficient to make a rigorous quantitative assessment of population trend for <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em> throughout its range, the two subpopulations with suitably long time-series of abundance estimates both declined by &gt;50% in far less than three generations and therefore easily meet criterion A for Endangered (see below). Another recent decline of approximately 70% in a large part of the species’ range (Yellow Sea, Korea) provides an index of decline (subcriterion b) that may apply throughout many unsurveyed portions of the range. Although the rate of decline in such areas can only be inferred, there is no evidence that threats differ substantially. The scale of threats is large enough over enough of the range to suspect and infer a decline of at least 50% over the last three generations (45 years; Moore 2015) (A2), over three generations into the future (A3), and over a three-generation period that includes both the past and the future (A4). The factor most responsible for such decline is incidental mortality in fisheries (subcriterion d), but the loss and degradation of habitat (including chemical pollution; subcriteria c and e) and vessel strikes (at least in the Yangtze River system; Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013) are contributing factors as well. The primary causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population size—bycatch in fishing gear and mortality from vessel strikes (both interpreted here as “exploitation”), decline in habitat quality, and possibly pollution—have not ceased, may not be well understood, and may not all be reversible.<br/><br/>As the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission concluded after a review of the species (at the time with no recognized species-level distinction between <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) in 2005 (IWC 2006), “human populations adjacent to the Finless Porpoise’s habitat are increasing in size and becoming more industrialised so the expectation should be that anthropogenic pressures will continue and intensify.” None of the threats has been seriously addressed or mitigated in any part of the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise’s range, even though threat levels are likely increasing. Partly because of their small size, phocoenids are exceptionally vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets (e.g., Jefferson and Curry 1994). Incidental mortality in fishing gear is either known or presumed to occur throughout the range of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1997, IWC 2006).<br/><br/>There is clear evidence of a declining trend in three major parts of this species’ range. In the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, a decline of nearly 70% was estimated over a period of 22 years, from 1976-1978 to 1999-2000 (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002, also see Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). There is also evidence of a rapid decline in recent decades in the Yangtze River and adjoining lake systems of China (Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2008, Wang 2009, Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2012) with a 60% decline in the six years between 2006 and 2012 (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2014); the subspecies there (<em>N. a. asiaeorientalis</em>) was classified as Endangered in 1996 and uplisted to Critically Endangered in 2013 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2013). Finally, there is recent evidence suggesting a decline of approximately 70% in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in the Korean portion of the Yellow Sea between the early 2000s and 2011 (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015), and there is no reason to believe this decline has been reversed.<br/><br/>There is sufficient information for separate assessment of at least two threatened subpopulations – the subpopulation in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, which likely qualifies for Endangered or Critically Endangered (Hashimoto et al. 2015), and the Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Japan) subpopulation, which likely qualifies for at least Vulnerable (Hashimoto et al. 2015).<br/><p></p>","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are found mainly in coastal waters, including shallow bays, possibly mangrove swamps, estuaries, and some large rivers. However, they can also occur in shallow waters (&lt;200 m deep) quite far from shore (up to 240 km). They appear to have a strong preference for waters with a sandy or soft bottom (Jefferson and Hung 2004).<br/> <br/> In Japanese waters, Finless Porpoises prefer shallow depths (&lt;50 m) and close proximity to the shore (&lt;5 km). In the shallow East China Sea, proximity to the shore does not appear to be as important (Amano 2009). </p>  Small fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (mainly demersal species) form the diet of Finless Porpoises (Jefferson and Hung 2004).","<p>Finless Porpoises, like other phocoenids (Jefferson and Curry 1994), are extremely susceptible to entanglement in gillnets, and large numbers have been, and continue to be, killed in many parts of their range.</p>  <p>In Japan, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises become entangled in a variety of types of fishing gear (Amano 2009). Changes in fishing methods and the use of acoustic deterrents may have reduced the incidental catch in some areas such as western Kyushu (Kasuya 1999, Amano <em>et al.</em> 2017), but substantial numbers are still being taken in gillnets and other fishing gear. A total of 114 specimens were collected in Japan during 1985–1992 from western and north-eastern Kyushu including parts of the western Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 1993): 84 (73%) of them had been killed incidentally in fisheries, 25 had been found dead on the beach or in the sea, and there was no information on the other five. Fishing gears that killed the 84 porpoises were bottom-set gillnets (58), surface gillnets (17), trap nets (7), trawl nets (1) and drifting (ghost) nets (1). Such fishing gears are common in Japan and probably kill Finless Porpoises off other coasts, although usually such catches go unreported. Shirakihara and Shirakihara (2013) estimated 238-270 Finless Porpoises are bycaught annually in Ariake Sound and Tachibana Bay.</p>  <p>In Korea (information is available only from the Republic of Korea), an official reporting system implemented in 2011 resulted in a count of 2,107 Finless Porpoises bycaught inshore, mainly along the west coast, in 2012 (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although reporting apparently has improved, there is still assumed to be substantial under-reporting for the following reasons according to Park <em>et al</em>. (2015): “First, each Finless Porpoise caught in a fish­ing net costs approximately $100 (100,000 Wons) [<em>sic</em>]. Therefore, the dead porpoise can be discarded because it has no signifi­cant value. Second, the bycatch of Finless Porpoises is usually reported only in large harbours, with deaths in smaller ports seldom reported (Kim <em>et al</em>., 2013). Therefore, it is likely that the impact of the bycatch of Finless Porpoises on its population is underestimated.”</p>  <p>Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that Finless Porpoises were the most frequently captured cetaceans in fishing gear along the Chinese coast and estimated that more than 2,000 were taken in 1994, mainly in trawl, gill, and stow nets. In the waters of western Taiwan, including the Matsu and Chinmen Islands (western Taiwan Strait), a considerable number of Finless Porpoises are taken in trammel nets, trawl nets, stow nets, and other gear (J. Y. Wang unpublished data). Given the numbers and types of net fisheries in Chinese coastal waters (e.g., Zhou and Wang 1994, Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999), there are serious concerns about the level of bycatch of both Finless Porpoise species. Illegal electric fishing became widespread in the Yangtze River during the 1990s, and it may kill porpoises outright and certainly contributes to the depletion of their prey (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2000).</p>  <p>In some parts of their range, there is an aversion to eating Finless Porpoises (Kasuya 1999, J. Y. Wang unpublished data). However, there is a long history of porpoises taken incidentally being sold for human consumption in at least some parts of Japan (e.g., Mizue <em>et al.</em> 1965) and on the Korean peninsula (IWC 2000). According to M. Amano (pers. comm.), consumption of Finless Porpoises no longer occurs in Japan. An analysis of the species composition of odontocete products in Korean markets during 2003–2004 estimated that the true catch of Finless Porpoises in Korean waters during this period was probably about four times the officially reported catch of 142 animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/> <br/> As coastal and riverine animals, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are also affected by habitat loss and degradation, boat traffic, and pollution. The extensive modification of coastlines for shrimp farming and rampant harbour (and other) development throughout East Asia means that there is less habitat for Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Porpoise habitat in the Yangtze River system has been degraded by water development, including the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams and about 1,300 smaller dams in tributaries (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2000). Sand mining is intensive in Poyang Lake, until recently a stronghold for Yangtze Finless Porpoises (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). Sand mining is also thought to have played a significant role in the severe decline of Finless Porpoises in the central and eastern Seto Inland Sea, Japan (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although pathology related to contaminant exposure has not been reported in Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises, pollution is considered a potentially serious threat (Kasuya 1999, Kannan <em>et al</em>. 1989, Iwata <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1995; Le <em>et al</em>. 1999, Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). A mass die-off of at least 249 Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises along the Saemangeum dike area of the western Korean Peninsula was reported by Park <em>et al.</em> (2012) who speculated that the cause was unusually low temperatures. However, there have been news reports of large (&gt;100) kills of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in local coastal fisheries, so it may be difficult to rule out human activities as a causal factor in such large-scale die-offs.</p>  <p>A survey of levels and drivers of human-caused mortality carried out in 27 fishing settlements along the middle-lower Yangtze channel identified three main categories of observed porpoise deaths: (1) interaction with fishing gear, (2) vessel strikes, and (3) unknown cause (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013). A total of 344 dated porpoise mortality events directly observed by informants between 1950 and 2008 were reported, including 75 porpoise deaths from 1989–1998 and 147 from 1999–2008. This apparent increase was said to be driven by the greater number of deaths attributed to vessel strikes (19 to 35) and unknown causes (31 to 94) in the more recent decade. Comparison of the reported mortality with the estimated abundance suggests that the fraction of individuals removed from the declining porpoise population in the Yangtze had quadrupled over the course of two decades. Turvey <em>et al</em>. concluded that entanglement in rolling hook long-lines was probably responsible for the greatest number of porpoise deaths in fishing gear and that vessel strikes and other anthropogenic factors, such as electrofishing, had become the dominant and increasing causes of mortality in the Yangtze.</p>  The causes of an apparent decline in Finless Porpoise numbers in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan are not fully understood, but include incidental mortality in fisheries as well as various forms of habitat degradation (IWC 2000, 2006). Parts of the coastal regions of the Inland Sea are highly developed and industrialized, so the associated threats of habitat loss (e.g., from reclamation and sand mining) and pollution are suspected to have had some (undetermined) level of impact (Kasuya <em>et al.</em> 2002).","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are small and cryptic and therefore difficult to survey. Estimates of abundance have been made for only a few areas (IWC 2006). Estimates from the early 2000s are available for five subpopulations in Japanese waters, distinguished on the basis of skull morphology and mtDNA variability (Yoshida <em>et al.</em> 1995, Yoshida 2002), as follows: 3,807 (coefficient of variation (CV) 16%) in Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 289 (CV 19%) in Omura Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 3,743 (CV 24%) in Ise/Mikawa Bay (Yoshida 2002); 3,387 (CV 33%) in Chiba/Sendai Bay (Amano <em>et al</em>. 2003); and 7,572 (CV 17%) in the Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Most of the estimates were summarized in IWC (2006). For the Inland Sea subpopulation, Kasuya <em>et al</em>. (2002) recorded a decline in sighting rate of 18-100% for 18 tracklines surveyed in 1976–78 and again in 1999–2000. The declines for 11 of the tracklines were statistically significant. Using abundance indices calculated by multiplying the density indices (no. individuals/cruise distance) and area size of each stratum, an overall decline of 69% is inferred over the 22 years between the two sets of surveys (T. Kasuya pers. comm. 2007, data from Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/> <br/> Surveys in western Korean waters (Yellow Sea) in the early 2000s estimated 21,532 (CV 39%) Finless Porpoises in offshore waters and 5,464 (CV 20%) in inshore waters (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) considered these estimates to be negatively biased (IWC 2006). More recent surveys resulted in density estimates of 0.122 individuals/km<span class=""A78"">² (offshore) and 0.151 ind./km² (inshore), both much lower than the corresponding estimates from surveys in 2004 (offshore, 0.565 ind./km²) and 2005 (inshore, 0.638 ind./km²) (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015). Park <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that these results indicated a decline in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in this region of approximately 70% between 2004/2005 and 2011.<br/> <br/> Based on surveys from 1984 to 1991, Zhang <em>et al</em>. (1993) estimated that there were about 2,700 porpoises in the Yangtze River, while Zhou <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated that only 700 remained in the lower reaches between Nanjing and Hukou between 1989 and 1992. Wang <em>et al</em>. (2000) concluded that Finless Porpoise abundance in the Yangtze River had declined considerably and that there could be fewer than 2,000 animals (although this was not based on a rigorous assessment). A two-vessel survey of the Yangtze mainstem in 2006 yielded an estimate of 1,225 (CV 0.13) which, when combined with earlier estimates for Poyang and Dongting Lakes, was interpreted as implying an overall number of about 1,800 in the Yangtze system (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). In some portions of the river where porpoises had been reported to be present in the past, none were seen during the 2006 survey (Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2012). Previous estimates of the annual rate of decline of Yangtze Finless Porpoises varied from 5 to 7.3% (see Wang 2009 for a review). However, a survey of the mainstem Yangtze in 2012 determined that only approximately 500 porpoises remained (Mei <em>et al.</em> 2014), indicating a roughly 60% decline in the main river in six years. However, Yangtze River cetacean surveys have been plagued by variable methods and coverage, and therefore decline rates must be viewed with some level of caution.<br/> <br/> There are no abundance estimates for Finless Porpoises in Chinese marine waters other than Hong Kong (IWC 2006), which in any event refer to for <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and not <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The type specimen was from the Yangtze River, Kiangsu [=Jiangsu] Province, China, ~129 km (80 miles) northwest of Shanghai (Pilleri and Gihr 1972).<br/> <br/> In general, this species occurs in a narrow strip of shallow (usually &lt;50 m deep) coastal water around the western Pacific Ocean from the Taiwan Strait to the waters of northern China, Korea and northern Honshu, Japan. (Note that a Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise was discovered recently in the waters of Okinawa Island, Japan (Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010), but it probably represents an extralimital stray rather than an extension of the species’ range.) The distribution also includes a few estuaries and rivers (e.g., the <em>N. a. asiaeorientalis</em> subspecies appears to be found exclusively in the Yangtze River system; Gao 1991, Gao and Zhou 1995).

Partly because of their small size, which limits their strength to break free once entangled, phocoenids are exceptionally vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets (e.g., Jefferson and Curry 1994), and incidental mortality in fishing gear has been documented throughout the range of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises. Fishing effort with gear documented to catch Finless Porpoises accidentally (including gillnets, trawls, stow nets, and seines) is intense in many areas where the species occurs or occurred. Although not quantified as rigorously as for some <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em> populations, regional declines (and possible local extirpations) of <em>N. phocaenoides</em> have been reported, presumably due to a combination of fishing pressure, coastal development and industrialization, pollution, and heavy vessel traffic (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1997, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2005, Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/> <br/>The data are insufficient to make a rigorous quantitative assessment of population trend for this species in any part of its range, but the scale of threats is large enough over enough of the range to suspect and infer a decline of at least 30% over the last three generations (about 45 years, assuming 15 years/generation as estimated for <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em> by Moore 2015) (<a name=""_Hlk486670028"">A2), over three generations into the future (A3), and over a three-generation period that includes both the past and the future (A4)</a>. The factor most responsible for such a decline would be incidental mortality in fisheries (subcriterion d, “exploitation”), but the loss and degradation of habitat (subcriterion c) and pollution (chemical and acoustic; subcriterion e) are likely contributing factors as well. None of the threats has been seriously addressed in any part of the species’ range, even though threat levels are presumably increasing.<br/> <br/> Therefore, the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise qualifies for Vulnerable under Red List criteria A2cde, <a name=""_Hlk486670084"">A3cde, and A4cde, </a>considering that the causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population size—bycatch, decline in habitat quality, and possibly pollution—have not ceased, may not be well understood, and may not all be reversible.","<p>Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises are found mainly in coastal waters, including shallow bays, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. They occur in waters &lt; 200 m deep and can be sighted up to 240 km from shore in some areas. It is uncertain which of the two currently recognized species of Finless Porpoises (possibly both) occurs farther offshore, especially in areas of sympatry.</p>  <p>Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises appear to have a strong preference for waters with a sandy or soft bottom (Jefferson and Hung 2004).</p>  <p>Small fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (mainly demersal species) form the diet of Finless Porpoises (Jefferson and Hung 2004). <br/></p>  Higher numbers of Finless Porpoises are present in Hong Kong waters in winter and spring than in other seasons (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002). Seasonal differences in density and distribution, with higher densities in the winter months of November to January, have been observed along the coast of southern Maharashtra, India, and acoustic monitoring data from there have been interpreted to suggest both seasonal and diurnal patterns of occurrence in near-shore waters (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017). Minton <em>et al</em>. (2013) also observed a seasonal signal in their vessel surveys in Kuching Bay, with higher densities of Finless Porpoises observed in March, April, and May, which coincided with the occurrence of larger groups containing very small calves. Observations of porpoise behaviour in the bay were interpreted as suggesting that it is an important feeding and calving area (Zulkifli Poh 2013). Two stranded individuals had large shrimp in their stomachs (G. Minton, pers. comm., cited in IWC 2017).","<p>Finless Porpoises, like other phocoenids (Jefferson and Curry 1994), are extremely susceptible to entanglement in gillnets, and large numbers have been, and continue to be, killed in many parts of their range (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002b). Finless Porpoises are caught in nets in Iranian, Indian, Pakistani and Malaysian coastal waters, although there are no good estimates of the magnitude of such catches (e.g., see Collins <em>et al.</em> 2005, Jaaman <em>et al</em>. 2009, Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2010). In East Malaysia, Finless Porpoises are caught as bycatch in ‘fish stakes’ in Sabah (Jaaman <em>et al.</em> 2009) and one individual was found entangled in the line of a crab trap in Sarawak (G. Minton pers. comm. 2011), where cetacean bycatch is prevalent (Peter <em>et al</em>. 2016, IWC 2017). Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that Finless Porpoises were the most frequently captured cetaceans in fishing gear along the Chinese coast and estimated that more than 2,000 were taken in 1994, mainly in trawl, gill, and stow nets. In the Taiwan Strait (where the two species of Finless Porpoises are sympatric), a considerable number of both species are taken in trammel nets, trawl nets, stow nets, and other gear (J. Y. Wang unpublished data). In Hong Kong waters, porpoises are caught regularly by trawl nets and gillnets, but there are no estimates of bycatch levels (Parsons and Jefferson 2000, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2002b). Given the numbers and types of net fisheries in Chinese coastal waters, the apparently high bycatch of Finless Porpoises (Zhou and Wang 1994, Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999) is a serious concern. In Maharashtra, India, during 2014-2016, at least twenty Finless Porpoise carcasses washed ashore, a few of them known to have drowned in shore seine nets and gillnets (M. Sule, pers. comm<em>.</em>).</p>  <p>As a coastal species, the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise is also affected by habitat loss and degradation, boat traffic, and pollution. The extensive modification of coastlines for shrimp farming, causeways, and harbour (and other) development throughout Asia (including the Persian/Arabian Gulf) means that there is less habitat for Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003, Braulik<em> et al. </em>2010). Although pathology related to contaminant exposure has not been reported in Finless Porpoises, pollution is considered a potentially serious threat (Kasuya 1999, Iwata <em>et al</em>. 1994, Parsons and Chan 1998, Minh <em>et al</em>. 1999, Parsons 1999, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002b, Ramu <em>et al.</em> 2005). The number of reported Finless Porpoise strandings in Hong Kong has increased in recent years, partly due to increasing public awareness and reporting of local cetaceans, but also possibly due to escalating levels of human impacts (T.A. Jefferson pers. comm. 2017). In the Persian/Arabian Gulf, chemicals from recent wars exacerbate total pollution loads in coastal waters from the usual sources such as industry, agriculture and households (Braulik <em>et al. </em>2010). Vessel collisions, especially involving high-speed ferries, may be a particular problem for porpoises in Hong Kong (Parsons and Jefferson 2000).</p>  <p>The following summary of examples illustrates the problems faced by this species:</p>  <p></p><p>In Chinese waters (excluding the considerable fisheries operating in Taiwanese waters), more than 3.5 million gillnets were estimated to be in use in the early 1990s (Zhou and Wang 1994). In India, the use of gillnets reportedly had increased from about 18,000 in 1950 to more than 216,000 by 1980 and gillnets were also being used extensively in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar (Mohan 1994). Since the time of those reports, gillnetting effort certainly would have increased considerably in these and other regions because there are few (if any) restrictions on this kind of fishing gear anywhere in the range of the species. Porpoise habitat in Myanmar is heavily fished with gillnets and other types of gear capable of taking small cetaceans incidentally (Smith and Than Tun 2008). A drift gillnet fishery for elasmobranchs is of concern in the Bangladesh Sundarbans (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008). In East Malaysia, Finless Porpoise numbers are thought to have ‘greatly declined’ due to bycatch in fisheries (Jaaman <em>et al. </em>2009), and commercial fishing (gillnetting, trawling, purse-seining) is intensive off Peninsular Malaysia where bycatch of Finless Porpoises is known to occur even though it is not monitored regularly (L. Ponnampalam pers. comm. August 2017). Surveys in the coastal waters of Vietnam have resulted in very few sightings of cetaceans. In a study by Smith <em>et al.</em> (1997), no sightings were made of Finless Porpoises yet local whale temples contained many skulls of them as well as other cetacean species. A survey around Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam, in 2015 found evidence of Finless Porpoises being bycaught in trawl nets (L. Ponnampalam, pers. comm., August 2017). The impacts of war in the 1960s and 1970s, compounded by intense fishing (especially the use of gillnets) in recent years and ongoing, are likely at least partly responsible for the near absence of cetaceans from these waters. In Iran (Persian/Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman/Sea of Oman), bycatch in fisheries appears to be the greatest threat to marine mammals and removals from apparently small, localized populations of Finless Porpoises may be unsustainable (Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2010). Two major marine mammal die-offs occurred in the Persian/Arabian Gulf in the 1980s and 1990s, possibly related to major oil spills (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2005). Finless Porpoise sightings in Pakistan’s Indus Delta region were apparently decreasing in the 1970s (Pilleri and Gihr 1972, Pilleri and Pilleri 1979) and by the 1990s the species had nearly disappeared from this badly degraded area (see Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1997). </p>  <p>The Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise is one of several cetacean species that have greatly declined or disappeared from large parts of their range in Thailand, largely as a result of coastal habitat degradation and fishery bycatch (IWC 1994). </p>  No large-scale direct hunting of this species is known to occur. In some parts of their range, people apparently are averse to eating Finless Porpoises (Kasuya 1999, J. Y. Wang unpublished data) but in other areas they are consumed. Direct killing or capture of Finless Porpoises appears to be relatively rare (Reeves <em>et al. </em>1997) but development of intentional fisheries for marine mammals from incidental captures (and economic benefits from subsequent consumption and marketing) may have increased in parts of Southeast Asia as preferred marine resources have been over-fished (see Perrin 2002).","<p>Finless Porpoises are small and cryptic and therefore difficult to survey. Estimates of abundance have been made for only a few areas (Jefferson and Hung 2004, IWC 2006), mostly in regions where the Narrow-ridged species (<em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) dominates, if not exists solely. Numbers of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises in Hong Kong and adjacent waters were estimated to be at least 217 (coefficient of variation (CV) 21-150%) (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2002a).</p>  <p>A vessel line-transect estimate of Finless Porpoises in Kuching Bay, Sarawak, Malaysia was 135 individuals (CV 31%, 95% confidence interval 74-246) (Minton <em>et al.</em> 2013). This represents a relatively small part of the species’ overall range (known or predicted) in western Borneo; there are no published abundance estimates for nearby areas (IWC 2017). A preliminary estimate of &gt;1,000 from vessel line-transect surveys is available from the Langkawi Archipelago, Peninsular Malaysia (L. Ponnampalam, pers. comm., August 2017).</p>  An estimate for a large area in the coastal waters of Bangladesh was 1,382 (CV 55%) but the density was very low compared to some of the reported densities of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in Japanese waters (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008).",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>The type specimen was supposed to have come from the Cape of Good Hope, but this location is believed to be erroneous; it is now generally accepted that the type locality is the Malabar coast of India (Rice 1998, Jefferson and Hung 2004).<br/> <br/> In general, Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises occur in a narrow strip of shallow (usually &lt;50 m deep) coastal marine waters (as well as some river mouths and estuaries) around the northern rim of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans from the Persian/Arabian Gulf (Preen 2004, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2005) eastwards around the rim of the Indian Ocean to the Indo-Malay region (Ponnampalam 2012) and to Java, Indonesia (but apparently not the Philippines) and northwards to the Taiwan Strait and central Chinese waters (Gao 1991, Gao and Zhou 1995). This is the more tropical and wide-ranging of the two species of Finless Porpoises. Records of this species from northern Chinese waters (e.g., Wang 1992) probably represent rare or extralimital events. Finless Porpoises are seen regularly (when sea conditions are favourable) in Sarawak, East Malaysia (Minton <em>et al. </em>2011), in at least parts of Peninsular Malaysia (e.g., they are the most frequently seen cetaceans around the Langkawi Archipelago according to Louisa Ponnampalam (pers. comm. 2017, J.Y. Wang unpublished data)), year-round (but with seasonal influxes) in Hong Kong (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2002a), and in parts of the western Taiwan Strait (J.Y. Wang unpub. data). They are also present along the East Kalimantan coastline of Borneo (D. Kreb pers. comm. 2011). In India, they are found in shallow waters along virtually the entire length of both the east and the west coasts, with sightings and strandings more commonly reported on the west coast (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017). One possible explanation for the difference is that the east coast has only pockets of preferred habitat, while more continuous or contiguous porpoise habitat is available along the west coast (Sule <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Given the paucity of dedicated cetacean survey effort in much of the species’ suspected range, the map includes the possible or projected range where oceanic features are consistent with the species’ known preferred habitat. As such, the species has not been recorded for all the states within the hypothetical range as shown on the map. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are marked as 'Resident' in the list of countries of occurrence. States within the hypothetical range, but for which no confirmed records exist, are included in the list as 'Seasonal Occurrence Uncertain'.</p>",There is no known trade in the taxon.,Marine,"<p>  </p>  <p>This species (which is presently listed as a single species with <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) is included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). Management measures are needed to address threats, especially bycatch in fisheries.</p>  At its annual meeting in May 2017 the IWC Scientific Committee’s sub-committee on small cetaceans reviewed the status of Finless Porpoises in India and parts of Malaysia and recommended that populations be surveyed for distribution, abundance, and habitat use with emphasis on areas where the least is known about the species (e.g., India, the Indo-Malay Archipelago, Arabian/Persian Gulf) (IWC 2017). The sub-committee also recommended that bycatch monitoring be improved in all areas of known overlap between Finless Porpoise occurrence and fishing activity, especially gillnetting.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50657407,15452,Leopardus jacobita,Endangered,C2a(i),2016,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most recent information confirms that the Andean Cat is a rare species, occurring at low densities and with a patchy distribution due to a specialization for rocky habitats.<br/><br/>New records of the Andean Cat in Argentina extended its distribution range to the south and outside the Andes, into Patagonian steppe and shrub habitats, at elevations as low as 650 m (Novaro <em>et al.</em> 2010, Martinez <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, a study of the population genetics of the Andean Cat throughout most of its range (Cossios <em>et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the species has a very low mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity and identified two distinct Andean Cat populations that should be considered as two ""Evolutionary Significant Units” (ESUs), the highland cats from the previously-known distribution and the newly-discovered population in the Patagonian steppe. Moreover, the northern ESU contains two genetically different groups, showing limited or no exchange of individuals between them, which should be considered as two ""Management Units” (MUs).<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation is an increasing concern in most areas where the Andean Cat is present, due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate livestock management and water extraction, as well as water and soil contamination for a growing mining and petroleum industry activity in the South American highlands and the Patagonian steppe. The Andean Cat will be affected negatively by global climate change throughout most of its range by a decrease in the geographical distribution (Bennett <em>et al.</em> submitted) and more recently by rapid expansion of exploitation of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking in northern Patagonia (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Additionally, Andean Cats are being killed by herders in Patagonia in retaliation for predation (Novaro <em>et al.</em> 2010) and in northwestern Argentina high mortality rates due to hunting by local people have also been inferred (Lucherini and Merino 2008). More recently, information gathered from monitoring Andean Cats and Pampas Cats with GPS collars in north-western Argentina suggests that competition between these two species may affect negatively Andean Cat populations and make them more susceptible to the mentioned threats (Tellaeche 2015).<br/><br/>Based on Andean Cat distribution records an extent of occurrence (EOO) of 1,530,818 km² was estimated. However, due to the specificity of Andean Cat to steep rocky environments, this area encompasses large areas between sites of records that are uninhabitable. In a preliminary estimation in a study area of 6,863 km² in Patagonia, only 1.4% of the total area was steep rocky areas. Additionally, in a study area of approximately 65,000 km² in Patagonia, only 3% of the cells in a grid size of 10x10 km were occupied, based on confirmed and unconfirmed Andean Cat records (Walker and Palacios, unpublished data).<br/><br/>This estimation can have more than one source of error (for example it uses still unconfirmed records) and was calculated for the Patagonian steppe, an environment that is different from that of the highland habitats in the northern and central part of the Andean cat distribution, where there is a greater proportion of rocky habitat. Therefore, to be conservative we estimated that 10% of the current EOO of the Andean Cat could actually be occupied.<br/><br/>Taking into account 10% of the EOO and the lowest density of 0.018 ind/km² (Huaranca <em>et al.</em> 2013), estimated for a region considered to have one of the most favourable climatic conditions for the Andean Cat (Marino <em>et al.</em> 2011), the total population of the Andean Cat is estimated at 2,755 individuals. Because no information about population structure is available, using a default value of 50% for the proportion of mature individuals within the Andean Cat population, only 1,378 would be mature individuals (see Table 1 in the Supplemental Material).<br/><br/>No information exists on trends with regard to habitat modification or destruction in the distribution area of the Andean Cat; but as early as 2002, the conservation status of the Patagonian Steppe and the Central Andean Puna were considered as Critically Endangered (CR) and Vulnerable (V), respectively, with habitat loss and fragmentation the most serious threats affecting their conservation status (Olson and Dinerstein 2002). There is no evidence that this situation has improved; an evaluation of the progress in the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 mentioned that most of the different habitats, including grasslands and wetlands, are still fragmenting and degrading (SCDB 2014).<br/><br/>Mining activities have increased and the associate use of water resources is impacting negatively most of the areas where the Andean cat presence has been confirmed; in the case of northern Argentinean Patagonia, fracking is an additional threat (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Bolivia, mining is a priority activity and mainly situated in the Andean mountain range; extractive mining without environmental precautions is increasing (Ribera 2013). In Chile, mining industry is an important part of the country´s economy and is mainly developed in the northern region, where the Andean cat is distributed and water is a scarce resource. There, the fragile high Andean ecosystems are being degraded and a reduction of the wetlands is predicted in Chile because of the effects of climate change (IEB, CASEB, CCG-UC - CONAMA 2010). In the Peruvian report to the Biodiversity Convention, it is mentioned that in recent years the transformation of natural ecosystems has increased due to changes in land use, particularly by extractive activities such as mining; a trend of transformation, desertification and erosion is mentioned for the fragile wetlands and grasslands in the Peruvian Andes (Ministerio del Ambiente 2014).<br/><br/>Considering the threats to the Andean Cat, the natural fragmentation of the habitat and the increasing trend in fragmentation due to habitat loss and degradation, a continued decline of the population number is inferred.<br/><br/>Based on the available data on Andean Cat distribution and genetic analysis of samples from most areas, 10 subpopulations were identified for the Andean Cat (see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). Three subpopulations in Peru (1=north, 2=west, 3=east); two in Bolivia (4=north, 5=centre east); one subpopulation shared among south Peru, centre west Bolivia and northern Chile (6); one subpopulation shared among south-western Bolivia, centre east Chile and north-western Argentina (7); and three subpopulations in Argentina (8=north centre, 9= centre west and 10=southern west). Although some of these could be connected, more studies and more samples for genetic studies are needed.In the meantime, as a precautionary measure these 10 subpopulations are identified.<br/><br/>The estimate of the number of mature individuals for each subpopulation was made in the same way as for the estimation of the total number of mature individuals of the whole Andean cat species. The area of each subpopulation polygon was estimated using the Minimum Bounding Geometry, Convex hull function in ArcGIS. As these polygons are all occupied areas within the EOO, we did not reduce the area to 10% as we did for the overall range. However, even within these occupied areas, occupancy and habitat use by Andean cats is patchy, and they are constrained to rocky places associated with wetlands and/or shrublands. Thus, considering new detailed information on space use (Lucherini <em>et al.</em> unpublished data, Huaranca unpublished data, Lagos unpublished data), we, estimated that only 40% of each subpopulation polygon is actually used by Andean Cats, and reduced the size of all polygons accordingly&#160;(see Table 2 and Figure 1 in the Supplemental Material). The largest subpopulation is estimated to contain 172 mature individuals.<br/><br/>A further reason for concern about the conservation of this cat species, and for adopting a precautionary approach to its categorization is climate change. According to Bennett <em>et al.</em> (submitted) the current bioclimatic distribution of the Andean Cat is clearly affected by climate change. By 2080, under the scenario A2 (medium to high emissions) the distribution area is expected to decrease between 15 and 30%, depending on the cut-off point used in the distribution model. Parallel to this, the model shows an increase in elevation in the north and central distribution, which puts the species even more at risk, because the environmental conditions at higher elevations do not provide the habitat requirements necessary for the Andean cat (Bennett <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>More studies are needed to confirm the definition of the subpopulations presented here and to improve our estimates of the population size of each one of them, but considering the precautionary principle, the analysis described above supports the classification of the Andean Cat as Endangered.","<p>The Andean Cat is found primarily in rocky and steep terrains, in arid and sparsely vegetated areas of the high Andes above the timberline, and in scrub and steppe habitats within the Andean foothills of Central Argentina and the Patagonian steppe ecological region (Napolitano<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008, Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010).&#160; In general, climatic conditions are extreme with very low temperatures, large daily thermal variations and low precipitation that determine the presence of adapted plants such as bunchgrasses, cushion plants, and low shrubs with small or resinous leaves (Cabrera and Willink 1973). The presence of high Andean wetlands known as “bofedales” and “vegas” is characteristic in the high Andes and are an important resource for wildlife and domestic animals (Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004).<br/> &#160;<br/> The Andean Cat distribution is similar to the historic range of the Short-tailed Chinchilla (<em>Chinchilla chinchilla</em>) and current range of the mountain vizcacha (<em>Lagidium</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> spp.) (Yensen and Seymour 2000), which are its major prey (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008). According to the results of diet studies in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, and compared with that of other Andean carnivores, the Andean Cat occupies narrower niche with&#160; a wide overlap with the Pampas Cat diet (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Marino <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010). Rodents constitute the main prey item and the Mountain Vizcacha in three out of five diet studies was the more frequent prey: 52% and 43-53% in southern Bolivia and 44.1% in northern Chile (Viscarra 2008, Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008, Torrico 2009). In a diet study with samples mostly collected in northern Argentina, unidentified small rodents were the most frequent prey (37.3%), followed by the mountain vizcacha 28% (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007); Tellaeche (2010) for a single locality in northern Argentina, also reported that small mammals were the item most frequently consumed by the Andean Cat (93.3% of the faeces), particularly rodents of the genus <em>Phyllotis</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> (found in 76.9% of the samples). Among the Andean Cat prey items, the mountain vizcacha has the greatest body mass by far; consequently it contributes significantly to the Andean Cat diet (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008).<br/> <br/> The Andean Cat is thought to be a solitary species, but may be seen in pairs or with kittens during the mating season and after the births of kittens respectively (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em><span lang=""EN-US"">et a<span lang=""EN-GB"">l</span></em>. 2004). Mating season, according to local people in Bolivia, is between July and August (Villalba and Bernal 1999); however, it is possible that this period could be much longer, because small cubs have been observed in October and from April to September (Villalba 2002, Villalobos<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. In prep., Lucherini Unpublished data). Two kittens were seen by Villalba (2002), and what appears to be an older single cub by Sorli <em><span lang=""EN-US""><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">(2006).<br/> <br/> Most of the reported sightings of Andean Cats have been during daytime; however the radio-tracking of the first radio-collared Andean Cat in southern Bolivia recorded main activity peaks at dusk or at night, between 18:00 and 23:00 hours (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009); similarly the results of 1,596 camera-trap photos from different localities in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile showed the following proportions for Andean Cat activity: 37.6% at night, 34.4% crepuscular, and 28% during the day (Lucherini <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009). Additionally, the results indicated that the Andean Cat activity overlaps largely with that of the mountain vizcacha, a diurnal and crepuscular species (Galende <em><span lang=""EN-US"">et a<span lang=""EN-GB"">l</span></em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 1998).<br/> <br/> Data on territoriality is absent, however, as occurs with most felids (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), it is possible that male territories are larger than those of females and that there could be a certain degree of territory overlap between the sexes. Because the conditions of the Andean Cat habitat are severe and naturally fragmented, it is probable that territory and home ranges are very large; a radio-tracked female Andean Cat, between April and December 2004, had a home range of 65.5 km² (95% minimum convex polygon: Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2009).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""> The Andean Cat is a medium-sized felid; from measures of skins the total length in adults varies from 740 to 850 mm and in sub-adults varies from 577 to 600 mm; tail length is from 410 to 485 for adults and 330 to 420 mm for sub-adults. Only two records on the weight are available, the first from a sub-adult specimen from Peru, which weighed 4 kg (Pearson 1957, García-Perea 2002) and the second is from an adult female from Bolivia which weighed 4.5 kg (Delgado <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2004).<br/> <br/> Andean Cat fur is mainly ash grey with brown-yellowish blotches that are distributed as vertical lines at both sides of the body, giving the appearance of continuous stripes. The tail of the Andean cat is very characteristic. It is very long (66 - 75% of the head and body length), thick and cylindrical, with a fluffy aspect and with 6 to 9 wide rings of dark brown to black colour (García-Perea 2002). The legs also have dark and narrower blotches or stripes, but they don’t form complete rings.<br/> <br/> Apparently the species is not sexually dimorphic in terms of fur colour, but comparisons among Andean Cat skulls carried out by García-Perea (2002) suggest that sexual dimorphism is present. Differences between juvenile and adult specimens were also found, with juveniles having a lighter coloration and more and smaller blotches (García-Perea 2002). Because of these features, sub-adult or juvenile Andean Cats can be confused much more easily with Pampas Cats (García-Perea 2002).<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>In the early 2000s the Andean Cat Alliance considered traditional hunting the top threat, followed by prey reduction and habitat loss and fragmentation (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004), four years later a re-evaluation of the threats affecting the Andean Cat, established that habitat loss and habitat degradation are the main current threats; hunting (opportunistic/palliative or traditional) and reduction of prey populations are considered as the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> threats, in order of importance (ACA 2011: Andean Cat Alliance Strategic Plan).<br/> <br/> Expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate livestock management and water extraction for a growing mining and petroleum industry activity in the South American highlands and the Patagonian steppe are altering the Andean Cat habitat. The Andean Cat will be affected negatively by global climate change throughout most of its range by a decrease in the geographic distribution (Bennett<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. in progress) and more recently by rapid expansion of exploitation of shale oil and gas through hydraulic fracturing or fracking in northern Patagonia (Walker <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2013).<br/> <br/> Hunting by local people who consider the Andean Cat a predator of their small domestic livestock has been frequently reported particularly in some regions of Argentina, Chile and Peru (Iriarte 1998, Cossíos and Madrid 2003, Lucherini and Merino 2008). Andean Cats are being killed by herders in Patagonia in retaliation for predation (Novaro<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010). These cats are also killed by dogs accompanying local shepherds and in north-western Argentina high mortality rates due to hunting by local people have also been inferred (C. Tellaeche and M. Lucherini unpub. data). Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2007) also reported the hunting of Andean and Pampas Cats for food and for traditional medicine in central Peru.<br/> <br/> Particularly in Bolivia, Peru and northern Chile, the Andean Cat (as well as the Pampas Cat) is considered a sacred animal according to indigenous Aymara and Quechua traditions. Throughout much of its range, dried and stuffed specimens are kept by local people for use in harvest festivals (Iriarte 1999, Sanderson 1999,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2004, Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012). <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Hunting for such cultural practices may represent a significant threat to the species.<br/> <br/> The Short-tailed Chinchilla was likely to have been a major prey species for the Andean Cat, but the species was hunted nearly to extinction for the fur trade (Nowell and Jackson 1996). In most of its range, the main prey of the Andean Cat is now the Mountain Vizcacha (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2007, Viscarra 2008, Napolitano <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Torrico 2009), which lives in patchily distributed small colonies and has also been reduced by hunting pressure. This may result in a highly fragmented distribution for the Andean Cat. Intra-guild competition, especially with the Pampas Cat, for Mountain Vizcacha prey, could negatively impact the Andean Cat (Lucherini and Luengos Vidal 2003, Walker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2007, Reppucci 2012).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>","<p>Until now three population estimates on Andean Cat were carried out. Napolitano<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2008), based on genetic sampling estimated five individuals to occur in a 25,000 ha area in northern Chile, around the Salar de Surire National Monument, resulting in a density of two Andean Cats in 100 km². More recent estimates based on systematic camera trapping resulted in 7-12 Andean Cats in 100 km² in northwestern Argentina (Reppucci <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011) and in central western Bolivia, a preliminary estimate of 1.8 Andean cats in 100 km² was calculated by dividing the minimun number of identified Andean Cats by the area covered (164 km²) (Huaranca <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2013). In the last two studies, densities of sympatric Pampas Cats were also estimated, resulting 74-79 Pampas Cats in 100 km² in Argentina and 4.9 Pampas Cats in 100 km² in Bolivia. Reppucci <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2011) also estimated the detection probabilities for both species, which were higher for Andean Cat (0.07) than Pampas Cat (0.02). Other studies based mainly on faecal sample collection have found records of the Pampas Cat much more frequently than the Andean Cat (Lucherini and Vidal 2003, Perovic <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2003, Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Viscarra 2008, Torrico 2009, Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012). All this information confirms that the Andean Cat is much rarer than the Pampas Cat.<br/> <br/> The three surveyed areas outlined above are located within the two regions that are considered to have the most favourable climatic conditions for Andean Cat, and that coincide with those places where a larger number of Andean Cat records have been obtained (Marino<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011). In this context, it is expected that Andean Cat density in those areas with less favourable conditions will be much lower.<br/> <br/> A study of the population genetics of the Andean cat throughout most of its range (Cossios<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em>. 2012) indicated that the species has a very low mitochondrial and nuclear genetic diversity and two distinct Andean Cat subpopulations,which are latitudinally separated between 26 and 35° S,<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">were identified that should be considered as two ""Evolutionary Significant Units” (ESUs). Moreover, the northern ESU contains two genetically different groups, showing limited or no exchange of individuals between them, which should be considered as two ""Management Units” (MUs).<br/> <br/> The geographical separation between the northern and southern ESU concurs with the third biogeographic barrier, the South American Arid Diagonal and the separation between the two northern management units coincides with the transition zone between the wet and dry Puna (Cossíos <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em> </em>2012); thus, the authors remark that these three groups of Andean Cat populations could have developed special adaptations because significant differences exist in rainfall patterns over this range.<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Andean Cat has a patchy distribution due to a specialization for naturally fragmented rocky habitats and most presence records are from the central Andes above 3,600 meters in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. However it has also been found at lower elevations in the southern Andes of Argentina at 1,800 m (Sorli<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2006) and more recent records of the Andean Cat in Argentina and Chile extend its distribution range to the south and outside the Andes, into Patagonian steppe and scrub habitats in Argentina, at elevations as low as 650 m (Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010, Martinez <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008), and at 2,200 m in Chile in the Atacama Region (Villalobos<em> et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. in prep.).<br/> <br/> Within the high Andes the Andean Cat was recorded at an average elevation of 4,236 m in Argentina (Perovic<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> 2003), above 3,800 m in Bolivia (Villalba <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2012), between 3,714 and 4,414 m in Chile (Napolitano <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2008), and at 4,000 m or higher in Peru (Cossios <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007).<br/> <br/> Until the end of the nineties, Andean Cat records were scarce and restricted to southern Peru, southwest Bolivia, northwest Argentina and northern Chile (Yensen and Seymour 2000). Similarly, sightings of this species were very few (Scrocchi and Halloy 1986, Sanderson 1999), and museum specimens were equally few (Garcia-Perea 2002). However in the last two decades the number of distribution records has greatly increased due to the efforts of the Andean Cat Alliance (<a href=""http://www.gatoandino.org"">www.gatoandino.org</a>), a network of specialist researchers.<br/> <br/> Currently the known northern and southern limit for the Andean cat respectively is central Peru (10°13'S), and central Argentina (38°23'S) (Cossios<span class=""apple-converted-space""> <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2007, Novaro <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2010), but throughout this range the Andean Cat populations are patchily distributed. The results of modelling the Andean Cat distribution considering four bioclimatic variables (annual mean and mean diurnal range temperature, annual precipitation, and coldest season winter), shows the presence of three biogeographic barriers that affect the species’ distribution: i) at the north in Peru that coincides with the Huancabamba depression, known as “Peruvian low” and defines the northern boundary of its distribution range, ii) at the centre in Bolivia, with the “Andean knee”, an extremely arid transition zone between the wet and dry Puna and where there are no records of Andean cats, and iii) at the south with the “Arid Diagonal” in Chile and Argentina, that is also an hyper-arid zone and with very few records of Andean Cats (Marino <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011).<br/> <br/> According to this model and despite the differences in elevation over the current geographic range of the Andean Cat, there are common climatic conditions that favour for their presence, which are cold, dry and extreme diurnal variations in temperature (Marino <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em> </em>2011).<br/> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></span></p>","In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Perú people of Aymara origin, and in some cases Quechua, have similar beliefs regarding the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat (both known as titi or osqollo). A common tradition is the use of a skin or a stuffed cat during ceremonies that people perform for marking their domestic livestock, mainly llamas or alpacas; the titi is considered a sacred animal related with abundance and fertility of the livestock or quality of crops. It is important to note that both the Andean Cat and Pampas Cat are part of these traditions and beliefs, and in general, are used indiscriminately. There are some local variations within and between countries and in some cases the influence of western culture has resulted in a total or partial loss of the values of Andean cultures and the distortion of ancestral customs regarding the titi (Villalba <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/>Cossios&#160;<em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">.

However, law enforcement is problematic, and hunted specimens are regularly observed in the field and for sale, although with less frequency than before, in special markets to be used in religious ceremonies.<br/> <br/> After developing the actions outlined in the Andean Cat Conservation Action Plan (Villalba<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004) and the information generated in the last 10 years, the Andean Cat Alliance elaborated the Strategic Plan for Andean Cat Conservation (AGA 2011) with the following objectives and maintaining the three main lines of action: Research, Education and Conservation:<br/> <br/> a.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To ensure long-term conservation of the Andean Cat and its natural environment, including the restoration or rehabilitation of the environments that have suffered degradation.<br/> <br/> b.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To integrate the conservation of the Andean Cat and its natural environment within local policies in the four countries where the species is present, working locally but with a global approach.<br/> <br/> c.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To strengthen activities of conservation and research in protected areas with Andean Cat populations, and to promote the creation or extension of existing protected areas to provide connectivity and/or protection of habitats and Andean cat populations.<br/> <br/> d.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To promote research on the conservation threats, ecological requirements of the species, its principal prey, and other sympatric carnivores.<br/> <br/> e.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To standardize the activities of working groups under common and more effective goals.<br/> <br/> f.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To train protected areas staff and local communities in activities in research, education and conservation, within and outside protected areas.<br/> <br/> The Andean Cat is found in several protected areas across its range and some were prioritized for promoting effective conservation of the species as well as their habitats and others for the need to carry out surveys and promote effective conservation actions.<br/> <br/> Mining and oil/gas extraction are a priority economic activity in South American countries, even in protected areas, therefore lobbying with authorities and the industry sector, as well as promoting and/or supporting the implementation of mitigation plans to minimize impacts are fundamental actions to be addressed (Walker<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Similarly, community-based conservation is an essential approach that is being implemented by promoting or supporting sustainable economic initiatives, favouring better practices in livestock management or other activities oriented to mitigate human-wildlife conflict. Community education and support for law enforcement are also important activities to minimize or stop Andean Cat hunting and encourage positive attitudes towards Andean cats and high Andean biodiversity.<br/><br/><strong> National legislation</strong><br/> <br/> <u>Argentina</u><br/> The Andean Cat is protected by National Law 22421 of wildlife conservation and its Statutory<br/> Decree 666/97.

51140517,15188,Okapia johnstoni,Endangered,A2abcd+4abcd,2015,2015-07-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Okapi have been undergoing a decline since at least 1995 that is ongoing and projected to continue, in the face of severe, intensifying threats and lack of effective conservation action which is hindered by the lack of security. The rate of decline is estimated to have exceeded 50% over three generations (24 years), based on figures from surveys in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (Réserve de Faune à Okapis; RFO) suggesting a 43% decline over the period 1995-2007, which some reports suggest continued in the period thereafter. The RFO remains the best protected site and it is inferred that the rate of decline here is at least equalled in other parts of the Okapi range. Although monitoring is only available to support estimates of declines in RFO since 1995, reports of declines or extirpations in other parts of the range and loss and degradation of habitat have been ongoing since 1980. The species is confirmed to be Endangered under criterion A2abcd+4abcd.","Okapi are limited to closed, high canopy forests between about 450 m asl and 1,500 m asl and they occur in a wide range of primary and older secondary forest types. They do not extend into gallery forests or the forest-savannah ecotone and do not persist in disturbed habitats surrounding larger settlements. Okapi will use seasonally inundated areas when the substrate is still wet, but they do not occur in truly inundated sites or extensive swamp forest. Tree fall gaps are selected as foraging sites for Okapi during the early stages of regeneration (Hart 2013). Okapi are unique in being the only species of forest ungulate to depend on understorey foliage and they are known to feed on over 100 species. They are mainly diurnal but have also been recorded feeding at night (Nixon and Lusenge 2008). Okapi have defined but non-exclusive home ranges, averaging 3-5 km<sup>2</sup> for adult females and up to 13 km<sup>2</sup> for adult males. Okapi are mainly solitary (Hart 2013). Generation length is broadly estimated at around eight years, based on calculations made for the global captive population (S. Hofman and K. Leus pers. comm. 2013).","Okapi can coexist with small-scale, low-level human occupation of the forest, but disappear in areas of active settlement or disturbance, and the major threat to this species is habitat loss due to logging and human settlement including illegal occupation of protected areas (Hart 2013, Kümpel <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;According to Hart (2013) approximately one-third of the Okapi’s known distribution is likely to be at risk by major incursions during the first quarter of this century. Areas at high risk include the southeastern Ituri Forest, the Kisangani area, Rubi-Tele, and the western and eastern limits of the species' range in the Ebola River basin and Virunga-Hoyo region respectively.<br/><br/>Hunting for meat and skins is also a threat and Okapi decline rapidly in areas where there is persistent use of snares. In some areas, Okapi are targeted for bushmeat whereas in others they are taken only incidentally (Hart 2013, Kümpel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The most prominent current threat to Okapi is the presence of illegal armed groups in and around key protected areas. These groups prevent effective conservation action, even surveys and monitoring in most sites, and engage in and facilitate elephant poaching, bushmeat hunting, illegal mining (gold, coltan and diamonds), illegal logging, charcoal production and agricultural encroachment. In a notorious incident in June 2012, armed rebels attacked the RFO HQ and killed seven people and all 14 captive Okapi.","East (1999) estimated that the total population may be over 10,000 and Hart (2013) estimated 35,000-50,000, though both sets of figures are perhaps better regarded as ‘guesstimates’ as they rely on extrapolation of a limited number of patchily distributed, dung-based surveys. Individual Okapi are rarely encountered and in much of their range they are uncommon or dispersed in localized areas, with dung found at low densities, commonly resulting in inadequate sample sizes for statistical analysis. Current numbers are believed to be lower and declining, but there is no reliable estimate of current population size. <br/><br/>It is widely considered that there was a decline in the Okapi population, along with other species, following the decade-long civil war which ended in the early 2000s. Population estimates were made in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (Réserve de Faune à Okapis; RFO) in 1993-1995 and repeated in 2005-2007 using the same ‘monitoring’ transects and distance sampling methodology, though individual transects were not necessarily carried out at the same time of year due to insecurity limiting access to parts of the Reserve (Hart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). These surveys showed a decline in dung density of 43% between the two survey periods. A second set of transects in 2005-2007 used an improved spatial design (systematic placement of transects covering the entire reserve), but were also conducted across seasons for the reasons above. Further analysis is required to determine whether comparison of these ‘systematic’ transects with the 1995-1997 and 2005-2007 monitoring transects, and a further set of transects conducted in 2000-2002 over part of the reserve under the MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants) program, supports the observed decline in dung density, and to specifically investigate seasonality as a variable. The same type of systematic design was used again in 2010-2011, but implemented over the three month dry season to reduce the effects of seasonality. While an overall comparison between the two systematic surveys (2005-2007 and 2010-2011) appeared to show an increase in Okapi dung density (Vosper <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), a comparison between transects undertaken at the same time of year (the dry season only), in the same area of the reserve, showed no significant difference in Okapi dung density (F. Maisels pers. comm. 2014). Seasonal differences in dung decay rates therefore complicate comparisons between these various sets of surveys.<br/><br/>Supporting evidence for RFO is available from Law Enforcement Monitoring (LEM) patrols from 2008 to 2013. These patrols covered distances of 10,125–25,467 km annually and showed an apparent decline in Okapi dung encounter rates between 2008 and 2013 (ICCN RFO unpubl. data). However, because the patrols were focused on anti-poaching and wildlife recording was secondary, patrol routes were not randomly located, and patrol timings and locations varied among years because of security and logistical issues, the data must be interpreted with caution.<br/><br/>Since the rebel attack on the RFO headquarters in June 2012 (see ‘Threats’ below), the presence of armed groups and an influx of illegal miners and poachers has reduced the ability of the reserve authorities to protect the reserve and this is likely to have ongoing implications for resident wildlife populations. RFO is still the most effectively protected Okapi site with resident rangers and an active conservation programme and the overall rate of decline here is inferred to have been equalled or exceeded elsewhere.<br/><br/>In the Twabinga-Mundo region, anecdotal evidence suggests that Okapi are targeted for their skins and meat, and have undergone a drastic decline in numbers over the past two decades with local people reporting that Okapi is the most prized bushmeat available (Nixon&#160;2010). Okapi had been present south of the town of Aketi and near the town of Buta but no signs were found on recent field surveys and locals said they had recently been hunted out by Bangalema nomadic hunters (Hicks 2010).",Decreasing,"Okapi distribution extends across parts of central, northern and eastern DR Congo. North and east of the Congo River, Okapi range from Maiko Forest north to the Ituri Forest, then west through the Rubi, Tele and Ebola river basins, extending north towards the Ubangi River. Okapi have a much smaller range to the west and south of the Congo River, extending from the west bank of the Lomami River west to the upper Lomela and Tshuapa basins (Hart 2013). In the fairly recent past, Okapi occurred occasionally in the adjoining Semliki forest of western Uganda (Kingdon 1979).<br/><br/>Recorded presence is concentrated in and around protected areas, mainly reflecting survey effort. The remoteness and inaccessibility of much Okapi habitat make field work logistically difficult, and insecurity in DRC over the past two decades has further restricted survey activity. As a consequence, extensive parts of potential Okapi range are poorly studied. Furthermore, Okapi are secretive and their occurrence can easily go undetected, especially at low densities.<br/><br/>The known strongholds of the Okapi are the Ituri and Maiko landscapes, the forests of the upper Lindi, Maiko and Tshopo basins and the Rubi-Tele region in Bas Uele (Hart 2013). There are confirmed recent (2013) records of Okapi in the Abumonbanzi Reserve in Gbadolite district of North Ubangi at the northwest end of the distribution (Ngbolua <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Since 1980, expansion of human settlement, deforestation and forest degradation have eliminated important portions of the Okapi range, in particular in the southern and eastern Ituri Forest where the species was at one time abundant (Hart 2013).<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 383,190 km<sup>2</sup>, but this includes unsuitable habitat such as degraded forest, swamp forest and urban areas. Excluding all these gives in an area of 244,405 km<sup>2</sup> for the suitable or hypothesised range (Kümpel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). The area of occupancy (AOO) is 14,112 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a grid of 5.6 x 5.6 km, the size used by most reported surveys and 450 (3.5%) of 12,764 grid squares with confirmed presence Kümpel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015). The AOO figure is however considered likely to be a substantial underestimate, surveys have been conducted in only 1,994 (15.6%) out of 12,764 grid squares so far.",Okapi are hunted for meat and skins.,Terrestrial,"<p>This species is not included in the CITES Appendices. The Okapi is a fully protected species under Congolese law and the species is a national symbol, appearing on the insignia of the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN) and on Congolese banknotes. <br/> <br/> The RFO (14,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and Maiko National Park (10,800 km<sup>2</sup>) support significant populations, but numbers in both sites have declined owing to the threats listed above. Strengthening protection of these two protected areas is the single most important means to ensure long-term survival of Okapi (East 1999, Hart 2013). A small population of Okapi still occurs in the Watalinga Forest (1,100 km<sup>2</sup>) in the northern sector of Virunga National Park, but currently receives no protection due to the presence of armed groups, though a new forest corridor project connecting Watalinga to the Mt Hoyo Reserve (200 km<sup>2</sup>), where Okapi have also been recorded, is due to start in 2015. Okapi occur in Rubi-Tele Hunting Reserve (c. 9,000 km<sup>2</sup>), though its precise legal status is unclear, in Abumonbanzi Reserve in the far west of the range, and on the west bank of the Congo River, where the proposed Lomami National Park within the Tshuapa-Lomami-Lualaba landscape (9,500 km<sup>2</sup>) is undergoing the process of official gazettement (Kümpel <em>et al.</em> 2015). A number of community reserves are located around Maiko National Park. </p>  <p>Many captive Okapi are held in international collections. In November 2011, representatives of the North American and European captive populations, including the Okapi Species Survival Plan (SSP) and the Okapi European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), met to discuss the role of the captive population in Okapi conservation and agreed to maintain a sustainable, cooperatively managed global <em>ex situ</em> Okapi population that contributes to a viable <em>in situ</em> population (Petric 2012). The zoo community is a major supporter of Okapi conservation work, in 2010 donating USD 225,000 to the Okapi Conservation Project, 33% of its budget (Gilman International Conservation, 2010). </p>    <p>ICCN is the government agency responsible for protected area management but is under-staffed and under-funded. The Okapi Conservation Project was established in 1987 and works within the RFO to protect Okapi and their habitat, as well as the culture of the indigenous Mbuti pygmies. Project activities include capacity building, agroforestry and community support (Gilman International Conservation 2010). The Wildlife Conservation Society started field surveys and research on Okapi in RFO and elsewhere in DRC in the 1980s. Several other international NGOs have also conducted Okapi-related work in DRC, including Fauna &amp; Flora International, Frankfurt Zoological Society, the Lukuru Foundation, and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). The first-ever species-wide Okapi conservation strategy was developed at a workshop held in DRC in May 2013 that was organised by ZSL in partnership with ICCN (Kümpel<em> et al.</em> 2015). In March 2013 a new IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group was established, co-hosted by ZSL, with the aim of coordinating research and conservation on both giraffid species and supporting implementation of the Okapi conservation strategy.</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small geographically isolated subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt; 1000 mature individuals. Anthropogenic mortality of only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals per year from a population of 100 individuals would result in 30%, 50% and 80% declines in population abundance after 3 generations, respectively (see Moore 2015 Table 5).</p>  <p>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the species’ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the species’ range in Australia (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012; Bejder<em> et al.</em> 2012; Cagnazzi<em> et al.</em> 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown<em> et al.</em> 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell<em> et al.</em> 2013). Additionally, the species’ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  Considering the available evidence and following a precautionary approach we considered this species as Vulnerable under IUCN criterion C2a(i) because the total number of mature individuals is plausibly fewer than 10,000, a projected continuing decline due to cumulative impacts; and each of the defined subpopulations studied to date is estimated to contain fewer than 1,000 mature individuals. Although the species may not meet any of the criteria for Endangered at this time, it is likely to do so in the near future considering It is possible that 1) number of mature individuals is less than 2,500, 2) the reductions in population size have been larger and pervasive enough to cause a net reduction for the entire species of at least 20% over a period of 2 generations and 3) that the number of mature individuals in each subpopulation across their range is ≤ 250 individuals.","<p>Within their geographical range Australian Humpback Dolphins are found primarily in coastal waters. Opportunistic data collected during aerial surveys designed to estimate the distribution and abundance of Dugongs (<em>Dugong dugon</em>) in the Great Barrier Reef indicated that Australian Humpback Dolphins were sighted on average 6.4 km (se = 1.26, Range 0-55.6 km) from the nearest point of land and 2.7 km (std. err. = 0.27, range = 0-8.1 km) to the nearest shallow area (either point of land or charted reef, less than 2m deep at low tide) (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997). In Queensland and in the Northern Territory humpback dolphins are found mostly within 10 km off the coast (Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). Accordingly, in Keppel Bay, Central Queensland, where up to 10 km offshore waters still remain below 10m in depth, Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were recorded on average 2.8 km (SD = 4.21, Range = 0-24 km) off the coast. In Western Australia, sightings obtained from recent exploratory surveys and ongoing studies seem to confirm a similar pattern, with the majority of the sightings obtained within 5 km off the coast (Brown and Hunt personal communication). In Papua New Guinea, the first tentative sightings of Australian Humpback Dolphins&#160;were made in the Kikori Delta region; close to the coastline and in waters 1.6-11.4 m deep (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p>  <p>While coastal waters are arguably the primary habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins, most survey work has been conducted close to the coast, thus the extent to which humpback dolphins use offshore waters is not yet fully understood. Observations of Australian Humpback Dolphins at least up to 55.6 km from land, indicate that this species may occasionally venture further offshore especially in sheltered and protected waters such as in the Great Barrier Reef where sand flats occur almost continuously from the mainland to the outer reefs (Corkeron<em> et al.</em> 1997).</p>  <p>Along the Australian Coast Humpback Dolphins are more likely to be found in relatively shallow and protected coastal habitats such as inlets, estuaries, shallow bays, inshore reefs and coastal archipelagos rather than in open stretches of coastline. In Queensland and Northern Territory, humpback dolphins are mainly found in water less than 20 km from the nearest river mouth and in water less than 15-20 m deep (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). Few animals have been observed in waters up to 30-50 m deep, but remained in close proximity (within 5 km) to the coast (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). In both Queensland and Northern Territory humpback dolphins have been also recorded as far as 20-50 km upstream in large rivers such as the East Alligator River, Northern Territory, and in the Fitzroy and Brisbane rivers in Queensland (Cagnazzi 2010, Palmer<em> et al.</em> 2014b, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). No studies on habitat use have been conducted in Western Australia. Preliminary surveys and ongoing studies in few locations indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins appear to utilize a wide range of near-shore habitats. For example, around the North West Cape, dolphins have been sighted in clear waters over Ningaloo Reef, and in turbid waters in Exmouth Gulf, and in depths ranging from 1 to 40 m deep (T. Hunt 2015, pers. comm., 19 February) </p>  <p>Among subpopulations there appear to be some differences in habitat selection suggesting high adaptability of this species to local environment characteristics. For example, in Cleveland Bay Australian Humpback Dolphins showed preferences for waters close to the coast and 2-5 m deep, followed by waters 1-2 m deep whereas in Keppel Bay (~630 Km south) humpback dolphins showed preference for waters 2-5 and 5-10 m deep, while In Port Curtis (~700 km further south) humpback dolphins showed preference for water 5-10 and 10-15 m deep. Within these regions humpback dolphins showed selection for various types of habitats including dredged channels, reefs, seagrass flats and mangroves.</p>  Across Australia, humpback dolphins have been observed feeding in a wide range of inshore-estuarine coastal habitats including rivers and creeks, expose banks, shallow flats, rock and coral reefs as well as over submerged reefs in waters at least up to 40 m deep (Allen<em> et al.</em> 2012, Cagnazzi 2010, Parra 2006, Parra<em> et al.</em> 2006b). The analysis of stomach contents of 6 humpback dolphins stranded in Queensland indicated they are opportunistic-generalist feeders, preying on a wide variety of fishes including both bottom-dwelling species (e.g., grunts, tooth ponyfishes, croakers, flatheads, and whitings) as<strong> </strong>well as pelagic species (e.g., cardinal fishes, gizzard shads, anchovies, false trevally and barracudas) (Parra and Jedensjö 2014). Among these, Grunt fish (<em>Pomadasys</em> sp.) were the most numerically important prey accounting for more than half (52.9%) of all prey items, followed by the cardinal fish (<em>Apogon </em>sp., 10.4%) and smelt-whiting (<em>Sillago </em>sp., 9.7%) (Parra and Jedensjö 2014)","<strong>Habitat Loss and Degradation<br/></strong>Several regions across Humpback Dolphins’ range in Australia have been substantially modified both inland, to allow mining, agricultural and grazing activities and along the coast to allow industrial ports; marinas, aquaculture and residential developments. Concurrently, several mining industries are undergoing major upgrades and extensions, while new extraction sites have been proposed to meet an increasing export demand of primary resources (carbon, oil, natural gas, woods, aluminium and uranium), particularly in northwestern Australia and along the central coast of Queensland (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Queensland Government 2012). As a result significant expansions of existing ports facilities are underway across the coastal range of Australian Humpback Dolphins (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) For example, by 2020 the port capacity along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Queensland, is expected to triple to support the predicted growth in Queensland’s annual coal production (Grech <em>et al</em>. 2013). The IUCN considered this unprecedented scale of development as a serious threat to biodiversity in the GBRWHA (Douvere and Badman 2012).<br/><br/>Activities associated with coastal zone developments such as land reclamation, dredging, seismic surveys, drilling, blasting, shipping and resource extraction may result in habitat loss and degradation for Australian Humpback Dolphins. For example, it has been estimated that in the Fitzroy River, Queensland, between 14 to 25% of Australian Snubfin Dolphin (<em>Orcaella heinsohni</em>) habitat (which largely overlaps with that of Australian Humpback Dolphins) will be directly modified if a planned industrial port development were to occur (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Besides their influence on dolphins’ habitat, these activities have the potential to cause disturbance of humpback dolphins’ normal activities through physical displacement and increasing underwater noise pollution (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014). Dredging involved in the construction, maintenance and expansion of ports is of particular concern as it may potentially displace dolphins from important habitats as a result of changes in fish distribution, increased vessel activities, declining water quality and underwater noise (Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Todd <em>et al</em>. 2015). Because most ports across the Australian Humpback Dolphins range are located in relatively shallow waters, they all require large volumes of dredging. For example, the Gladstone Western Basin project in Queensland involved the dredging of 22 million cubic meters of soil (Ports Australia 2014).<br/><br/>Additionally habitat loss and fragmentation from coastal zone developments and associated activities can influence the population genetic structure of biological populations through their isolation (Keyghobadi 2007). Given the small densities, strong population genetic structure and limited gene flow found among subpopulations of Australian Humpback Dolphins; loss of genetic variation may reduce the ability of individuals to adapt to a changing environment, cause inbreeding depression, reduce survival and reproduction and increase their probability of extinction (Andrews 2014, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><strong><br/>By-catch</strong><br/>Human-related mortality of humpback dolphins in Australian waters is thought to be largely attributable to by-catch in shark nets set for swimmers protection by the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) and in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries for Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em> Bloch 1970) and Threadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em> Macleay 1884) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> Shaw 1804) (Hale 1997, Paterson 1990). There are no estimates of the magnitude of these indirect takes or of their trend over the time.<br/><br/>Fisheries observers on gillnet vessels operating in northern Australian waters between 1981-1985 reported one Australian Humpback Dolphin among the cetacean species incidentally taken (Harwood and Hembree 1987). At least 18 Humpback Dolphins were collected from shark nets along the Queensland coast between 1968-2001 (Haines and Limpus 2002, Heinsohn 1979). Between 1997-2007 a further 13 humpback dolphins were reported caught in the QSCP shark nets and drumlines (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Shark nets have now been removed from most of the Queensland coast and captures of dolphins appear to be small at a state level (Gribble <em>et al</em>. 1998). For example, between 2008 and 2011 no humpback dolphin was reported caught in the shark nets, despite QSCP accounting for 73% of all cetaceans mortalities (Meager <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, given the low population sizes at which this species occurs, the death of even a few individuals per year at a local level could have detrimental consequences on the viability of local subpopulations.<br/><br/><strong>Water pollution</strong><br/>Sources of anthropogenic contaminants are likely to increase in the future across northern Australia, as a result of a widespread contamination by several new pesticides (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012), increasing annual runoff (Chiew and McMahon 2002), and rapid urban and industrial development. As coastal top predators, humpback dolphins may accumulate high concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants through bioaccumulation (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>The water discharge by many rivers across the Humpback Dolphin’s range in Australia is of poor quality, often with contaminant concentrations likely to cause environmental harm (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2012, Francey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Schaffelke <em>et al</em>. 2012). For example an assessment of the relative risk of pollutants from agricultural and land uses ranked most of the rivers in Queensland as relatively high priority (Waterhouse <em>et al</em>. 2012). Agricultural and industrial-sourced pollutants have been identified as the major threats to the coastal water quality especially along the Great Barrier Reef. As a result various contaminants, were detected in sediments samples as well as in several marine species known to be part of the humpback dolphin diet (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2005). Accordingly, a recent study detected high levels of organochlorine compounds (DDTs, PCBs, HCB) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in biopsy samples collected from humpback dolphins along the Queensland coast (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a).<br/><br/>Although exposure to contaminants may not directly cause the death of an animal, it may affect the dolphins’ health in numerous ways, including an increased susceptibility to diseases and impairment of metabolic functions (Bossart 2011, De Swart <em>et al</em>. 1996). The immunosuppressive effect of contaminants may play an important role in the death of humpback dolphins following large floods and major industrial coastal developments (DEHP 2012, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Underwater Noise</strong><br/>Sounds introduced into the marine environment by anthropogenic activities (e.g., dredging, pile-driving, underwater surveying, shipping) may have detrimental effects on marine mammals by interfering with their ability to communicate, echolocate, and/or mask other important natural sounds (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 1995, Nowacek <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>For example, impulsive hammering sounds can be loud, and levels as high as 165 dB re 1 mPa were measured 1 km from a hammer used for pipe installation (Bailey <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent study conducted in the Pearl River Estuary of China, near Hong Kong, to monitor the effects of the world's largest vibration hammer (OCTA-KONG) on Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins has suggested that the vibration zone detectable by individual animal extends beyond 3.5 km. While Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins clicks do not appear to be adversely affected, the whistles were susceptible to auditory masking and a safety zone of 500 m radius was proposed (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Floods</strong><br/>Peak mortality of inshore dolphins In Queensland, including Australian Humpback Dolphins, followed sustained periods of elevated freshwater discharge (9 months) (Meager and Limpus 2014). In Queensland floods exceed their natural ranges of variation due to inland catchment modifications that result in a large amount of sediments, heavy metals, nutrients and pesticides being discharged into the estuaries and adjacent coastal areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Furnas 2003). Increases in freshwater discharge may also increase exposure to infectious pathogens such as toxoplasmosis; which has been observed and thought to be the cause of death of four Australian Humpback Dolphins (Bowater <em>et al</em>. 2003). Modelling studies estimated that in some areas the annual runoff in catchments across Australia could increase to up to 15% by the year 2030, due to the increased in rainfall associated with global warming (Chiew and McMahon 2002). Thus, the resilience and recovery capacity of the entire coastal ecosystem including humpback dolphins’ preferred habitat may be put under great threat.<br/><br/><strong>Cumulative threats</strong><br/>The cumulative impact of environmental factors and anthropogenic activities is arguably the primary threat to humpback dolphins (Dungan <em>et al</em>. 2011). The continuous alteration of coastal systems have greatly undermined the resilience of many wildlife communities, populations, and species living in estuaries, making them more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity events and anthropogenic stressors (Hobday and Lough 2011). The loss of habitat quantity and quality has been identified among the primary drivers of population declines of marine animals. The reduction of suitable habitat may force local populations of humpback dolphins to adjust to the remaining resources through a reduction in survival rate and population size, or emigration to more suitable areas (Andren 1994, Fahrig 1997, Jefferson 2000). Such effects are likely to be exacerbated when natural systems are simultaneously subjected to multiple stressors as a result of cumulative impacts and negative synergistic interactions (Crain <em>et al</em>. 2008, Halpern <em>et al</em>. 2008, Venter <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Recent studies on other inshore dolphin populations living in highly industrialized regions have reported negative population trends. In the Pearl River estuary, China, modelling of demographic data from strandings of humpback dolphins predicted that the population was declining at about 2.4% per annum (Huang et al. 2012), in the Yangtze River the population of Yangtze Finless Porpoise is declining at a rate of about 6% p.a. (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2012), while in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, the local isolated bottlenose dolphin population has declined at a rate of about 30% over the last 12 years (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2007). According to this evidence a reduction in the number of Australian Humpback Dolphins could be expected if the impacts of multiple port expansion, development projects, water pollution, vessel traffic and increasing frequency of natural catastrophic events are not properly addressed.","At present, there is no range-wide estimate of the abundance of Australian Humpback Dolphins. Estimates of abundance are available from several discrete locations across Australia (Supplementary Material: Table 1, see Fig. 1 for locations). Additionally, monitoring to estimate abundance is currently underway at several new locations in Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Overall, available abundance estimates indicate that humpback dolphins occur in small subpopulations averaging 54-89 individuals and 0.1-0.19 individuals per km² (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the global number of “mature individuals” (i.e. individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction) of Australian Humpback Dolphins is challenging, because relevant demographic data are insufficient or non-existent. If we assume that the proportion of mature individuals (Nm) is similar to that estimated for the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>), which is 50% (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007), each subpopulation studied to date (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) numbers &lt;105 mature individuals. Considering that all available abundance estimates for Australian Humpback Dolphins are low (typically less than 150 individuals; Table 1 in the Supplementary Material), the total number of mature individuals across their range is unlikely to exceed 10,000 individuals.<br/><br/><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>Estimates of population size trends across the species’ range are unknown. Surveys in Cleveland Bay, northeast Queensland, (1999-2002) showed low population sizes (34-54 individuals) and no clear trends, but indicated that even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates population trends will be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size were greater than 20% p.a. (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a). A longer multiyear study (2006-2011) in the Capricorn and Curtis Coast regions, Central Queensland, showed that abundance estimates declined throughout the study in Keppel Bay and Curtis coast region from 115 and 84 individuals in 2007 to 104 and 45 in 2011, respectively (Cagnazzi 2013). The decline in abundance estimates was associated with a large flood event in 2010 and the concurrent expansion of the Port Curtis port facilities (Cagnazzi 2013). Analyses of data collected until 2014 will clarify whether the observed decline is permanent or just a temporary shift in dolphin distribution.<br/><br/>Ongoing monitoring studies (2011-2014) in Bynoe Harbor, Darwin Harbor and Shoal Bay in the Northern Territory, have shown that the numbers of humpback dolphins in these areas are quite small (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) but have remained fairly stable throughout the years (Brooks and Pollock 2014). Estimates in Port Essington Harbor, Northern Territory, varied widely (48-207) among sampling periods (2008-2010). This variation was likely due to movements in and out of the study area, temporary emigration, temporal changes in behaviour, or temporal changes in detectability (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a).<br/><br/>Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small and localized subpopulations connected by limited gene flow. No subpopulation studied to date (Table 1) is estimated to contain more than 104 mature individuals. Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation across their range would be &lt;1,000 mature individuals and that there could well be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. As with other cetaceans, the low reproductive rates of Australian Humpback Dolphins make them vulnerable to even low rates of anthropogenic mortality. For example, assuming a 3% recruitment rate (as estimated for <em>S. chinensis</em> and <em>S. plumbea</em> in Moore 2015) a discrete subpopulation of 100 individuals would decline by 30%, 50% and 80% over 75 years (three generations) if only 3.7, 4.1 and 5.3 individuals were removed, respectively, per year due to anthropogenic mortality (see Table 5 in Moore 2015).<br/><br/>Given the number of development projects that are underway or proposed throughout a great proportion of the species’ range in Australia (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Material) a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals is projected. There are indications already of considerable declines in at least some locations along the Queensland coast, which are potentially linked to environmental stressors (Cagnazzi 2013). Habitat degradation and loss is ongoing and expected to increase across the species’ range in Australia (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). The loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats is one of the primary drivers of population declines for species following a metapopulation structure model such as humpback dolphins (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014, Cagnazzi 2010, Schnell <em>et al</em>. 2013). Additionally, the species’ range is considered a hotspot of future extinction risk for marine mammals because of cumulative human impacts (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Population Structure</strong><br/>Overall, the genetic data available suggest that Australian Humpback Dolphins exist as a metapopulation of small and relatively isolated subpopulations with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014, Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data). Analysis of population structure using both microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA sequence data from humpback dolphins from the Dampier Archipelago, and the North West Cape in north Western Australia (~300 km apart) showed significant levels of population structure with limited gene flow (Brown et al. 2014). Similarly, analysis of population structure among eight sampling locations (from tens to 1,500 kilo meters apart) along the east coast of Queensland indicated significant population differentiation and low levels of migration rates between most sampling locations (Parra <em>et al</em>. unpub. data).<br/><br/>The available evidence on abundance estimates (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material) and population genetic structure indicates Australian Humpback Dolphins live in small, localized populations with limited gene flow. Abundance estimates suggest that there are fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. Additionally, no subpopulation studied to date is larger than 200 mature individuals (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Substantial numbers of humpback dolphins have been killed in localized areas along the east coast of Queensland in anti-shark nets set to protect bathers (Heinsohn 1979, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004) . Humpback dolphins are also known to die in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries primarily for |Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) and T|hreadfin Salmon (<em>Polynemus sheridani</em>) and <em>Eleutheronema tetradactylum</em> (Anderson 1995, Hale 1997). Given the continuing vulnerability to bycatch in shark nets and gillnets, low densities in surveyed areas, and increased habitat degradation throughout their range (see threats section) it is likely that a continuing decline of at least 10% will occur over a period of 3 generations (about 75 years, assuming generation length is similar to that estimated for <em>S. chinensis </em>in Moore 2015).",Decreasing,"Australian Humpback Dolphins are found in tropical/subtropical waters of the Sahul Shelf from northern Australia to the southern waters of the island of New Guinea(Jefferson and Rosenbaum 2014). In Australia humpback dolphins are thought to be widely distributed along the northern Australian coastline from approximately the Queensland-New South Wales border (31°27´S, 152°55´E) to western Shark Bay, Western Australia (25°51´S, E113°20´E). However, no dedicated wide-scale surveys throughout this range have been conducted and at present, this continuous distribution is inferred primarily from localized studies; strandings, museum records and aerial surveys for other species (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004). Similarly, the extent of their distribution in the southern waters off the island of New Guinea is also still unclear due to the limited amount of marine mammal survey work carried out in this region. Recent surveys in the Kikori Delta region of Papua New Guinea reported a total of 7 groups of humpback dolphins (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014). Photographic records of these animals indicate that they are likely <em>S. sahulensis</em> but genetic studies are needed to solidly clarify which Sousa species occurs off the island of New Guinea. It is also uncertain if the species occurs in the deep waters (~30-90 m depth) over the continental shelf between Australia and Indonesian New Guinea (the Arafura Sea).<br/><br/>Most studies to date indicate that Australian Humpback Dolphins occur mostly close to the coast (within 20 km from land) and in relatively sheltered offshore waters near reefs or islands (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Corkeron <em>et al</em>. 1997, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006b). Furthermore, stomach content analyses indicate Australian Humpback Dolphins feed mainly on fishes associated with coastal-estuarine waters (Parra and Jedensjö 2014). As most survey work has been conducted in coastal waters, this apparent coastal distribution and preference for inshore habitats might be biased.<br/><br/>For purposes of this assessment and in line with discussions on the distribution range for <em>S. sahulensis</em> at the IUCN Workshop to Assess/Re-Assess IUCN Red Listings for Indo-Pacific Genera of Coastal Small Cetaceans (San Diego, 20-21 May 2015), we assume Australian Humpback Dolphins occur 1) continuously across northern Australia and southern New Guinea and 2) up to the 30 m isobath (Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Material). Given these assumptions we estimate their geographic range to be approximately 562,193 km² comprised of: ~405,091 km² for Australia (QLD: ~202,344 km², NT: ~98,769 and WA: ~ 103,978 km²) and ~157,102 km² for southern New Guinea. The lack of spatial information on the occurrence of Australian Humpback Dolphins throughout their inferred range precludes an accurate estimation of their extent of occurrence (EOO; i.e. area contained within the shortest continuous imaginary boundary which can be drawn to encompass all the known, inferred or projected sites of present occurrence of a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy) and area of occupancy (AOO; i.e. area within its 'extent of occurrence' which is occupied by a taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy). Although both EOO and AOO are likely to be significantly less than the geographic range estimated here, the large extent of their potential distribution suggests that their EOO and AOO are very likely to be above 20,000 km².","<p>There is no robust evidence of traditional use for consumption or medicinal use across the Australian humpback dolphin’s geographical range. In the 1960-70s live-captures (at least 8 individuals) took place in Queensland, Australia, for oceanarium displays (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2004). A female humpback dolphin wild caught in 1968 and currently held at Sea World (Amity) is estimated to be over 48 years of age. Capture for the purposes of public display is no longer permitted under Australian law.</p>",Marine,"<p>As a recently described new species, Australian Humpback Dolphins have not been listed under any national and International listing. Previous conservation assessments as <em>S. chinensis </em>are summarized<em> </em>in Table 2. The most recent assessment of the conservation status of humpback dolphins (as <em>S. chinensis</em> ) in Australia, concluded the species should be listed as Data Deficient (Woinarski<em> et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>In 2012 The Australian Federal Government commissioned a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and conservation status of Australian tropical inshore dolphins (Beasley<em> et al.</em> 2012) and a Draft Coordinated Research Strategy to address knowledge gaps and assess their national conservation status (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2012). These reports led to a technical workshop attended by researchers, statisticians and government and indigenous representatives to review the proposed research objectives identified in the draft research strategy, and agree on research priorities that would allow the assessment of the conservation status of Australian inshore dolphins at a national level. The resulting research strategy (DSEWPaC 2013) identified three specific research objectives applicable to Australian snubfin and humpback dolphins: (1) to conduct a broad-scale assessment of their extent of occurrence and area of occupancy (2) to conduct dedicated multi-year studies of their distribution, abundance and habitat use at selected sites across northern Australia with differing levels of threatening processes; and (3) to undertake a spatial and temporal risk assessment of current and projected threatening processes. Sampling and statistical methods to achieve these objectives have been recently described in Brooks<em> et al.</em> (2014). Following these advances, the Australian Federal Government released in 2014 the Whale and Dolphin Protection Plan, which includes a National Dolphin Conservation Plan. This plan aims to guide research and conservation assessment of Australian Humpback Dolphins and snubfin dolphins by supporting research into their ecology and major threats over the next three years.</p>  <p>Multiple-use marine protected areas in Western Australia (e.g. Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef Marine Park), the Northern Territory (e.g. Garig Gunak Barlu), and Queensland (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Dugong Protected Areas; Moreton Bay Marine Park) cover a substantial portion of the known and presumed habitat of Australian Humpback Dolphins in Australian waters and may provide some protection for humpback dolphins. To improve the quality of water discharged into the Great Barrier Reef, in 2008, the Australian Government invested $200 million in The Reef Rescue initiative to help farmers in the Great Barrier Reef catchments to improve farming practices to reduce sediment and nutrient run-off.</p>  <p>In Australia, humpback dolphins have also been identified as a conservation value in Commonwealth waters around Australia in the North, North-west and Temperate East Marine bioregional plans (DSEWPaC 2012a, b, c). These plans were developed under section 176 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and are aimed at improving management and decision making in relation to Australian marine biodiversity and resources. Biologically Important Areas (i.e. areas where species of conservation value displays important behaviors such as breeding, foraging, resting and migration) for the conservation of humpback dolphins were identified using available information at the time and expert scientific knowledge about species’ distribution, abundance and behavior in these regions.</p>  National Guidelines for Whale and Dolphin Watching and for interaction with seismic explorations provide some protection for inshore dolphins (DOE 2005, 2008). Strategies to reduce the entanglement and death of Australian Humpback Dolphins in nets set by The Queensland Shark Control Program for protection of bathers include the use of acoustic alarms, mixed use of nets and drumlines, overall reduction in the number of nets, and establishment of mammal rescue squads (DPI 2001, Gribble<em> et al.</em> 1998).",Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

This species is capable of temporary emersion, and can persist in thin films of water for several days when evaporative processes reduce available water in salt marshes and inland lagoons (Turko and Wright 2015). This species can withstand a broad range of salinities, and most often occurs in hypersaline lagoons (Feltkamp and Kristensen 1970). Diet is comprised of detritus, unicellular algae, small macroalgae, zooplankton (<em>Artemia</em>), small crustaceans and bryozoans (Feltkamp and Kristensen 1970,&#160;Carmona 1983, Cervigón 1991). Maximum reported body size is approximately 6.1 cm total length (TL) (Cervigón 1991).</p><p></p><p>Hypersaline estuaries are common on the northern coast of South America, due to their shallow depth (&lt;1 m), rain regime with little rainfall and fresh water inputs, very high sunlight throughout the year, high water temperatures and consequently high evaporation. The salinity of these water bodies can vary between 36 ‰ to more than 60 ‰ in marginal areas of the lagoons, and between 80 ‰ and close to 140 ‰. In areas referred to as “Salinas”, depth can be just a few centimetres (Mago 1965, Kristensen 1970, Kristensen and Hulscher-Emeis 1972, Boer <em>et al</em> 1973, Cervigón and Gómez 1986, Cervigón 1991, Cervigón and Ramírez 2003, 2012).</p><p></p><p><em>Cyprinodon dearborni</em>&#160;does not occur in freshwater rivers (lotic ecosystems) or freshwater inland lagoons (lentic ecosystems).

83768267,6488,Denisonia maculata,Data Deficient,,2017,2017-06-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Data Deficient, because&#160;it occurs as a severely fragmented population, and there is a continuing decline in the area of the very limited gilgais habitat to which the species is restricted, and while it has an extensive distribution range it has an area of occupancy at most below 6,000 km<sup>2</sup> and the high degree of uncertainty surrounding this value suggests that the species could either have an area of occupancy below 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> (and possibly below 500 km<sup>2</sup>), and so warrant listing in a threatened category or as either Near Threatened or Least Concern. It has not been possible to quantify rates of habitat - and presumed attendant population decline over the past 10 years, or to project rates of decline into the future, however, these too are associated with a high degree of uncertainty and may approach or exceed the threshold for listing in a threatened category.","This species favours low-lying 'gilgai' (ephemeral wetland) areas with cracking clay soil; habitat mapping indicates that the maximum available area of this habitat within the snake's range is around 11,000 km<sup>2</sup>, although due to finer-scale heterogeneity than the map resolution allows the maximum area of occupancy is probably less than 50% of this area (M. Venz pers. comm. 2017). This is a nocturnal snake species that shelters in soil cracks and sometimes under fallen timber and ground litter during the day. It is viviparous with 3 to 11 young per litter (an average of 6-8). It is an ambush predator that mainly feeds on frogs (<em>Litoria</em> spp., <em>Platypectrum&#160;</em>spp.) but has rarely also been documented taking lizards (agamids, gekkonids, scincids) (Shine 1983, Reed and Shine 2002, Cogger 2014).","Changes to soil structure within this species' habitat is a significant threat to subpopulations. This habitat has been very heavily impacted through conversion to agricultural use for crops (sorghum, sunflower, cotton, etc.) that need ploughing. Coal and gas extraction, though both direct impacts on water quality (S. Wilson pers. comm. 2017) and associated habitat loss, is a significant threat within the species' range. Potential threats include water extraction, with the consequent drying of gilgais, and contamination either through chemical spills into the gilgais or diffusion of polluted water into these wetlands (S. Wilson pers. comm. 2017). The majority of the population is found within an ""intense resoutce extraction footprint"" (S. Wilson pers. comm. 2017), and there are plans to further intensify this activity. It has not been possible to quantify rates of habitat decline resulting from agricultural intensification over the past 10 years on the basis of available data, but it is known to be ongoing and will continue into the future (M. Venz pers. comm. 2017). This is a specialist feeder on amphibians (which may be highly sensitive to water pollution) and consequently these impacts may both directly reduce habitat quality for the snake and potentially reduce prey availability (S. Wilson pers. comm. 2017).","Although the species is typically hard to detect, it can be fairly common within the limited extent of suitable habitat within its range. It occurs in pockets of high density, but its abundance is strongly tied to gilgai habitats and densities exhibit a ""sharply delineated"" drop off away from these waterbodies (Wilson and Swan 2014, S. Wilson pers. comm. 2017). The population is expected to be declining in response to habitat degradation and loss, and the species is thought to occur as a severely fragmented population due to the fragmentary nature of its habitat and its inability to disperse between sites. More than half of the population lies within an area of intense resource extraction, and even relatively moderate disturbance to the species' habitat, such as a spillage of contaminated water, may render individual subpopulations unviable (S. Wilson pers. comm. 2017).",Decreasing,"This species is found in central-eastern Queensland (Cogger 2014), from around Taroom in the south, north to Charters Towers.",The species does not really appear in trade.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Under the the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, this species is listed as 'Vulnerable'.

It feeds on invertebrates, small vertebrates and green shoots, and typically lays 2-4 eggs in a scrape on the ground. Eggs and young are susceptible to ground predators. North African populations may be sedentary or partially migratory, moving relatively short distances to find recent plant growth (Snow and Perrins 1998).<br/><br/>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1996).  <br/><p></p>","The principal threat is from hunting, which has worsened with the increased use of firearms, off-road vehicles and other technology (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005, Michler 2009). This threat is compounded by pressures on the species's habitats, from agricultural expansion, over-grazing of livestock, road construction, other infrastructure development and tourism developments (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005). Eggs are susceptible to trampling by livestock and collection by humans. Disturbance can be caused by oil exploration activities, along with disturbance associated with other threats. Locust control programmes can lead to direct and indirect poisoning of birds and a reduction in food supply. Floods and droughts cause additional pressures (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>Subspecies <em>fuertaventurae</em> is considered threatened by collisions with powerlines (Lowen 2007, C.

Although the Sahel zone has seen only a limited impact from West Africa’s rapid human population growth, along with low population densities and a predominantly traditional nomadic lifestyle, habitat degradation is occurring through the thinning of sparse non-regenerating <em>Acacia</em> woodlands, as well as the overgrazing of sub-desert steppes and excessive harvesting of firewood, which are followed by wind erosion and sand encroachment (Thiollay 2006). Protected Areas in the region where this species occurs may be under threat from oil exploration (Meynier 2009, van Vliet and Magrin 2012).<br/><p></p>","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as fairly common (del Hoyo<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 1996).",Decreasing,"<em>Neotis nuba</em> has a disjunct range across the Sahelian and, marginally, Saharan zones of Africa.

However, trend data for the eastern sub-population is poorly known, and should the worst-case scenario for <em>B. p. ceciliae</em> prove to be accurate this species may warrant uplisting in the future. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>The species is largely a resident, but undergoes local daily and seasonal movements of up to several dozen kilometres (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996, E. T. C. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. It breeds during the wet season months of May-December in West Africa, and July-January in East Africa (subject to local seasonal variation)<strong></strong>, nesting in single pairs in territories 0.5-1 km<sup>2</sup> (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. During the dry (non-breeding) season it is more congregatory, forming large flocks of up to several hundred individuals (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. In South Sudan it begins to flock along the Nile in November, reaching a peak in late February and March (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. In Chad it gathers in concentrations after breeding, and then moves south (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. In Nigeria it was subject to local movements with seasonal changes in water levels (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), though it no longer occurs in the country. It forages singly, in pairs or in small groups (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>.<strong> Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em><strong> </strong>This species is found in wet and dry open habitats, but prefers freshwater marshes, wet grasslands, and the peripheries of water-bodies<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong>. In South Sudan it is especially found in areas with water up to 1 m in depth, and knee-high to hip-high vegetation dominated by <em>Cyperus</em>, <em>Eleocharis</em>, <em>Scirpus</em>, <em>Setaria</em>, <em>Cynodon </em>and various leguminous and rosaceous plants (Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>. It always remains near wetlands, but is rarely associated with deep, open water (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. It often prefers to forage on dry ground with short grass (Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong> and, particularly in West Africa, it will sometimes forage and nest in upland areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>, rice fields, wet crop fields and even abandoned fields (Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong>. It prefers to roost in large trees, but will use small trees or shallow water when necessary (Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season it congregates in larger permanent wetlands<strong></strong>, and often forages near herds of domestic livestock (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong> or even in rubbish dumps (Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>. <strong>Diet </strong>This species is a generalist omnivore (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Its primary food source is small grain crops (45%)<strong></strong>, with small plants, small invertebrates and small vertebrates also featuring in the diet<strong> </strong>(Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003). It will take insects (grasshoppers, flies), molluscs, millipedes, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, reptiles, seed heads, grass tips and agricultural grain (corn, rice, millet) (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built on the ground<strong></strong> in densely vegetated wetlands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong>. The nest consists of a round, loosely constructed platform of reeds and grasses placed in short grass marsh in several centimetres of water, or occasionally on dry land (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. Its base is often over a metre in diameter (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. Clutch-size is c.2.5 eggs per nest. Incubation lasts 22-25 days, and chicks are able to fly when 35-40 days old (Dodman <em>et al. </em>2014).<p></p>","Habitat loss and degradation are significant threats, occurring through drought, wetland drainage and conversion for agriculture, overgrazing, fire, agricultural and industrial pollution, industrial construction and dam construction (flooding wetlands upstream and dessicating those downstream) (Meine and Archibald 1996, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003, <strong></strong>Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2007, <strong></strong>T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. Droughts have both directly and indirectly impacted this species's habitat, since they force people to migrate to relatively moist, less populated regions, which are then subjected to the associated pressures mentioned above (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Considerable hunting pressures also exist (P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2007, Kone 2007, Morrison 2009)<strong></strong>, including capture and sale of live birds, some destined for legal international markets (over 7,000 birds since 1985 when the species was listed on CITES Appendix II [UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database, January 2005]<strong></strong>). Parts of dead Black Crowned-cranes, notably the head and wings, are used in traditional healing (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. In addition, indiscriminate pesticide application may be leading to harmful bio-accumulation of toxins (E. T. C. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>, and direct poisoning to reduce crop depredation has been reported in East Africa (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Warfare and political instability affects nations across the range of the species, and may have particularly impacted upon those in South Sudan where the implementation of conservation measures has not been able to proceed (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003), and remains problematic. Oil exploration in and near the wetlands also poses a threat (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","The western sub-population (<em>B. p. pavonina</em>) was estimated to number c.15,000 individuals in 2004, and the eastern sub-population (<em>B. p. ceciliae</em>) is less well-known, though estimated at 28,000-55,000 individuals in the same year. This gives a total population estimate of 43,000-70,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 28,000-47,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Balearica pavonina</em> occurs in disjunct sub-populations through the Sahel and <strong>Sudan-Guinea </strong>savanna zones of Africa, with records from as far south as the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, but was once more numerous and widespread.

The status of the eastern sub-population (<em>B. p. ceciliae</em>) is less well-known, though it appears to have declined from an estimated 65,000-90,000 individuals in 1985 and 65,000-77,500 individuals in 1994 to an estimated 28,000-55,000 individuals in 2004 (with at least 80% in Sudan and <strong>South Sudan</strong>) (Beilfus<em> et al. </em>2005, Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

Over-exploitation in the  non-breeding range (in particular in Suriname) may be the principal  driver of declines, with eastern-breeding populations also potentially declining due to reduced food supply at key staging sites and changes in arctic breeding habitat, but further information on the rate and drivers of declines is needed.","It breeds in high and low Arctic and subarctic wet sedge or heath tundra, often near pools, rivers and lakes (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996). In the non-breeding season it is mainly coastal, favouring sandy beaches and intertidal mudflats, sometimes also shallow lagoons and saltmarsh (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996). On migration it is also found &#160;at inland wetlands (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996). Food is mainly chironomid larvae in the breeding season, along with other small invertebrates and seeds. Various small aquatic, marine and terrestrial invertebrates are taken on migration, including horseshoe crab <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Limulus polyphemus </span>eggs on spring migration in eastern USA  (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996). Makes non-stop flights of up to 4,000 km on migration, with flocks of up to 350,000 gathering at key stopover sites  (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1996).","Hunting of shorebirds in northern South America, which is legal in Guyana but illegal in&#160;French Guiana and&#160;Suriname, is widespread and thus a potential threat to <em>C. pusilla</em>. Shorebirds killed by hunters in Suriname are estimated to number several tens of thousands annually, involving mainly <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. pusilla </span>and<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Tringa flavipes</span>: if 20,000 <span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. pusilla</span> were removed from a population of two million annually (1% decrease, net after recruitment), the decline would amount to some 26% over 30 years, independent of other mortality, suggesting hunting could be a significant factor in the observed declines (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Poaching in Suriname may have increased over the last c.20 years  owing to improvements in weaponry and transportation. Another potential  threat is the harvesting of horseshoe crabs <em>Limulus polyphemus </em>in Delaware Bay, an area  which reportedly sees the passage of c.60% of the total population of <em>C. pusilla</em>  during the spring migration. The species feeds primarily on horseshoe crab&#160;<em></em>eggs during episodes of rapid mass  accumulation, but harvest pressure from 1995-2005 dramatically reduced  egg availability  (Mizrahi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Significant changes in the intertidal profile, for unknown reasons, have taken place along the coast of the Guianas, although numbers of birds were also lower in areas with no obvious changes in mudflat area (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Use of pesticides in agricultural areas such as rice fields may affect shorebirds using those habitats directly, and drainage of pesticides into coastal areas and onto mudflats also has the potential to affect shorebirds (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Small-scale gold mining has increased considerably in the northern South American wintering range, and mercury, which is used in the extraction process and can reach the coast via the rivers, has the potential to affect shorebirds in coastal areas (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012). Oil exploration is underway in Suriname and Guyana, with spills representing a further potential threat. Increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes during southbound migration may be causing increased mortality during this period (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2012).&#160;On the Canadian Arctic breeding grounds, the influence of grazing of Snow Geese (<em>Anser caerulescens</em>) and Ross's Goose (<em>Anser rossii</em>) on shorebird habitats is debatable but the effects last for decades (Peterson <em>et al</em>. 2013).","The population was formerly estimated at 3.5 million individuals, but  this was revised downwards to 2.2 million individuals in 2006 (Morrison <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006, A.

Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat.

They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012). The Manatee population in Africa is reported to be reduced, but their present range appears to be comparable to historic reports (Husar 1978, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major rivers from north to south including lakes within these river systems: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansoa, Geba, Grande de Bulba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavally, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoe, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Pie, Katsena Ala, Deb, Okigb, Issa, Bani, Akwayafe, del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logoné, Mitémélé, Gabon, Ogooué, Nyanga, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Loémé, Congo, Loge, Dande, Bengo, Cuanza, and Longa.<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lakes: Lake Guiers (Senegal); Lake Volta (Ghana); Inland Niger delta (Mali); Lake Léré and Lake de Tréné (Chad); Lake Togo (Togo); Lake Aheme (Benin); Lake Onangue, Lake Ezanga, Lake Mandje (Cachimba) (Gabon).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lagoons: Digboué Lagoon, Tadia Lagoon, Ebrié Lagoon, Fresco Lagoon, Bandama Lagoon, Comoe Lagoon, (Ivory Coast); Sakumono Lagoon, Lake Songaw Lagoon, Keta Lagoon (Ghana), Grand Popo Lagoon, Lake Nokoue (Benin); Badagry Lagoon, Yewa Lagoon, Lagos Lagoon, Lekki Lagoon (Nigeria); Nkomi (Fernan Vaz) Lagoon, N’gowe (Iguela) Lagoon, N’dogo Lagoon, Banio Lagoon (Gabon); Conkouati Lagoon (Republic of the Congo); Massabi Lagoon (Cabinda).","<span lang=""EN-US"">Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly  everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass  is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

This forest is cool and very damp, with a conspicuous moss layer and many epiphytes (bromeliads) on the tree trunks. Specimens have been found by day, on or close to the ground, in the forest and in adjacent recent clearings on the slopes of Volcán Reventador. The eggs are laid on the ground, and the tadpoles are carried on the back of the adults one by one to bromeliads (e.g.&#160;<em>Guzmania conifera</em>), where they develop.","Habitat at the type locality has been cleared for agriculture and livestock farming, where pesticides including glyphosate are often used (T.R. Kahn pers. comm. In: Kahn <em>et al. </em>2016). Oil and gas extraction operations in Napo province promote the building of roads and human settlement (Kahn <em>et al. </em>2016). The drastic decline in this species in the mid-1980s may have been related to the synergistic effects of habitat loss, chytridiomycosis and climate change. This species is also threatened by volcanic activity from Volcán Reventador, where the release of toxic gases and volcanic ash (seen in moderate eruptions) and the potential pyroclastic flow (observed in major eruptions) could result in catastrophic landslides that, depending on their extent, would completely destroy the remaining forested habitat of this frog (Kahn <em>et al.</em> 2016). Volcanic ash has been discussed as another possible cause for the apparent disappearance of this species (Lötters <em>et al.</em> 2007).","It no longer survives at its only known locality, where it has not been seen since&#160;1974.

Overall, there are a limited number of specimens reported. It is believed to occur in inshore waters where it is captured in gillnet, line and trawl fisheries within its range. Its recent re-discovery and re-description means that historically it has likely been under-recorded, however reliable identification of <em>Carcharhinus</em> species since then indicates that this species is rare and localised.<br/><br/>Although there are limited data on its status, similar commercially important <em>Carcharhinus</em> species in the Arabian Gulf/Persian Gulf (hereafter referred to as the 'Gulf') have undergone significant declines. One of the areas in which the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark is known from (southern Oman/eastern Yemen) has been, and continues to be, subject to intensive fishing targeted at sharks, suggesting suspected population declines of 50-80% are appropriate for this species. The other known centre of abundance around Kuwait is also subject to habitat degradation and change from water management practices in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Furthermore, the loss and modification of coastal habitats in the Gulf is a significant concern for inshore species such as this. A further population reduction is suspected over three generation lengths (2017-2042) based on current levels of exploitation. The limited geographic range of this species compared to other similar ""blacktip"" species increase the risks to this species. As such it is assessed as Endangered under criterion A2cd+3cd. Further research and monitoring are required to better understand the distribution, biology, ecology and population status of this species.","There is limited information available on this species because of the limited number of specimens recorded. Its maximum size is 165 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016). Females are mature by at least 131 cm TL and demonstrate placental viviparity with litters of 4-6 embryos. In the northwestern Gulf, there is evidence that parturition occurs in spring when embryos are 35-51 cm TL. Further records of the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark from the western Arabian Sea indicate that adults are present in this region throughout the year.<br/><br/>No ageing data are available for the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark. Generation length is estimated to be 8.25 years based on the Spottail Shark from Australia&#160;which has a similar maximum size. The Spottail Shark matures at 2-3 years and reaches a maximum age of 14 years (Davenport and Stevens 1988).","The Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark is likely to be taken by inshore gillnet, line and trawl fisheries within its range given it is known only from specimens from fish markets (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2013, Jabado <em>et al. </em>2015). One of the known centres of abundance around Kuwait is also subject to habitat degradation and change from water management practices in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Marine habitats in the Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance and quickly deteriorating due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard <em>et al.</em> 2010) which is likely to impact this species.","The Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark is morphologically very similar to the Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>), Spottail Shark (<em>C. sorrah</em>) and the Graceful Shark (<em>C. amblyrhynchoides</em>) and there is likely to have been confusion in species identification across its potential range. It was only recently rediscovered in Kuwaiti landings (2009), with subsequent confirmed records across the Gulf and in Oman (Moore <em>et al. </em>2013). There is no species-specific information on population size or structure.<br/><br/>Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Bonfil 2003, Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2015). Reports from Iran based on a comparison of results from trawl surveys in the Gulf indicate that the biomass of sharks (particularly carcharhinids) has been decreasing since the 1970s (Valinassab <em>et al.</em> 2006). Historical surveys in the Gulf indicated that carcharhinid sharks comprised up to 22% of biomass in trawl surveys in 1980-81, whereas in 2002, they represented only ~2% (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Similarly, results from interviews with fishermen in the UAE indicate that the majority of fishers started seeing a decline in the abundance of sharks over 20 years ago, and that these declines have been significant (Jabado <em>et al. </em>2015). Declines in the order of 30-50% in commercially important shark species such as <em>C. limbatus</em> and <em>C. sorrah </em>are suspected. Furthermore, one of the areas in which&#160;Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark&#160;is known from (southern Oman/eastern Yemen) has been, and continues to be, subject to intensive targeted shark fishing (Bonfil 2001). Therefore, although the status of the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark remains unknown, based on the significant decline in other similar species in the region, population declines of 50–80% are suspected over a period of three generation spans (~25 years). A further population reduction is suspected over three generation lengths (2017–2042) based on current levels of exploitation.",Decreasing,"The Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark is endemic to the Arabian Seas region, occurring in the northern Indian Ocean, including the Gulf (UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain), Sea of Oman and Arabian Sea (Oman and Yemen).","<p>The meat of this species may be sold fresh for human consumption at local markets in the region.

There are various forms across its range (Red Sea to India), but until taxonomy is resolved, the forms in the Arabian Seas region are treated as a single species for the current assessment. This species appears to be very common in waters less than 40 m deep, including in intertidal areas. Given its size it is likely to have a productive life history, but this needs to be confirmed with species-specific research. It is regularly caught in shallow water trawls and is normally discarded at sea in the western part of its range, but landed in considerable numbers in the eastern part (i.e., India). Overall, fishing pressure is increasing across its habitat, and declines in batoids have been documented in India. At one landing site, catches have been stable over a 15 year period after an initial increase. However, over that same time period, trawl effort doubled. Overall, declines of &lt; 30% are suspected over the last three generations (~33 years), and with ongoing fishing pressure, further population declines are suspected over the next three generations (2017-2050); the species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting VU A2d+3d). Uncertainty arising from unresolved taxonomy, the unknown fate of discards, and uncertainty about its life history, all support a precautionary approach. Indeed, it is possible that in the near future the intense trawling pressure in parts of its range could lead to further declines and make it eligible for listing as Vulnerable if not higher.</p>","This species is very common in shallow and intertidal waters mostly to 30 m, but occasionally 40 m (Akhilesh K.V. pers. comm. 05/02/2017), over soft substrates. It is a very small species, only growing to 32 cm disc width (DW). Data from the <em>H. imbricata</em> form show that males mature about 18 cm DW and females by at least 23 cm DW (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012). Born at 7-10 cm DW (Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). No data on litter size is available, but given the small size it is likely to be low. Similarly, no data on frequency of breeding is available. No ageing data are available.

The high level of increasing exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen going from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassab <em>et </em>al. 2006). The Scaly Whipray is normally discarded at sea in the western part of the range, but retained and marketed in the eastern part. Post release survival is unknown and needs to be investigated.<br/><br/>Its occurrence in very shallow water also makes it susceptible to coastal development and habitat degradation. Marine habitats in the Gulf are experiencing high levels of disturbance and quickly deteriorating due to major impacts from development activities (including dredging and reclamation), desalination plants, industrial activities, habitat destruction through the removal of shallow productive areas and major shipping lanes (Sheppard <em>et al</em>. 2010) which is likely to impact this species.</p>","Gillnet and trawl surveys in northern Kuwait (near the Iraq border) in 2004-05 recorded the species (as <em>Himantura imbricata</em>) as the second most abundant elasmobranch (Bishop <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has been recorded (as <em>H. imbricata</em>) in small numbers in fish markets in Kuwait and Qatar (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2012). This species is very common bycatch in shallow trawls in Iran (7-8% of rays caught [by weight]), but it is normally discarded (T. Valinassab pers. comm. 05/02/2016). It appears to be more common in the northern Gulf than in the southern, although this could be due to its susceptibility to trawls. During recent research surveys using trawls in UAE waters, it constituted a significant proportion of ray catches (R.W. Jabado pers. comm. 31/03/2017). It is rarely recorded in Oman (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007). The small size of this species means that it is often discarded at sea, thus making the collection of data from landing sites difficult. In the Red Sea, it appears uncommon due to the limited amounts of suitable habitats (Bonfil 2003, I. Elhassan unpub. data).<br/><br/>The population has declined off India and Pakistan due to overall declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing. For example, the annual average catch of rays landed by trawlers at New Ferry Wharf, Mumbai, between 1990-2004 was 502 t. During this period trawler hours doubled, and consequently, the catch rate declined by 60% from 0.65 kg/hr in 1990 to 0.24 kg/hr in 2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). The same paper showed that landings of this species (as <em>Amphotistius imbricatus</em>) were stable, indicating that it is an abundant species in trawl catches, but still declining due to trawl effort doubling during this period. In Pakistan, it is regularly captured, and there is evidence that the abundance has declined since 1999 (M. Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017).

Its moderately small remaining population continues to decline and as a result it is considered Near Threatened. <p></p>,"This species breeds in the high Arctic on well drained tundra with tussocks and scant vegetation. It is generally not found near the sea and avoids marshes. It appears to depend heavily upon intensive grazing by livestock in its wintering grounds to create short grassland (Lanctot <em>et al.</em> 2002, Aldabe 2016)<strong></strong>, but also uses flooded pampas grasslands (Blanco <em>et al</em>. 2004, Lanctot <em>et al</em>. 2004). During migration it is found on many short grass habitats (McCarty <em>et al</em>. 2009, Norling <em>et al</em>. 2012). At the internationally important Rainwater Basin stopover site in Nebraska, U.S.A., it was observed to feed primarily in agricultural land (soybeans, corn), and use wetlands for resting (McCarty <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). It is a lekking species. <p></p>","The species was severely overhunted in the late 1800s and the early part of the 1900s, reportedly declining to near extinction from a population which may have numbered in the hundreds of thousands to millions.&#160;The breeding grounds may be affected by habitat loss and degradation, and environmental contaminants (R. Lanctot<em> in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Previously, on-going declines were attributed to widespread and continuing destruction of grasslands in the wintering range (Lanctot and Laredo 1994, Lanctot 1995)<strong></strong>, but there seems to be little evidence to support this, although environmental contaminants may be playing a part there (R. Lanctot<em> in litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Exposure on migration to toxic chemicals and pollutants in its agricultural feeding grounds may pose a threat, and is being investigated further (Lanctot 2006, McCarty <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009)<strong></strong>.Conservation threats faced by the species vary throughout the annual cycle. On the breeding grounds, habitat is being lost or degraded due to energy production (extraction of oil and gas and associated development) and climate change (Lanctot <em>et al</em>., 2010). Climate change may also be affecting demographic parameters but the overall effects are unclear. Negative effects on Buff-breasted Sandpiper productivity may occur due to the decoupling of the apparent synchrony between the breeding chronology of &#160;the birds and food availability (Lanctot&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2010). Alternatively, climate change could lengthen the growing season, providing flexibility for birds to initiate or replace lost clutches (although this may be more common in Calidrids that do not have a lek mating system), as well as promote survival of chicks – enhancements that could provide an overall positive or neutral effect (Lanctot <em>et al</em>., 2010).&#160;<br/><br/>During migration, Buff-breasted Sandpipers may be negatively impacted from wind energy installations in the Great Plains/Midwest of the central United States and in coastal portions of the Gulf of Mexico (Lanctot&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2010). The short vegetation required by the species is being lost through management of native grasslands for medium to tall vegetation, a reduction in the size of intact grassland units and the conversion of native grasslands or pastures to agriculture and other human development (Lanctot <em>et al</em>., 2010). Agricultural conversion could lead to altered prey availability and increased exposure to pesticides and herbicides. However, little to no quantitative data are available to suggest birds using human-altered habitats have altered migration abilities, lowered survival rates, or affected any other measurable demographic trait. Climate change may also affect the species during migration by increasing the severity of storms over the western Atlantic that could directly impact survival rates of juveniles, which predominately use this pathway during southbound migration (Lanctot&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2010).<br/><br/>On the non-breeding range, Buff-breasted Sandpipers are threatened by conversion of historic grasslands into agriculture, wood plantations, mines, and tourist locations. Pastures are also being “improved” by ranchers planting exotic vegetation with a different vegetation structure that appears to be less preferred. Such improvements frequently involve applications of fertilizer and other contaminants that may negatively affect the species. Buff-breasted Sandpipers are also vulnerable to changes in ranch management that reduce grazing levels and result in pastures with tall vegetation. Finally, climate change may result in sea-level rise and greater precipitation, which will inundate the many low-lying areas used by the species during the non-breeding season.","Originally numbering in the hundreds of thousands to millions (1890s-1900s), the species was brought to near extinction in the early 1920s by habitat destruction and hunting.

This region was the epicentre of Africa's ""world war"", to which Gorillas have also fallen victim. The Mountain Gorilla subspecies (<em>Gorilla beringei beringei</em>), was listed as Critically Endangered since 1996. Although a drastic reduction of the Grauer’s Gorilla subspecies (<em>Gorilla beringei graueri</em>), has long been suspected, quantitative evidence of the decline has been lacking (Robbins and Williamson 2008). During the past 20 years, Grauer’s Gorillas have been severely affected by human activities, most notably poaching for bushmeat associated with artisanal mining camps and for commercial trade (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). This illegal hunting has been facilitated by a proliferation of firearms resulting from widespread insecurity in the region. Previously estimated to number around 16,900 individuals, recent surveys show that Grauer’s Gorilla numbers have dropped to only 3,800 individuals – a 77% reduction in just one generation (<em>ibid</em>.) This rate of population loss is almost three times above that which qualifies a species as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>Mountain Gorillas have been faring substantially better; one of the two subpopulations is recovering from an all-time low in the 1980s, making Mountain Gorillas the only great ape taxon that has been increasing in number (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013).

Even with the growth of the Mountain Gorilla subspecies, the overall decline of the Eastern Gorilla species is expected to exceed 80% over three generations due to the high levels of poaching, loss of habitat as human populations expand, and civil unrest and lawlessness in parts of this species’ geographic range. If unabated, in 2054, only 14% of the 1994 population will remain. Therefore, Eastern Gorillas qualify as Critically Endangered under criterion A (A4bcd).","Grauer's Gorillas range between 600 and 2,900 m asl in dense mature and secondary lowland tropical rainforest through transitional forests to Afromontane habitat, including bamboo forest, swamp and peat bog. Mountain Gorillas are restricted to elevations above 1,400 m in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and above 1,850 m in the Virungas by human occupation at lower levels. Their habitat includes many Afromontane vegetation types, including bamboo forest, mixed forest, and subalpine grassland on the volcanic peaks. The Bwindi Mountain Gorillas live at lower elevations, in forest characterised by steep slopes of predominantly mixed forest habitat with a dense understorey.<br/><br/>Diets of Eastern Gorillas vary greatly with elevation and its effect on food availability. Mountain Gorillas are largely herbivorous and feed on stems, pith, leaves, bark, and occasionally ants. Their favoured food items are wild celery, thistles, nettles, bedstraw, wood and roots. Both subspecies feed almost exclusively on young bamboo shoots when they are in season twice a year. Gorillas at lower elevations have a more diverse and seasonal diet. Both Grauer’s Gorillas in lowland forest and Bwindi Gorillas are frugivorous.<br/><br/>Eastern Gorillas are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. After waking, they feed intensively and then alternate rest, travelling and feeding until night-time. All Gorillas build nests to sleep in, some in trees, but the majority of their nests are on the ground. Gorillas are not territorial, and there is extensive overlap between the annual home ranges of different groups, which vary in size from 6–40 km². Eastern Gorilla groups are polygynous or polygynandrous, with one or more adult males, several females, their offspring, and immature relatives forming the core of relatively stable groups. Median group size is 10 weaned individuals; maximum observed group size is 65 individuals.<br/><br/><u><strong>Life History</strong></u> (as summarised in Williamson and Butynski 2013)<br/>Male Eastern Gorillas are capable of reproducing when they become “blackbacks” at 8-12 years of age. They are considered “silverbacks” at 12 years of age, and reach their full adult size at 15 years. Female menarche occurs at 6-7 years of age, followed by a period of adolescent sterility. Average age of first parturition is 9.9 years. Females have a reproductive cycle of <em>ca</em> 28 days and are receptive for 1-4 days around the time of ovulation. They experience lactational amenorrhea while suckling infants. Young are weaned at 3-4 years of age, from which point they no longer travel on their mothers’ back. Females give birth every 3-4 years and generally produce 3-4 surviving offspring during their reproductive life span. Maximum life span is unknown, but it is certainly over 40 years. Eastern Gorillas have a generation time of 18.2 years for females and 20.4 years for males (Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Major threats to Eastern Gorillas are:<br/><ol><li><strong><u>Poaching</u> </strong>- Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, hunting represents the greatest threat to Grauer’s Gorillas (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). A high demand for bushmeat stems from the growing human population, the destabilising impact of armed groups, artisanal miners in remote areas and a general scarcity of affordable domestic protein in rural areas. The permanent presence of people who provide the workforce for exploitation of natural resources also constitutes a major factor in this problem. Miners working in national parks have admitted to poaching Gorillas, which are relatively easy to hunt with guns and provide large quantities of meat (Kirkby <em>et al</em>. 2015). Illegal capture of live infants is a secondary threat (after the mother has been killed and eaten), except on occasions when Mountain Gorilla infants have been the principle target, fulfilling the demands of a fictitious, international market. These orphans usually die or are seized by the wildlife authorities.</li><li><strong><u>Habitat loss and degradation</u></strong> - Agricultural and pastoral activities are leading to continued loss and fragmentation of Gorilla habitat in DRC. At present, there is no commercial logging in the Eastern Gorilla’s range, but there is continuous artisanal extraction of resources, which puts added stress on natural habitats. Illegal mining has decimated the lowlands of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, a Grauer’s Gorilla stronghold. Destruction of forest for timber, charcoal production and agriculture continues to threaten the isolated Gorilla populations that persist in North Kivu and the Itombwe Massif.</li><li><u><strong>Civil unrest</strong></u> - For two decades, refugees, internally-displaced people and numerous armed groups have placed enormous pressure on DRC’s forests through uncontrolled habitat conversion for farmland, harvesting of firewood, timber extraction and mining. Ongoing political unrest and military activity, including rebel occupation of national parks have compounded other threats (Yamagiwa 2003, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). A recent survey identified 69 armed groups operating in North and South Kivu (Stearns &amp; Vogel 2015), covering important portions of remaining Grauer’s Gorilla range. Armed conflict and the collapse of law and order in DRC brought a significant rise in the illegal circulation of military weapons and ammunition. Former traditional hunters have obtained guns, notably AK47s, and the commercial trade in bushmeat increased with the spread of firearms, often supplied by government soldiers and rebel militia. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Virunga Mountain Gorillas were also impacted by war and instability (Kalpers <em>et al</em>. 2003, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2011).</li><li><u><strong>Disease</strong></u> - Regulated tourism is a key strategy for Eastern Gorilla conservation; however, transmission of human diseases is a major concern (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015), as is excessive disturbance to Gorillas and their habitat (Macfie and Williamson 2010), which could jeopardize conservation programmes. Examples of likely or proven human-­to-­great ape disease transmission include respiratory viruses (Köndgen <em>et al</em>. 2008, Palacios <em>et al</em>. 2011, Spelman <em>et al</em>. 2013), human herpes simplex virus (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2014) and scabies (Kalema-Zikusoka <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some of these cases have been fatal and most have involved habituated Gorillas or Chimpanzees. Nonetheless, Mountain Gorillas visited by researchers and tourists have consistently shown higher population growth rates than unhabituated Gorillas, which is likely due to the daily monitoring of habituated groups. Continuous monitoring leads to better protection and facilitates veterinary interventions to remove snares and treat respiratory illnesses (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2011); it is almost impossible to treat unhabituated Gorillas.</li><li><strong><u>Climate change</u></strong> - Climate change is predicted to impact the forests of the Albertine Rift escarpment, leading to the upslope migration of species and key Gorilla habitat, notably montane forest (Ayebare <em>et al</em>. 2013). Increased temperatures and modified rainfall patterns are also likely to result in changes in food availability and habitat quality (McGahey <em>et al</em>. 2013). With almost all montane forest in the eastern highlands now destroyed and converted for agriculture to support some of the highest human population densities in the African Great Lakes region, climate change may have negative effects on food security for the human populations surrounding Gorilla habitat, which could also conservation efforts in the future.</li></ol>","It is likely that fewer than 5,000 Eastern Gorillas remain.&#160;<em>Gorilla b. beringei</em>&#160;lives in two isolated populations in three countries: DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. The first surveys of the Virunga Mountain Gorillas estimated a population size of 274 individuals in 1971–73 (Harcourt and Groom 1972, Groom 1973). The population fell to a low of 254 individuals in 1981 (Aveling and Harcourt 1981, Weber and Vedder 1983). Since then, protection measures have enabled the population to recover and the most recent estimate for the Virungas is a minimum of 600 individuals (Hickey <em>et al</em>. 2018). The second (Bwindi-Sarambwe) Mountain Gorilla population numbers about 400 individuals (Roy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Thus, the total population of the subspecies is now at least 1,000 individuals (Roy <em>et al</em>. 2014, Hickey <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In 1994–95, the total population of <em>G. b. graueri</em> was estimated to be 16,900 individuals (Hall <em>et al</em>. 1998a, 1998b). Since then, widespread insecurity and poaching for bushmeat, particularly around mining camps, have led to increasing fragmentation of the population and rapid reductions of numbers. Using survey data collected between 2010 and 2015, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated that the number of Grauer's Gorillas remaining in 2015 is only 3,800—a 77% loss since 1994-95. These population estimates were made using night nest abundance and distribution, and predictive modelling. Nest encounter rates indicate an ongoing rate of decline of ~5% per year at many of the sites surveyed, due to fragmentation and illegal hunting around the many artisanal mining camps and villages located in areas where Grauer's Gorillas occur (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"Eastern Gorillas are found in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), northwest Rwanda and southwest Uganda.<br/><br/><em>Gorilla beringei beringei</em> (Matschie 1903) is restricted to two populations in forests only 25 km apart, but isolated by land that is intensely cultivated and densely settled. One population is in the Virunga Volcanoes, straddling the borders between DRC (Virunga National Park), Rwanda (Volcanoes National Park) and Uganda (Mgahinga Gorilla National Park). The other occurs in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, with a small contiguous portion in Sarambwe Nature Reserve in DRC.<br/><br/><em>Gorilla beringei graueri</em> (Matschie 1914) is endemic to the forests of the Albertine Rift escarpment in eastern DRC. It has a discontinuous distribution from the lowlands east of the Lualaba River to the Mitumba Mountains and the Itombwe Massif. Mt. Tshiaberimu in Virunga National Park is the northern limit of Grauer’s Gorilla’s geographic range. The southern limit is a subpopulation in the Hewa Bora region, Fizi District (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Although formerly known as the Eastern Lowland Gorilla, <em>G. b. graueri</em> occurs over the widest altitudinal range of any Gorilla, from approximately 600 m to 2,900 m asl, overlapping considerably with the altitudinal range of <em>G. b. beringei</em> (1,400–3,800 m asl; Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013).","<p>Gorillas are completely protected by national and international laws in all countries of their range, and it is, therefore, illegal to kill, capture or trade in live Gorillas or their body parts.<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<em>Gorilla beringei</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES, and under Class A of the African Convention (as the species <em>Gorilla</em>). DRC has a legal framework for managing national parks and wildlife, but has difficulty applying its laws, and political will is limited. Underlying this is a difficult sociopolitical context – a breakdown of law and order during two decades of conflict, combined with poverty and economic insecurity, exacerbates the difficulties of enforcing the law in this region. To address the critical situation faced by Grauer’s Gorillas, NGOs are working with the government authorities to support protected areas and reinforce conservation programmes. However, the widespread presence of armed groups in eastern DRC restricts the ability of conservation organisations to operate in the field.<br/><br/>One quarter of the predicted range of the Grauer’s Gorillas occurs in national parks and nature reserves; the remaining three quarters is currently unprotected (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Gazetting of the Itombwe Reserve and establishing a protected area west of Kahuzi-Biega National Park could secure as much as 50% of the subspecies' range.<br/><br/>Conservation challenges are likely to increase as the DRC government continues its efforts to stabilize the east. Security will favour industrial extraction, large-scale agriculture and infrastructure. While development will increase the country's ability to support its human population and participate in the global economy, it will also result in increased human settlement in forest areas critical to Gorillas. Targeted conservation action in priority sites will be vital to slow further demise of this subspecies.<br/><br/>The entire Mountain Gorilla population resides in protected areas where there are active government programmes. Although the protected areas are relatively well monitored, illegal activities continue in some locations, therefore monitoring the impacts of both illegal activities and conservation actions should continue. While these national parks are legally protected, habitat fragmentation and degradation will be exacerbated if infrastructure developments are allowed within their boundaries.<br/><br/>To achieve conservation successes, long-term commitment is key, as shown by the international conservation organisations that have been working in difficult circumstances for decades to support the protected area authorities and try to secure the survival of Eastern Gorillas. IUCN has published a detailed conservation strategy with clear priorities for Grauer’s Gorillas (Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2012). See Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2015) for additional recommendations and see Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2011) for an overview of the impacts of conservation activities on mountain Gorillas in the Virunga Massif.<br/><p></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It favours high and dry areas on steep river banks and precipices, low hills, rock outcrops and rocky islands (Kear 2005). Less commonly it inhabits low islands in lowland areas (Kear 2005). Vegetative cover in its preferred habitats is usually thin and includes dwarf birch&#160;<em>Betula</em>, willow&#160;<em>S</em><em>alix</em>, and dead grass (Kear 2005).&#160;During the non-breeding season it inhabits open steppe and open rolling lowland hills, feeding among steppe, coastal lines, pasture, stubble and crop fields (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Throughout the day it flies to coastal and freshwater lakes to drink (Kear 2005). Occasionally it also roosts at these lakes, using the middle of the water or remote shallow areas and muddy and sandy beaches with low aquatic vegetation (Kear 2005). It will also roost on frozen lakes or on the sea (Kear 2005). The distribution of geese from year to year depends a lot on differences in lake water levels.&#160;On its breeding grounds it feeds primarily on Fabaceae and to a lesser extent grass leaves and the shoots of cotton-grasses&#160;<em>Eriophorum angustifolium</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>E. scheuchzeri</em>&#160;(Rosenfeld and Volkov 2001), as well as some&#160;<em>Carex and Equisetum</em>&#160;spp. (Kear 2005).<em>&#160;</em>Wintering geese feed on winter wheat, barley, maize, pasture and steppe grasses and, in Greece, natural grassland (Kear 2005). In Kazakhstan on passage they feed mainly on spilled grain on the fields after harvesting the wheat crops in autumn. They also feed on arid-adapted herbs such as&#160;<em>Salicornia&#160;</em>(Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. At migration staging areas the diet is thought to consist largely of grass shoots, supplemented with tubers and rhizomes (Kear 2005), as well as the salt marsh’s galophyte complex of&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Puccinellia distans</span>&#160;and&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Aeroplus littoralis</span>&#160;(Rozenfeld 2011b, Simeonov and Possardt 2012).<strong>&#160;</strong><br/><br/>The species nests in hollows and fissures in the ground, usually 50-80 mm deep and 200 mm in diameter (Kear 2005). They are often constructed near to the eyries of birds of prey (Kear 2005), since breeding success may depend on nesting Peregrine Falcon&#160;<em>Falco peregrinus</em>, Snowy Owl&#160;<em>Bubo scandiaca</em>&#160;and Rough-legged Buzzard&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Buteo lagopus</span>&#160;providing protection from predators (Quinn&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996, Prop and Quinn 2003, Quinn&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, S.

Successful breeding seasons are also associated with good lemming years, and it has been suggested that this may be because predators are sated by the lemming population and so predation of geese is much lower.<br/><br/>This species is highly migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Following the post-breeding moult it migrates southwards over land in mid- to late-September (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, arriving on its wintering grounds in October-November. Here it is highly gregarious and occurs in flocks, regularly in association with the White-fronted Goose <em>Anser albifrons</em> (Madge and Burn 1988) Lesser White-fronted Goose 				<em>A. erythropus </em>and Greylag Goose<span style=""font-style: italic;""> A. anser</span>. The return journey is made between March and May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>, often together with <em>A. albifrons</em> (Kear 2005). It flies in dense flocks rather than in the defined V-formation typical of other goose species (Kear 2005), and arrives on its breeding grounds in small flocks of 3-15 individuals (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. It begins to breed in June in loose colonies, usually of around five to fifteen pairs (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, S.

Petkov <em>in litt</em>. 2015, 2016). Following land privatization, and especially the residential and tourist development boom in winter roosting and feeding areas, the quality of roosting areas has decreased. In addition, the low profitability of agriculture has reduced the area under winter wheat cultivation which, together with conversion to other crops, has decreased the availability of food. <a style=""mso-comment-reference:NP_1; mso-comment-date:20120503T1542"">Some key feeding sites have </a>been lost in Bulgaria<strong> </strong>(S.

Petkov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span>&#160;2012, 2016). Disturbance in the lakes used for roosts is also caused by poachers and fishermen (Dereliev 1997, D. Hulea <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Dereliev and Georgiev, 2002). Disturbance/chasing of feeding birds by hunters (because they associate with White-fronted Geese <em>Anser albifrons</em>, a legal quarry species) is a significant limitation on foraging behaviour and prenuptial accumulation of fat reserves, which has a negative effect on survival during spring migration and breeding (N. Petkov <em>in litt.</em> 2007, 2016). Hunting by tourists in Ukraine poses an increasing threat (WWT TWSG News 10 1997) and birds are shot at staging grounds in Russia.&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and others dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 67% of the habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler and Lysenko 2000). The increase in oil and gas operations in the region has seen a significant expansion into previously remote areas and has resulted in disturbance of breeding birds as well as direct habitat loss to a small degree. Further expansion of operations in the region is anticipated (Cranswick <em>et al. </em>2010). Other threats include industrial developments at breeding sites in Gydan and Yamal, the use of fungicides (Mateo <em>et al. </em>2016) and rodenticides in the wintering grounds, as well as displacement by windfarms in the wintering areas. A major recent threat is the expansion in windfarms in the wintering areas since 2008. Many thousands of wind turbines have been proposed in Dobrudhza area both in Bulgaria and Romania, including large complexes adjacent to IBAs and SPAs. Data analysis from wintering grounds in Bulgaria suggest that there is already impact of the constructed windfarms leading to displacement and shifting of the foraging areas (<a>Petkov <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012</a>).<br/><p></p></span></span>","Coordinated censuses in January 2003, 2004 and 2005 resulted in total population estimates of 33,600, 52,800 and 32,100 individuals respectively. The geometric mean of these totals 38,500. Recalculating this including the 2006 count of c.34,000 gives a revised geometric mean of 37,000 individuals. However, total counts of 40,800 in spring 2008 (primarily as a result of a large count in Kalmykia), 44,300 the following winter (Cranswick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and a potential population count of 56,860 in autumn 2010 (Rozenfeld 2011a) lend further weight to the suggestion that counts in the mid 2000s might be partially incomplete because birds wintered away from the traditionally surveyed sites. In 2015, Wetlands International increased its global population estimate from c. 44,000 to c. 56,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species breeds on the Taimyr (70% of the population), Gydan  and Yamal peninsulas, Russia (Hunter and Black 1996). In winter, prior  to the 1950s, much of the population occurred along the western coast of  the Caspian Sea, mainly in Azerbaijan, and in Iran and Iraq. The  wintering area then rapidly shifted to the western Black Sea coast, and  80-90% of birds now congregate in January/ February at 5-10 roost sites  on the Black Sea coast, particularly at Shabla Lakes and Durankulak  Lake, Bulgaria, Razelm-Sinoe lagoons, Romania, and in the coastal area  between the rivers Danube and Dniester in Ukraine (A.

Small numbers also  winter in Azerbaijan. The precise distribution in winter varies  according to the severity of the weather from the Crimean peninsula to  the Dobrudzha region of Bulgaria. In cold weather, small numbers are  occasionally on the Aegean shore of Greece and Turkey (Cranswick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.  </span>2010); during prolonged mild periods, significant numbers may remain in  Kalmykya, Stavropol and Rostov districts in Russia (S.

Migration is believed to follow a relatively narrow route  south down the Ob to Kazakhstan (though a small number of ringing  recoveries and recent satellite tracking data point to some birds passing to the west of the Urals [Simeonov <em>et al. </em>2014]) and  then east to the Black Sea. There are four known main staging areas: the  Lower Ob, Middle Ob and Kumo-Manych depression in Russia, and the  Northern and Kostanay regions of Kazakhstan. They are also regularly  recorded in small numbers on passage in Hungary (e.g. Pigniczki 2008).  There may be other, currently unknown, staging sites (several new sites have been identified by satellite tracking [Simeonov <em>et al. </em>2014]) and knowledge of  the migration route, particularly in Siberia, should therefore be  considered incomplete. It is also possible that some wintering grounds  remain undetected (perhaps in eastern Ukraine and southwest Russia),&#160;and use of these areas during mild weather may account for the variation in winter survey totals in recent years.<br/><br/>Maximum population counts from wintering or staging areas were 60,000 between 1967-1970, 25,907 between 1976-1990, 75,879 between 1991-1995, 88,000 in 1996  (Aarvak <em>et al.</em> 1996), 60,444 between 1998-2001 (with a maximum of 88,425 in winter 2000) (D.

The total population size is estimated at approximately 2,500 individuals, although no recent estimates have been obtained for the populations in China. Although the population in China is small and probably declining, this is offset by the increasing trend of the species in Central Asia, which represents the majority of the species’ population (approximately 75%). Numbers in India are very small, and thus are numerically not significant for determining species-level population trends. Its extent of occurence (EOO) is &gt;1,000,000 km² and although its area of occupancy (AOO) is not known, it is not likely to approach the threshold of &lt;2,000 km² to qualify for Vulnerable or Near Threatened. To the best of our knowledge there is no continuing decline or extreme fluctuations in the EOO, AOO, area, extent and/or quality of habitat, number of locations or subpopulations or the number of mature individuals. This species is therefore listed as Least Concern.","<em>Cervus h. bactrianus </em>and <em>C. h. yarkandensis</em> inhabit riparian forested corridors surrounded by desert environments. Some significant groups of <em>C. h. bactrianus</em> inhabit reed bushes with very limited tree cover. Although the main habitat of <em>C. h. bactrianus</em> is riparian forests, its diet includes grasses, sedges and shrubs, and tree shoots to a minor extent. Its diet is very limited most of the year (e.g. when inhabiting reeds and brush). As opposed to other red deer subspecies, which consume branches preferably of young deciduous trees of up to 15 mm thick, <em>C. h. bactrianus</em> eats only branches of willow, poplar, some other riparian forest species and saxaul in deserts up to 5 mm thick.<br/><br/><em>Cervus h. hanglu</em> inhabits deciduous woodland, upland moors and open mountainous areas (sometimes above the treeline), natural grasslands, pastures and meadows (Koubek and Zima 1999).It primarily uses mixed oak forests, followed by Morus and riverine habitats during the winter and mixed oak forests and coniferous forests during the summer, where food availability is greatest (Ahmad <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). In woodland, its diet consists mainly of shrub and tree shoots, but in other habitats it also consumes grasses, sedges and shrubs.<br/><br/>Generally found in mountainous areas, where it spends summers in alpine meadows and winters in valleys. On more level terrain, it seeks wooded hillsides in summer, open grasslands in winter.","In Central Asia <em>C. h. bactrianus</em> has declined due to illegal hunting and loss of habitat; although much of the remaining forest is legally protected, illegal logging, forest loss due to fires and illegal grazing of livestock remain problematic (Karlstetter and Mallon 2014, Pereladova 2013).<br/><br/>Poaching, by both civilian and military personnel, was identified as the main cause of the decline of the Hangul in the past and present (Shah <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Wildlife Department are at present unable to patrol and implement protection activities due to the occupation of Dachigam National Park by insurgents and the armed forces, thus poaching may very likely have increased as a result (M.K. Ranjitsinh pers. comm. 2016). Incursion of nomadic livestock herders and predation of fawns by their guard dogs is reportedly also a significant problem that is not being effectively dealt with and competition for grazing grounds with livestock and the associated risk of disease transmission are also significant threats. The Hangul <em>C. h. hanglu </em>population in the Dachigam landscape also appears to have low genetic variation in comparison to other species (Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015) and thus could be susceptible to the effects of inbreeding.<br/><br/>In China <em>C. h. yarkandensis</em> is threatened by agricultural expansion, oil exploration and most significantly, by hunting (Jianfang <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006).","<em>Cervus h. bactrianus</em> known from the basins of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers underwent a rapid decline in the 19th century and disappeared from Syr Darya by 1900. In the mid 1960s the population consisted of 350-500 individuals; special reserves were established for the protection of <em>C. h. bactrianus</em> and populations were restored in parts of its former range. By 1989 there were approximately 900 individuals in 13 groups. However, after the break up of the Soviet Union only 350 individuals remained as a result of poaching. Following restoration activities the population of <em>C. h. bactrianus</em> had increased to 1,900 individuals in total in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan by 2011 (Pereladova 2013) and 2,700 in total in 2015 (O. Pereladova pers. comm). Population numbers in Afghanistan are not known (Karlstetter and Mallon 2014).<br/><br/>Periodic monitoring of Hangul (<em>C. h. hanglu</em>) in Dachigam has been in operation, and population statistics have been maintained since the early 20th Century (D. Donnithorne-Taite pers. comm. 2016). However, uncertainty regarding the accuracy of many of the official population statistics makes determining the population trend and status over time challenging. A drastic decline in the Dachigam Hangul population was reported soon after 1947, when the 3,000-5,000 animals estimated in the early 1900s suddenly dropped to 180 animals in 1965, although there are considerable doubts of the veracity of the earlier population estimates (Gee 1965, Mukesh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, M.K. Ranjitsinh pers. comm. 2016). Prior to 1947 Hangul was regarded as “royal game” by the Maharaja and was thus strictly protected. In the 1950s, the total population was estimated at a few hundred animals but this was thought to have been optimistic (Gee, 1965). By 1960, the total population estimate had fallen to 250 individuals and by 1962 to 175-200 animals as estimated by Gee, although official estimates were significantly higher at 360 animals (Gee, 1965). In 1968, Schaller conducted a census of the Hangul population during the rut and estimated a total population size of 180 animals (Kurt 1978). From the early 1970s onwards the official estimates of the Hangul increased up to a peak of 818 individuals in 1988. However, these official estimates were almost certainly inflated (M.K. Ranjitsinh pers. comm. 2016). Disturbances in Kashmir prevented the monitoring of the Hangul population in Dachigam from 1989 to 1991. When monitoring resumed in 1992, the population had reached the lowest level yet recorded at 120–140 individuals, which is believed to be a reliable estimate (M.K. Ranjitsinh pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>From 1994 to 2003 the Hangul population in Dachigam was estimated to be between 150 and 195 individuals with numbers remaining fairly stable over that period. Post-2003, official population estimates were again most likely inflated (M.K. Ranjitisnh pers. comm. 2016). Problems with differing survey methods are also apparent. In 2015 the population estimate of 110–130 individuals in Dachigam National Park is thought to be accurate (M.K. Ranjitsinh pers. comm.), and the overall population including the other relic populations in Kashmir was estimated to be fewer than 150–200 individuals (Bacha 2014, Bacha <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Due to the doubts over the veracity of official Hangul population estimates and differing monitoring methods applied over time, it is very difficult to determine the population trend based on these data. However, additional information suggests that the Hangul population is very likely undergoing a continual decline. The current sex ratio of the Hangul population in Dachigam is 1 stag: 11 hinds (M.K. Ranjitsinh pers. comm. 2016), stags are more vulnerable to poaching, particularly during the rut, which is the main threat to the Hangul population (Shah <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). In 2006 the stag: hind ratio was estimated at 29: 100, and in 2009 it was estimated at 18: 100 (Qureshi<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2009) suggesting the situation has worsened quite significantly in recent years and that poaching is taking a considerable toll on the Hangul population. The number of young is also extremely low with a current fawn: hind ratio of 6: 100 (Ahmad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013), this is significantly lower than in 2009 when the ratio was estimated at 21: 100 (Qureshi<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Schaller (1969) reported a stag: hind ratio of 45: 100, above 30: 100 is considered to be a good ratio for Red Deer (Clutton-Brock <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1982).&#160; The summer pastures and only extant breeding ground of Hangul are also occupied by shepherds, sheep flocks and their guard dogs (Shah <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011), the latter disturb and depredate the newly born fawns (Qureshi<em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, M.K. Ranjitsinh pers. comm. 2016).<br/><br/>In China, C. h. yarkandensis had a declining population of about 4,000–5,000 in 1991, scattered along the Tarim and Karakax rivers, central Xinjiang Province (Gu Jinghe 1991, Wilson and Mittermeier 2011). The deer is apparently isolated in three populations, in Xaya, Lopnur and Qarqan, and continues to decline, as conservation measures thus far have not been effective. There were an estimated 50 individuals in the Qarqan area and approximately 200 in each of Lopnur and Xaya (Mahmut <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001), more recent population estimates could not be obtained in 2015 for the re-assessment.",Increasing,"In Central Asia the Bukhara Deer or Bactrian Deer (<em>Cervus hanglu bactrianus</em>) inhabits Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and north Afghanistan. Historically it inhabited all of the river valleys of Amudaria and Syrdaria, as well as the Murgab and Tedjen to the west, Zarafshan and Ily to the east, but its range was much reduced in the 1960s. Conservation activities in the aforementioned countries have restored the deer to a number of areas (Pereladova 2013). It now occurs in the Badai-Tugai State Nature Reserve and the Kyzylkum State Nature Reserve in Uzbekistan, where the highest numbers remain. Most of these populations are shared with Turkmenistan. The population in Veravshan State Nature Reserve (Uzbekistan), which was reintroduced in the 2000s, is shared with Tajikistan. In Tajikistan the main population, which is recovering, is in the Tigrovaya Balka State Nature reserve and Farkhor and Khamadoni Districts. The species was extirpated from Kazakhstan in the 1960s and reintroduced to the Karatchingil hunting concession (where it numbers 400-500 animals), the Altyn-Emel National Park and Turkestan (Syrdarya). In Afghanistan it possibly occurs in the wetlands of the Amu Darya in Kunduz Province and in Takhar close to the border with Tajikistan. Reintroduced deer of the Ajar Valley were hunted to extinction (Karlstetter and Mallon 2014).<br/><br/>The Hangul (<em>C. h. hanglu</em>) was once widely distributed in the mountains of Kashmir along the Zanskar Mountain range, from Shalurah and Karen in the Kishenganga catchment to Dorus in the Lolab Valley, the Erin catchments in Bandipora in the north, to Bringi valley and Marwah/Wadwan in Kishtwar High Altitude National Park (NP), the lower Chenab Valley, and Ramnagar in the south (Gee 1966, Holloway andWani 1970). Gamagul Siya-Behi Sanctuary in Himachal Pradesh is the only site outside of Jammu and Kashmir that retained an isolated Hangul population (Holloway 1971, Schaller 1969, Kurt 1978) of unknown status for a brief period before it was declared extinct from that region (Schaller 1969, Kurt 1978, Qureshi <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Ahmad <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009). At present the only viable population of Hangul is restricted to the Dachigam National Park with a few small populations in the adjoining areas of Shikargah-Overa to the South and Surfrao-Akhal and Wangath-Naranag in Sindh Forest Division to the north (Ahmad <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009, Qureshi <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>2009, Ahmad <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/><em>Cervus h. yarkandensis</em> inhabits the valleys of the Tarim, Konqi and Qarqan rivers in Xinjiang, China.",The species is illegally hunted in China. The illegal hunting is one of the main reasons for the species' decline in Central Asia and the primary reason for the species’ decline in India.,Terrestrial,"More than 10 years of conservation efforts in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, have halted the decline of <em>C. h. bactrianus</em> and begun to restore populations. Conservation measures implemented to date include anti-poaching, ecological education/prevention of poaching, establishment of systems of ecological corridors with protection from poaching (ensuring safe, seasonal migration), forage fields and seasonal feeding where necessary, regulation of the total number of animals and population sex ratio (to avoid local overpopulation and depletion of resources), establishment of additional protected areas, and reintroduction into suitable habitats ensuring connectivity and possibilities for gene exchange between minor populations (Pereladova 2013).<br/><br/>In India, Dachigam National Park is the stronghold for the Hangul containing the only population larger than a few individuals. Despite some conservation efforts, poaching is clearly the biggest threat to the Hangul. Ensuring that poaching is no longer a threat to the Hangul is the highest priority conservation intervention. Secondly, preventing incursion of nomadic livestock herders will reduce competition with livestock for grazing grounds, reduce the potential for disease transmission and will likely increase the survival rates of fawns by reducing depredation by herding dogs Ahmad <em>et al.</em> (2013). Reported predation by Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> and Asiatic Black Bear <em>Ursus thibetanus</em> may exacerbate an already fragile situation (Shah <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ahmad <em>et al.</em> 2013), control or translocation of Asiatic Black Bear could help reduce predation on Hangul fawns and increase survival and recruitment (M.K. Ranjitsinh pers. comm 2017).<br/><br/><em>Cervus elaphus bactrianus</em> is listed on Appendix II of CITES. Since 2002 the Bukhara Deer has been protected under an MoU concerning conservation and restoration of the deer under the auspices of the CMS. <em>Cervus elaphus hanglu</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES and under Schedule-I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and JandK Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1978. It has also been listed amongst the top 15 species of high conservation priority by the Government of India (Mukesh <em>et al.</em> 2015).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
121229971,41688,Ursus arctos,Least Concern,,2017,2016-02-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The range of the Brown Bear has historically declined in North America, Europe, and Asia, and the species has been extirpated in North Africa. However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the world’s most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 km²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 km²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5‒15 bears per 1,000 km²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, Frković <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130–220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 km² and 2,200 km² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21‒29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of Gärdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (≈1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Evidence indicates a decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality over a period of three generations (45 years) based on forest loss in West and Central Africa (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Mayaux <em>et al.</em> 2013, Achard <em>et al.</em> 2014) resulting in the species qualifying for A2c. It also meets criteria A2d on the basis that it is reasonable to infer, and coinciding with forest loss, that populations have declined by 50% over a period of three generations (1974-2019) due to exploitation for local consumption and more recently harvest for international trafficking to Asian markets. The species also meets criteria A4cd using a period of 45 years (three generations; 30 years past, 15 years future) because it is inferred that suitable habitat has been lost in the last 30 years (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Mayaux <em>et al.</em> 2013, Achard <em>et al.</em> 2014), and will continue to be so, while populations have been and are expected to continue to be overexploited. Intercontinental trafficking of tropical African pangolin scales to Asia has seemingly increased in the last decade and governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within one generations time; there is increasing Chinese investment in West and Central Africa which is apparently facilitating pangolin trafficking; there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for African pangolin derivatives, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest, will be effective; and the population of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to double by 2050 with the largest increases in countries including DRC (United Nations, 2019) thereby placing greater pressure on populations of this species. A generation length of 15 years has been used for this assessment based on the estimated generation length for Temminck’s Pangolin (<em>Smutsia temminckii</em>); however, it should be noted that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding this estimate and further research into the life history of the Giant Pangolin is required in order to make a more informed estimate of generation length.  <strong></strong>","<p>The Giant Pangolin<em> </em>occurs in primary and secondary rainforest forest formations, gallery forests, swamp forests, forest-savannah mosaic habitats and wooded savannah (Hoffmann <em>et al. </em>2019). The species also persists discontinuously in savannah woodland /agricultural mosaics in central and southwestern Uganda (N. Matthews and S. Nixon unpubl. data). In Tanzania it has been recorded in bamboo stands in miombo woodland (Foley <em>et al. </em>2014). It is thought that the species may be dependent on access to permanent water sources (Kingdon <em>et al. </em>2013), although this requires confirmation. The species is found across a wide altitudinal gradient, from sea level on the Gabon coast to at least 2200 a.s.l. in the Albertine rift escarpment forests of eastern DRC (S. Nixon, unpubl. data). &#160;The Giant Pangolin is myrmecophagous and feeds on ants (including <em>Palthothyreus</em> and <em>Anomma)</em>, and termites (including the genera <em>Macrotermes</em>, <em>Pseudocanthotermes</em>, <em>Odontotermes</em>, <em>Cubitermes</em>, <em>Apicotermes</em> and <em>Protermes;</em> Vincent 1964; Pagès 1970) but other insect species may also be taken (Kingdon 1971). It is a terrestrial species; animals spend the daytime resting under piles of plant debris, in thickets, under fallen tree roots, in partially opened termitaria, or in burrows (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Individuals may have relatively consistent home ranges, although average home range size is not known and may vary quite substantially across different habitats (Pagès 1970, Kingdon 1971, S. Nixon, unpubl. data) and between sexes (N. Matthews and S Nixon unpubl. data). Individuals are primarily solitary although females are sometimes seen with their young and camera trap surveys have detected individuals walking close together suggesting some association (Bruce <em>et al. </em>2017, N. Matthews and S. Nixon unpubl. data). Scent marking behaviour is evident and commonly observed in both male and female Giant Pangolins in central Uganda which may reflect territorial and/or, pre-copulatory behaviour (N. Matthews and S. Nixon unpubl. data). Their reproductive biology is not well known; breeding may be seasonal and females usually give birth to a single young, possibly annually, but perhaps every second year. Generation time is estimated at 15 years based on the calculated generation time of&#160;Temminck’s Pangolin (<em>S. temminckii)</em> but may be longer.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>","<p>As with other pangolin species, unsustainable levels of hunting and poaching are the primary threat to the long-term survival of the Giant Pangolin. The species is subject to widespread exploitation for bushmeat and use in traditional medicine and is regularly recorded in bushmeat markets (Colyn&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1987, Bräutigam <em>et al.</em> 1994, Fa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Bowen-Jones 1998, Ayeni <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Colyn <em>et al.</em> (1987) found that this species comprised one-tenth of the total number of pangolins (~100) on sale as bushmeat in rural areas around Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2004, Giant Pangolins contributed 5,019 kg in terms of harvested biomass (including either whole animals and/or animal parts) from five markets monitored in Gabon, compared to 2,053 kg for White-bellied Pangolins (<em>Phataginus tricuspis</em>) and 335 kg for Black-bellied Pangolins (<em>P. tetradactyla</em>; Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). </p><p>Market surveys across range countries have revealed the price of Giant Pangolins has increased substantially over the past two decades with Mambeya <em>et al.</em> (2018) recording a 211% price rise (compared to a 73% rise in the price of arboreal pangolins) between 2002 and 2014 in Liberville, Gabon. Further, while Giant Pangolins were not recorded among the 18 most commonly traded species between 2002 and 2006, a 2014 study revealed they were the seventh most traded species forming 3.6% of all carcasses sold. Ingram <em>et al.</em> (2018) concluded that prices rose 5.8 times across central Africa between 1993 and 2004 , estimating&#160; that 0.4-2.7 million pangolins were harvested every year in Africa during this period including 100,000 Giant Pangolins per annum. In Nigeria numbers of Giant Pangolins for sale in bushmeat markets have increased since 2003 as White-bellied Pangolins become harder to source (D. Soewu, unpubl. data). Figures from bushmeat markets are likely to underestimate the actual offtake: Fa <em>et al.</em> (1995) noted that survey records of Giant Pangolin meat in the markets of Bioko were misleading as only 10% made it to market. Similarly, in Liberia, only 25% of the harvest is sold, as local hunters preferred it to other species, while harvest rates in six communities adjacent to Sapo National Park were found to be unsustainable (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The breakdown of taboos protecting the species has led to increased hunting pressure in some areas. For example, local protection afforded by totems in western Côte d’Ivoire has broken down due to refugee movements throughout the region as a result of conflicts in Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). </p><p>The species is increasingly recorded in international trade. There are no reports of trade in live specimens in the CITES trade reports between 1996 and 2011, however in 2012 50 individuals were reportedly exported from Togo to Lao PDR for commercial purposes and in 2015 100 live animals were exported from Nigeria to China for use in captive breeding according to the CITES trade data (Challender and Waterman 2017). Between 2011 and this species being listed on CITES Appendix I in January 2017, 3,268.14 kg of Giant Pangolin scales (an estimated 908 individuals) were traded internationally (Challender &amp; Waterman 2017).</p><p>The true scale of the illegal international trade is unknown, but between 2012 and 2017 6,115kg of Giant Pangolin scales were seized, equating to an estimated 1,697 individuals (Challender and Waterman 2017). These shipments were all apparently destined for markets in East or Southeast Asia. It is estimated that between 2015 and 2019 the equivalent of more than 400,000 African pangolins were trafficked&#160;either in Africa bound for Asia, or en route to East Asian countries, including the Giant Pangolin (Challender<em> et al.</em> 2019; D. Challender, unpubl. data). In 2018 and 2019 there were numerous very large seizures (e.g. up to and &gt;12 tonnes of African pangolin scales) of shipments en route to Asia, and which likely included scales from Giant Pangolin. Ilegal intercontinental trade is a serious and growing threat to Africa’s pangolins, particularly as the illicit nature of the trade means that it is likely that the vast majority of such exports are not detected. This species' large size, low reproductive rate and terrestrial habits make it particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p>Habitat loss is also a threat. Past and present declines in Giant Pangolin area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality likely differ between West and Central Africa. West Africa has deforestation rates that are three times higher than in the Congo Basin forests (Mayaux et al. 2013), with some countries having lost up to 98% of their natural forest cover (e.g. Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana; Achard et al. 2014; Mayaux et al. 2013; Knauer et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2017). West Africa also has higher human population densities (Tatem 2017), and smaller patches of roadless areas (Ibisch et al. 2016) than Central Africa. Annual deforestation is higher in areas with higher human population density (Mayaux et al. 2013). In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest loss of tropical primary forest in the world, while Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire ranked 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> (of countries with &gt;100,000 ha of primary forest) in terms of their percent increase in forest loss from 2017 at 60% and 26% respectively (World Resources Institute 2019), however true rates of loss are imperfectly known.</p>","<p>This is a solitary, nocturnal and elusive species which is difficult to census and as a result there is no reliable information on population abundance or densities (or occupancy). Recent camera trapping surveys have given information on the relative abundance of the species in some study areas across their range, including in Tanzania, and Cameroon (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2014, Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2017). Detection rates for Giant Pangolins tend to be low using systematic or random camera trapping methods. Data collated from 17 camera trap studies across eight countries (Cameroon, DRC, Gabon, Liberia, Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda) between 2010 and 2016, and representing 1993 camera trap stations and 137,145 trap nights, revealed the proportion of Giant Pangolin detections (naïve occupancy) was only 0.13, and the proportion of sampling occasions with detections (naïve detection probability) was 0.02 (Khwaja <em>et al.</em> in prep). Recent studies however indicate that camera-trapping rates can be improved through targeted efforts (Bruce <em>at al.</em> 2017; N. Matthews and S. Nixon, unpubl. data). Density and abundance are likely to be influenced by a variety of factors including habitat suitability, prey availability, levels of anthropogenic persecution, and to a lesser extent predation levels from large carnivores. The species is believed to be generally rare and populations are thought to be declining across their range.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The species is widely but discontinuously distributed throughout West and Central Africa in a broad range of habitats including primary and secondary rainforest formations, swamp forest, forest savannah mosaics and savannah woodlands. It is recorded from Senegal (though there is no evidence of its presence in Gambia) eastwards through Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia (including the vicinity of Mt Nimba; Coe 1975), Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, where it has also been reported from the north in Mole National Park (Grubb <em>et al.</em> 1998). There is no information from Togo (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), although Grubb <em>et al.</em> (1998) map older records from Ghana near Fazao-Malfakassa National Park on the border with Togo. The species was previously thought to be found across northern Benin, but may now be restricted to the W and Pendjari National Parks (Akpona and Daouda 2011), although recent surveys have not detected the species there. Sayer and Green (1984) referred to sightings in Burkina Faso and Niger (although the species was not included by Lamarque 2004). The distribution of this species in Nigeria is unclear, but it may occur in the south and was camera-trapped in the southeast in Gashaka Gumti National Park in 2016 (S. Nixon, unpubl. data). It was previously recorded as occurring on the island of Bioko (Kingdon <em>et al.</em> 2013), however these reports are likely of carcasses brought in from the mainland to be sold at market (Hoffmann <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ingram <em>et al.</em> 2019). From the eastern bank of the Sanaga River in Cameroon the species is continuously distributed throughout the Congo Basin into Central Uganda (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Giant Pangolins have been observed on the lakeshore in western Kenya, close to the Uganda border, although there are no recent records (Kingdon 1971). There is an authenticated record from the Mahale Mountains in western Tanzania, where their presence has been confirmed by camera-traps and they may also occur in Gombe National Park (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are no records from Burundi (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013) but the presence of the species has recently been confirmed in South Sudan, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D. Reeder, unpubl. data). Although previously thought extirpated in Rwanda the species has recently been confirmed present in the Akagera National Park in the east of the country (D. Bantlin, unpubl. data). The northern limits of the distribution are not well known but can be expected to broadly coincide with the limits of the tropical lowland rainforests and forest savannah mosaics. The northern banks of the Kasai and Tshuapa Rivers apparently define its southern limits within the central forest block (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>","<p>The Giant Pangolin is subject to exploitative threats. Individuals are hunted for their meat, which may be consumed locally or traded as wild meat, and for their scales, which are used for cultural and ethno-medicinal purposes, including in Traditional African Medicine<em> </em>(Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 1994).</p><p>  </p><p>Hunting for local utilization has historically been the main threat to African pangolins (alongside habitat loss in parts of the range) and while there is limited evidence of international trade within the continent (e.g. Bräutigam <em>et al</em>. 1994, Soewu and Ayodele 2009), it seems likely that not all pangolin derivatives for sale in regional markets are of domestic origin. </p><p>  </p><p>Intercontinental trade of pangolins to Asia, typically for the traditional medicine markets in China and Viet Nam, is a major and rapidly intensifying threat to African pangolins. Large seizures of Giant Pangolin scales totalling 6,115kg, or an estimated 1,697 individuals, have been made in recent years, apparently destined for south east Asia (Challender and Waterman 2017). This species has also been identified in seizures made in Hong Kong (Mwale <em>et al.</em> 2017) and it is highly likely that Giant Pangolin scales were present in the apparently increasing number of seizures involving tropical African pangolins but not identified to species level. The low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade and the fact that hunting and poaching is indiscriminate between age and sex, and increasingly targeted for export markets, suggest that documented pangolin seizures comprise only a small fraction of the actual trade, with real volumes likely at unsustainable levels (see Challender and Waterman, 2017).<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Giant Pangolins are present in protected areas across their range, including in: Cameroon: Campo Ma’an (Matthews and Matthews 2006), Dja Faunal Reserve (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2018), Lobéké National Park (T.

123791436,15953,Panthera onca,Near Threatened,A2cd,2017,2016-08-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Classify as Near Threatened, due to a suspected 20-25% decline over the past three generations (21 years) in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and habitat quality, along with actual or potential levels of exploitation. Given the inherent difficulty of assessing this species, the normally low density with which it occupies the landscape and the effects that small population and habitat degradations can have on the species, our minimum assessment of population decrease could be a significant underestimate.<br/><br/>Since the previous Red List assessment in 2008, the threats to Jaguars have continued or intensified. The first expert mapping of Jaguar range took place in 2002 (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002), and the resulting map was used for the 2008 Red List assessment. Today, more is known about Jaguar distribution and abundance, allowing us to retrospectively classify areas as Jaguar range in 2015 that were previously identified as non-range or gaps in knowledge (Supplementary Material Figure 1). The 2015 mapping exercise also reflects updates to range recommended by Jaguar experts, with sufficient evidence (i.e., tracks, camera-trap photos, sightings of live or dead animals) to warrant inclusion/exclusion of range. The updated range indicates increasing fragmentation of Jaguar populations, particularly in eastern and southeastern Brazil, northern Venezuela and the Maya Forest (Selva Maya) of Mexico and Guatemala. Comparing 2015 Jaguar range to the extent of “known” range from the 2002 exercise, thereby controlling for the difference in knowledge extent, there is a 20.0% decline in Jaguar range over the past fourteen years (2002-2015), from 8.77 million km² to 7.02 million km² (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). With a more robust range map from which to begin the next assessment, the species will likely qualify for VU in the near future.<br/><br/>With a generation length of 6.84 years, we suspect at least a 20-25% loss in mature individuals over the past 21 years (three generations) because there are documented population declines together with habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Paviolo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Jedrzejewski <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales (de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2017a, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","The Jaguar has a stocky, heavy body with short massive limbs associated with reduced cursorial behaviour and dense forest habitat, and robust canines and large head allowing a more powerful bite than other large cats (Seymour 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Mean body weight varies by up to 100% across their range, those living further from the equator tend to be larger (Iriarte <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1990). This extreme variation in size may reflect variation in the availability of large prey in different habitats: the largest Jaguars occur in open flood plains areas, the Llanos in Venezuela and the Pantanal in Brazil, and take the largest prey, and the smallest Jaguars inhabit the dense forest areas of Central America and Amazonia and take smaller prey (Hoogesteijn and Mondolfi 1996, Oliveira 2002).<br/><strong><br/><u>Habitat</u></strong><br/>Jaguar habitat is typically characterized by dense forest cover (mainly primary and secondary forest), the presence of water bodies and a sufficient prey base (Swank and Teer 1989, Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). However, they are found in range of habitats from rainforest to seasonally flooded swamp areas, pampas grassland, thorn scrub woodland, and dry deciduous forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars mainly inhabit tropical lowland forest, followed by dry tropical forest, xeric habitats and finally arable lowland pastures (Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Although Jaguars have been reported from elevations as high as 3000 m (Brown and Lopez Gonzalez 2001), they typically avoid montane forest, and have not been found in the high plateau of central Mexico or above 2700 m in the Andes (Ceballos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>, 2011). The species is more strongly associated with water in comparison to any of the other Panthera cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), indicated by their higher densities within tropical moist forests than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest (Maffei <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Even within drier areas they are only found around the main water courses. This characteristic quickly brings them into conflict with expansion of high intensity agriculture, having the same requirements of nearby water sources for irrigation.<br/><br/><u><strong>Home range</strong></u><br/>Jaguar home ranges vary in size across their geographic range, often according to the season and availability of resources (e.g. Crawshaw and Quigley 1991, Núñez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). Generally males range further than females.<br/><br/>In the dry tropical deciduous forest of Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, female home range size ranged from 25 km² (dry season) to 60 km² (wet season) (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Nunez et al 2002). In the semi-deciduous and seasonally flooded forest of Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, male home range size ranged from 33 to 41 km² for males and 32 to 59 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Ceballos <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>In the tropical broadleaf moist lowland secondary forest of Belize, male home range size ranged from 28 to 40 km² (radio telemetry; Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). In the mosaic landscape (secondary broadleaf forest, savannah and agriculture) of Central Belize, male home ranges ranged from 103 to 194 km² in the dry season and 179 to 386 in the wet season, and from 86 to 99 km² for a single female in the dry and wet seasons respectively (95% MCP, GPS collars, Figueroa 2013).<br/><br/>In the llanos of Venezuela, home range size ranged from 93 to 100 km² (males, dry season) and ranged from 51 to 80 km² for females in the wet season and dry season respectively (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Scognamillo <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>There are numerous studies of home ranges from the seasonally inundated landscape of the Brazilian Pantanal: females 25 to 38 km² (radio telemetry; Schaller and Crawshaw 1980), females 5km² and males 20 km² for males in the wet season, and 70 and 79km², respectively, in the dry season (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw and Quigley 1991), female 38km² and male 67km² (95% fixed kernel, radio telemetry; Azevedo and Murray 2007), 57 to 176 km² (95% MCP, GPS collars; Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006), and females 34 to 101 km² in the wet season, and 42 to 89 km² in the dry season, and males 79 to 149 km² in the wet season, and 58 to 263 km² in the dry season (90% adaptive kernel estimator, GPS collars, Cavalcanti and Gese (2009).<br/><br/>In the semi-deciduous rainforest of the Brazilian Atlantic forests, male home range size ranged from 87 to 139 km², and from 44 to 133 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Cullen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). It can be seen in the above review that the more recent studies using GPS technology show considerably larger range sizes compared to older VHF studies, this is especially indicative for recent GPS studies from areas where previously VHF studies were carried out. The differences are ranging from ~4-6 times larger. It is therefore reasonable to assume that these older ranges are considerably underrepresenting Jaguar home ranges. Densities based on these ranges are therefore equally overestimated.<br/><strong><br/><u>Diet</u></strong><br/>Jaguars are opportunistic hunters. Over 85 prey species (wild and livestock/domestic), including mammals, reptiles and birds, have been recorded in their diet across their geographic range (Seymour 1989).<br/><br/>Jaguars take a wide variety of prey species but large-sized ungulates are preferred when available (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The intake of large prey likely helps Jaguars save energy, since it is estimated that 50% of kills are larger prey on which they will feed for up to 4 days (Schaller and Crawshaw 1980, Nunez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Nevertheless, Jaguar diet is highly variable, depending on prey availability, ease of capture, and a variety of additional factors (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Seymour 1989). In some areas cattle (<em>Bos</em> sp.) comprise an important item in their diet (Polisar <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Palmeira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Cavalcanti and Gese 2010). The decline of wild prey below a minimum threshold increases livestock depredation by big cats (Khorozyan <em>et al</em>. 2015), which in turn may lead to retaliatory killings of felids by livestock owners. High frequency of smaller prey species is frequently reported in Jaguar diet, e.g. armadillo (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Novack <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Foster <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b). The species has therefore gained a reputation of being able to persist in relatively disturbed areas with incomplete prey assemblages (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). However, most diet studies rely on scat analysis. Palomares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) showed that the high majority of these scats are from males. Diet studies are therefore highly biased towards male diets. As males do not contribute anything to the rearing of young, as single individuals, they are able to sustain themselves better at a varied diet of small species. Mothers with cubs will likely require the larger ungulates but this important component of the populations is extremely poorly represented in diet studies of scats.<br/><br/><u><strong>Reproduction</strong></u><br/>There are few studies on the reproductive ecology of Jaguars in the wild. Males and females may come together for breeding opportunities at any time of the year (e.g. Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). The female is in oestrus 6-17 day period, and gestation lasts 91-101 days (in captivity), after which the female gives birth to up to four cubs, usually two, which will stay with her for up to 24 months (Mondolfi and Hoogesijn 1982, Seymour 1989, Kitchener 1991, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cubs are fully dependent on their mother’s milk for the first 10-11 weeks, and continue to suckle until 5-6 months old (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cycling could resume 2-3 weeks following lactational anestrus (Soares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). However, inter-birth intervals documented in the wild are approximately two years (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Carrillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). By 15-18 months, Jaguars travel and hunt independently within their mother’s range, although they may still come together at kill sites (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars are usually independent by the age of 24 months, however the age of dispersal or the social circumstances associated with it are poorly known (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Dispersal does not appear to be linked with the onset of sexual maturity, estimated at 24-30 months for females and 36-48 months for males (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Few data are available on dispersal distances however telemetry studies in the Brazilian Pantanal suggest that males disperse further than females (Quigley and Crawshaw 1992, Quigley and Crawshaw 2002). Dispersal through human-dominated landscapes may increase the likelihood of conflict with humans, particularly in areas where the habitat is highly fragmented (e.g. Sáenz and Carrillo 2002). The maximum age of last reproduction of a female recorded in the wild is 13 years (Brown and Lopez-Gonzalez 2001).<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013). Values for age at first reproduction and longevity were agreed to by experts at the 2012 National Action Plan workshop for Jaguars in Brazil, and can be used for generation length calculations as:<br/><br/>GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs<br/>R<sub>span</sub> = 15 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 11.5 yrs<br/><br/>Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013)<br/>Thus, GL = 11.5*0.29 +3.5 = 6.84 yrs for Jaguars.","Jaguar populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010a, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Nijhawan <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press), killing for trophies/illegal trade in body parts, pro-active or retaliatory killings associated with livestock depredation (Zimmermann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2008, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015), and competition for wild meat with human hunters (Jorgenson and Redford 1993, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Deforestation rates in Latin America are the highest in the world together with tropical Africa (FAO forest update, D’Annunzio <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Industrial agriculture, along with subsistence agriculture, is the most significant driver of deforestation in tropical and subtropical countries, accounting for 80% of deforestation from 2000-2010. The current contribution of agriculture to deforestation varies by region, with industrial agriculture being responsible for 30% of deforestation in Africa and Asia, but close to 70% in Latin America. The most significant agricultural drivers of deforestation include soy, palm oil, and cattle ranching, all highly prevalent throughout Latin America (http://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture). The produce is mainly used for export as raw products for developing countries, not to feed local populations. Fragmentation and displacement frequently leads to lowering of densities of Jaguars and prey in leftover forest patches due to easier access and Jaguars feeding on the replaced livestock. Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Latin America is characterized by relatively low population densities with high population growth (http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). This means that the increased agricultural expansion will likely not be used to feed the expanding population of Latin America. Increased pressure on wildlife as a food source will increase. Even in low population countries like Belize, 75% of the yearly wildlife offtake can be attributed to humans, while Jaguars only account for 25% (Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Increases in human population within these thinly populated countries means, increased fragmentation for agriculture, industry and urbanization necessary for sustaining the increased number of people, making the wildlife easier accessible for hunting. The greater need for food and potential increase in wealth for a proportion of the population means increased commercialization and increased prizes for wildlife game species, which are all Jaguar prey species.<br/><br/>Habitat loss is reducing and isolating Jaguar populations range wide (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Jaguars have lost about 49% of their historic geographic range (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em>et al.</em> 2016; current assessment). The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) an important Jaguar prey (e.g. Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010b), has been extirpated from 21% of its historical range during the past century and changed from NT to VU under the latest IUCN assessment (Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Keuroghlian <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Jaguars have become extinct in El Salvador, Uruguay, and the United States (where there are still periodic individuals present as presumed dispersers from Mexico) (TSJRT 2012, Campbell 2015). There are documented population declines and habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales. For example, the connectivity of Jaguar habitat between Honduras and Guatemala is almost gone; similar losses have been documented across the Chaco, Iguazu and Atlantic Forest, and between Tamaulipas and Veracruz (Haag <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press). Many Jaguar populations require connectivity between core sites to survive in the long term and these connectivity corridors are most of the time outside protected areas, and therefore vulnerable to human impacts (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>The vulnerability of the Jaguar to persecution is demonstrated by its disappearance by the mid-1800 from Uruguay (Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016), El Salvador and by the mid-1900's from the south-western US (Johnson and Van Pelt 2016). Disappearance from these countries catches the current trends in a nutshell. These countries were the first areas to show rapid population increase with large scale land conversion. Retaliatory killing of the remaining exposed Jaguars led to their extinction. These processes are now taking place on a continental scale and therefore there are few areas within Jaguar range that can be considered safe. With limited technological expansion in the region, the main source of income will be industrial agriculture. With every (local) economic crisis, it means that the last Jaguar strongholds will be eroded further. Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, there is still demand for Jaguar paws, teeth and other products, especially in local markets where canines are still considered interesting jewellery. On top of this, Jaguars are starting to be considered a replacement for tiger bone for traditional medicine purposes by the increasing Asian community in Latin America.","<u><strong>Historic assessment of Jaguar viability </strong></u><br/><strong>High chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that populations in 70% of the Jaguar range (over 6 million km²) had a high probability for survival. Most of that area consists of the Amazon Basin rainforest, and adjoining areas of the Pantanal and Gran Chaco (Torres <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Other areas considered by Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) to have a high probability for long-term Jaguar persistence included tropical moist lowland forest in Mesoamerica (the Selva Maya of Guatemala, Mexico and Belize) and a narrow strip of the Choco-Darien of Panama and Colombia to northern Honduras.<br/><br/><strong>Medium chance of survival: </strong>Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that Jaguar populations in 18% of the Jaguar range (1.6 million km²) had a medium probability of long-term survival. These areas are generally adjacent to the areas considered to have a high-probability probability of survival and include a large portion of the northern Cerrado, most of the Venezuelan and Colombian llanos, and the northern part of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. In Central America and Mexico, they include the highlands of Costa Rica and Panama, southern Mexico, and the two eastern mountain ranges of Mexico, Sierra de Taumalipas and the Sierra Madre Oriental.<br/><br/><strong>Low chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) classified the remainder of Jaguar range (12%) as having a low probability for Jaguar survival, and of most urgent conservation concern. These areas include the Atlantic Tropical Forest and Cerrado of Brazil; parts of the Chaco in northern Argentina; the Gran Sabana of northern Brazil, Venezuela and Guyana; parts of the coastal dry forest in Venezuela; and the remaining range in Central America and Mexico.<br/><br/><strong><u>Current assessment of Jaguar populations</u></strong><br/><strong>Mexico</strong>: Jaguar densities in Mexico have been estimated from 0.75 to 6 adults per 100 km² (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2016). The Jaguar population in the Selva Maya in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico was estimated in 2000 individuals (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Rodriguez-Soto <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). In the Greater Lacadona Ecosystem in southern Mexico, Jaguar density was estimated at 1.7-4.6/100 km², with an estimated population of 62 to 168 Jaguars within the protected areas of this region (de la Torre and Medellín 2011). Overall, Mexico’s national Jaguar census estimated at 4,000-5,000 individuals in 2011 (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press). The northern and central areas of Mexico are however becoming increasingly isolated with Jaguars disappearing where they were previously still detected (Grigione <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Rosas-Rosas and Bender 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Central America</strong>: Estimates of Jaguar density from Mesoamerica from 27 studies conducted from 2000 to 2010 range from 0.74 to 11.2 /100 km², however most of the studies did not cover the minimum area to ensure unbiased density estimates (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Nevertheless, across these sites density estimates were higher in tropical moist forest than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest, and higher in national parks compared to those from other multiple use areas (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Densities in the Belizean Selva Maya rainforest were estimated at 7.5-8.8/100 km² (Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). Jaguar density estimates in the protected lowland moist tropical forest of the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize range from 3.5 (+/- SE = 0.7) to 11.0 (+/- 3.1)/100 km² (Harmsen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Jaguar density was found to decline across the human-influenced landscape, a mosaic of unprotected forest, savannah, agriculture and settlements with distance from the protected forest (Foster 2008). The Talamanca Mountains of Costa Rica and Panama support a Jaguar population, but the probability of long-term persistence is medium to low (Gonzalez-Maya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Similarly the Jaguar populations located in protected areas in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua are under a great pressure from deforestation and hunting (Petracca <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>South America</strong>: Jaguar density in the Brazilian Pantanal has been estimated as 6.6-6.7 /100 km², or 10.3-11.7/100 km² depending on the method used (telemetry versus camera traps, respectively, Soislao and Cavalcanti (2006). In the Bolivian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 2.8/100 km² (Madidi National Park Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004), and in the Colombian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 4.5/100 km² and 2.5/100 km² (Amacayacu National Park and unprotected areas respectively; Payan 2008). Estimates of Jaguar density are 2/100 km² in the savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, 3.5/100 km² in the semiarid scrub of the Caatinga, and 2.2/100 km² in the Atlantic Forest (Silveira 2004), and 2.2-5 per 100 km² in the Bolivian Gran Chaco (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). The Atlantic Forest subpopulation in Brazil has been estimated at 200+/- 80 adults (Leite <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002). Jaguar populations in the Chaco region of northern Argentina and Brazil, and the Brazilian Caatinga, are low-density and highly threatened by livestock ranching and persecution (Altrichter <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, T. de Oliveira pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><u><strong>Historic methodological biases</strong></u><br/>Unfortunately, many of these reported density estimates have inadequate sample sizes of area or capture and recaptures. Careful reviews have shown that these estimates tend to be biased positively rather than negatively (Foster and Harmsen 2012, Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Tobler and Powell 2013). This means that many of the older publications from before 2010 tended to overestimate densities at an unknown quantity. It also means that previous assessments have been overly optimistic about Jaguar status throughout their range.<br/><br/><u><strong>Subpopulation status</strong></u><br/>De la Torre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2017) identified 34 Jaguar subpopulations where there is little likelihood of demographic or genetic exchange, and assessed each against Red List criteria. Overall, 97% met the criteria for Critically Endangered (25 subpopulations) or Endangered (eight subpopulations) (see Figure 3a-e in the Supplementary Material). The large Amazonia subpopulation, estimated to hold 89% of the total species population (57,000 out of 64,000), was assessed as Least Concern.",Decreasing,"The Jaguar is the largest cat of the Americas, and the only living representative of the genus <em>Panthera </em>in the New World (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Historically it ranged from the southwestern US (where there are still some vagrants close to the Mexican border) through the Amazon basin to the Rio Negro in Argentina (McCain and Childs 2008, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Its extent of occurrence (EOO) (updated with the collaboration of 44 experts—see the lists of Assessors and Contributors and the Assessment Rationale section for a thorough description) is estimated at 9.02 million km², with its stronghold the rainforest of the Amazon basin, which comprises 57% of its total EOO. The Jaguar has been virtually eliminated from much of the drier northern parts of its range—Arizona and New Mexico in the United States, and extreme northern Sonora state in Mexico—( Johnson and Van Pelt 2016), as well as northern Brazil, the pampas scrub grasslands of Argentina and throughout Uruguay (de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016). In 2002, Jaguars were estimated to occupy only about 46% of its historic range (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). With our improved knowledge of Jaguar range (see the Assessment Rationale and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), this percentage is set at 51% currently.<br/><br/>Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002) defined the most important areas for conservation of viable Jaguar populations (Jaguar Conservation Units or JCUs). These 51 areas cover 44.49 million km², or 49% of Jaguar range according to present calculations.","Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996).

The Jaguar is fully protected at the national level across most of its range, with hunting prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, United States, and Venezuela, and hunting restrictions in place in Guatemala and Peru (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Specific conservation plans for the species have been developed in Mexico, Panama, Honduras, and Brazil. <br/><br/>With habitat fragmentation a major threat, and taxonomic research suggesting little significant differences among Jaguar populations, an ambitious program has been launched to conserve a continuous north to south habitat corridor through the species range (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010).<br/><br/>Addressing livestock management and animals that prey on livestock is a high priority for conservation efforts in many Jaguar range countries due to the impact of retaliatory killing of Jaguars and other predators.<br/><br/><strong><u>Jaguar Conservation Actions</u><br/></strong>The following is a list of actions that a variety of Jaguar range countries have put in place to enhance Jaguar conservation. <br/><ol><li>Respond to reports of livestock depredation, and provide advice and assistance to improve livestock management practices, thereby reducing depredation and associated retaliatory killings of Jaguars; </li><li>Understand and address the hunting of Jaguar prey for sport, commercial and subsistence uses, and raise awareness about the laws governing the hunting of wildlife and the need for adopting sustainable hunting practices;</li><li>Monitor and safe-guarding Jaguar core populations, Jaguar Conservation Units, or JCUs (see Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010);</li><li>Maintain national and regional population connectivity through the identification of corridors for Jaguar movement between JCUs and applying conservation actions in those corridors through the engagement of corridor stakeholders as in the development of a Conservation Action Plan for the Central Belize Corridor (Kay <em>et al.</em> 2015);</li><li>Develop national, regional and local monitoring programs for Jaguars and their prey.</li></ol>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The rate of decline is probably underestimated because a period of only 25 years was considered and other sources of non-natural mortality, including other fisheries, were not incorporated into the analysis. The causes of the suspected population decline have not ceased. On the contrary, fishing effort has increased, at least in some areas in Brazil. In 2012, the Brazilian Government established regulations for gillnet fisheries that included maximum allowable net lengths and several categories of no-fishing areas. However, there is evidence that the level of Franciscana mortality in southern and southeastern Brazil remains high. The numbers of Franciscanas killed in Brazil in gillnets and found washed ashore each year remains in the order of several hundred which is not different from the numbers observed in years that preceded the regulations (e.g., Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2016; Cremer <em>et al.</em> 2016, E.R. Secchi, unpubl. data). The bycatch is also high in Uruguay and Argentina, where estimates of annual mortality are a few hundred Franciscanas (Capozzo <em>et al.</em> 2007, Negri <em>et al.</em> 2012, Szephegyi <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/></p>","Although sometimes described as a ‘river dolphin’, the Franciscana does not occur in freshwater habitats. The species is generally found in turbid coastal waters, but also inhabits clear waters as well as marine areas associated with islands and rocky shores (Pinedo <em>et al</em>. 1989, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2009). Franciscanas are found mainly in the marine environment and only occasionally in estuaries (Santos <em>et al</em>. 2009) and one inland bay (Cremer and Simões-Lopes 2008). They are relatively common in the Uruguayan part of the La Plata River estuary (Praderi 1986). Franciscanas are primarily coastal, inhabiting waters beyond the surf zone and out to the 30 or 50 m isobath, depending on the region. For example, in FMAs III and IV they occur in waters up to 50 m deep (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2010), while in FMAs I and II they appear to be restricted to waters inshore of the 25 or 30 m isobath. Franciscana density decreases with distance from the coast, although the rate and degree of the decrease vary according the width of the continental shelf (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, D. Danilewicz, unpub. data).<br/><br/>Franciscanas apparently do not migrate, although seasonal inshore–offshore movements have been documented in some areas (Bordino <em>et al</em>. 1999, Bordino 2002). Movements of 70-90 km along the coastline have been recorded for satellite-tagged individuals in Argentina (Wells <em>et al</em>. 2013). Predation by both large sharks and Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) has been documented (Praderi 1985, Ott and Danilewicz 1996, Santos and Netto 2005).<br/><br/>Franciscanas feed on several species of shallow-water fish (e.g., sciaenids, engraulids, gadids, batrachoids, trichiurids and carangids), cephalopods, and crustaceans (Brownell 1989, Di Beneditto and Ramos 2001, Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2002, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002, Troina <em>et al</em>. 2016). Their coastal marine habitat is typically characterized by continental run-off with high discharge of high-nutrient river flows (e.g., Patos Lagoon [Lagoa dos Patos] in RS and the La Plata River [Río de la Plata] in Argentina and Uruguay). Juvenile sciaenids, the most important prey of Franciscanas, are typically associated with continental runoff and the influence of subtropical shelf waters (Crespo 2009).","The main threat to the species is incidental mortality in gillnet fisheries (there are no reports of direct exploitation of Franciscanas), which has been observed since at least the mid 1960s (Van Erp 1969). In the 1960s, the bycatch in Uruguay alone (at two villages) was as high as 1,500-2,000 animals (Brownell and Ness 1969, Pilleri 1971), but changes in the fisheries’ target species resulted in a significant decrease in the bycatch in the 1980s (Crespo <em>et al.</em> 1986, Praderi 1997). Bycatch estimates in the early 2000s totaled at least 2,900 animals per year in all management stocks combined (e.g., Ott <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b), but these numbers are thought to be underestimated to an unknown extent, primarily due to: (1) captures in other non-monitored types of fisheries (e.g., active gillnetting, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 1997; trawling, Szephegyi <em>et al.</em> 2015); (2) under-reporting of bycatch by fishermen; and (3) dolphins captured sometimes falling from the net during retrieval (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b). Annual bycatch is believed to be higher in FMA III with estimates of 1,300 animals/year (Ott <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003b, 2004) and much higher in some years (Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013), followed by FMA IV: 500-800 individuals/year (Bordino and Albareda 2005), FMA II: &gt; 700 /year (Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2002, IWC 2005), and FMA Ib: &gt; 110/year (Di Beneditto 2003). These annual mortality estimates suggest that bycatch levels continue to be unsustainable (Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2012; Crespo <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zerbini <em>et al.</em> 2010, Prado <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/> <br/> Stomach contents of Franciscanas from Rio Grande do Sul have included many kinds of debris: discarded fishing gear such as pieces of nylon net (17% of 36 stomachs), ""cellophane"" (or some other type of synthetic packaging material), and plastic fragments (6%) (Bassoi 1997). This problem has also been reported in northern Argentina, where cellophane, fishing debris, and plastic were found in 45%, 32% and 16% of the examined stomachs, respectively (Bastida <em>et al</em>. 2000, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002). The effects of such debris ingestion on health status of individual Franciscanas have not been assessed, and the subpopulation or population-level implications are uncertain. Debris ingestion is a new threat that did not exist, at least in Uruguay, in the early 1970s (R.L. Brownell, Jr., pers. comm., August 2017).<br/> <br/> Other known or potential threats include various forms of habitat degradation (e.g., overfishing; destruction of the benthic community and bycatch of small sciaenid fish—main Franciscana prey—by trawling; and chemical and acoustic pollution) (e.g., Bassoi and Secchi 2000, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2002, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2002, Laílson-Brito <em>et al</em>. 2007, Yogui <em>et al.</em> 2010, Holz 2014).","Based on genetic, morphological, distribution, and population parameters, Secchi <em>et al</em>. (2003a) proposed four provisional management units (Franciscana Management Areas, or FMAs) with the following ranges:&#160; FMA I - coastal waters of Espírito Santo (ES) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) States, Brazil; FMA II - São Paulo (SP), Paraná (PR), and Santa Catarina (SC) States, Brazil; FMA III - coastal waters of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, southern Brazil, and Uruguay; and FMA IV - coastal waters of Argentina, including the provinces of Buenos Aires and Rio Negro (only occasional in as far south as Chubut).<br/><br/>Since the study of Secchi <em>et al</em>. (2003a), new genetic and morphological data have indicated the potential for subpopulation structure throughout the range of the Franciscana (Lázaro <em>et al</em>. 2004; Mendez <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010; Véras 2011; Barbato <em>et al</em>. 2012; Costa-Urrutia <em>et al</em>. 2012; Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014; Negri <em>et al</em>. 2015; Gariboldi <em>et al</em>. 2015; Ott <em>et al</em>. 2015), leading to the development of new sub-divisions within each FMA (Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, because (1) the degree of differentiation within the various FMAs was highly variable, (2) some studies were based only on mitochondrial DNA data, and (3) there is currently no consensus on threshold levels of gene flow above which management units should be adopted, recent refinements in Franciscana subpopulation structure were limited to regions where the greatest levels of genetic difference were observed (Anonymous 2015). In this sense, FMA I was considered an Evolutionarily Significant Unit and split into two distinct management units (FMA Ia and FMA Ib, Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014), a division also supported by well-known gaps in the distribution of the species, one between SP and RJ and another in ES (Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2012). In addition, the boundary between FMA II and FMA III was moved about 250 km to the north and currently lies at the central coast of SC State (Ott, 2002, Véras 2011, Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ott <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>There is no range-wide abundance estimate for the species, but estimates have been calculated for a portion or the whole of individual FMAs. <br/><ul><li>Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. (2012) conducted aerial surveys in ES (FMA Ia) and RJ (FMA Ib) in 2011. No on-effort sightings were recorded in FMA Ia, despite relatively large survey effort, suggesting that the population of Franciscanas in ES is small, a hypothesis further supported by the very low genetic diversity of this stock (Cunha <em>et al</em>. 2014). Abundance of Franciscanas in FMA Ib was estimated at nearly 2,000 individuals (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.46), indicating that this is the smallest and the one with the lowest density among all FMAs for which estimates are available. <br/></li><li>Abundance in FMA II was estimated at 8,500 individuals (CV 0.34) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2010) in 2008/9. This estimate is considered to be biased low because habitat offshore of the 30 m isobath was not surveyed. Within FMA II, there are also abundance estimates for Baia da Babitonga (Babitonga Bay) in SC, where a possibly isolated population of Franciscanas occurs (Cremer <em>et al</em>. 2012). Boat-based line transect surveys estimated 50 animals in the early 2000s (CV 0.29, Cremer and Simões-Lopes 2008) and 55 individuals in 2011 (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2011), indicating no evidence for a change in the number of Franciscanas within Babitonga Bay over a 10-year period.</li><li>Recent surveys in FMA III have been conducted only within the Brazilian portion (RS State) and the estimates were 6,800 (CV 0.32) in 2004 (Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2010) and nearly 10,000 dolphins (CV 0.20) in 2014 (D. Danilewicz <em>et al</em>., unpub. data). Because the survey methods and data analysis between these two estimates differed, it is not appropriate to conclude that the higher estimate in 2014 represents an increase in abundance in RS. Surveys to estimate Franciscana abundance have never been conducted in Uruguay. <br/></li><li>Aerial surveys conducted in Argentina (FMA IV) in 2003-2004 estimated a population of nearly 15,000 individuals (CV 0.42, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010). This estimate is believed to be negatively biased because it was not corrected for perception bias and because density estimated for offshore areas (depths greater than 30 m) was not extrapolated to non-surveyed areas.</li></ul>Population viability analysis using estimates of abundance, fisheries-related incidental mortality, and rates of population growth from the early 2000s suggested that levels of bycatch were not sustainable in all FMAs and that Franciscanas in FMAs II, III and IV would decline by at least 30% in 25 years (Secchi and Fletcher 2004, Secchi 2006). These analyses led to the previous Red List classification of the Franciscana as Vulnerable. The modelling exercise conducted by Secchi and Fletcher (2004) and Secchi (2006) is considered to underestimate the risk of decline of Franciscanas, because estimates of bycatch were believed to be biased low in some areas. In fact, most recent data on bycatch (see the <em>Threats</em> section below) indicate that the numbers caught annually in FMAs II and IV are roughly twice as high (e.g., Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bordino and Albareda 2004, IWC 2005) as the values used in the projections by Secchi (2006). Abundance estimates obtained from the mid 2000s to early 2010s suggest that bycatch levels are still unsustainable in FMAs Ib, II, and IV where the annual removals range from 3-6% of the estimated population sizes (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2010, Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2010, Danilewicz <em>et al</em>. 2012). There are no estimates of bycatch or abundance for Franciscanas in FMA Ia.",Decreasing,"Franciscanas inhabit shallow coastal waters (and they sporadically enter the estuary of the La Plata River [Rio de la Plata]) of subtropical and temperate regions of the western South Atlantic Ocean (Crespo 2009, Secchi 2014). They are found only along the east coast of South America (Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina), from the northern Golfo San Matias, central Argentina (<em>ca</em> 42°10'S), to Espírito Santo, southeastern Brazil (18°25'S) (Siciliano 1994, Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species is not distributed continuously throughout its range. Surveys (including beach and aerial surveys, museum specimens, interviews with local people) indicate that Franciscanas are extremely rare or absent in two northern areas: (1) between central and southern Rio de Janeiro State comprising nearly 300 km of coastline and (2) in southern Espírito Santo State comprising approximately 150 km of coastline (Azevedo <em>et al</em>. 2002, Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2012). The reasons for these gaps are unclear, but the species’ preference for shallow and productive waters (Brownell 1989, Pinedo <em>et al</em>. 1989, Danilewicz <em>et al.</em> 2009) suggests that depth and the narrowness of the continental shelf influence habitat selection (Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2002).",,Marine,The Franciscana is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Key patches for sustainable populations of Andean Bears were defined as areas larger than 400 km² and within 15 km of the nearest patch (Verboom <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2001, Velez-Liendo 2014). At the national level, Venezuela showed the greatest projected loss of key patches (70%), with only two of these key patches available to sustain its bear population. Peru, Colombia and Ecuador are projected to lose 31%, 29% and 27% respectively, and Bolivia 19%. Causes of this loss of key patch habitat is associated with human development activities that have not ceased, and in some areas may increase by allowing oil exploration and exploitation within some protected areas. Expansion of the agricultural frontier, inadequate agricultural practices and land/agrarian reforms; mining and oil exploitation, conversion of land to coca crops and the drug trade, have been the main drivers of the loss and degradation of Andean bear habitat (Ataroff and Rada 2000, Palminteri <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2001, Armenteras <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2003, 2011; Rodríguez <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Yerena <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em><span lang=""EN-US"">. 2007, Velez-Liendo 2010, Dávalos <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2011, García-Rangel 2012, Portillo-Quintero <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sánchez-Mercado <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2014). Three main data sources were used to map these human intrusions on Andean Bear habitat: disturbed areas (roads, settlements, agriculture fields, etc.) from Josse <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> (2009), forest cover loss derived from satellite imagery for the period 2000-2013 (Hansen <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2013) and 8 years (2000-2008) of fire activities from MODIS Rapid Response System data sets (<a href=""http://modis-fire.umd.edu/index.php"">http://modis-fire.umd.edu/index.php</a>) (Velez-Liendo 2010;<span lang=""EN-US""> <span lang=""EN-US"">note: data and imagery were from LANCE FIRMS operated by the NASA/GSFC/Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) with funding provided by NASA/HQ<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">).<br/> <br/> Furthermore, as a consequence of habitat loss, human-bear conflicts are likely to increase resulting in reduced tolerance and escalating bear kills (Goldstein <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2006; Sánchez-Mercado <span lang=""EN-US""><em>et al</em>.<span lang=""EN-US""> 2008, 2014; García-Rangel 2012; Zukowsky and Ormsby 2016). Thus, even where a habitat patch is of sufficient size to maintain a bear population, human-caused mortality is likely to reduce bear density.<br/> <br/> Climate change projections for 2010-2039 by Tovar <em>et al</em>. (2013) indicate that all ecosystems inhabited by Andean Bears will exhibit a degree of loss: 30% loss for Tropical high altitude grasslands, 24% for Tropical dry and moist shrublands, and 18% for Tropical moist lowland and montane forests. Based on the current state of the Andean Bear’s habitat, the fact that many threats causing reduction and degradation of Andean Bear ecosystems have not ceased, and projected patterns of biodiversity shift caused by climate change, the species is vulnerable to widespread future decline.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Andean Bear species’ experts in the Bear Specialist Group considered all of these threats and provided estimates of rates of decline.&#160; Experts estimated rates of decline of &gt;30% for each of the five range countries in the next 30 years and also in a 30-year time window overlapping the present (2000–2030). This qualifies the species for Vulnerable, under criteria A3 and A4. There is also a reasonable likelihood that the global population consists of &lt;10,000 mature adults (given a total population of &lt;20,000 bears), a condition under criteria C1, but since the rate of future population decline is only suspected based on rates of habitat loss or alteration, the nature of the evidence is insufficient (i.e., not directly estimated) to categorize the species under C1.<br/></p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></span></p>","<p>Andean Bear altitudinal range extends from 200 to 4,750 m above sea level, with an area of occupancy covering approximately 260,000 km²<sup> </sup>along the Tropical Andes. The lower limit is on the Western Peruvian range; the upper limit is within Carrasco National Park in Bolivia (Peyton 1980, 1984, 1999; Goldstein 1990, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sánchez-Mercado 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Velez-Liendo 2010, García-Rangel 2012, Appleton <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> The species inhabits a great variety of ecosystems along the Tropical Andes including Tropical dry forests, Tropical moist lowland and montane forests; Tropical dry and moist shrublands, and Tropical high altitude shrubland and grasslands (García-Rangel 2012). Seasonal shifts in habitat use due to changes in food availability have been reported (Peyton 1980, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Velez-Liendo 1999, Paisley 2001, Cuesta <em>et al.</em> 2003, Troya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2006, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009). Andean bears are mostly found in Tropical moist forests and Tropical high-altitude grasslands (Peyton 1980, 1987a, 1987b, 1999; Velez-Liendo 1999, Cuesta <em>et al</em>. 2003, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sánchez-Mercado 2008), but it remains unclear whether bears can live entirely in high-altitude grasslands and paramo without access to forested areas (Paisley and Garshelis 2006). In the north coast of Peru, Andean bears inhabit a Tropical dry shrubland (Peyton 1999, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, García-Rangel 2012, Appleton <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> Andean bears are omnivorous and have a suite of physical adaptations for this life style (McLellan and Reiner 1994, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004, Christiansen and Wroe 2007, Christiansen 2008). Anatomical skull and dentition adaptations to grind (Christiansen 2008) and a pseudo-thumb (Salesa <em>et al</em>. 2006) to aid in consuming a diet of fibrous, hard vegetative matter. Andean bears also opportunistically prey on mammals, including rabbits and mountain tapirs (Castellanos 2011a), but most notably free-ranging domestic cattle (Goldstein 1990, 2002; Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991; Peyton 1999; Cuesta and Suárez 2001; Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004; Goldstein <em>et al.</em> 2006; Christiansen and Wroe 2007; Christiansen 2008; Torres 2008; Figueroa and Stucchi 2009; García-Rangel 2012). Bromeliads and palm trees constitute the most common food items in the diet of Andean Bears across the majority of their range (Peyton 1980, Goldstein 1990, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Goldstein and Salas 1993, Troya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Rivadeneria-Canedo 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2009, García-Rangel 2012). On a seasonal basis, fruits are key food sources for the species as they provide carbohydrates, protein and fat necessary to balance their diet (Peyton 1980, 1984, Goldstein 1990, Rodríguez-Rodríguez and Cadena 1991, Rivadeneira-Canedo 2001, Troya <em>et al</em>. 2004, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <br/> Andean Bears are excellent climbers and commonly build tree platforms where they rest, feed on fruits and carcasses, as well as guard feeding areas (Peyton 1980, 1984; Goldstein 1990, 1991, 2002; Torres 2008, García-Rangel 2012). Activity patterns are mainly diurnal, but they vary seasonally and between geographic areas (Paisley 2001, Paisley and Garshelis 2006, Castellanos 2011b). As food is available all year-round in most parts of their range, Andean bears do not hibernate (Peyton 1999, Garshelis 2009). Information on reproduction is limited for Andean Bears and has mainly come from captive individuals (Bloxam 1977, Rosenthal 1988, Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, Spady <em>et al</em>. 2007, García-Rangel 2012, Enciso and Guimarães 2013).<br/> <br/> The species is polyestrous, a facultative seasonal breeder and experiences delayed implantation (Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, Spady <em>et al</em>. 2007). In captivity, females show three to four oestrous cycles during a single breeding season with no seasonal ovarian activity (Enciso and Guimarães 2013). Mating has been recorded in the wild at various times of year but peaking between March and October (Peyton 1980, Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998). Litter size varies from one to four, with twins being most common, and may be related to female weight and hence food abundance (Saporiti 1949, Bloxam 1977, Peyton 1980, Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007, García-Rangel 2012). Field observations in Bolivia (Velez-Liendo 1999) suggested that births occur two to three months before the peak of the fruit season, perhaps to allow mothers to leave the den with their cubs when fruits are abundant (Peyton 1980, Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998, Velez-Liendo 1999, Velez-Liendo and Paisley 2010). In captivity, time of birth varies with latitude but births usually occur from February to September (Garshelis 2004, Claro-Hergueta <em>et al</em>. 2007).</p>","<p>                   </p><p><strong>Habitat Loss</strong><br/> The Tropical Andes has been home to human communities, including the great Inca Empire, for thousands of years and, as a consequence, 90% of Andean ecosystems have been transformed in some way (Young 1998, 2009; Vina and Cavelier 1999; Ataroff and Rada 2000; Myers <em>et al</em>. 2000; Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Armenteras <em>et al</em>. 2011). The expansion of the agricultural frontier, together with inadequate agricultural practices and land/agrarian reforms, have been the main drivers of the loss of natural ecosystems (Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998, Yerena 1998, Young 1998, Vina and Cavelier 1999, Ataroff and Rada 2000, Armenteras <em>et al</em>. 2011, Portillo-Quintero <em>et al</em>. 2012). Mining and oil exploitation are becoming an increasing menace not only to bears, but to local communities due to land expropriation, loss of habitat connectivity, and contamination of water and soil (Young and León 1999, Bury 2002, Bebbington <em>et al</em>. 2008, Bebbington 2009). Conversion of land to coca crops and the drug trade, together with guerrilla groups in some parts of the Andes, favours a lawless land-use system that also impacts the quality of Andean Bear habitats and the bear's probability of long-term survival (Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007, Dávalos <em>et al.</em> 2011, García-Rangel 2012).<br/> <br/> <strong>Illegal Killing</strong><br/> Illegal killing is an important, but underestimated threat for Andean Bears. Based on a review of the literature, an average of about 180 bears are known to be killed per year across its range—it is suspected that the real number is much higher, and is likely increasing. For example, recent assessments in northern Ecuador showed unprecedented numbers of cattle killed by bears (at least 320 during the period 2009-2014; Zukowski and Ormsby 2016), as more people are turning to dairy cow farming as a livelihood (Jampel 2016). Bears are killed for retaliation against crop or livestock depredations (or protection against future depredations), for cultural or medical beliefs, and for commercial trade (Orejuela and Jorgenson 1999, Peyton 1999, Rumiz and Salazar 1999, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007, Figueroa 2008, Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Lameda 2011, E.D. Rodríguez pers. comm. 2014, M.P. Viteri pers. comm. 2014). Since the number of bears killed is likely underestimated by a wide margin, the effects of such killing on bear populations is hard to assess, but rates of killing are high in some areas. Sanchez-Mercado <em>et al.</em> (2008, 2014) estimated that up to 36% of the bear’s distribution in the Cordillera de Merida in Venezuela was within an “ecological trap”, due to human threats. These authors estimated that the effects of this threat combined with habitat fragmentation could be fostering an extinction probability higher than 50% over the next 50 years across this mountain range. Bears are killed during opportunistic encounters, while sport hunting, or as retaliation after damaging crops, particularly maize, or killing livestock (Goldstein 1991, 2002; Peyton 1999, Poveda 1999, Morales Vargas 2003, Goldstein <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2008, Torres 2008).<br/> <br/> <strong>Climate Change</strong><br/> Global projections of effects of climate change show a general tendency towards upslope displacement of the mountain biome, suggesting that the Tropical Andes is among the most vulnerable region to climate change (Malcom <em>et al</em>. 2006, Urrutia and Vuille 2009, Beaumont <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, the heterogeneity of this hotspot shows a more complex response (Tovar <em>et al</em>. 2013) affecting phenological patterns and increasing species vulnerability with predictions of species loss ranging from 20-50% due to range contractions for many taxa (Cuesta-Camacho <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lawler <em>et al</em>. 2009, Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 2011, Graham <em>et al.</em> 2011, Hoffmann and Sgrò 2011, Chen <em>et al.</em> 2011, Velásquez-Tibatá <em>et al.</em> 2013, Richardson <em>et al.</em> 2013, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p> It is likely that all ecosystems associated with Andean Bears will exhibit reductions in their extension. With an increment of +0.74 C in the last century, and a projected increase of 4.3 +/- 0.7 C by 2100 (IPCC 2013), extensive changes in habitat are expected: the Tropical high altitude grasslands is the most fragile ecosystem, with an estimated loss of 30% (Tovar <em>et al.</em> 2013) due to the lack of upslope area for migration. Projected reduction in annual rainfall (IPCC 2013) is likely to affect species highly dependent on humidity such as epiphytic bromeliads (Colwell <em>et al</em>. 2008, Svenning and Condit, 2008, Tewsksbury <em>et al.</em> 2008). Tropical dry and moist shrublands are likely to lose 24% of their area (Tovar <em>et al</em>. 2013), mainly due to a significant variation in the number of dry months (IPCC 2013), while a loss of 18% in area was estimated for Tropical moist lowland and montane forests and Tropical dry forests due to upslope displacements. Furthermore, the extensive (and intensive) land use by human activities in Paramo grasslands, are likely to encroach even further, affecting not only the biodiversity associated to this ecosystem, but also the ecosystem services this biome provides to the region.<br/> <br/> Changes in climate regimes must therefore be considered as a growing threat for Andean Bears, as they are likely to alter habitat quality as well as land-use patterns, and increase the probability of human–bear encounters and conflict (Karanth and Chellam 2009, Aguirre <em>et al.</em> 2011, Hoffmann and Sgrò 2011, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sheridan and Bickford 2011, Mysterud 2013, Ripple <em>et al.</em> 2014). Even more, the areas considered to be most vulnerable to climate change across the Andes are those considered important for Andean bears including: Yanachaga Chemillen National Park (NP) (Peru), Manu NP (Peru), Madidi NP (Bolivia), Apolobamba ANMI (Bolivia), Carrasco NP (Bolivia) and Amboro NP (Bolivia) (Hoffman <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>Expert knowledge, data extrapolations, genetic analysis, mark-recapture, radio tracking and sign surveys, as well as ecological modelling have been used to estimate population sizes and densities of Andean Bears (Peyton 1984, 1999; Yerena 1994; Peyton <em>et al</em>. 1998; Cuesta and Suárez 2001; Ruiz-García 2003; Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Viteri 2007; Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2007; Velez-Liendo 2010; Garshelis 2011; García-Rangel 2012). Wild populations are believed to be on decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and illegal killing (Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2008, Velez-Liendo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Velez-Liendo and Paisley 2010, García-Rangel 2012). National assessments applying different approaches estimated 1,100-1,600 bears in Venezuela (Ruiz-García 2003), 3,000-6,000 in Colombia (Ruiz-García 2003), 1,200-2,000 in Ecuador (Cuesta and Suárez 2001, Viteri 2007), ~5,000 bears in Peru (Peyton 1999), and ~3,000 bears in Bolivia (Velez-Liendo 2010). These rather crude countrywide estimates, yielding a range-wide estimate of 13,000-18,000 bears (5-7 bears/100 km² over its 260,000 km² range), are reasonably consistent with three empirically-derived mark-recapture (re-sight) density estimates of 3-8 bears/100 km² (Viteri 2007, Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2007, S. Molina, pers. comm). It should be cautioned, however, that all abundance and density estimates for this species have known biases, so consistency among the estimates is not verification of their accuracy (Garshelis 2011).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Andean Bear is the only extant bear species in South America and is endemic to the Tropical Andes (Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004; Ríos-Uzeda <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2007; Viteri 2007; Viteri and Waits 2009; García-Rangel 2012). The distribution of this species is long (<em>ca</em> 4,600 km) and narrow (<em>ca</em> 200-650 km) in the mountains from Venezuela to Bolivia (Peyton <em>et al.</em> 1998, Yerena 1998, Peyton 1999, Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004). From North to South, Andean bears are found in Sierra de Perijá and Cordillera de Mérida in Venezuela; the Occidental, Central, and Oriental Andean mountain ranges of Colombia; both Eastern and Western slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes; across the three Peruvian Andean mountain ranges, including a portion of the North Pacific coastal desert; and in the Eastern slope of the Tropical Andes in Bolivia (García-Rangel 2012). The possible presence of the bear in Panama was reported by Hershkovitz (1957), but recent surveys in the area did not find evidence to support this claim (Goldstein <em>et al.</em> 2008). Recently, presence of Andean bears in Northern Argentina has been confirmed by Cosse <em>et al</em>. (2014) through genetics. However, given that these presence points are up to 300 km south (straight line) of the known most-southerly population in Bolivia, they may represent vagrant individuals rather than resident populations.</p>",<p>Some bears are killed for cultural and medical purposes.

A total of 58 protected areas have been established across the Andean Bear distribution, but threats remain within their boundaries with most of these areas being no more than “Paper Parks” lacking adequate budget and staff (Hardner 2008; Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2008; Monsalve Dam <em>et al</em>. 2010; García-Rangel 2011, 2012). Although efforts to establish, maintain and connect old and new protected areas along the bear’s range have been carried out (e.g., Vilcabamba-Amboro corridor between Peru and Bolivia and the interconnected system of protected areas in the Venezuela Andes), large portions of the bear’s habitat are still unprotected and poaching has not been controlled (Yerena 1994, 1998;Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2003, Kattan <em>et al</em>. 2004, Surkin <em>et al</em>. 2010, Yerena and García-Rangel 2010, Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 2011, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2014). Recently (2007-2014), a number of important steps towards Andean Bear conservation have been undertaken across its distribution including: (1) promotion of Andean Bear conservation by local education programmes and research projects carried out by conservation groups, NGOs, zoological parks, universities, research institutes and government agencies in Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela (Figueroa and Stucchi 2009, Albarracín 2010, García-Rangel 2012). (2) The publication of national action plans for Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador (Sánchez-Mercado 2008, Castellanos <em>et al</em>. 2010, Monsalve Dam <em>et al</em>. 2010), and a national assessment for Bolivia (Velez-Liendo, <em>et al</em>. 2009). Unfortunately priority actions highlighted by some of these programs have not been undertaken. Such is the case for the three key areas identified for connectivity conservation within the Venezuelan Action Plan (Yerena <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Knowledge regarding the species ecology has improved, with information about home range sizes, movement patterns and population sizes for some locations in Peru, Ecuador and Colombia (Rodríguez <em>et al</em>. 2003, Monsalve Dam <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sánchez-Mercado <em>et al</em>. 2010, García-Rangel 2012). Nevertheless, in order to develop robust conservation actions, further efforts regarding population sizes and limiting factors are required. Current and future research need to focus on populations, habitat and connectivity, human dimensions, and climate change effects on both the ecology of the species and human-bear conflict               (Rodríguez <em>et al.</em> 2003, Jorgenson and Sandoval 2005, Yerena <em>et al.</em> 2007, Monsalve Dam <em>et al.</em> 2010, Velez-Liendo and Paisley 2010, García-Rangel 2012).&#160;Finally, it is important to encourage conservation initiatives to focus on a more holistic and creative approach where the needs of the species and the people inhabiting the Andes mountain range are jointly considered (García-Rangel 2012).</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Furthermore, the species meets criterion A for Vulnerable under the subcriteria A2, A3 and A4 because a reduction of at least 30% over three generations (60 years) is suspected in the past (A2), in a time period including both the past and the future (A4), and in the future alone (A3) based primarily on (c) a decline in habitat quality and (d) actual and potential levels of exploitation (in the form of bycatch in nets). In all three cases, the causes of the reduction have not ceased, are not well understood and may be irreversible.</p>  Although the species may not meet any of the criteria for Endangered at this time, it is likely to do so under C2a(i) in the near future because: 1) the number of mature individuals is or will be fewer than 2,500, 2) the reductions in population size either have been or will be large and pervasive enough to cause a net reduction for the entire species of at least 20% over a period of 2 generations, and 3) the number of mature individuals in each subpopulation across the range either is or will be ≤ 250 individuals.","<p>Studies to date indicate that Snubfin Dolphins occur mainly within shallow, protected coastal and estuarine habitats (Parra <em>et al. </em>2002, 2006b; Parra 2006, Allen <em>et al. </em>2012, Palmer <em>et al. </em>2014b, Brown <em>et al. </em>2016). A study conducted in far northern Queensland indicated that Snubfin Dolphins occurred mostly in waters less than 15 m deep, within 10 km of the coast, and no more than 20 km from the nearest river mouth (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006b). In Cleveland Bay, Snubfin Dolphins preferred shallow water &lt; 2 m deep and shallow areas with seagrass beds (Parra 2006). Similarly, in Keppel Bay the dolphins’ core area of use coincided with the Fitzroy River estuary (Cagnazzi <em>et al. </em>2013b). Within this range, Snubfin Dolphins used shallow (2–5 m), shallow subtidal (5–10 m), and moderate-depth (10–15 m) habitat more frequently than expected by chance. In contrast, intertidal (0–2 m) and deeper water (15–20 m) were used less frequently than expected by chance (Cagnazzi <em>et al. </em>2013b). Boat-based surveys conducted between Keppel Bay and Cleveland Bay further strengthen the importance of riverine-estuarine systems to Snubfin Dolphins in Queensland. The only resident population of Snubfin Dolphins along 800 km of coastline between Cleveland Bay and Keppel Bay was found at the mouth of the Proserpine River in the Whitsundays (Cagnazzi 2017). </p>  In the Northern Territory, most records of Snubfin Dolphins are from estuaries, tidal rivers and coastal areas within 20 km of river mouths. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, Snubfin Dolphins occur up to 20 km offshore, likely because of the consistently shallow waters of the Gulf, being less than 10 m deep in many regions 20-30 km offshore. Some Snubfin Dolphins have been recorded up to 30–50 km upstream in larger tidal rivers and at least as far as 10 km offshore (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a,b). Studies in Western Australia also indicate Snubfin Dolphins mainly occur in shallow coastal areas (Brown <em>et al. </em>2016).","<strong>General<br/></strong>The biological features discussed above render the Snubfin Dolphin particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic threatening processes, including habitat degradation and modification, accidental captures in gillnets and shark exclusion devices, direct catches, vessel strikes, noise pollution, chemical pollution, prey depletion, disease and climate change. The impact and extent of anthropogenic threats varies across regions, with some subpopulations facing greater threats than others. The most pervasive threats across the species’ distribution are habitat degradation and modification, incidental capture in fishing gear and shark control nets, water pollution, climate change and the cumulative impact of these threats.<br/><br/><u><strong>Current threats affecting the population now, and likely to affect the population in future</strong></u><br/><br/><em><strong>Habitat degradation and modification<br/></strong></em>Habitat loss and degradation has been identified among the primary drivers of population declines of large marine animals (Lotze and Worm 2009). Habitat degradation and modification consists of human activities associated with land reclamation, dredging, seismic surveys, drilling, blasting, shipping, and resource extraction that can result in habitat loss and degradation for Snubfin Dolphins. These activities are known to cause local changes in the composition, structure, and function of the coastal and estuarine habitats, through direct removal of habitat (seagrass, mangroves), physical disturbance, sedimentation, increasing commercial and recreational vessel traffic, increasing noise and chemical pollution, and introduction of viral and bacterial pathogens. Such stressors, when combined with the continuing intensification of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a result of climate change, and the associated fluctuations in sea levels, are likely to reduce the quality of Snubfin Dolphin habitat. For example, recent extensive diebacks (7,400 ha) of mangrove forests in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia and in Mangrove Bay (40 ha) in north Western Australia were associated with prolonged drought, high temperatures, and a low sea-level event (Duke <em>et al</em>. 2017, Lovelock <em>et al</em>. 2017). The individual, as well as the cumulative, effects of the above threats are a cause of concern for the long-term viability of Australia’s inshore dolphin populations (Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, DOE 2015, Parra and Cagnazzi 2017).<br/><br/>The coastal zone along Snubfin Dolphins’ range, particularly in northwestern Australia and along the central coast of Queensland, has been substantially modified both inland, to allow mining, agricultural and grazing activities, and along the coast to allow industrial ports, marinas, aquaculture and residential developments (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bejder <em>et al</em>. 2012, Queensland Government 2012). For example, by 2020 the port capacity along the coast of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA) is expected to triple to support the predicted growth in Queensland’s annual coal production (Grech <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2015). IUCN considered this unprecedented scale of development as a serious threat to biodiversity in the GBRWHA (Douvere and Badman 2012).<br/><br/>Activities associated with coastal development, such as land reclamation, vessel traffic and construction, may result in the physical loss and degradation of habitat for cetaceans (Jefferson et al. 2009, Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013). The reduction of suitable habitat may force local populations of Snubfin Dolphins to adjust to the remaining resources through a reduction in survival rate and population size, or emigration to more suitable (though probably suboptimal) areas (Andren 1994, Fahrig 1997, Jefferson 2000). Dredging involved in the construction, maintenance and expansion of ports is of particular concern (Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Todd <em>et al</em>. 2015). Because most ports across the Snubfin Dolphins’ range are located in relatively shallow waters, they all require large volumes of dredging. For example, the Gladstone Western Basin project in Queensland involved the dredging of 22 million cubic meters of soil (Ports Australia 2014).<br/><br/>In addition to their impacts on dolphin habitat, these activities may disturb cetaceans through physical displacement and increased underwater noise (Jensen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pirotta <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rako <em>et al</em>. 2013). For example, in the Fitzroy River, Queensland, it was estimated that two proposed port developments would have overlapped with 14% (49 km²) of the representative range and 17.7% (41 km²) of the core area used by Snubfin Dolphins (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). The impacted area likely would have been substantially larger considering the indirect effects of the construction activities on the nearby habitats and the long-term consequences of daily operating activities on the entire area as result of seabed ‘reclamation’, percussive pile driving, dredging, increased vessel traffic and a decline in water quality (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<br/><br/>Additionally, habitat loss and fragmentation from coastal zone developments and associated activities can influence the population genetic structure of biological populations through their isolation (Keyghobadi 2007). Given the low densities, population genetic structure and limited gene flow found among populations of Snubfin Dolphins, a further loss of genetic variation may reduce the ability of individuals to adapt to a changing environment, cause inbreeding depression (reduced survival and reproduction) and increase their probability of extinction (Dixon <em>et al</em>. 2007, Andrews 2014, Brown <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>Incidental capture</em></strong><br/>Entanglement or bycatch of dolphins in recreational and commercial fishing gear is one of the most serious threats to marine mammal populations and species around the world (Read <em>et a</em>l. 2006, Read 2008). Snubfin Dolphins are susceptible to entanglement, especially in gillnets, which are often found closer to the mouths of rivers, creeks and estuaries where Snubfin Dolphins are more likely to be found (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parra and Jedensjö 2009). Snubfin Dolphins have been killed in localized areas along the east coast of Queensland in anti-shark nets set to protect bathers (Heinsohn 1979, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) has been in operation since the early 1960s across many Queensland beaches, using nets, drum lines, or a combination of both to reduce the perceived risk of shark attack. Between 1967 and 1987, 520 dolphins were caught in Queensland shark nets. The Snubfin Dolphin was the most frequently bycaught species in nets north of Mackay (Paterson 1990) with the maximum average of about 10 Snubfin Dolphins per year (assuming that all dolphins caught were Snubfin). In 1992, following the introduction of new methods to minimise by-catch, the number of Snubfin Dolphins caught in the shark nets between 1992 and 1995 declined to a maximum of 1.3 per year (Gribble <em>et al</em>. 1998). At present, 13 shark nets and 149 drum lines are operating in Queensland. Between 1997 and 2011, a total of 11 Snubfin Dolphins were caught in the QSCP corresponding to about 1.8 per year (Meager <em>et al</em>. 2012). Most captures of Snubfin Dolphins in shark nets occurred in the Cairns, Townsville, and Mackay areas, suggesting the potential for local stock depletion (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Snubfin Dolphins are also known to die in inshore gillnets set across creeks, rivers and shallow estuaries (Hale 1997, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002). In southern Papua New Guinea bycatch in gillnet fisheries and at least occasional direct catches (of which there are anecdotal records, Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2017) are considered the most significant threats to Snubfin Dolphins. During a 15-day field trip to the Kikori Delta in 2015, five Snubfin Dolphins were confirmed as having been bycaught in large-mesh gillnets (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although it is impossible to estimate the magnitude of Snubfin Dolphin bycatch throughout the species’ range, it is clear that even small numbers are unsustainable and would result in rapid local population declines.<br/><br/><strong><em>Water pollution and climate change</em></strong><br/>Sources of anthropogenic contaminants are likely to increase in the future across northern Australia, as a result of the widespread use of several new pesticides (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012), increasing annual runoff (Chiew and McMahon 2002), and rapid urban and industrial development. The water discharge by many rivers across the Snubfin Dolphin’s range in Australia is of poor quality, often with contaminant concentrations expected to cause environmental harm (Francey <em>et al</em>. 2010, Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2012, Schaffelke <em>et al</em>. 2012). Accordingly, a recent study detected high levels of organochlorines (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in biopsies collected from Snubfin Dolphins on the Great Barrier Reef along the Queensland coast (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Although exposure to contaminants may not directly cause the death of an animal, it may affect its health in numerous ways, including increased susceptibility to disease and impairment of metabolic functions (De Swart <em>et al</em>. 1996, Bossart 2011).<br/><br/>In Queensland, floods normally exceed their natural ranges of variation due to inland catchment modifications that result in large amounts of fresh water discharge, sediment, heavy metals, nutrients and pesticides being discharged into the estuary and adjacent coastal areas (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2003, Furnas 2003). The effects of a flood on dolphins generally are temporary until natural conditions are re-established (Fury and Harrison 2011). However, it has been suggested that peaks in dolphin mortality (Holyoake <em>et al</em>. 2009, Meager and Limpus 2014), such as those recorded in Queensland in 2011 (DEHP 2012), occur when floods are sustained for long periods. Modelling studies estimated that the annual runoff in catchments on the east coast of Australia could increase by up to 15% by the year 2030 (Chiew and McMahon 2002). Altered coastal conditions and projected increases in cyclone severity, floods, storm surges, and sea surface temperature could affect dolphin habitat and food resources (Lawler <em>et al</em>. 2007, Meager and Limpus 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>Cumulative impacts</em></strong><br/>The ongoing alteration of coastal systems has greatly undermined the resilience of many biotic communities, populations, and species living in estuaries, making them more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity and anthropogenic stressors (Hobday and Lough 2011). Such effects are likely to be exacerbated when natural systems are subjected to multiple stressors as a result of cumulative impacts and negative synergistic interactions (Venter et al. 2006, Crain et al. 2008, Halpern et al. 2008). Recent studies on other inshore dolphin populations living in highly industrialized regions have reported negative population trends. In the Pearl River estuary, China, modelling of demographic data suggested that Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins (<em>Sousa chinensis</em>) have declined at about 2.4% per year (Huang <em>et al</em>. 2012), in the Yangtze River the population of Yangtze Finless Porpoises (<em>Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis</em>) has been declining at a rate of about 6% per year (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2012), while in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, the local isolated Bottlenose Dolphin (<em>Tursiops </em>sp.) population declined by about 30% over a 12-year period (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2007). By analogy, a reduction in the number of Snubfin Dolphins is likely given the multiple impacts of port expansion, development projects, water pollution, vessel traffic and increasing frequency of natural catastrophic events.","<strong>Population Abundance<br/></strong>At present, there is no range-wide estimate of the abundance of Snubfin Dolphins. Estimates of abundance from mark-recapture studies of photo-identified individuals are only available for a few selected populations across Australia (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Available abundance estimates indicate that Snubfin Dolphins occur in small populations of typically fewer than 150 individuals. Places where abundance has been estimated in Queensland include Cleveland Bay (310 km²) with estimates ranging from 64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 51-80) to 76 (95% CI 65-88) (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a) and Keppel Bay with estimates of 71 (95% CI 61-80) to 80 (95% CI 68-93) (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Available abundance estimates in the Northern Territory are of 19 (18-20) to 70 (49-90) in the Darwin region (1,086 km²) (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2017) and 136 (95% CI 58-317) to 222 (95% CI 146-336) in Port Essington (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2014a). An estimated 133 (95% CI 127-148) Snubfin Dolphins inhabit waters of Roebuck Bay and 48 (95% CI 41-58) to 54 (95% CI 51-60) the waters of Cygnet Bay, Western Australia (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>There is no quantitative information on trends in abundance across the species’ range. Studies in Cleveland Bay indicated that even with relatively unbiased and precise abundance estimates, population trends would be extremely difficult to detect in less than three years unless changes in population size were greater than 20% per year (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006a). A multiyear study (ongoing since 2006) in Keppel Bay, Central Queensland, showed that between 2006-2010 abundance estimates of Snubfin Dolphins remained stable at around 70-80 individuals (Cagnazzi 2013), before starting to decline slightly in 2011 to about 68 (64-72) individuals in 2013 (Cagnazzi unpub. data). The decline in abundance estimates was associated with a period of extensive summer flooding that has been affecting this region every summer since 2010. Even though the negative trend is small and the 95% CIs of the estimates overlap, the decline has been consistent since 2011. Indices of abundance, including proportion of marked individuals observed in recent surveys (2014-2016) in the same area, showed a substantial variation across years with the lower estimates being 100 (68-147) in 2014, 163 (132-200) in 2015 and 103 (74-144) in 2016 (Cagnazzi unpub. data).<br/><br/><strong>Population Structure</strong><br/>Genetic analyses conducted on biopsies collected across two nearby populations in the Kimberly, Western Australia (i.e., Roebuck Bay and Cygnet Bay ~ 250 km apart) showed significant levels of population structure at both mitochondrial and nuclear markers (Brown et al. 2014). Contemporary migration rates per generation (20 years) between these two sampling locations were low (&lt; 10%, m &lt; 0.1). Similar results were obtained for three sampling locations in Central Queensland (Cleveland Bay, Keppel Bay, Whitsundays) that are 250-400 km apart (Parra et al. unpublished data). No genetic information on population structure is available from the Northern Territory of Australia or from Papua New Guinea. Overall, the available genetic data suggest that Snubfin Dolphins exist as a metapopulation of small, largely isolated population fragments with limited gene flow.<br/><br/><strong>Summary</strong><br/>The limited data presented above indicate that the Snubfin Dolphin has a restricted and discontinuous geographical distribution, occurs mainly over a narrow strip of shallow coastal waters, occurs in relatively small subpopulations, and the subpopulations are relatively isolated with limited gene flow among them. No subpopulation studied to date is larger than 250 mature individuals (Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Therefore, it is highly likely that the largest subpopulation has &lt;1,000 mature individuals and that there could well be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals across the range.<br/><br/>Similar to other small cetaceans, Snubfin Dolphins are long-lived (at least 28-30 years), have slow rates of increase (0.037, range 0.02-0.06), late maturity (reproductive maturity at 8-10 years of age) and low reproductive rates (one calf every 2-5 years) (Moore 2015), making them particularly vulnerable to even low rates of human-caused mortality. For example, based on model estimates of intrinsic growth rate (0.037) and generation time (20) for Snubfin Dolphins, Moore (2015) estimated that human-caused mortality rates of 4.4%, 5.0% and 6.5% would lead to declines of 30%, 50% and 80% in population size after three generations. These threshold mortality rates correspond to Vulnerable (VU), Endangered (EN) and Critically Endangered (CR) under the A criterion (population size reduction).<br/><br/>Although there is little quantitative data on Snubfin Dolphin population trends, a declining population can be inferred throughout many parts of the range given the species’ high vulnerability to human-caused mortality (e.g., from bycatch in gillnets and shark nets), its restricted distribution and reliance on coastal and riverine waters, the low estimates of abundance in surveyed areas, and the increasing habitat degradation and destruction throughout its range.",Decreasing,"Australian Snubfin Dolphins (hereafter referred to as Snubfin Dolphins) inhabit coastal, shallow waters of the tropical and subtropical zones of Australia and southern Papua New Guinea (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2017, Parra and Cagnazzi 2017). The distribution map accompanying this assessment depicts the inferred distribution as a continuous band throughout coastal waters within the 20 m isobath in countries where these dolphins are known or believed to occur. Although distribution is considered continuous across the range, the occurrence of Snubfin Dolphins along the northern Australia coast and southern Papua New Guinea is poorly documented (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002). Gaps in occurrence of several hundred kilometres are apparent along the east coast of Queensland (Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<br/><br/>In Australia, Snubfin Dolphins have been reported from Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia (Allen <em>et al</em>. 2012), across the northern coastline (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2011) and the Gulf of Carpentaria, and south along the east coast to as far south as the Brisbane River (Paterson <em>et al</em>. 1998, Parra <em>et al</em>. 2002). Sightings south of Roebuck Bay in Western Australia and south of Keppel Bay in Queensland are rare and considered extralimital.<br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea, Snubfin Dolphins are known to inhabit the Kikori Delta from Morigio Island east to Baimurru. It is likely that they also occur further east to Karema, which is situated at the headwaters of the Purari River. No Snubfin Dolphins have been sighted around the Daru region or west of Morigio Island, although only limited opportunistic surveys were undertaken (Beasley <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2017).<br/><br/>There are currently no confirmed records of Snubfin Dolphins from other regions of the Pacific Islands. Anecdotal sightings of Snubfin Dolphins have been reported from the Solomon Islands (Bass 2010). However, these records were provided during interviews to investigate the status of Dugongs (<em>Dugong dugon</em>) in the Solomon Islands, therefore the identification (at both species and genus levels) is highly uncertain.","There is no evidence of traditional use or trade for consumption or medicinal use across the Snubfin Dolphin’s range in Australia.

In Australia, Snubfin Dolphins are included on the list of migratory species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act of 1999 and are listed as Near Threatened in The Action Plan for Australian Mammals 2012 (Woinarski <em>et al. </em>2014) </p>  <p>The Australian Government invested $2 million over three years (2014-15 to 2016-17) for the implementation of a Whale and Dolphin Protection Plan. The National Dolphin Conservation Plan has promoted the conservation of dolphins in Australian waters by supporting research into inshore dolphin conservation, including investigating key threats and determining the conservation status of priority species such as the Snubfin Dolphin and the Australian Humpback Dolphin (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>). To identify the primary research objectives to inform the conservation and management of Australia’s tropical inshore dolphins, an expert workshop was held on April 9-10, 2015 in Canberra. The resulting Inshore Dolphin National Research Strategy (DOE 2015) identified the following research objectives applicable to Snubfin and Humpback Dolphins: 1) provide for access to and analysis of standardised national tropical dolphin data to assess distribution and underpin management and conservation, 2) conduct long-term monitoring project to determine trends, mitigate impacts from threats, and support adaptive management and conservation of tropical inshore dolphins, 3) identify, map and assess threats to tropical inshore dolphins, understand related impacts, and mitigate risks, 4) improve knowledge of genetic connectivity dispersal and movement at national, regional and local scales, 5) foster collaborative and national approaches to effectively gather mortality, life history and dietary information from stranded and by-caught specimens, 6) foster community participation in data collection on tropical inshore dolphins and develop a continuous improvement approach to methods and related programs. Guidelines on sampling and statistical methods to achieve some of these objectives have been recently described in Brooks <em>et al. </em>(2014). The highest-priority enabling objective was 1) Indigenous Engagement<strong>: </strong>Foster effective and informed partnerships with Australia’s Indigenous communities to enable sustainable conservation management of tropical inshore dolphins.</p>  <p>Multiple-use marine protected areas in Western Australia (e.g., Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef Marine Park) and Queensland (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Dugong Protected Areas; Moreton Bay Marine Park) cover a substantial portion of the Snubfin Dolphin’s known and presumed habitat and may provide some protection for this species.</p>  <p>Snubfin Dolphins were identified as having conservation value in Commonwealth waters around Australia in the North, Northwest, and Temperate East Marine bioregional plans (DSEWPaC 2012c,b,a).

Although lacking direct empirical estimates of population trends, country experts from the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group made subjective estimates of rates of population loss over three generations (30 years in the past, a 30-year window overlapping the present, and 30 years into the future) based on dwindling geographic ranges, loss and degradation of habitat, and high levels of exploitation. Weighting each country’s estimate of population change by the country’s areal proportion of the geographic range yielded an overall estimated decline of ~35% for the past 30 years, and ~40% or more for time periods including the future. Thus, this species meets the criterion A threshold for Vulnerable.<br/> <br/> Deforestation rates and reported high volumes of hunting and trade throughout the Sun Bear range form the basis for this assessment. Sun Bears are forest dependent species, and, thus area of forest loss is directly linked with population decline. Southeast Asia, which comprises nearly all of the species global range, has experienced a higher relative rate of forest loss over the past 30 years than any other part of the world (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010; Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014; Dong <em>et al.</em> 2014). Extent of occurrence (EOO) appears to be shrinking, with just a few individuals left in China and Bangladesh, and rapid decline in Vietnam (projected 50–80% decline in the next 30 years). Area of occupancy (AOO) is declining and becoming increasingly fragmented, most noticeably in Borneo and Sumatra. In mainland Southeast Asia, some patches in southern Myanmar, central Thailand, southern Cambodia, and southern Vietnam appear to be completely isolated. Deforestation and degradation is expected to continue into the future. Coupled with this, and the persistent trade in bears and bear parts, sun bear populations are expected to decline even more rapidly in the future.</p>","<p>                   </p><p>Sun Bears are a forest-dependent species, favouring interior mature and/or heterogeneously structured primary forests (Augeri 2005). There are two ecologically distinct categories of tropical forest that comprise their natural range, distinguished by differences in climate, phenology, and floristic composition: seasonal evergreen and deciduous forest in the mainland (north of the Isthmus of Kra) and aseasonal evergreen rainforest in Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo.<br/> <br/> In the far northern range limit in northeast India, Sun Bears were recorded in mountainous areas of subtropical climate (Higgins 1932, Chauhan and Singh 2006, Choudhury 2011). Their range may be limited farther north by colder climate and unsuitable habitat in the Himalayan sub-region, and limited farther northwest by competition with Sloth Bears (<em>Melursus ursinus</em>; Steinmetz, 2011). In Bangladesh, Northeast India, and throughout the rest of the mainland range (Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam) Sun Bears are sympatric with Asiatic Black Bears, inhabiting seasonal ecosystems with a long dry season (3-7 months), during which rainfall is &lt;100 mm per month. Seasonal forest types usually occur in a mosaic that includes semi-evergreen, mixed deciduous, dry dipterocarp, and montane evergreen forest (Nguyen Xuan Dang 2006, Scotson 2010, Steinmetz 2011, Gray and Phan 2011). In Thailand, Sun Bears and Asiatic Black Bears use many of the same habitats and have extensive overlap in diet.&#160; However, in montane forests &gt;1,200 m elevation (where ground cover is sparse) Asiatic Black Bears are more abundant than sun bears, possibly due to the lower abundance of invertebrate prey (Vinitpornsawan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> In southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, Sun Bears inhabit tropical evergreen moist forest and lowland or hill dipterocarp forest (Kawanishi and Sunquist 2004, Nazeri <em>et al</em>. 2014). Tropical evergreen rainforest comprises the Sun Bear’s main habitat in Borneo, Sumatra, and Peninsular Malaysia. Climate is generally constant in this region, with high annual rainfall that is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. The Sundaic tropical evergreen rainforest includes a wide diversity of forest types used by sun bears, including lowland and hill dipterocarp, peat swamp, freshwater swamp, limestone/karst hills and lower to sub-montane forest.<strong> </strong>Of these habitats,<strong> </strong>in Borneo and Sumatra, sun bear abundance (based on signs and camera trap records) was highest in primary lowland dipterocarp forest (Davies and Payne 1982, McConkey and Galetti 1999, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2002, Fredriksson 2005, Augeri 2005, Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2007, Wong and Linkie 2013). Sun Bears also occur in mangrove forest, although their occurrence in this forest type probably depends on proximity to other more favoured habitats (G. Fredriksson, pers. obs).<br/> <br/> Broadly speaking, Sun Bears seem to be more abundant in lower elevations (Augeri 2005, Steinmetz 2011) but there is wide variation throughout the range. In India, Sun Bears were detected up to 3,000 m (Choudhury 2011) and occupancy was higher in high elevations, possibly because low elevations were more degraded (Karanth <em>et al.</em> 2009). In western Thailand, Sun Bears occurred primarily below 1,200 m (Vinitpornsawan <em>et al</em>. 2006) but have been observed up to 2,100 m in neighbouring Myanmar (Htun 2006), and up to 1,600 m in Lao PDR (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 1999). <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">In Indonesia, sun bears occur primarily below 1,200 m although have been observed at 2,140 m in Sumatra (Augeri 2005, Wong and Linkie 2012). In Peninsular Malaysia Sun Bears were primarily below 1,200 m (Nazeri <em>et al.</em> 2014), whereas in Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) Sun Bears were more frequently encountered at higher altitudes, though this might be the result of high levels of hunting and logging activities at lower altitudes, both having negative impacts on Sun Bear densities (Brodie <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> In highly disturbed landscapes, habitat use may be driven more by hunting and habitat disturbance levels than by natural influences.<strong> </strong>For example,<strong> </strong>in the World Heritage Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai forest complex in Thailand, illegal rosewood (<em>Dalbergia </em>spp.) logging may cause Sun Bears to avoid interior forest, due to intensive logger traffic, most of whom are armed with guns (D. Ngoprasert, King Mongkut's University of Technology, pers. comm.). In some sites Sun Bears seem to prefer interior primary forest and density increases with increasing distance to roads and human settlements (Linkie <em>et al.</em> 2007, Nazeri <em>et al.</em> 2012, Wong and Linkie 2013). However, sun bears also use selectively logged areas (Wong <em>et al</em>. 2004, Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2007), but their occurrence in newly logged forest (&lt;10 years) is much lower compared to forest that was logged more distantly in the past (Brodie <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/> <br/> Sun Bears have been observed in plantations (oil palm, sugar palm), agricultural lands (sweetcorn, cucumber, pumpkin, sesame), orchards (coconut, durian, banana, jackfruit, snakefruit, pineapple, apple) and near forest edges (Nomura <em>et al.</em> 2004, Augeri 2005, Fredriksson 2005, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2012, Chea 2013, Sethy and Chauhan, 2013, Scotson <em>et al</em>. 2014), where they may be considered pests. Scattered reports of predation on livestock (goats; Sumatra, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2015) and chickens (Borneo, Fredriksson 2005) exist. Crop raiding tends to occur most often during harvest time and is concentrated in areas where crops are planted along the forest edge (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1996, Fredriksson 2005, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is no evidence that Sun Bears can survive in deforested or agricultural areas in the absence of nearby forest (Augeri 2005). It is known that they can derive some nutritional benefit from consuming oil palm fruits (Nomura <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chea 2013), but it is doubtful that they could subsist on this, without other foods and cover provided by nearby natural forest.<br/> <br/> Sun Bears are generalist omnivores, feeding primarily on termites, ants, beetle larvae, stingless bee larvae and honey, and a large variety of fruit species. Figs (<em>Ficus</em> spp.) are particularly important when available (McConkey and Galetti 1999, Wong <em>et al.</em> 2002, Augeri 2005, Fredriksson <em>et al.</em> 2006a). Occasionally, growth shoots of certain palms and some species of flowers are consumed (Fredriksson <em>et al.</em> 2006a), but otherwise vegetative matter rarely occurs in the diet. The Indonesian name for Sun Bears translates to ‘honey bear’ presumably because they are so attracted to honey. Their massive jaw muscles and disproportionately large canines (for the size of their head; Christiansen 2007, 2008) enable them to bite through the bark/stem of hardwood trees to consume stingless bees nests and honey, and their long tongues are used to extract insects and their products from crevices. Their long sharp claws enable them to dig easily into the ground and break into rotting logs (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2002). In Bornean lowland forests, fruits of the families Moraceae, Burseraceae and Myrtaceae make up more than 50% of the fruit diet (Fredriksson <em>et al.</em> 2006a), whereas in western Thailand fruits of Lauraceae, Fagaceae, Leguminosae, Labiatae, and Sapindaceae are the most commonly consumed (Vinitpornsawan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> There is no evidence of Sun Bears hibernating, presumably because of year-round food availability across their range. There is also no evidence of parturient females entering a prolonged period of fasting, as do other bears species. Female bears use cavities of either standing or fallen large hollow trees as birthing sites. Both diurnal and nocturnal behaviour has been documented. Average home range estimates from Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia range from 7 km² to 27 km², respectively, with daily movements affected by food availability (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2004, Fredriksson 2012, Cheah 2013).<br/> <br/> Little is known about social structure or reproduction. Sun Bears are largely solitary, except when with offspring. But they occasionally occur in pairs, and may congregate to feed from large fruiting trees. Faecal steroids from wild Sun Bears in Indonesia and from captive Sun Bears in European and American zoos indicated that Sun Bears are polyestrous, a seasonal breeders, usually producing a single cub (Schwarzenberger <em>et al.</em> 2004, Frederick <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>","<p>Sun Bears are threatened primarily by deforestation and commercial hunting, which occurs to varying degrees throughout the range (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 2012, Stibig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Killing due to human-bear conflicts is an additional threat, although less obvious in its impact.<br/> <br/> Active trade in wild Sun Bears and their parts (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011, Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014) is one of the two most serious threats to Sun Bear populations. Commercial poaching of Sun Bears was reported by regional experts in the Bear Specialist Group to be a moderate to major threat in all range countries except Brunei, for which there are no data (see also Meijaard 1999, Nea and Nong 2006, Nguyen 2006, Htun 2006, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014). In Thailand, local hunters in one area estimated that commercial poaching reduced the abundance of Sun Bears by more than 40% in 20 years (Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2006). Poaching pressure is increasing within some Thai Protected Areas, based on encounter rates of poaching signs and poachers (Steinmetz and Ngoprasert, unpubl. data), though bears are not usually targeted as much as other species. In northeastern India, where Sun Bear populations occur naturally at low densities, bears are still caught and poaching is said to have reached ""critical"" levels (Chauhan and Singh 2006, Sethy and Chauhan 2012). In southern Lao PDR, sign surveys indicate that Sun Bear populations have been reduced to extremely low levels relative to other sites in Southeast Asia, with declines attributed to historically high poaching levels (Scotson 2012).<br/> <br/> Of major concern is a widespread trend of wildlife snaring throughout much of the Sun Bear range. In northeastern Lao PDR, hunters use a snaring method that specifically targets bears and threatens to wipe out local populations (Scotson and Hunt 2012). Large and small mammal snares were detected in numerous protected areas throughout the county. Although not always specifically targeting bears this represents a major ongoing threat (Scotson and Brocklehurst 2013). Farmers affected by wildlife crop damage frequently set snares around the perimeter of crop fields (Fredriksson 2005), and in some instances catch bears (Hunt and Scotson 2011, Scotson <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia camera traps increasingly record bears with missing paws (apparent snare injuries) and in a radio collaring study in Peninsular Malaysia, three out of five captured Sun Bears had missing paws (Cheah 2013), indicating high snaring pressure using cable snares.<br/> <br/> Enforcement of domestic and international wildlife laws is severely lacking in most cases and is failing to deter illegal bear trade (Shepherd and Nijman 2008, Foley <em>et al</em>. 2011, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014). Low risk of being prosecuted and high potential profits mean that the incentive to poach bears is very high. The value of bear parts on the illegal wildlife market has increased notably over the past two decades (Livingstone and Shepherd 2014).<br/> <br/> Other motivations for killing bears include preventing damage to crops and livestock (Fredriksson 2005, Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wong <em>et al</em>. 2014), subsistence use such as wild meat consumption (Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014), and fear of bears near villages. The rapid loss and fragmentation of forests across the Sun Bear range may bring bears closer to humans and thus increase the likelihood of human-bear interactions (Fredriksson 2005). In Lao PDR, where bear crop raiding occurs annually in many parts of the country, farmers showed a general reluctance to report crop raiding events to management authorities and may be more inclined to hunt bears that enter fields instead of seeking non-lethal mitigation methods (Scotson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Incidences of sun bears attacking humans are rare and usually result as an act of self defence—under normal circumstances, Sun Bears avoid humans.<br/> <br/> As Sun Bears are a forest dependent species, population declines are likely to be associated with deforestation rates. Deforestation increased dramatically during 1990-2005 and in recent times Southeast Asia has experienced the highest annual rate of forest cover change in the world&#160; (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010; Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014; Dong <em>et al</em>. 2014). Some estimates project extremely high loss of natural forests and of biodiversity of up to 75% and 85% respectively by 2100 (Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2010). Rate of forest loss is not uniform throughout the range, however, with some discrepancies among published estimates of forest lost due to varying analytical techniques (Dong <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Analyses by Stibig <em>et al</em>. (2014) indicated that Southeast Asia lost 11.9% of its forest cover during 1990-2000. The Sundaic region (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei) experienced the highest rate of loss (Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono 2012, 2014; Sodhi <em>et al</em>. 2014); Stibig <em>et al</em>. (2014) calculated 13% of forest was lost during 1990-2000, and Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011 estimated a further 9.9% lost during 2000-2010. By 2012, primary forest loss in Indonesia was estimated to be double that in Brazil (Margono 2014). Hansen <em>et al</em>. (2009) estimated that in Sumatra and Kalimantan combined, 23.5% of total forest was lost from 1990-2005, with loss of lowland forest alone more than 40%. Brunei seems to be impacted the least, although deforestation and forest degradation are still evident (Bryan <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/> <br/> Deforestation in the Sundaic region is largely attributed to extensive clear-cutting for plantations (i.e., oil palm, rubber), unsustainable logging practices (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2005), legal and illegal logging, and forest fires (Meijaard <em>et al</em>. 2005, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006, Wong and Linkie 2012). Conversion of natural habitat to oil palm plantations is most extensive on Borneo and Sumatra (Miettinen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Wicke <em>et al</em>. 2011; Margono <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014). Protected areas are not exempt from deforestation; 40% of the forest lost in Indonesia during 2000-2012 was lost in areas where logging is restricted (i.e. national parks and protected forests, Margano <em>et al</em>. 2014), and in Kalimantan alone, 56% of protected lowland forests were cleared from 1985-2001 (Curran <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/> <br/> Human-caused fires throughout the Sundaic region are also diminishing habitat quality and quantity for sun bears, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia. These fires are more extensive during El Niño-related droughts. Between 1997-2006 a total of 16.2 million ha of Borneo’s landmass (21% of total land surface area) were affected by fires (Langner and Siegert 2009). On Borneo, periods of prolonged drought have disrupted fruiting patterns (e.g., Harrison 2000), which in combination with reduced habitat availability due to clearing for agriculture, logging and fires, resulted in starvation among sun bears, even in protected primary forest areas (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2005, Fredriksson <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/> <br/> Given the Sun Bear’s affinity for primary and relatively mature, heterogeneously structured forests, along with its strongly frugivorous diet, such forest loss and fragmentation will exert significant effects on the bear’s regional and global populations along with its genetic and demographic structure and viability (Augeri 2005). Based on deforestation rates and increasingly fragmented range, and evidence of increasing trade of bears and their parts, it is likely that many isolated populations face a real threat of extirpation.</p>","Regional experts reported declines of Sun Bears in eight of ten current range countries (trends in two other current range countries—Brunei and Bangladesh—are unknown). There are few reliable estimates of Sun Bear population size and few studies have quantified population trends. Previous attempts to extrapolate population size from anecdotal information on bear density derived from occasional bear sightings and sign surveys (e.g., Davies and Payne 1981, Meijaard 2001) have led to unreliable estimates (Garshelis 2002).<br/><br/>A camera-based mark-recapture survey in Thailand estimated population densities of 4.3 (95% Cl 1.6-11.6) and 5.9 (95% Cl 2.3-15.4) per 100 km² in two sites within Khao Yai National Park (Ngoprasert <em>et al.</em> 2012). In southern Sumatra, in Harapan Rainforest, a camera-based study estimated a density of Sun Bears of 26 bears per 100 km², 4-5 times higher than density estimates from Thailand (Lee 2014, unpubl. data). The methods used to estimate density in Thailand and Sumatra differed (capture-recapture and gas-model, respectively), but if results are comparable, they suggest substantially higher density of Sun Bears in the Sundaic portion of their range than on the mainland (where in part they coexist and potentially compete with Asiatic Black Bears).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Sun Bears have declined in some sites, for example Khao Yai National Park where camera trap photo encounter rates declined by nearly two-thirds from 0.73 per 100 days (over the period 1999-2003) to 0.27 (2003-2007) (Lynam <em>et al.</em> 2003, Jenks <em>et al.</em> 2011). But other populations seem to be doing better, with photo encounter rates stable in Kuiburi Natonal Park and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary (Steinmetz, unpublished data). An earlier systematic mammal status assessment study with local people in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, estimated that Sun Bear numbers declined by more than 40% in a 20-year period from 1984-2004 (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2006). But improved protection and community engagement since then appears to have had a positive effect. In neighbouring Lao PDR, interviews in rural communities adjacent to bear habitat recorded widespread population declines (Scotson 2010, 2012). In west Sumatra, repeat camera trap surveys using an occupancy-based sampling framework revealed a decline in Sun Bear populations (5%/year) in response to high levels of deforestation (9%/year in the most deforested site) over 7-year period (Wong <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Sun Bear populations can recover in previously extirpated areas, given a nearby source population. In Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan), sign transects were used to monitor relative abundance of Sun Bears in forest affected by fires and adjacent unburned forest from 2000 to 2010. In the unburned forest, Sun Bear density remained stable. In the recently burned forest, Sun Bear sign density was close to zero post fires, but in 10 years reached 65% of the sign densities in adjacent unburned forest (Fredriksson 2012).",Decreasing,"The historic range of this species (within 500 years) extended across much of Southeast Asia, from Borneo and Sumatra north to at least Yunnan Province, China. Fossil records from the Pleistocene have been found much farther north (Erdbrink 1953). Assam, in northeast India, marks the northwestern confirmed historic range limit (Wroughton 1916, Higgins 1932). Reports of Sun Bears formerly occupying the Terai of Nepal (Hodgson 1844) appear to be erroneous. In the northeast, the range extends to northeastern Vietnam (Erdbrink 1953). The southern-most range limit is Indonesia; there are no records of Sun Bears ever occurring farther east than Borneo. Records exist from the Island of Java from middle-late Pleistocene (Erdbrink 1953) but there is no evidence of occurrence there within historic times.<br/><br/>In present day, Sun Bears occur patchily through much of the former range, and have been locally extirpated from many areas. This is particularly evident in Thailand, where bears are mainly limited to a patchwork of protected areas separated by expanses of agriculture (Kanchanasakha <em>et al.</em> 2010). The range extends westward to southern Bangladesh and northeastern India (West Garo Hills, Meghalaya), northwards to eastern Arunachal Pradesh (Chauhan 2006; Choudhury 2011; Sethy and Chauhan 2012, 2013) and northern Myanmar. The Sun Bear's range is sympatric with Asiatic Black Bears (<em>Ursus thibetanus</em>) across mainland Southeast Asia to about 9°N latitude (in peninsular Thailand), south of which Asiatic Black Bears do not occur. In the Sundaic region, its range extends south and eastwards to Sumatra and Borneo respectively (Steinmetz 2011).<br/><br/>In mainland Southeast Asia Sun Bears appear to exhibit a natural population gradient from the north to south being most abundant in the southern regions and becoming less common towards the northern edge of their range (Steinmetz 2011). A north to south gradient probably applies to the entire range as well, with population abundance lower in mainland Southeast Asia than in Sundaic Southeast Asia. This is based on higher population densities (Ngoprasert <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lee 2014 unpubl. data) and higher sign densities (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fredriksson 2012) in the Sundaic region compared to the mainland. This gradient of abundance is presumed to be natural and unrelated to human exploitation as it was apparent in historical times (e.g., in India, Higgins 1932) and is also reflected by the relative frequency of fossil records in the mainland and Sundaic regions (Vos and Long 1993, Tougard 2001, Meijaard 2004). As such, Sun Bears are rare in the western and northern edges of their range in southern Bangladesh and Northeast India. There are no records of Sun Bears north of the Brahmaputra River in Assam or Arunachal Pradesh (Chauhan 2006, Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013, Choudhury 2011). Sun Bears are relatively less common in the northern highlands of Lao Peoples&#160;Democratic Republic (hereafter Lao PDR), compared with the southern region (Scotson 2010, 2012). Current distribution in northeastern Myanmar is uncertain due to political instability in the area but presumes to be in decline (Saw Htun, Wildlife Conservation Society, pers. comm. 2014). The northeastern range ends in eastern Vietnam, at the Red River, limited presumably by colder climates and unfavourable habitats.<br/><br/>Sun Bears were thought to be extirpated in Bangladesh until recent confirmed records in 2014 and 2015 (Anwarul Islam, WildTeam pers. comm. 2015). It is possible that a population in a southern Bangladesh is maintained through immigration from core areas in western Myanmar.&#160;Likewise, the existence of this species in China remains in doubt.&#160;Surveys in the most likely regions (remnant lowland natural forests) of Yunnan Province confirmed their absence in all but one small area (&lt;600 km²) that could not be surveyed (Wen and Wang 2013). In 2016, video footage of a Sun Bear was obtained from a camera trap in this area, indicating the presence of at least one bear, &lt;1 km from the Myanmar border (Li <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; It is unknown whether there is a transboundary population, or just a few individuals living near the border. Nevertheless, this represents the first confirmed record of the species in China in 45 years. Sun Bears most likely occurred in what is now Singapore, but were extirpated due to the widespread deforestation that occurred in the 1800s and 1900s (Corlett 1992, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2003).","<p>Sun Bears are commonly poached for their gall bladders (i.e., bile) and paws; the former is used as a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the latter as an expensive delicacy. Traditionally, bear bile was used to treat a wide range of ailments and for promoting general good health and strength. Use was largely subsistence based, until around the mid 1900s, when international trade routes opened and commercial interest in bear bile began to grow. Bear bile forms a component of traditional Chinese medicine but has not commonly been part of traditional medicinal practices in Southeast Asian cultures. Thus, it is not typically used locally, but rather sold to consuming markets. Sun bears (or parts thereof) were one of the most commonly seized bear species in Asia from 2000-2011 (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014). Illegal import of Sun Bears or parts has been detected in the USA, New Zealand, UK and France, and illegal exportation from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Lao PDR, Indonesia and the USA (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/> <br/> Domestic hunting and trade of Sun Bears is illegal throughout the entire range except Sarawak, where it is permitted under license (although no license has ever been issued; Krishnasamy and Shepherd, 2014). Sun bears have been listed in Appendix I of CITES since 1979 and international commercial trade is therefore illegal. Monitoring illegal bear trade in Asia has been difficult and little quantitative information has been collected on the scale of trade or trends over time. However, records of perceived high volume of use and trade have existed for decades (e.g., Caldecott 1988, Meijaard 1999, Pereira 2002, Foley <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), and the high and increasing value of parts indicate that trade is still booming. In Lao PDR, trading values for wild cubs increased 2.6 times and gall bladder values increased 180 times from the early 1990s to 2013 (data for Sun Bears and Asiatic Black Bears combined; Livingstone and Shepherd 2014). Prices vary widely throughout the range. In Lao PDR, in 2014, poachers sold cubs for ~$US 600 and gall bladders ~US$ 700. In Southern Yunnan, in 2014, a Sun Bear carcass from Myanmar, with gall bladder intact, was traded for ~US$ 4,000 (Roshan Guharajan pers. comm. 2015). In Japan and South Korea, values for gallbladders can exceed the value of gold (INTERPOL 2014). In Cambodia, annual confiscation rates of sun bears more than doubled from 1998 to 2008, with a ratio of around 3:1 Sun Bears to Asiatic Black Bears confiscated. Sun Bear confiscations decreased in subsequent years, although given the prevalent high value of bears this may be due to declining bear populations and trade becoming more secretive, as opposed to reduced trade (Broadis 2011). <br/> <br/> Sun Bear cubs (wild caught), although mostly traded as pets, are also ‘farmed’ for their bile in commercial bear farms in China, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam. However, this industry is by far dominated by Asiatic Black Bears and the proportion of Sun Bears held on farms is relatively small (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2011, Livingstone and Shepherd 2014). Indeed, Sun Bears seem to produce much lower levels of the medicinal bile acids (ursodeoxycholic acid) than found in Asiatic Black Bears (Hagey <em>et al.</em> 1993). Nevertheless, Sun Bears were observed in small private bile farm enterprises in Vietnam (Nguyen 2006, Foley <em>et al</em>. 2011). Proponents of the bear farming industry claim that the availability of farmed bile will satisfy the growing demand for bear bile and gall bladders within Southeast and East Asian (China, Korea, Japan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East) markets. However, there is no evidence that this is the case; instead, there is evidence for the opposite - that the demand for wild products continues to rise in the presence of bear farming (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2011, Livingstone and Shepherd 2014). Furthermore, mortality rates of farmed bears are high and farms in Southeast Asia rely on wild cubs to replenish their stock. There may be complex interactions between the markets for farmed and wild sourced bear bile, and the availability of farmed bile may drive up the value and demand for the wild product (Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2011). As such, the IUCN has called for a situation analysis to investigate the true nature of the relationship between the market for farmed bile and the market for wild bile (Garshelis and Scotson 2012).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Measures to reduce habitat loss and poaching throughout the entire Sun Bear range are key actions needed to conserve Sun Bears. In areas with the highest deforestation rates, such as Indonesia and Malaysia (two globally leading oil palm producers), immediate action should be taken to protect remaining high conservation value forests from conversion to other land-uses, eliminate unsustainable logging, and effectively manage forest fires. Additionally, new protected areas should be established and effectively managed in order to preempt land conversion (Augeri 2005, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006) and protect critical Sun Bear habitat. For example, in Peninsular Malaysia, Nazeri <em>et al</em>. (2012), using MaxEnt modelling, reported that Sun Bears favour dense tropical evergreen forest over cultivated landscapes and areas in close proximity to roads. Of habitat deemed ‘highly suitable’ only 22% is contained within protected areas. These findings suggest that the present geographical extent of protected areas in Peninsular Malaysia provide insufficient coverage of habitat crucial for conserving Sun Bears.<br/> <br/> In conjunction with primary forest protection, degraded habitats and forest remnants in human-modified landscapes should be enhanced, through reforestation programs, corridor planning and elevated protected status. Additionally, there is the need to establish buffer zones and prevent further agricultural expansion surrounding protected areas. Achieving these measures requires increased levels of resources, the support of conservation constituencies in civil society, and strengthened government commitments to conservation. In Malaysia and Indonesia, the two main producers of palm oil, it will be difficult to stop forest conversion, given the impacts of their economies in the world markets. Furthermore, in present conditions the effective management of already established protected areas, let alone addition of new protected areas and land management outside of protected areas, has proven a highly challenging task.<br/> <br/> Sun Bears are legally protected domestically and internationally from hunting and trade throughout most of their range. However, deficiencies in law enforcement are recognized as major ongoing weaknesses (Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014). Some successes are evident where dedicated agencies operate with steady technical and funding support. For example, in Cambodia, a dedicated Wildlife Protection Mobile Unit, run by Forestry Officials and Military and funded by international NGOs, has confiscated more than 100 Sun Bears and Asiatic Black Bears since 1998 (Broadis 2011). Similar initiatives exist in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia but action is limited. Establishment of more focused wildlife protection/crime units is recommended for other range countries, where possible funded by local authorities responsible for wildlife law enforcement.<br/> <br/> Reduction of mortality by clearing of snares from bear habitat is urgently needed throughout much of the range, and long term measures are needed to prevent the problem reoccurring. Efforts to do so are underway in several protected areas throughout the region, by park authorities often in collaboration with foreign NGOs. However, these projects usually do not extend throughout a protected area and can face difficulties in maintaining long-term funding and political support.<br/> <br/> To combat the growing impacts of human-bear conflict, funding and technical support is needed to promote non-lethal mitigation, especially in low-income regions where the incentive to hunt bears may outweigh incentives to stop conflict from occurring.<br/> <br/> Non-government organizations (NGO’s) have established bear dedicated rescue centres in Cambodia, Vietnam, Lao, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia with the primary aim of providing sanctuary to bears confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade. Bear rescue centres can play a key role in raising local awareness on the threats to sun bears and the conservation value of ecological services provided by bear habitat. Some centres operate dedicated outreach teams, providing structured learning programs that can reach tens of thousands of people each year. Likewise, centres support capacity building of local conservationists, and facilitate <em>in-situ</em> and <em>ex-situ</em> research and conservation. Rehabilitation of ex-captive Sun Bears is another potential role. However this is rare and fraught with challenges, as most potential release sites are still threatened by forest loss and poaching. For example, in Cambodia, a pilot project to rehabilitate two Sun Bears that had been confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade ended after both bears were trapped in snares within two months, despite over two years of intensive snare-patrolling in the area prior to the release (M. Hunt, Free the Bears, pers. comm).<br/> <br/> Ultimately, reducing the trade in bear parts would be one of the most highly beneficial steps for the persistence and recovery of Sun Bears throughout their range, especially as trade is increasingly moving towards the last strongholds for Sun Bears in Malaysia and Indonesia (Shepherd and Shepherd 2010, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014). Understanding consumer motivation, and educating and changing the behaviour of potential consumers of bear products, could be an incredibly effective tool. This is especially important given that law enforcement is generally underfunded and unfocused.<br/> <br/>Increasing our scientific knowledge of Sun Bear ecology, population distribution, status and effects of threats is also needed. Aside from a now outdated global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), only one range country (India) has developed a National Conservation Action Plan for Sun Bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). Range mapping efforts, ongoing since 2006, have suffered from lack of presence data. But in 2014, the Bear Specialist Group mapped the current range-wide distribution of Sun Bears based on collation of more than 2000 presence points from throughout the range and with input from numerous experts. This has resulted in the most up to date range map for the species. The veracity of Probable range depicted by experts remains unclear. Habitat modelling approaches (e.g., Maxent; Nazeri <em>et al.</em> 2012) generate maps of potential distribution and may thereby help direct field surveys to promising locations to ascertain bear status; however such models are often generated with bear presence data from a small area and extrapolated broadly, and should thus be treated with caution. There remain large areas for which sun bear status is uncertain, most noticeably in Myanmar, where further research is needed.<br/> <br/> Furthermore, it is important to establish the geographic distribution of Sun Bears at finer scales, taking into consideration habitat and fragmentation within and between countries, in order to better direct conservation actions and monitor habitat changes accurately (i.e., forest loss and fragmentation).<br/> <br/> In 2006 The Bear Specialist Group mapped important habitat blocks for long-term survival of Sun Bears (Bear Conservation Units-BCUs). Anti-poaching efforts and forest boundary protection efforts within BCUs should be a high priority. Presently no BCUs receive support just for bears, but BCUs in some countries coincide with protected areas that receive substantial conservation support for other species (such as tigers), and bears benefit as a result (Steinmetz and Garshelis 2014). The possibilities to link bear conservation with that of other species should be explored and promoted more widely.<br/> <br/> Efforts are currently underway to develop a standard methodology with which to monitor occurrence, relative abundance and trends of Asian bear populations through repeat sign transects. To this end, methodologies to distinguish Sun Bear claw marks from Asiatic Black Bear claw marks and to age claw marks have been developed (Steinmetz and Garshelis 2008, 2010). Surveys using this technique have been completed in Lao PDR and are planned for Vietnam and Cambodia. Trends in bear occurrence and relative abundance within the aforementioned BCUs should be monitored using standardized sign surveys and camera trapping by local government, communities, and NGOs. Results of such monitoring could indicate which management or ecological conditions promote successful bear conservation, and which do not, and provide a means to assess the results of conservation efforts (e.g., future range expansion and/or increased bear density being indicative of effective conservation efforts). Additional field studies would also be helpful in this regard, as few intensive studies have been conducted on Sun Bears.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The precise timing of its spring arrival at breeding colonies is variable depending on locality, from late February on Franz Josef Land to early May in north-west Greenland. Immense colonies are formed on sea coasts, usually nesting in crevices in rock scree of maritime slopes and on coastal cliffs. Colonies are abandoned in August with individuals seeking more southerly waters (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).","<p>As Little Auks spend much of their life at sea, including at and below the sea surface, they are vulnerable to both oil spill events and chronic oil pollution (Fort <em>et al.</em> 2013). The Newfoundland area is subject to chronic oil pollution, with tens of thousands of Little Auks dying in this area annually (Wiese and Robertson 2004). Recent tracking research has indicated that important foraging grounds for the species overlap with expanding oil and gas extraction activities and shipping, which could lead to habitat degradation and species mortality (Fort <em>et al.</em> 2013). The Little Auk is still hunted in Thule during its short period of presence in the summer, to form the delicacy Kiviaq, now only eaten at important celebrations. It is thought that, in the 1990s, annual take in Greenland was c. 60,000 birds which, due to the global population numbering over 30 million, is not thought to cause significant declines. There is also evidence for mortality due to bycatch, however, estimates for the combined bycatch of all auk species in the Northeast Atlantic is in the thousands (Fangel<em> et al. </em>2015), so this is unlikely to be causing declines.</p>  <p>It has been found that Little Auks’ reproductive output and body condition is unaffected by the retreat of sea-ice, due to the use of bathymetric features for foraging, meaning this species will be largely unaffected by the retreat of sea-ice in response to climate change. Further research shows Little Auks are able to switch to feeding in nutrient rich coastal glacier melt-water in cases where sea-ice is absent, maintaining chick growth but showing a 4% decrease in adult body mass (Grémillet <em>et al.</em> 2015). There is some dispute as to whether changing sea surface temperature will have an effect on the Little Auk. It has been found that foraging plasticity allows Little Auks to feed on the smaller and less lipid-rich copepods found in warmer water without a reduction in fledging success or adult body condition, although this is thought to be at the expense of energy expenditure on other activities (Grémillet <em>et al. </em>2012). In contrast to this, Hovinen <em>et al.</em> (2014) found adult survival to be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation index and local summer sea surface temperatures with a time lag of 2 and 1 years respectively, implying climate change may have a negative effect on the Little Auk population. </p>","The global population is estimated to number c.16,000,000-36,000,000 individuals (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).

Cats have been introduced on several islands by army personnel and have been found near colonies and may be having an effect on the species (Shobrak 2007).

Oil exploration activities, which are taking place within 100 km of the species' centre of abundance and sea currents would likely take oil spills from the main area of development towards the species’s range (Agüero <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011). In the last 30 years, three major oil spills severely affected Steamerduck breeding areas and were reported to cause massive mortalities, and the sediment and rocks within the species’ range are still contaminated with oil derivatives (Agüero <em>et al.</em> 2011). The ongoing threat of chronic oil contamination is considered to have slow or even negligible effects on the population, but future spill events remain a high-level risk.&#160;</p><p>The species may also be affected by the harvesting of guano and macroalgae (Agüero <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011), as well as other human activities such small-scale coastal fishing and recreational activities. Egg collecting has been reported, but appears to occur at very low intensity and at a few sites only (Agüero <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011). A further potential threat stems from three introduced species; the Green Crab <em>Carcinus maenus</em>, Asian Kelp <em>Undaria pinnatifida</em> and the Acorn Barnacle <em>Balanus glandula</em>, all of which may cause dramatic changes to ecosystems upon which Steamerducks depend (Agüero <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). The exact impact of these species on the White-headed Steamerduck and the changes they incur on the wider ecosystem is currently unknown. Levels of predation during the breeding season may be increasing with the documented rapid population increase in the population of native Kelp Gulls <em>Larus dominicanus</em> (Agüero <em>et al</em>. 2011). The observation that the species breeds at higher densities on islands could suggest that it is restricted by mammalian predators on the mainland (Agüero <em>et al.</em> 2011), but also indicates its vulnerability to potential introduction of invasive species onto islands.

It breeds in the high Arctic from late-May or early-June (depending on the timing of the Arctic thaw) <strong></strong> in single pairs or loose groups<strong></strong>, often with colonies of nesting gulls or terns (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005);<strong></strong> although it is not itself a colonial species (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. Males undergo short post-breeding moult migrations<strong></strong>, often gathering in small or large flocks (up to 4,000 in Iceland) (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> while females are incubating (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Females usually moult in the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, although large concentrations (500-1,000 individuals) of moulting females have been recorded away from breeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. During the moulting period the species is flightless for a period of c.3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The autumn migration begins after the moulting period in mid-August (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, with males tending to remain much further north than females or immatures (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong> leading to some sexual segregation during the winter (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. The species is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season<strong></strong> and is commonly observed in small or large flocks<strong></strong> sometimes of several thousand individuals (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The return spring migration generally begins in late-February (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> although flocks of non-breeders may remain in the south, often in winter quarters, during the breeding season (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds in tundra, wooded tundra<strong></strong> and moorland regions in the high Arctic<strong></strong>, occupying small, shallow<strong></strong>, freshwater lakes, pools and rivers<strong></strong> with grassy shorelines and high densities of invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. It shows a preference for water less than 6 m deep (usually 2 m) for diving (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding</em> The species winters on shallow coastal waters&#160; less than 10 m deep<strong></strong> (especially in the vicinity of sewage outlets)<strong></strong>, as well as sheltered bays<strong></strong>, estuaries <strong></strong> and brackish coastal lagoons (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. It is also found inland on large lakes <strong></strong> and reservoirs during this season (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The species is omnivorous (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. During the winter, its diet consisting predominantly of molluscs (Johnsgard 1978) such as muscles, cockles and clams while in coastal habitats and <em>Hydrobia </em>snails while in brackish waters (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005). Other food sources include insects<strong></strong>, aquatic insect larvae<strong></strong>, crustaceans such as amphipods, worms, small fish<em></em><strong></strong>, and the roots, seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants such as sedges <em></em>and water weeds (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Breeding</strong> The nest is a shallow depression close to water<strong></strong> on the ground<strong></strong>, either in thick vegetation<strong></strong>, in cracks in rocks, under woody shrubs or under perennial herbaceous vegetation less than 50 cm high (Iceland) (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992; Kear 2005). The species is not colonial but it will sometimes nest among gulls and terns (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, with neighbouring nests being placed as close as 1 m in some areas (Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>In Scotland, UK the introduction of a sewage treatment scheme in the Firth of Forth, a large marine bay, resulted in a considerable reduction in the abundance of the species, with feeding flocks only remaining at outfalls where sewage continued to be discharged in large quantities (Campbell 1984)<strong></strong>. It was unclear whether the changes in the species's distribution were due to reductions in the number of food items borne in the sewage or to reductions in aquatic invertebrate abundance as a result of the new treatment system (Campbell 1984)<strong></strong>.   <p></p>","<p>Incidental capture in commercial fisheries poses a major threat to this species which shows a relatively high vulnerability to bycatch (Sonntag <em>et al.</em> 2012). Entanglement in fishing equipment causes an estimated 5-10% annual mortality in the Baltic region (Jensen 2009). The species winters near major fishing areas in Europe, North America and Japan, thus interaction with fisheries is common throughout the range.  </p><p>Wetland habitats critical to breeding success are potentially threatened by climate change. Remotely sensed imaging has revealed landscape-level changes, including the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska, associated with a warming climate, longer growing seasons and increased potential evapotranspiration (Riordan <em>et al.</em> 2006). Audubon’s (2014) climate model predicts the loss of over half of the North American summer range with suitable climatic conditions, with similar trends likely in Eurasia. Climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes throughout the sensitive ecosystems in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Reduced duration of spring snow cover in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Greater Scaup, possibly due to trophic mismatch, with a projected 12.9% decline in population by 2080, compared to the 1980 census (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Future ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Scaup diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Certain colonies in the Pacific Northwest may be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium originating from mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, raising the possibility that heavy metal pollution could be contributory to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). The Scaup’s habit of congregating around coastal sewage outlets in winter, also exposes it to risk from other pollutants (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017).</p>  <p>Flocks often occur in vicinity of oil-related developments and are therefore susceptible to oiling and related pollutants, particularly when moulting and during winter. Oil pollution could also impact the species indirectly through decreased abundance or quality of invertebrate prey (Kirby <em>et al.</em> 1993, Kear 2005). Oil and gas exploration in Siberia may have disruptive impacts on breeding grounds and could potentially be associated with an increase in hunting pressures (Jensen 2009, Mineyev 1998). Wind farms may represent a threat to the Greater Scaup, having been shown to affect duck population densities more severely than those of other species groups (Stewart <em>et al.</em> 2007). However, it has been found that collision rates are lower than for other groups (Dürr 2013 <em>per</em> Fox <em>et al. </em>2015) and, as such, wind farms are likely to only be damaging to the population when inappropriately placed (Drewitt &amp; Langston 2006).<br/></p>  At present, direct persecution only appears to have a low impact on a minority of the population, with annual mortality in the EU estimated at 0.6% (Mooji 2005) or not more than 2% (Jensen 2009). In the last 10-year period with available data (2004-2014), the estimated harvest of Greater Scaup in US and Canada ranged from 56,000 to 104,000 birds and showed a decreasing trend in population size (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). Another study in North America found little evidence that harvest was  associated with population decline (Afton and Anderson 2001). Low levels of hunting have also been reported in north-western Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006). Although wintering in densely populated coastal areas (Europe, N. America, Japan) makes the species an exposed hunting target, persecution is thought to have negligible effects on the population as a whole.<p></p>  <p></p>","The global population is estimated to number c. 4,920,000-5,130,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).&#160;The breeding population in Europe is estimated at 134,000-178,000 pairs, which equates to 269,000-355,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"Summer breeding grounds of the species range across the northern limits of Europe (including <strong>Iceland</strong>) and Asia, through the Aleutian Islands (year-round breeding) to Alaska (<strong>USA</strong>), and across to the Atlantic coast of <strong>Canada </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).

It shows a preference for shallow fresh waters with emergent vegetation for initial brood rearing, afterwards moving to more saline waters where the young fledge (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <em>Non-breeding</em> The species generally moults in sheltered fjords and bays with high densities of benthic fauna (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, and winters at sea on deep offshore waters close to the edge of sea ice or in coastal areas with shallow waters (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005).<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of animal matter such as benthic molluscs, crustaceans, larval insects (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong> (e.g. caddisflies and midges)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, echinoderms (e.g. sea urchins and sand dollars)<strong><sup></sup></strong> and other marine invertebrates, although the seeds and the vegetative parts of tundra plants, sedges and aquatic plants may also be taken on the breeding grounds, and algae, eelgrass <em>Zostera</em> spp. and <em>Ruppia maritima</em> may be taken at sea (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. </p><p><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a slight hollow on dry ground and is usually positioned near water, in the open, or under the cover of driftwood, grass hummocks or rocks (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984; del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  </p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Levels of hunting in this species are poorly regulated in parts of the range and may be unsustainable in some areas. Two to five percent of the population has been harvested annually in Alaska and Canada in recent years (Powell <em>et al.</em> 2012), accounting for 16,000 individuals (Rothe <em>et al</em>. 2015). Harvesting levels can reach 6.9% in the Northwest Territories (Byers and Dickson 2001), while in south west Greenland there has been an estimate of between 10-20% of the winter population killed annually (Hansen 2002). No data is available for Russia. In one study covering the wintering population in southwest Greenland, 22% of adults carried embedded lead shots (Falk <em>et al.</em> 2006). Lethal and sub-lethal levels of lead have also been detected in related Spectacled Eiders Somateria fischeri in Alaska where they are thought to be reducing survival rates (Grand <em>et al.</em> 1998, Flint <em>et al.</em> 2016). Given their overlapping ranges and similar ecologies, King Eiders are likely to be affected in a similar way.</p>  The species is also vulnerable to mortality from bycatch, with 100-200 individuals killed per year around Nuuk, Greenland. Bycatch of all eider species has been reported in Newfoundland, Iceland, Norway, Germany and the Baltic Sea (Merkel 2004). Oil spills poses an additional threat, a small spill in the Pribilof Islands in 1997 caused high Eider mortality. Should an oil spill occur in the eastern Chukchi Sea, a primary staging area for King Eiders during autumn and spring migrations, it would be expected to cause a population decline of between 2.1-3.4% a year in northern Alaska (Bentzen and Powell 2012). Oil fields have been developed in areas where King Eider nests in northern Alaska, but no decline in numbers has been documented (Powell <em>et al.</em> 2012), with pollution from spills being a greater threat than the disturbance of oil exploration activities and development of platforms. Climate change poses an ongoing and future threat to the species through ocean acidification and habitat shifting. Decreased pH values of seawater may lead to declines in molluscs which are key prey items in eider diets (Steinacher <em>et al</em>. 2009, USFWS 2010, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Remote sensing has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2005, Riordan <em>et al.</em> 2006) which could constitute breeding habitat loss. However, no link between wetland loss and population decline has been demonstrated. Climate change is still predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the sensitive Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015), likely to alter the population dynamics of this high arctic species.<p></p>  <p></p>","The global population is estimated to number c.800,000-900,000&#160;individuals (Wetlands International 2015), while the population in Russia has been estimated at c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals (Brazil 2009).&#160;The European population is estimated at 37,500-45,500 pairs, which equates to 75,000-91,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"The King Eider breeds along the Arctic coasts of Europe, North America and Asia.

Further studies are needed to determine the causes of these declines, and whether some populations may have shifted to unsurveyed areas within the range.  <p></p> <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong>. It begins to breed in June, nesting sometimes in single pairs in very low densities (roughly one pair per 100 acres was recorded on the Kashunuk River in the 1960s)<strong></strong> (Johnsgard 1978), but occasionally in small colonies of up to 60+ nests (Kear 2005). Around the time of hatching, males gather in large flocks off the coast near the breeding ground (Johnsgard 1978). Shortly after hatching, the female moves her brood to the coast where they form 'herds' (Johnsgard 1978). The species migrates up to 3000km to its moulting sites (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, where it becomes flightless for a period, before some continue migration to more distant wintering sites (Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. The timing of the moult migration appears to be highly variable, occurring sometimes as early as August, but in some years not until November, in which case the moult occurs prior to arrival (Johnsgard 1978). On the moulting grounds it forms flocks that may exceed 50,000 birds (Laubhan and Metzner 1999, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. Congregations of a similar size also occur also in the spring when pair formation occurs prior to departure for the breeding grounds (Kear 2005). Spring migration commences in March in East Asia (Kear 2005). Elsewhere it begins in April, usually peaking in May (Kear 2005).<strong> </strong>Arrivals on the breeding grounds begin in early June (Kear 2005). Some small flocks remain throughout the summer in the wintering quarters at Varangerfjiord (Kear 2005).&#160;<strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em><strong> </strong>This species regularly breeds several kilometres inland (Kear 2005). It inhabits pools of various shapes and sizes in areas that characterise flat coastal belt within open tundra (Kear 2005). In the Lena Delta and Barrow areas it favours moss-lichen polygonal tundra (Kear 2005). It forages in areas of fresh, saline or brackish water, as well as in tidal flats (Johnsgard 1978). Following hatching all birds move to coastal habitats (Johnsgard 1978). <em>Non-breeding </em>It winters mostly at sea, along low-lying rocky coasts, frequenting bays and river mouths<strong> </strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). It forages in water that is less than 10m deep<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>, and particularly favours areas where freshwater streams enter the sea<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>Madge and Burn 1988).<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>Diet </strong>It feeds chiefly on molluscs, crustaceans and other marine invertebrates (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992)<strong></strong>. During the breeding season, some freshwater prey is taken including chironomid and caddisfly larvae (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. During moult, bivalve molluscs are the primary food source (Petersen 1981)<strong></strong>.<strong>&#160;</strong><strong>Breeding site</strong> Nests are built on small hummocks or in depressions between hummocks, usually within a few metres of a tundra pond, and are often well-concealed by grass (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. The nests are deep and lined with lichens, grass and down (Kear 2005). <strong> </strong> <p></p>","<p>Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Recent dramatic changes in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness north of Alaska and Russia may affect eiders in unknown ways. In addition, climate change is causing the loss of Arctic tundra ponds (Andresen and Lougheed 2015), which could be contributing to declines in the species. In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Increased predation may also result from climate-related collapses in the pattern of cyclical abundance of rodents, as predators target alternative prey in the absence of their main food (Quakenbush <em>et al.</em> 2004, Iles <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p>  <p>Habitat loss also occurs through prospecting for, and the exploitation of, natural resources such as oil and gas (Kear 2005). The increasing traffic of tankers carrying oil from Arctic areas imposes the risk of contamination following spills (Kear 2005). There are concerns in Alaska that a road-building project approved by the United States Congress in 2009 may impact the species (Morse 2009). Disease and water pollution may impact eiders in their wintering area in south-west Alaska. It is not currently clear which of these many factors is driving the overall decline (K. Laing <em>in litt</em>. 2004, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>Over-hunting in Siberia and in other breeding areas may be impacting Steller's Eider populations while large numbers may be taken during the spring migration, though data on levels are poor (Pihl 1997). Subsistence hunting has been ongoing in Alaska since the late 19th century and may have affected breeding populations in this area (Fredrickson 2001). Studies at Barrow indicate that the historical and ongoing use of lead shot in hunting causes lead poisoning, despite being made illegal in a nationwide ban in 1991 (Morse 2009). Eiders breeding in Russia are also subject to human subsistence harvest and exposure to lead shot, where declines in the number of wintering birds on Bering Island, Russia appear to be greater on the west coast near the only village on the island; new protective zones are being proposed there (Y. Artukhin <em>per</em> K. Laing <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Males are subject to particular hunting pressure as they arrive on moulting grounds before females (Morse 2009).</p>  <p>Another threat is mortality resulting from bycatch in gillnet fisheries, which has been documented in Lithuanian waters (Dagys and Žydelis 2002) and resource competition from shellfisheries. Redistribution is likely to have reduced bycatch in some areas, but the foraging ecology of the species puts it at risk from bycatch where they overlap with fishing fleets, for example in Estonia (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  Nest predation by mammalian and avian predators such as Arctic Fox <em>Vulpes lagopus</em>, Snowy Owl <em>Nyctea scandiaca</em> and Pomarine Jaeger <em>Stercorarius pomarinus</em> appears to be a threat on Alaskan breeding grounds. No nesting was observed near Barrow between 2001 and 2004, but nesting has since occurred with some success following the inception of fox control in 2005 (Safine 2011). Increasing human habitation of Arctic regions has increased the range and numbers of Ravens <em>Corvus corax</em> and some large gulls, leading to a greater predation pressures (Kear 2005).<p></p>","Various population estimates include: c.10,000-15,000 wintering individuals in north Norway and the south-east Baltic (based on a count of 4,297 off Kola Peninsula in April 2003 [Krasnov <em>et al.</em> 2004], 2,300 in the whole Baltic in 2009 (Skov <em>et al.</em>, 2011) and c.2,700 wintering off Norway in the same year (Aarvak <em>et al.</em> 2012) Ce.100,000-110,000 wintering individuals were counted in the north Pacific; counts in North America declined from 137,900 in 1992 to 77,300 in 2003, forming the basis of the 2003 North American population estimate of 90,000-95,000 individuals (K.

Ce.20,000 individuals migrate through the Kamchatka Peninsula in spring (Gerasimov and Gerasimov 2003), c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.23,000 wintering individuals were recorded in Russia in March 2009 (Aarvak <em>et al.</em> 2012). The minimum European population in winter is currently estimated at 30,800-41,200 individuals, which equates to 20,500-27,500 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). There is also a marginal breeding population in Europe estimated at 5-50 pairs, which equates to 10-100 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Based on the current European wintering population estimate of 30,800-41,200 individuals (BirdLife International 2015) and an estimate of 100,000-110,000 individuals wintering in the north Pacific, the total population is estimated at c.130,000-150,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species breeds between the Kolyma Delta and the Yamal Peninsula, <strong>Russia</strong>, and on the Arctic plain of Alaska, <strong>U.S.A.&#160;</strong>(C.

Improved knowledge regarding populations outside the Baltic Sea might lead to the species being uplisted to Endangered if the overall rate of decline can be confidently shown to be very rapid.<p></p>","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory although its movements are poorly understood (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. It breeds from late-May onward<strong></strong> in single pairs or loose groups (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>, the males leaving the females soon after the start of incubation <strong></strong> (between late-June and early-September) to gather in small flocks for a flightless moulting period (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. Some populations undergo extensive moult migrations of up to 1,000 km, while others moult on waters near the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Females moult between early-August and early-October on the breeding grounds (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>, often abandoning their young at the start of the moult which then gather into large parentless groups (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. The southward autumn migration occurs from September to October after the post-breeding moult (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong> and non-breeders may oversummer in the wintering areas (Madge and Burn 1988)<strong></strong>. Outside of the breeding season the species is highly gregarious<strong></strong>, in winter gathering into large aggregations of perhaps several tens of thousands of individuals to roost or to feed in inshore and offshore waters (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. The species is diurnal and regularly dives to depths of 3-10 m when foraging, with a maximum dive depth of 50-60 m (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on marshy grass tundra in the high Arctic<strong></strong>, especially where habitat mosaics are formed by hummocks and ridges together with moist depressions<strong></strong>, freshwater lakes<strong></strong>, bogs<strong></strong>, slow rivers<strong></strong> or pools of standing water, it is common among willows or dwarf birch in the arctic-alpine zone (Scandinavia) (Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. It generally avoids wooded tundra (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The species also breeds on small rocky islands off mainland Arctic coasts and on larger offshore islands,  using promontories, deltas<strong></strong>, coastal inlets<strong></strong> and islets in fjords (Greenland) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998<em></em>)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>The species winters at sea, generally far offshore<strong></strong> in waters 10-35 m deep<strong></strong>, as well as in saline, brackish or fresh estuarine waters, brackish lagoons <strong></strong>, and inland (very rarely) on large, deep freshwater lakes (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. <br/><strong>Diet </strong>The species shows a preference for marine foods during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>, its diet consisting predominantly of animal matter such as crustaceans (e.g. amphipods and cladocerans<strong></strong>), molluscs, other marine invertebrates (e.g. echinoderms, worms) and fish (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The species also takes freshwater insects and insect larvae ands well as plant material such as algae, grasses, and the seeds and fruits of tundra plants (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a natural depression on dry ground positioned in the open, amongst vegetation<strong></strong>, partially hidden by overhanging boulders<strong></strong> or under low shrubs (e.g. willows or dwarf birch) usually close to water (Johnsgard 1978, Flint <em>et al</em>. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Although it is not a colonial species some pairs may nest in loose groups, and the species may also nest in association with Arctic Terns (Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","<p>A major decline observed in the wintering population of the Long-tailed Duck in the Baltic Sea coincides with heavy bycatch mortality in gillnet fisheries, with an estimate of at least 90,000 birds (of different species) killed annually (Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2009). This species is highly susceptible to gillnet mortality and is the most frequently recorded victim in the eastern and south eastern Baltic Sea (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011), with annual mortality estimates ranging from 1 to 5% for the total Baltic Sea population (Bellebaum <em>et al.</em> 2013). Age ratios of gillnet victims in the southern Baltic suggest a decline in breeding success of c.75% over the 20th century (J. Bellebaum <em>in litt</em>. 2012). </p>  <p>The effects of chronic oil pollution from small-scale oil discharges in non-breeding areas is a significant threat as Long-tailed Ducks form large aggregations that overlap with major shipping and oil transportation routes. Further expansion of such activity in the northern part of the range is likely to increase the scope of this threat (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Large, catastrophic oil spills still occur, although the frequency of incidence has reduced (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015). Industrial activity within the breeding range poses a threat through direct mortality from oil pollution (Gorski <em>et al</em>. 1977, Kirby <em>et al.</em> 1993, Y. and O. Mineev <em>in litt.</em> 2012, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017) as well as the degradation and loss of wetland habitat due to petroleum pollution, drainage and peat-extraction (Grishanov 2006). Sand and gravel extraction destroys habitats of benthic organisms, which are key prey items. In the Baltic, these activities are currently occurring at insufficient levels to be responsible for declines in waterbirds (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011). A mortality event in 2006-2007 ascribed to pollution resulted in ‘several thousand’ dead Long-tailed Ducks being washed up along the Hatpudirskaya bay coast (Y. and O. Mineev <em>in litt</em>. 2012). Development of large offshore wind farms could have negative effects on the species, through restricting access to foraging areas and by altering the suitability of benthic habitat.</p>  <p>The species has previously suffered heavy losses from avian cholera outbreaks (Friend 2006) and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Future outbreaks of disease may be expected and may compound observed declines in parts of the range. The introduced Round Goby <em>Neogobius melanostomus</em> has become established in the Baltic where it feeds on benthic invertebrates and could affect food supplies for Long-tailed Ducks, with unknown severity of impact (Almquist <em>et al</em>. 2010, Dagys 2017). The Round Goby appear to considerably reduce mussel density in shallow water (less than 20 m) in the Baltic Sea, and the numbers of Long-tailed Duck in these areas have decreased correspondingly (Hearn <em>et a</em>l. 2015).</p>  <p>The species is still hunted across the majority of its range (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The mortality from hunting has fallen considerably in line with the recorded decline in the species, partly due to reduced numbers of birds available but also as a result of tighter regulation and fewer active hunters (Hearn <em>et al</em>. 2015). However, bag size has recently increased in Finland (19,400 birds in 2013), which may reflect greater numbers present during winter (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015). The sustainability of present-day hunting levels is unclear, but these populations are already subject to significant mortality from other threats so require close monitoring. Previous hunting levels cannot be assumed to have been sustainable, and better quantification of additive mortality from all threats is needed to be confident in the size of any harvestable surplus (Hearn <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  The results of autumn migration monitoring at various Baltic sites show that juveniles now represent a very low proportion of the population (Hario <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ellermaa <em>et al.</em> 2010), indicating that insufficient young are being raised to compensate for adult mortality (low recruitment). This low breeding success has been linked to the collapse of the formerly distinctive 3-4 year cycle of Arctic rodent abundance since the mid-1990s as a consequence of climate change, which may lead to greater rates of predation on alternative prey (Hario 2009, Iles <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, breeding success also appears to have declined in locations where rodents are absent, with poor female condition leading to bypassed breeding (A. Kondratyev <em>in litt.</em> 2012). In addition, ocean acidification may impact mollusc density and quality, further reducing prey availability (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009). More information about the effects of climate change on lower trophic levels is required, but prey density and size is likely to be impacted by changes in sea temperature, and key foraging ecologies may be altered, but there is uncertainty over whether resources are lost or have shifted their distribution.<br/><br/><p></p>","The global population is estimated to number 3,200,000 to 3,750,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2017).",Decreasing,"This species has a circumpolar range, breeding on the Arctic coasts of North America (<strong>Canada</strong>, Alaska, <strong>U.S.A.</strong> and <strong>Greenland</strong>), Europe (<strong>Iceland</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>), and Asia (<strong>Russia</strong>). It winters at sea further south, as far as the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, South Carolina and Washington in the United States, <strong>Korea</strong> on the Asian Pacific coast, and other areas including the Black Sea and Caspian Sea (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). According to monitoring data from the Baltic Sea, where the western Siberian and northern European populations winter, the population there has declined significantly since the early 1990s at least (Hario <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ellermaa <em>et al.</em> 2010, Nilsson and Månsson 2010, Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011). An estimated total of c.4,272,000 individuals was counted there in 1992-1993, falling to c.1,486,000 individuals in 2007-2009, which suggests that a decline of c.65% has occurred over a period of 16 years (Skov <em>et al</em>. 2011). Research on the tundra of eastern European Russia since 1973 suggests that a steep decline may have occurred there (Y. and O. Mineev&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012). There is no evidence to suggest that the geographical distribution of this population has shifted sufficiently to account for this decline (Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011, L. Nilsson <em>in litt</em>. 2011, J. Bellebaum i<em>n litt.</em> 2012, M. Ellermaa <em>in litt.</em> 2012), though small increases in wintering numbers have been recorded in Finland. The estimation of a real and severe decline is supported by data from migration bottlenecks in the Gulf of Finland where the numbers observed on migration have fallen dramatically since the early 1990s at least (A. Lehikoinen <em>et al. in litt.</em> 2012).&#160;North America holds the second largest population (c.1 million birds [Wetlands International 2017]). The Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey (WBPHS) indicates large declines from the early 1950s but a relatively stable population since 1989 (Flint 2013); on a shorter time-scale, the population appears to have declined from 1980 to 2002 and then increased from 2007 to 2012 (Bowman <em>et al. </em>2015). Population trends vary among regional surveys; breeding numbers on the Arctic Coastal Plain were stable during 1986-2012 but increasing 2003-2012; on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding numbers were stable during 1988-2012 but decreased during 2003-2012; on western Victoria Island, Northwest Territories, breeding numbers probably decreased from 1992-94 to 2004-05; and on Kodiak Island, Alaska, wintering numbers were stable during 1991-2005 (Raven and Dickson 2006; Zwiefelhofer <em>et al. </em>2008; Stehn <em>et al.</em> 2013; Bowman <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;However, this species is especially poorly monitored because its breeding distribution is largely outside the area covered by breeding waterfowl surveys, and because of its offshore distribution during winter and the lack of comprehensive winter surveys (T.

Some populations may also be sedentary (many remain in the Red Sea area all year round) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species breeds in the Summer&#160;(usually between April and October; Olsen and Larsson 2003), and usually nests colonially (e.g. in small loose colonies on the larger islands in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea), or occasionally solitarily (e.g. in Africa),&#160;with 1-3 pairs per island often amidst colonies of other species (Urban&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).

It is found at harbours and ports, and forages inshore, in intertidal zones (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), and up to 10 km beyond reefs (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), rarely extending up to 140 km offshore (Cramp and Simmons 1983, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). It nests on coastal or inshore coral islands preferring smaller outer islands of old coral that are sparsely vegetated, rocky and sandy, preferably protected from the ocean by live reef (Cramp and Simmons 1983). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists mainly of dead fish and fishermen's offal, as well as tern eggs and chicks (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), the eggs of White-eyed Gull <em>Larus leucophthalmus</em> (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), turtle hatchlings (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), prawns and small fish (Cramp and Simmons 1983). It poses a threat to other species as it is a serious local predator of eggs and chicks in colonies of other seabirds (Gallagher <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a scrape or depression in bare coral (Kenya) (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996), under mangrove bushes on a bed of leaves, under <em>Suaeda</em> bushes in loose sand (Somalia) (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), or under low hanging coral (Red Sea) (Cramp and Simmons 1983, del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) on exposed promontories (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986).","The Sooty Gull is vulnerable to oil spills (Javed <em>et al</em>. 2005) and is at risk of habitat degradation due to land reclamation for oil prospecting in the Gulf region (Javed <em>et al</em>. 2005) as well as disturbance to breeding birds from future oil drilling in Tanzania (Cooper <em>et al</em>. 1984). The main predation pressure on this species likely comes from humans, with nests in Astola Island, Pakistan, regularly robbed of eggs, and a reduction in the number of breeding birds in the Seychelles due to egg collection for human consumption (Blackburn and Bird 2013).","Delany and Scott (2006) estimate the population to be 150,000-300,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"The Sooty Gull can be found in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, east to south <strong>Pakistan</strong> and south to northern <strong>Kenya</strong> (Kiunga Islands) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996).",,Terrestrial|Marine,,Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Over the next three generations (18 years), this decline is likely to become rapid  as a result of land reclamation on tidal flats and disturbance at colonies, resulting in the species's listing as Vulnerable. <p></p> <p></p>","The species nests on the ground and is restricted to common seepweed <em>Suaeda glauca </em>saltmarsh habitats. Wintering birds are found on estuarine tidal flats, with regular movements between different sites, dependent on weather and food supply.<p></p>","<p>The key threat facing this species is loss and degradation of the tidal flats and saltmarshes, and the subsequent loss of Common Seepweed <em>Suaeda glauca</em>, which is essential for breeding. In Yancheng National Nature Reserve, one of three breeding and wintering areas in China, the area of Common Seepweed reduced by 79% between 1992 and 2007, with the majority being replaced by aquaculture ponds (Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2010). Farmland area increased by 12% within Yancheng National Nature Reserve (Jiang <em>et al.</em> 2010), likely contributing to the loss of Common Seepweed. Further to this, there has been a continual increase in the ‘built-up’ area of Yancheng NNR in the period 1988-2006 (Ke <em>et al.</em> 2011), likely both for housing and commercial use. Reclamation developments associated with the Tianjin New Coastal District project, started in 2006, seriously impacted an important wintering area by autumn 2011, resulting in a substantial loss of inter-tidal mudflats in Tianjin municipality (P. Holt <em>in litt</em>. 2012). This conversion has occurred across much of the breeding range. Land use changes cause fragmentation of costal landscape and decreasing breeding habitat; changing water levels lead to losses of nests and chicks from rising water. There are no regulations to prevent the continued building of factories in Yancheng NNR (Jiang <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p>The introduced invasive <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> is displacing Common Seepweed in large swathes of habitat. The area of Yancheng NNR occupied by <em>Spartina </em><em> alterniflora</em> increased by almost 400% between 1992 and 2007, over 90% of the increased area was mudflat prior to the growth&#160; of&#160;&#160;<em><em>Spartina </em>alterniflora</em> (Jiang <em>et al.</em> 2010). The colonisation of mudflats by&#160;<em><em>Spartina</em> alterniflora</em>&#160;causes sedimentation and constrains the natural transition of coastal vegetation, causing seepweed patches to thicken and become unsuitable for nesting (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2010). In 2010, only two patches of<em> </em><em><em>Suaeda </em> glauca</em> communities suitable for breeding remained in Yancheng NNR.</p>  <p>Egg collection represents a significant threat; major breeding site Shuangtai Hekou NNR supports 20,000 seasonal employees, known to collect eggs for food. Egg collection is also a problem in Yancheng NNR (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2009). Small-scale collection of bio resources, such as crabs, clamworm and seepweed, which disrupts incubation and causes desertion of breeding sites, increases risk of predation of chicks and eggs (Jiang<em> et al.&#160;</em>2010) and has been recorded in Yancheng NNR and Shuangtai Hekou NNR.</p>  <p>The Yellow River Delta NNR, the third major breeding site for <em>Saundersilarus saundersi</em> in China, contains China’s second largest oilfield (The Diplomat 2016). This likely contributes to habitat loss and degradation, with the oil extraction activities thought to contribute to the high level of subsidence in the area (Zhang et al. 2015), as well as the disturbance of birds. Oil field exploration has been undertaken within Shuangtai Hekou National Park, with more than 100 drilling sites in 2002 (Kanai <em>et al</em>. 2002). There have not been any studies on the specific impacts to Saunders's Gull, however it does not seem to be causing significant decline in the population.</p><p></p>","A population estimate of 14,400 mature individuals has been derived from analysis of records and surveys by BirdLife International (2011).

The species may also occur on freshwater lakes and estuaries during migration<strong> </strong>(Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, as well as crustaceans, worms, echinoderms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), amphipods, isopods<strong></strong> (Kear 2005), small fish, and (in freshwater habitats) adult and larval insects<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species may also consume plant material on its breeding grounds<strong></strong> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. leaves and shoots)<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression positioned on the ground<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in tall grass, among hummocks or under bushes<strong> </strong>(Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), usually within 100 m of open water (occasionally up to 2-3 km away)<strong></strong> (Kear 2005).

Collision mortality is also likely to be a minor threat as collisions rates between ducks and wind turbines are low compared with other species groups, which is consistent with their high avoidance rates at offshore wind farms (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). </p>  <p>There is a small risk that future outbreaks of H5N1 (avian influenza) could pose a risk to the species (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is mostly asymptomatic in wild birds and there is no record of significant mortality in this species. </p>  <p></p><strong></strong><p></p>","The global population has been estimated at 600,000-1,000,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006), probably including c.400,000-700,000 mature individuals, on the basis that they account for around 2/3 of the population.",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,,Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The species mainly forages by diving and may feed at depths of 30-40 m during the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on wooded<strong><sup> </sup></strong>coastlines (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005), small freshwater lakes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005), pools and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998) in northern coniferous forests (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005), wooded Arctic tundra (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) and alpine zones (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005); especially where there are boulder-covered or small rocky islands available for nesting with extensive herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and low trees (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> The majority winter at sea on shallow inshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), especially in estuaries or inlets where there are large mussel-beds (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also occur on freshwater lakes and estuaries during migration<strong> </strong>(Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, as well as crustaceans, worms, echinoderms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), amphipods, isopods (Kear 2005), small fish, and (in freshwater habitats) adult and larval insects<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species may also consume plant material on its breeding grounds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. leaves and shoots) (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow depression positioned on the ground<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) in tall grass, among hummocks or under bushes<strong> </strong>(Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), usually within 100 m of open water (occasionally up to 2-3 km away) (Kear 2005).</p>  <p></p>","<p>Hunting poses a significant threat to the species, with an estimated harvest of 6,000 – 14,000 individuals in the 10-year period from 2004-2014 in US and Canada, but with a downward trend (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). A recent estimate suggests that the harvest of White-winged Scoters may be 29-37% over the maximum sustainable rate (Koneff <em>et al.</em> 2017).  </p><p>The species feeds at depths of 30–40 m and is therefore highly susceptible to bycatch in fishing nets, as documented by Good <em>et al.</em> (2009) in the Salient Sea, Washington. Moulting and wintering populations are also vulnerable to oil spills as they often occur in high densities in close proximity to oil transportation routes. One catastrophic spill could impact a large proportion of the population. Oil pollution can also cause the long-term disruption of food supplies which may have more serious effects on populations in the long-term than direct mortality from oiling. Lance (2001) documented evidence for a long-term negative effect as a result of the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident. The disturbance and habitat degradation caused by increasing levels of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic will likely have only minor or negligible impacts on this species (Poland <em>et al. </em>2003, Henderson and Loe 2014). </p>  <p>In some locations in the Pacific Northwest, sea ducks could be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium associated with mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, which raises the possibility that such exposure could be contributing to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). Climate change is an additional threat, with remote sensing showing the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska (Riordan <em>et al.</em> 2006), with these wetlands providing important breeding grounds for the species at present. In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch, projected to cause a 31.0% population decline between 1980 and 2080 (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of White-winged Scoter diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","There is apparently no reliable estimate of this species's total population, and further research is needed.",Decreasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,,Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The population is undergoing a continuing decline owing to hunting, nesting disturbance and the modification and burning of its habitat. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is mostly sedentary, although it may make some movements in order to find optimal feeding habitat as water levels vary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. In South Sudan there are regular seasonal movements between feeding and breeding zones<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Guillet 1978)<strong></strong>. It is very solitary. Even within the pair, male and female will often feed at opposite ends of their territory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Loose aggregations may occasionally occur where receding water levels and large numbers of fish become concentrated in a small area (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It breeds solitarily, usually maintaining a density of fewer than three nests per square kilometre (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). The breeding season is long. Eggs are laid at the end of the rains, as waters start to recede, and chicks fledge towards the end of the dry season (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding </em>It both breeds and forages in seasonally flooded marshes, but may utilise separate habitats for foraging and breeding (Renson 1998, Ngwenyama 2012).<strong></strong> The vegetation in these flooded marshes is dominated by a mixture of papyrus <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, reeds e.g. <em>Phragmites</em> spp., cattails<em> </em><em>Typha</em> spp. and grasses, particularly <em>Miscanthidium</em> spp. (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992).<em> </em>It is often found in areas with abundant floating vegetation, often papyrus (Baker 1996)<strong></strong>. It also uses permanent non-papyrus swamps in areas such as the Malagarasi (Tanzania) (Dinesen and Baker 2006) and Lake Victoria (Uganda)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Dinesen <em>in litt</em>. 2007). <em>Non-breeding </em>It usually forages in shallow water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong><strong></strong> where it makes use of clear channels among the vegetation that have been created by the movements of large mammals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It tends to avoid areas where the vegetation is too dense to be penetrated easily, or is taller than the bird's back (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It is reported to prefer water that is poorly oxygenated, where fish are forced to surface to breathe, and are thus more easily caught (Guillet 1978)<strong></strong>, which is why it is thought not to frequent swamps that are characterised by papyrus alone (Guillet 1978). In South Sudan it has been known to forage on rice fields and other flooded plantations (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992).<strong> Diet </strong>When feeding, it shows a preference for lungfish <em>Protopterus aethiopicus</em>, but takes a variety of fish species including Senegal Bichir <em>Polypterus senegalus</em>, catfish <em>Clarias</em> spp. and tilapia <em>Tilapia </em>spp. (Guillet 1979, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It also preys on aquatic animals such as amphibians, young crocodiles and watersnakes (Briggs 2007<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span>Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992), and may even take rodents and young waterfowl (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). Diet seems to vary geographically: lungfish and catfish are the main prey species in Uganda, and catfish and watersnakes the preferred diet in Zambia (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, Mullers and Amar 2015a).<strong> Breeding site </strong>The nest is grassy construction, up to 3 m wide, on a mound of floating vegetation or a small island (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>, and often among dense stands of papyrus (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). The maximum clutch size is three, although usually only one nestling will survive, with rare records of two chicks fledging (Mullers and Amar 2015b). The species can live for around 50 years (although it is likely to live less long in the wild [R. Mullers <em>in litt. </em>2016]),&#160;takes three to four years to reach reproductive maturity, and is monogamous.<strong> </strong> <p></p>","Throughout most of its range, the species is threatened by habitat destruction and degradation, disturbance, hunting, and capture for the bird trade (see Collar and Stuart 1985, Baker 1996, T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002). Suitable habitat is being converted for cultivation and pasture, and cattle have been known to trample nests (Briggs 2007), while in Uganda and the Sudd exploration for oil may impact this species by altering its habitat and the oil polluting the environment (Dodman 2013). Pollution may also be significant in Uganda, where agrochemicals and tannery effluents run off or are disposed of into Lake Victoria (Dodman 2013). The species is hunted for food and cultural reasons, for example it may be viewed as a bad omen. It is also captured for the zoo trade, which is a problem especially in Tanzania where trading of the species is still legal (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>. Interviews with people in the Bangweulu Wetlands (Zambia) indicate that eggs and chicks are taken for consumption and sale, probably to zoos or collectors (Roxburgh <em>et al. </em>2006). Five chicks per month were estimated as taken for trade in one district in 2011, with only two individuals surviving the transit (D. Ngwenyama <em>in litt</em>. 2011). In 2007, an undisclosed number of specimens, illegally imported from Tanzania, were confiscated by the Danish authorities in Copenhagen<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Dinesen <em>in litt</em>. 2007) and at least two birds were exported from Tanzania to a zoo in the USA (T. Dodman <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Small-scale trading poses a serious threat to small local populations rather than the global population (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>, though recent reports suggest that levels of disturbance and trade are not sustainable in Zambia (T. Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011). Breeding success may be as low as 10% annually in Bangweulu, mainly due to human disturbance (Mullers and Amar 2015b). During the 2011-2013 breeding seasons, only 10 out of 25 chicks successfully fledged: four chicks were killed in fires, one was depredated&#160;and 10 were taken by humans (R. Muller <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Zambia, fire and drought threaten habitat (especially in Bangweulu, where a decline is apparent) (T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002)<strong></strong>, there is some evidence for trapping and persecution (T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002)<strong></strong>, and nests are trampled by large herbivores feeding in the swamps (Renson 1998)<strong></strong>. Conflict in Rwanda and DRC has disrupted protected areas (e.g. Akagera National Park) that support the species (T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002)<strong></strong>, and the proliferation of firearms has greatly facilitated hunting. In South Sudan, its stronghold, it has been said to be ""very much endangered by destruction of papyrus swamps by cattle and fire"" (Nikolaus 1987)<strong></strong>. Between 1952 and 1980 the area of the Sudd swamps of South Sudan increased (Howell <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong></strong> from 6,700 km<sup>2</sup> to 19,200 km<sup>2</sup>. Whilst this habitat was earlier threatened by drainage due to plans for the Jonglei Canal, these plans are no longer supported, though canalisation and related schemes for the oil industry do pose a threat&#160; (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> 2008). The construction of several dams along the lower Nile will allow artificial manipulation of water levels in the Sudd (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>. In the Malagarasi, large areas of miombo woodland adjacent to swamps are being cleared for tobacco farming and agriculture, and the human population, which includes fishermen, farmers and semi-nomadic pastoralists, has increased very rapidly in recent decades (Dinesen and Baker 2006). In this region, dry-season burning and cattle-grazing in the species's core area are severe and expanding, and the first rice paddies have appeared at the edge of the species's key swamps. Over four years only 7 of 13 nests were successful at this location (John <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;Also in Malagarasi, a railway line has bisected swamps and rice paddies in some of its core areas<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Dinesen <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Records of birds outside their core areas may be due to the displacement of birds by fires in dry years <strong></strong>(Dinesen and Baker 2006).<p></p>","The total population has been estimated at 5,000-8,000 individuals (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> 2002), and a total population estimate of fewer than 10,000 individuals is supported by Dinesen and Baker (2006). The range of 5,000-8,000 individuals roughly equates to 3,300-5,300 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Balaeniceps rex</em> is widely but very locally distributed in large swamps from <strong>South Sudan</strong> to <strong>Zambia</strong>. Approximate national estimates proposed by T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> to Wetlands International (2002) are: c.5,000 in South Sudan (50-80% of the total population [Briggs 2007]), 100-150 in <strong>Uganda</strong> (but possibly over 200 [Briggs 2007]),<strong>&#160;</strong><strong></strong>100-500 in western <strong>Tanzania</strong> (this figure also proposed by Dinesen and Baker [2006]), &lt;500 in<strong> Zambia</strong><strong> </strong>(Roxburgh and Buchanan<em> </em>[2010] gave a later estimate of 1,760, with 1,296 in the Bangweulu Swamps alone, but this is possibly an over-estimate [F. Willems <em>in litt. </em>2016]), &lt;1,000 in the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo </strong>(DRC), irregular visitors in the <strong>Central African Republic</strong>, &lt;50 in <strong>Rwanda</strong><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>&lt;50 in<strong> Ethiopia</strong>. In 1997, the population was estimated to be 12,000-15,000 individuals (Rose and Scott 1997), but a more recent review makes a conservative estimate of 5,000-8,000 individuals (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> to Wetlands International 2002). This figure may prove too low, depending on research into the South Sudan populations (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> to Wetlands International 2002). An estimate of 3,830 birds was given for the Sudd (including areas of Zeraf Reserve) by Fay <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2007). A total population of less than 10,000 individuals is supported by a literature review in which the extent of certain wetland habitats was found to have been significantly overestimated by previous studies. Surveys in September-October 2005 support the suggestion that there are a few hundred individuals in the Malagarasi region of Tanzania (Briggs 2007). There is little doubt that the species is declining in Tanzania, Zambia and Rwanda, with possible declines in Uganda as well, and the species may be more threatened than available information suggests<strong> </strong>(L.

It is a bentho-pelagic species that occurs from inshore and estuarine areas to offshore habitats in depths of up to 100 m. It is the most productive sawfish species, reaching maturity early (2–3 yr) and having intrinsic rates of population increase &gt;0.27 yr<sup>-1</sup>, making it less susceptible to fishing pressure than other sawfish species. However, it does have the highest post release mortality of all sawfish species. While the current population size and its historic abundance are unknown, it persists in most of its range states, but in substantially lower numbers than historically. Like other sawfishes, the toothed rostrum and demersal occurrence makes Narrow Sawfish extremely susceptible to capture in gillnets and demersal trawl nets. The species has been affected by commercial net and trawl fisheries, which operate in inshore areas of its range, reductions in habitat quality and coastal development, the impacts of which have cumulatively led to population decline. This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, is protected in some range states as a no-take species, and is sheltered in some areas that are closed to fishing; but these actions alone will not be sufficient to ensure its survival in some regions. Ongoing fishing and development is likely to lead to future population declines. Despite a lack of quantitative data to support declines, current information indicates that Narrow Sawfish across its Indo-West Pacific range are considerably more rare than historically recorded. Declines of between 50 and 70% over three generation lengths (~18 years) are suspected and have primarily been attributed to ongoing capture in commercial net and trawl fisheries, with the Narrow Sawfish being particularly susceptible given it has poor post-release survival.<br/><br/>The previous assessment of this species was Critically Endangered. However, given the new information that has become available since the last assessment and the fact that the more dramatic declines have happened outside of the three generation period (~18 years), the species now meets the criteria for an Endangered listing (representing a non-genuine change in status based on new information available since the time of the last assessment).<span lang=""EN-CA""><strong><em></em></strong>  <p></p>","The Narrow Sawfish is a bentho-pelagic species that inhabits estuarine, inshore and offshore waters to at least 40 m depth (Last and Stevens 2009). Inshore and estuarine waters are critical habitats for juveniles and pupping females, whilst adults predominantly occur offshore (Peverell 2005). <br/><br/>Narrow Sawfish mature at two to three years of age, at around 200 cm total length (TL) and 230 cm TL for males and females, respectively (Peverell 2005). They are estimated to live, on average, to nine years and have a generation length of approximately six years (Peverell 2005, Tobin <em>et al</em>. 2010, Moreno Iturria 2012). They are presumed to have an annual birth cycle, with an average of 12 pups per litter (Peverell 2005, D’Anastasi 2010). Preliminary genetic research suggests that, in contrast to most elasmobranchs, Narrow Sawfish may not have multiple fathers per litter (D’Anastasi 2010). Intrinsic rates of population increase based on life history data from the exploited population in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, has been estimated to be around 0.27 yr<sup>-1</sup> (Moreno Iturria 2012), with a population doubling time of ~2.6 yr. These demographic parameters indicate that this species is more productive than other species of sawfish, which may explain why this species has persisted longer under moderate to heavy fishing pressure, while other sawfish species have disappeared.","The toothed rostrum of Narrow Sawfish, and their primarily coastal distribution, makes them highly susceptible to fishing pressure through entanglement of their rostrum in fishing gear and habitat degradation, which has resulted in populations becoming increasingly rare and fragmented. Demand for their high value products, along with their high incidental catch rates and high post release mortality (Peverell 2005, Tobin <em>et al</em>. 2010) are the drivers of the threat posed by fisheries. Fishing, especially gillnetting and trawling, is the most pervasive threat to Narrow Sawfish (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2005, Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007). Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) catch may be a threat for Narrow Sawfish in many regions, such as northern Australia where it has been well documented (Lack and Sant 2008). An assessment of the sustainability of sharks and rays in Australian fisheries reported in Salini <em>et al</em>. (2007) found Narrow Sawfish to be at high risk of being fished unsustainably due to their high catchability in fishing gear, and their life history. More recent work on age and growth of this species has shown them to be more productive than other sawfishes and a more recent ecological risk assessment identified them as being at medium risk of being overfished (Tobin <em>et al</em>. 2010). The level of risk is likely to be much higher through most of the rest of its range because fishing levels in northern Australia are relatively light.<br/><br/>In general, juveniles, which use inshore nursery grounds, interact regularly with coastal and estuarine gillnet fisheries (Peverell 2005). Pregnant females also interact with inshore net fisheries (see D’Anastasi 2010). Late stage juveniles and mature animals tend to interact with offshore gillnet and trawl fisheries (Peverell 2005, Northern Territory Government Department of Regional Development, Primary Industry, Fisheries and Resources 2008, Stapley and Rose 2009).<br/><br/>In Australian waters, Narrow Sawfish are the most commonly caught sawfish in the Northern Territory (Field <em>et al</em>. 2008), Gulf of Carpentaria (Peverell 2005), Queensland east coast (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Western Australia (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2005, McAuley <em>et al</em>. 2005). Commercial fishery catches of Narrow Sawfish in Australian waters remain significant, including in the inshore gillnet fishery on the east coast of Queensland, with Narrow Sawfish making up ~1.1% of the total elasmobranch catch (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011). In addition to the demersal net and trawl fisheries in which all sawfishes are caught, Narrow Sawfish are also caught in pelagic gillnets (i.e. those that do not reach the sea floor), indicating a more diverse set of threats from fishing gear. Narrow Sawfish rostra and fins have also been confiscated from illegal foreign fishing vessels in Australian waters (Salini <em>et al</em>. 2007b, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The presence of distinct genetic stocks suggests that if localised depletions do occur, populations may not necessarily be replenished by adjacent stocks within ecologically relevant timeframes (D’Anastasi 2010). The low mitochondrial genetic diversity observed in Australia may also be a risk factor since populations with lower genetic diversity may be at greater risk of losing genetic diversity to a point where losses cannot be recovered and this can lead to inbreeding depression and/or reduced resilience (Frankham 2003, D’Anastasi 2010, Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>Coastal development associated with the rapidly expanding mining industry (including mineral, coal, gas and oil mining and associated processing plants and port facilities) is a growing threat to Narrow Sawfish. Increased urbanisation of coastlines is a growing threat too. These activities result in the modification and/or destruction of critical habitat and lead to degraded water quality through pollution (see Mudd and Patterson 2010 for an example). Given the species reliance on estuarine and inshore coastal areas, where most development and pollution is occurring, these threats are of growing concern, although relative to fishing, they are unlikely to substantially affect global status.","Genetic and morphological data supports the division of the global range of the Narrow Sawfish into subpopulations (Faria <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Australia, subpopulations on the west and east coasts form distinct genetic stocks, with the Gulf of Carpentaria likely forming a third stock (D’Anastasi 2010, Green 2013). This indicates limited dispersal of at least females. It also indicates that remaining global stocks are likely to be distinct and non-interbreeding, resulting in significant population structure. Genetic diversity, based on mitochondrial DNA, throughout Australian waters is low overall (and lowest on the east coast), with the Narrow Sawfish having the lowest genetic diversity of all sawfish species that occur in Australian waters (D’Anastasi 2010). The genetic diversity throughout the rest of the range is unknown.<br/><br/>Although Narrow Sawfish were relatively common throughout their global distribution, they have declined to varying degrees throughout their range. Accurate estimation of levels of decline are difficult to determine due to the lack of species-specific baseline data (but see Peverell 2008, D’Anastasi 2010, Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011). Declines are masked by extremely poor reporting practices, misidentification (Giles <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stapley and Rose 2009) and the absence of adequate observer programmes. Available catch data and anecdotal evidence indicate severe global declines since the 1960s. Populations are suspected to have declined by 50-70% over the last ~20 years (three generation lengths), with 80% of the population thought to have been lost since the 1960s.<br/><br/>Data from the Queensland Shark Control Program in Australia, which operates ‘bather protection’ fishing gear along the Queensland east coast shows a clear decline in sawfish catch (non species-specific) over a 50-year period from the 1960s and the complete disappearance of sawfish in southern regions of the state (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2005). Northern Australia, particularly the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia (R. McAuley pers. comm. 2012), the Northern Territory (Field <em>et al</em>. 2008), the Gulf of Carpentaria (Peverell 2005), and parts of the Queensland east coast (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011), contain the most viable, ecologically functional populations that remain worldwide. Even within these areas, populations are likely to have declined significantly from historic levels. Their presence in fisheries bycatch suggests that viable stocks currently remain.<br/><br/>Landings in India are also still reported (K.K. Bineesh pers. comm. 2012). Narrow Sawfish are now considered rare in many places where evidence is available, including parts of India (Roy 2010), parts of Bangladesh (Roy 2010), Myanmar (FIRMS 2007–2012), parts of Malaysia (including Borneo) (Almada-Villela 2002, Manjaji 2002), Indonesia (although remnant populations could still exist in the Java Sea) (White and Kyne 2010, P. Last pers. comm. 2012), Thailand (Vidthayanon 1997, Compagno 2002a, CITES 2007), and Singapore (CITES 2007). The last published record from the Straits of Hormuz towards the western edge of its range, is from 1997 (A.B.M. Moore pers. comm. 2012). <br/><br/>The status of populations in the remainder of its range, where surveys or catch monitoring are poor, is uncertain. It is however likely that these populations have declined substantially from pristine levels due to the high level of fishing in many of these areas.",Decreasing,"<p><span lang=""EN-CA"">The exact historic distribution of Narrow Sawfish is uncertain, but it is highly likely that its full range extended from the Persian (Arabian) Gulf, across southern Asia and the Indo-Australian Archipelago, and north to Japan and South Korea (Last and Stevens 2009, A.B.M. Moore pers. comm. 2012). The western extreme of the range may reach as far as Somalia, with some reports from this region (M.T. McDavitt pers. comm. 2012). The Gulf of Chihli, China, South Korea and the southern portion of Japan are reported as the northernmost extent of occurrence, although this needs clarification <span lang=""EN-CA"">(Fowler 1941, Misra 1969, Chen and Chung 1971, Compagno and Cook 1995)<span lang=""EN-CA"">. The central coasts of western and eastern Australia are confirmed as the southernmost extent (see D’Anastasi 2010).&#160;</span></p>","Narrow Sawfish fins, rostra, meat, liver oil and skin are all highly valued elasmobranch products (Compagno <em>et al</em>. 2005, Lack and Sant 2008, Lack and Sant 2009). They have been the focus of target fisheries and also retained as bycatch throughout the Indo-West Pacific, including Australia. This has resulted in severe global declines in extent of occurrence. Their fins are particularly valuable as they have a high density of fin needles and can be marketed as ‘white fin’ (considered more valuable than regular shark fin), which are preferred attributes for shark fin soup (CITES 2007). Narrow Sawfish products have also been used as decorations, in ceremonial rituals and for medicinal purposes in Australia, China (McDavitt 1996, McDavitt and Charvet-Almeida 2004) and Myanmar (FIRMS 2007-2012). See CITES (2007) for a comprehensive overview of trade in sawfishes.",Marine,"At the global level, Narrow Sawfish are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I, which forbids international trade in the majority of cases. There is a ban on trade in pristid products on eBay, but this is currently ineffective because it is not enforced and material is only removed if it is reported by outside parties. In Australia, legislative protection for Narrow Sawfish as a ‘no-take’ species is in place in Western Australia and Queensland. There are no protections in place in commercial fisheries in the Northern Territory or Commonwealth waters. The take of sawfish is banned in India, but the level of compliance is low, with Narrow Sawfish still being recorded in landings (K.K. Bineesh pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>In Australia, codes of practice and training in safe handling of sawfish, as well as measures to avoid catching them, have been promoted in all states and territories. While Narrow Sawfish are the most productive sawfish, they also have the lowest levels of survival following capture and handling (Salini et al. 2007). Careful handling and live release of Narrow Sawfish may play a role in reducing fishery effects, however unlike other sawfish, high post release mortality in this species may ameliorate the positive benefits of good handling practices.<br/><br/>Closures (spatial and temporal) are likely to provide Narrow Sawfish with some level of protection (see D’Anastasi 2010, Tobin <em>et al</em>. 2010). For example, inshore net fisheries in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland have seasonal spatial closures of varying durations between October and January to protect spawning barramundi stocks. These closures afford some protection to a portion of the Narrow Sawfish population, including a portion of the pupping female population (for example, pupping females have been observed inshore in Queensland during October). Some permanent spatial closures implemented within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Representative Areas Program rezoning in 2004 and in Princess Charlotte Bay in 2006 may have benefited Narrow Sawfish. The Northern Territory Government implemented a temporary spatial closure in 2008 in response to the killing of a considerable number of young Narrow Sawfish that was deemed unsustainable.&#160; <br/>Fishing gear modifications offer some options for reducing the bycatch of sawfish. Turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) are mandatory in all Australian prawn trawl fisheries and a study by Brewer <em>et al</em>. (2006) showed that the use of TEDs in a prawn trawl fishery reduced catch of Narrow Sawfish, although the realised conservation benefit may be limited (see Griffiths <em>et al</em>. 2006). Brewer <em>et al</em>. (2006) also found that 20% of sawfish were entangled in the top of nets before they reach the TED and it was suggested that lining the front section of the net with canvas, fine metal mesh or tough flexible plastic had potential to reduce sawfish bycatch further, but this remains untested.","",,false,false,Global

Anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk31280999"">The IUCN Red List criteria prioritise indices of mature animals at their breeding area. I</a>n the absence of such data for the eel, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of European Eels, leaving ‘continental’ waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of (pre-) spawning stock biomass, but such data sets for migrating silver eel are low in number, spatially limited and only recent (most only since 2010). The index data best representing the geographic range of <em>A. anguilla</em><em>, </em>over adequate time scales to apply the Red List criteria<em>,</em><em> </em>relate to glass eels, but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood (Westerberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). While there are hypotheses that certain regions may have greater importance for the spawning stock (e.g. Dekker, 2004, Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011), evidence is lacking to support such hypotheses and to deviate from the common view that the European Eel is a panmictic species, i.e. all individuals come from a single spawning stock. As such, escapement from a specific river/country/region will not be directly reflected in subsequent recruitment as this relies on the spawning stock as a whole, irrespective of escapement location. Furthermore, it is most precautionary to assume that each and every part of the continental distribution area potentially contributes to the reproductive process, or that each part may be the key part (Dekker 1999). Therefore, the IUCN Red List criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the most comprehensive estimate.</p><p>Yellow and silver eel data for <em>A. anguilla </em>have an uneven geographical spread and do not fully represent the stock across its range. Nevertheless, a cursory analysis of these data found that over three generation lengths (39 years; see Habitat and Ecology), the mean decline in yellow and silver eels was found to be greater than 50% (see Population). Both analyses on yellow and silver eels indicated declines within the range of Endangered (EN) category. <a name=""_Hlk26366036""></a></p><p>Compounding these declines in escapement of maturing eels, are strong correlations between recruit series from sites over the range showing substantial declines during the period of the last three generations (Bornarel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The ICES recruitment index is 98.6% lower in the ‘North Sea’ series, and 94% lower in the ‘Elsewhere’ series, compared to the 1960–1979 reference level (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). It is noted, however, that the most recent statistical analyses conducted on these recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Due to the period of time eels spend feeding and growing prior to silvering and migrating to spawn, the numbers of silver eels may continue to decline, reflecting past declines in recruitment. </p><p>Sampling for leptocephali in the Sargasso Sea was undertaken in 2011, and results compared with previous sampling across the same area occurring in 1983 and 1985 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). The reduction in catch rate was 89% between 1983 and 2011, and 64% between 1985 and 2011 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation indicates a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding grounds over this time period, suggesting a lower abundance of spawners, higher egg and/or larval mortality and/or a reduction in spawning success. Thus, data on leptocephali and recruits to continental waters indicate declines within the range of Critically Endangered (CR). </p><p>A suite of threats have been implicated in the decline of European Eel recruitment and stock: barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines and pumps; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly&#160;<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>); exploitation of glass, yellow and silver eels; changing hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation.&#160;The significance of these threats individually or synergistically may vary across spatial range of the eel. Further research is required to fully quantify and understand the complexities of individual and combined threats.</p><p>Eel Management Plans (EMPs) have been developed in European Union Member States after implementation of the EU Council Regulation No 1100/2007 relating to the recovery of the European Eel (EU 2007). The Regulation set the objective of each EMP to be to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock” (EU 2007), and that EMPs would be prepared with the purpose of achieving this objective in the long term. </p><p>A number of management measures are being implemented in line with EMPs,&#160;including control of fisheries, bypassing turbines and pumps, easing of barriers and restocking - transfer of eel from one watershed to another. Quantifying the effects of these measures on silver eel escapement biomass is complicated in many cases because (i) measures are not implemented in isolation, making it difficult to identify individual contributions, and (ii) measures affecting earlier life stages will take years to influence silver eels, and ultimately spawning stock. There remains a great deal of debate as to whether restocking benefits the eel spawning stock and thus enhances future recruitment. Regulations and management actions currently focus on increasing escapement from continental waters, although these do not take account of eel condition or quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). &#160;&#160;</p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). It was concluded that the Regulation has been important in catalysing activity towards the recovery of the European Eel and remains a relevant document (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). However, despite progress, the eel remains in a critical condition and recovery could take decades, and further ambition is required (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>).</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2007,&#160;&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;was listed in Appendix II of CITES (the&#160;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species&#160;of Wild Fauna and Flora)&#160;due to concerns over the impact of international trade on this species (this listing came into force in March 2009).&#160;In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded it was not possible to perform a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF) for this species (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). Exports out of, and imports into, the European Union (EU), have since ceased due to ongoing concerns over the decline in recruitment and stocks. However, trade continues within the EU and from non-EU countries within its range to other non-EU countries. In 2014, <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> was also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).</p><p>The limited understanding of the complex relationship between recruitment, growth phase, and escapement makes it difficult to determine how declines in one will affect the other. However, it has been concluded that low recruitment will very likely ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement for, at least one generation length (13 years; see Habitat and Ecology). Further, since there is a short time period (~two years) between spawning and subsequent glass eel abundance, low recruitment has been proposed to be indicative of low breeding stock. As such it was deemed appropriate to assign&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;a Critically Endangered (CR) listing under current observations and future projected reductions of mature individuals (A2bd+4bd).</p><p>This category status remains unchanged from the previous assessment. Ultimately the CR category accounts for a proportional decline in population over a continental scale and this species has undergone a substantial decline over the last three generations. Although implementation of management measures has shown improvement, there is still concern over the effectiveness of EMPs to generate recovery to historic reference state within an appropriate timeframe, in the context of multiple threats (European Commission 2020). Continued, and ideally increased, effort will be essential in promoting recovery. A drive to fill data gaps – particularly in relation to the southern range of this species – would allow a more spatially comprehensive assessment in the future. </p><p>                          </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is found in a range of habitats from small streams to large rivers and lakes, and in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters (ICES 2015). It also occupies open ocean areas during migrations but is rarely observed in this habitat. Under natural conditions, it only occurs in water bodies that are connected to the sea; it is stocked elsewhere.<br/> <br/> <strong>Ecology:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is facultatively catadromous, living in fresh, brackish and coastal waters but migrating to pelagic marine waters to breed (Tsukamoto <em>et al. </em>1998, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2000). While there is some understanding of the eel’s continental life history, relatively little is known about its marine phase. The migrations in the European Eel’s life cycle are the longest and most oceanographically complex of the Anguillid species (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2002). </p><p>There are no exact data about specific spawning sites, however, it is hypothesised that spawning takes place in an elliptic zone, about 2,000 km wide in the Sargasso Sea, in the West Central Atlantic (from 70° W and eastward to 50° W) (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2019). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). The adults are assumed to die after spawning (Tesch 2003). Oceanic migration of leptocephali is estimated to take about two years on average before they arrive at the continental shelf (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The mechanisms by which leptocephali reach the European and N. African coasts are not well understood. In the Atlantic region, recruitment has been found to follow a South to North gradient over a period of around four to five months (ICES 2020). This starts in September in the North-West and occurs progressively later in the Channel and North Sea (ICES 2020). Recruitment to the Mediterranean is slightly more complex, publications suggest most eel ascent occurs between December and March, and landings suggest a peak in January. Although in some areas, recruitment occur over a wider period, even year-round (ICES 2020). <br/> <br/> Glass eels enter freshwater as sexually undifferentiated individuals. Development and differentiation of the sexual organs are thought to be closely correlated with body size and associated with the yellowing phase of the life history. Sex determination is principally driven by environmental factors with density-dependence producing more males at high densities (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Male European eels initially grow faster than females, however, females achieve a greater age and size than males when sexually mature. Furthermore, the mean length increases significantly with latitude in females but not males, whereas age increases significantly in both (Durif <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. Aprahamian unpub. data). Male fitness is maximised by maturing at the smallest size that allows a successful spawning migration (a time minimising strategy) such that males tend to emigrate at a length of &lt;450 mm (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Conversely, females adopt a more flexible size-maximising strategy prior to migration that trades off pre-reproductive mortality against fecundity (Davey and Jellyman 2005). There is considerable geographic variation in mean length at metamorphosis of male and female European eels (Vøllestad 1992). Dekker <em>et al</em>. (1998) described the extreme sizes in each of the life stages of the European eel from data at a long-term capture locality in the Netherlands, this paper also discussed the international situation, finding no more extreme values (sizes (cm): Min–Max, glass eels: 5.4–9.2, yellow: 6.9–133.0, silver (Male): 21.2–44.4, Silver (Female): 26.4–101.0). Driven by density-dependence, there are often skewed sex ratios at individual localities as well as geographic bias associated with latitude.<br/> <br/> Eel growth increases with temperature, as documented in aquaculture (Sadler 1979, Dosoretz and Degani 1987, Holmgren 1996, Ciccotti and Fontenelle 2001), and growth rate is generally faster in saline water than fresh (Acou <em>et al</em>. 2003, Daverat and Tomas 2006, Cairns <em>et al</em>. 2009). Furthermore, those individuals produced in saline waters usually have significantly higher fat content and contain lower loads of the swim bladder parasite, <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> and thus may have improved chances of reaching their spawning grounds (ICES 2009, Marohn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Body burden of toxic compounds, that are thought to affect migration and reproductive success, are also variable over regions and river basins, dependent on local pollution pressure (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016). During the growth phase, dependent on size, eels feed on a variety of organisms including fish, amphipods and decapod crustaceans. In saline muddy-bottomed habitats, eels forage on bivalves, shrimp, small fish and polychaete worms. The tendency towards piscivory has been linked to eel length: there is evidence that eels &gt;40 cm have the ability to consume larger prey such as fish or crustaceans (Moriarty 1974, Mann and Blackburn 1991, Yalçın-Özdilek and Solak 2007). Lammens <em>et al</em>. (1985) observed periods of low chironomid biomass to be a factor resulting in eels switching to prey on fish. In a comparison of two lakes in Germany, piscivory in eels was also concluded to be controlled by macrozoobenthos density (Dörner <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>      </p><p>The age at which eels undergo the transformation to the silver stage and undertake their spawning migration, is hugely variable and dependent on latitude and temperature of the environment in which they have grown, food availability, physical barriers that block migration routes, growth rate and sex differences. Estimates for average ranges of the continental growth phase were suggested as approximately 2–15 years for males and 4–20 years for females (Tesch 2003) – noting that much older individual eels occur especially in the latter. Durif <em>et al</em> (2009) examined a number of data sets from across the species range in relation to age at silvering which indicated a range of 2 to 15 years for males and 2 to 30 years for females. From these ranges, an estimated generation length of 13 years was used for this assessment, inclusive of a two-year larval migration and one-year spawning migration of silver eels (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has however been stated that there is variability in the accuracy of the methods used to age eels (ICES 2015). Assessment of available data on generation length during the IUCN Red List process highlighted that defining the required single generation length value for species with a broad range of ages-at-maturation such as eels was extremely difficult. Factors that can significantly affect this parameter include longitude and latitude, sex, growth rates, habitat quality and resource availability.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is susceptible to a number of natural and anthropogenic threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat loss/degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). The occurrence and significance of these threats varies considerably from area to area across the species range. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Dekker 2004, Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures (listed below), are less likely to have a significant positive effect on the stock than a combined approach. </p><p>There is a significant body of information including a great deal of contradiction in peer-reviewed and grey literature, and in expert opinion, relating to these threats. The assessment process and accompanying external review indicated that a comprehensive discussion of these threats and their impacts was significantly beyond the scope of this assessment. Below, all suspected threats are listed (in alphabetical order), with some (but not all) key references and a very brief synopsis of these threats. This is by no means comprehensive and does not attempt to fully dissect the wide range of views and data on these pressures.

In the AMBER (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers) project has begun tracking barriers across Europe, compiling them into a ‘Barrier Atlas’ to better inform management and conservation (AMBER International 2019). The project is ongoing, but so far around 415,000 barriers - complete or partial, with degree of obstruction not often fully quantified - have been recorded within this tool (AMBER International 2019). Relating in particular to hydropower, 21,387 plants are recorded currently in existence in Europe, with a further 278 under construction, and 8,507 planned (Schwarz <em>et al</em>. 2019).<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> In the Iberian Peninsula, 80% of eel habitat had been lost when compared to a 19<sup>th</sup> century baseline, as a result of dams causing fragmentation (Clavero and Hermoso 2015). A full life cycle model developed by Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. (2015) suggested the decline of the European Eel between 1975 and 1985 may be somewhat attributed to habitat loss. The model projected a reduction in suitable eel habitat, by 16% in the Mediterranean and 71% in the North and Baltic seas (Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. 2015). Degradation and loss of available habitat is also exacerbated by development, flood control, water-level management and the abstraction of surface and ground water for both domestic and commercial use (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). For example, Portugal, Spain and Morocco have been impacted by dam construction and/or drought in recent decades (Kettle <em>et al.</em> 2011). Further, it has been hypothesised, that the decline in good quality habitat and associated resources may be causing a decline in body condition of escaping silver eels in parts of the range which may have effects on the success of migration and/or spawning due this species’, particularly the female’s, reliance on fat stores for reproductive success (van Ginneken and van den Thillart 2000).</p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in <em>A. anguilla</em> – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding area (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p><p>The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American Eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif <em>et al</em>. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to larval metamorphosis being impeded due to the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Miller and Tsukamoto 2016). <a name=""_Hlk13652216"">Using a high-resolution ocean model, Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. (2014) found ocean current variations to be a major driver in the onset of decline in European Eel recruitment that occurred in the early 1980s. Although after this period, the correlation between oceanic fluctuations and eel recruitment was lost, and lack of recovery was likely a result of other pressures (Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. 2014). </a>Pacariz <em>et al</em>. (2014), however, found that the overall success of larval drift from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958–2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson <em>et al</em>. (2012). Politis <em>et al</em>. (2017) found 18°C to be optimum temperature for spawning of <em>A. anguilla</em> under experimental conditions. The results suggested <em>A. anguilla</em> may inhabit a deeper layer of the Sargasso Sea during early life stages and may be vulnerable to changes in temperature as a result of ocean warming. A recent ICES WGEEL report described climate change and increasing ocean temperature under “new and emerging threats”, due to unusually warm and dry periods occurring throughout European countries (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). This warm and dry period resulted in higher water temperatures, reduced levels of dissolved oxygen, and in some cases habitat loss through drought, creating stressful conditions for eels and other freshwater biota (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). There were several reports of eel mortalities from European countries, connected to warmer water, increased instances of disease, or deaths that could not be explained (ICES2018<em>c</em>).</p><p>The parasite nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>), introduced when the Japanese Eel (<em>A. japonica</em>) was imported to Europe for culture in the early 1980s, is also thought to impact the ability of the European Eel to reach its spawning ground. There multiple proposed impacts which include a negative effect on silver stage physiology (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012); swimbladder damage which impairs swimming performance (Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007); and a reduced ability to cope with high pressure during their reproductive migration (Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sjöberg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Prevalence of <em>A. crassus</em> has been found to be higher in smaller eels (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017, Hafir-Mansouri <em>et al</em>. 2018), with the proposal that smaller eels feeding mainly on invertebrates have a greater infection intensity than larger, piscivorous eels, because of increased chance of encounter with infected invertebrate hosts (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p><p>Lipophilic pollutant contaminants and metals act as stressors within the continental stage of the European Eel life cycle (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). This can result in damage to the respiratory system, tissues and organs, alter the regular function of endocrine processes, osmoregulation, and haematological dynamics, as well as decreasing protein content, reducing the ability of an eel to cope with physiological stress (Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019, De Meyer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Lipids are essential for allowing normal migration and reproduction (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). As pollutants impair lipid metabolism and storage, it may reduce the ability of silver eels to migration (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). Chemicals stored by eels and released when fat stores are broken down during migration, could subsequently limit the capacity of the silver eels to complete their spawning migrations due to metabolic disruption (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al</em>.&#160; 2019). Further, there is concern that even if the spawning migration is completed that lipid stores containing xenobiotics may result in disrupted gonadogenesis and/or low-quality gametes, as well as transmission of pollutants to the larvae (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Sühring <em>et al</em>. 2015, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016;,Freese<em> et al.</em> 2017, 2019, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Nowosad <em>et al</em>. 2018). Ultimately, pollutants may be affecting eels at molecular and individual levels, but also scaling to population and community wide effects (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019). Lipophilic chemical pollutants have been identified as a cause of recruitment failure, although current policies focusing on increasing escapement from continental waters do not consider eel quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). To mitigate impacts of contaminants, it may be valuable for management to integrate methods to improve the condition and quality of both habitats and escaping eels (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). This may also be considered in relation to stocking activities, by ensuring eels have suitable, unpolluted rearing habitat (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Predation also represents a threat to <em>A. anguilla</em> and is increasingly being discussed in relation to competition with commercial and recreational fisheries. Cormorants in particular have been a focus of recent research, which has found eel consumption by cormorants to be of a similar quantity to that of fishery landings in both the Baltic Sea (Hansson <em>et al</em>. 2018) and some lakes in Sweden (Ovegård 2017). Human factors may exacerbate the threat. Under experimental conditions, acoustic disturbance has been found to reduce anti-predation behaviour in eels, affecting likelihood of survival (Simpson <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>Unsustainable exploitation is a threat to the species. Fishing for the European Eel began with small scale fisheries up to the late 1800s, before shifting during the mid-1900s to larger scale, commercial exploitation, with production peaking between 1960–70 (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016, Dekker 2019, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Across its distribution, all continental stages of the European Eel are currently exploited although data from different regions varies in quality and period of collection. Trade of European Eel continues within the European Union (EU) for consumption, culture and stocking, although export from the EU has been banned since 2010 although over this time period commercial landings of yellow and silver eels have remained relatively consistent (around 2000–3000 tonnes) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>) (see Conservation). Indeed, it seems that yellow/silver eels are declining while glass eel catches increase (European Commission 2020<em>a</em>).</p><p>                          </p><p>Despite the ban on trade outside of the EU, under-reporting, illegal fishing (poaching) and illegal trade are believed to occur throughout the range of the European Eel fisheries (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is little information regarding illegal exploitation of the European Eel, which is thought to be driven mainly by demand from East Asia for use as a substitute for <em>Anguilla japonica</em>, due to the reduced abundance of glass eels of this species (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Assessment of the impact of this component of fishery exploitation is therefore extremely difficult. Export of European Eel outside of EU borders is visible through trade statistics, and enforcement agencies report the tonnage of successful operations where shipments have been intercepted, and seizures made (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). A review of exploitation, including an attempt to understand the scale of eel trafficking for the European Eel was conducted by Stein and Dekker in Kaifu <em>et al</em>. (2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>Determining changes in the stock of European Eel is difficult due to limited data and the poor understanding of the relationship between recruitment, eels in continental waters, and escapement. Not only can there be a large time lag (10's of years) between the recruitment of glass eels to fresh and brackish water and the subsequent escapement of silver eels, but given that <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is panmictic, escapement from one area does not translate directly into returning larval recruitment at the same locality. Indeed, for all intents and purposes it is assumed that practically nothing is known about the population dynamics of the oceanic phase of <em>A. anguilla</em> (ICES 2013<em>a</em>). </p><p>Assessment of datasets using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria took into account the following: consistency of sampling; longevity of the data set; whether data were eel-specific or multi-species; whether the collection methods were active or passive; whether the watershed the data related to was subject to restocking activity; and/or whether, in the case of fisheries independent data, there was exploitation in the region.</p><p>There are more available datasets for <em>A. anguilla</em> in northern, central and southern European countries compared to North Africa. For the purposes of analysing recruitment trends, ICES often refers to the North Sea subpopulation in separate terms to the rest of Europe. This is because the rate of decline in abundance of <em>A. anguilla </em>recruitmen<em>t </em>has been shown to be substantially greater for this area compared to elsewhere (ICES 2012), although this declining trend can be mostly accounted for during the period between 1980 and 1985. Declines in both the North Sea and elsewhere indices are presented and considered. Unless otherwise stated, data were accessed through relevant contacts in the EIFAAC/ICES/GFCM Working Group on Eels (WGEEL).<br/> <br/> </p><p><strong>Glass and Yellow Eel Recruitment:&#160;</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Glass eel and young-of-year recruitment data used to inform this assessment were taken from the analysis provided in ICES (2019<em>a</em>). Data used in the ICES recruitment index were from Norway, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium in the “North Sea” series, and UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy in the “Elsewhere” series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment is based largely on data from the Baltic area where only yellow stage eels are recruited (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). <br/> <br/> Since the early 1980s, a steady and almost continent-wide decline has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels. The ICES recruitment index fell to its lowest historical level in 2012: less than 1% for the North Sea and 5% elsewhere in the distribution area with respect to recruitment from between 1960–1979 (ICES 2012). In the most recent ICES report, the provisional 2019 recruitment index was at 1.4% of the 1960–1979 reference level in the ‘North Sea’ series, and at 6.0% in the ‘Elsewhere’ series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These provisional values for 2019 show a slight decrease from final 2018 values, which were 1.9% in the ‘North Sea’ index, and 8.9% in the ‘Elsewhere’ index (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). However, statistical analyses conducted on recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment to European waters was 26.4% of the 1960–1979 reference in 2018 (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Data collection for 2019 was stated to be ongoing and so not available at the time of publication (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). The overall decline in recruitment will likely continue to influence adult stock for at least one generation length (ICES 2012). <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Yellow Eel (standing stock): </strong><br/> There were few time-series data sets available to this assessment for the yellow eel life stage, and they only cover a small amount of the geographical range. Data sets were made available from Skagerrak (southern Norway), Den Burg (Netherlands) and the East Anglian River Basin District (RBD) in the UK (Rivers Blackwater, Colne, Chelmer, Stour) (Environment Agency 2019). Skagerrak and Den Burg data derive from beach seines and fyke nets, respectively, and the East Anglian RBD data derive from electrofishing surveys. Data from Skagerrak contained mostly yellow eels, with some silvers, whereas the other data sets were for yellow eel only.<br/> <br/> The analyses of yellow eel data suggest declines that were not as severe as that of recruitment:&#160;in the East Anglian RBD, the mean decline&#160;was between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data,&#160;over a period of three generation lengths (39 years);&#160;in Skagerrak and Den Burg, the mean decline mirrored this trend.&#160;There is a variety of published literature describing abundance trends in yellow eels not captured within this analysis - note the following examples are not comprehensive. In the Bristol Channel, sampling conducted between 1981 and 2009 at power station cooling water intakes found yellow eel abundance to decline by 15% per year, to 1% of the level in 1980 (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, abundance decline has been documented in the River Meuse, in Belgium (Matondo and Ovidio 2016), and Ireland, in both the Foyle Estuary (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Lough Sheelin, in the upper River Shannon catchment (MacNamara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Conversely, a study to establish the status of stocks in England and Wales found rivers along the West coast, and some in the northeast remained similar, whereas declines were observed in the south-east (Bark <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fisheries-independent monitoring conducted on six sites along the Swedish west coast found yellow eel CPUE to display a slow increase between 1975 and 2003, after which it decreased, before increasing again from around 2011 (Andersson <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Declines in yellow eels were identified earlier than that of glass eel recruitment, occurring since the 1960’s (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016). The less pronounced decline in the yellow eel data analysed here compared to those reported for glass eel indices could be partially due to density-dependent mortality confounding the effects of changes in recruitment (Svedäng 1999). However, it needs to be taken into account that the age range of yellow eels is broad and that there may very well be a time lag in knock-on effects. As such, any increase in recruitment would not be expected to be immediately mirrored in a rise in yellow eel numbers, indeed, it is possible that this life stage may continue to decline. </p><p><strong>Silver Eels:</strong><strong><br/> </strong><br/> For silver eels, there is similar uneven geographical spread of data.&#160;Data sets of silver eel escapement were available from France (MNHN-Dinard and UMS PatriNat unpub. data.), Norway and Ireland and were collected from scientific surveys. Note that the silver eel escapement estimates generated for EMPs are only available from 2010 and therefore not dating back long enough to be used in these analyses.</p><p>Based on these data, silver eel decline does not appear as pronounced as for recruitment indices but, similar to yellow eels (standing stock), they indicated a mean decline of&#160;&#160;between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data, over the period of three generation lengths (39 years).&#160;Again, the less pronounced decline compared to recruitment indices may be due to density-dependent mortality at previous life stages, but it cannot be ruled out that a decline in silver eel escapement may continue despite increases in recruitment and/or yellow eels due to the long generation time.&#160;&#160;</p><p><em>Note</em>: The 2019 ICES data call included a request for available data on abundance trends for the standing stock of yellow and silver eels (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Information collected for yellow eels included long-term monitoring across various habitats for 70 sites, and for silver eels across 28 sites (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These data have not been reported by ICES yet, but future analysis will provide a more accurate understanding of the situation.</p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> has been included in a number of regional and national Red List assessments in Europe over the past 10 years. The European Eel has been assessed as Critically Endangered across Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011), for the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM 2007), as well as in Sweden (Gärdenfors 2010), Denmark (NERI 2009), France (UICN Comité français, MNHN, SFI and AFB 2019), Ireland (King <em>et al</em>. 2011) and north Belgium (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). Indeed, the European Eel showed the largest negative trend of any of the freshwater fishes (-75%) in the Belgian report (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Norway the status is now Vulnerable (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015).<br/> <br/> For the North African range there is considerably less information. A regional Red List assessment in North Africa suggests that <em>A. anguilla</em> is Endangered due to a decline in recruitment of 50% in the last 10 years with annual catches declining by between 10 and 25% since the 1980s, and by more in Tunisia alone (Azeroual 2010).</p><p>Currently, the best estimate metric for translation into the IUCN criteria for ‘Mature Individuals’ is the silver eel life stage, although this has its limitations. Following escapement from continental waters, there is the possibility that a proportion of silver eels may succumb to the effects of sub-lethal impacts incurred during growth / escapement and/or be predated before reaching the breeding area to spawn. </p><p>                      </p><p>An alternative metric that could be used in place of silver eel escapement is numbers of leptocephali collected close to the breeding area, as this would also give an indication of the state of the spawning stock. In 2011, sampling across the breeding area for <em>A. anguilla, A. rostrata</em> and other non-anguillid species was conducted, following the same methods as previous sampling in this area that occurred in 1983 and 1985, just after the beginning of the decline in eels occurred in 1980 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). Results from this study were compared with the previous sampling, and significantly lower numbers of European Eel leptocephali were collected in 2011, with a reduction in catch rate of 89% and 64% compared to sampling in 1983 and 1985, respectively (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation depicts a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding area over this time period, suggesting a reduction in the spawning stock, and correlating with the reduction in recruitment to continental waters. This is of great concern for the future resilience of the population.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> occurs in most inland waters of Europe and is distributed from North Cape in northern Norway, southwards along the coast of Europe, all coasts of the Mediterranean and on the North African coast (Schmidt 1909, Dekker 2003<em>b</em>). It very rarely enters the White and Barents seas, but it has been recorded eastward to the Pechora River in northwest Russia. The species occurs in low abundance in the Black Sea region where it migrates east to the Kuban drainage (occasional individuals reach the Volga drainage through canals). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> also occurs in northern Scandinavia and eastern Europe. A report by the ICES Study Group on Anguillid Eels in Saline Waters (SGAESAW) indicates that eel stocks can contain a mix of freshwater residents, saline water residents, and inter‐habitat migrants (ICES 2009). The continental distribution of the European Eel is over an area of approximately 90,000 km²&#160;in Europe and parts of North Africa (Moriarty and Dekker 1997), with a substantially larger range if their marine distribution is considered. </p><p>For several decades prior to a cessation of import to, and export from, the EU in 2010, <em>A. anguilla</em> was also exported to Asia for seed stock in eel farms (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species may well have been introduced in some parts of Asia (through escape or release from farms, e.g. Arai <em>et al</em>. 2017), however these will not contribute to the spawning stock and therefore areas of introduction have been excluded in the range information. </p><p>    </p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring, before eggs hatch and leptocephalus larvae migrate back across the Atlantic to begin the continental phase of their life history (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk17388906""></a><a name=""_Hlk17388861"">The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver</a>, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There is clear evidence for this in the case of <em>A. anguilla</em>. Traditionally, European Eel was consumed within its European and North African range states – yellow and silver eels were fished for direct consumption, and glass eels were caught for farming and also for consumption (mainly in Spain). Although still consumed within Europe, in recent decades European Eel became increasingly important in fulfilling demand in East Asia (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crook 2010, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>According to FAO data, total annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production (catch and aquaculture) has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Historically, eel farms used species of local provenance. France, Spain, Portugal and the UK are the principal fishing nations for glass eels, and Italy, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands the main producers of farmed European Eel for consumption within Europe. However, towards the end of the 1990s, a decline in stocks of Japanese Eels, combined with the apparently cheap and abundant supplies of European Eel glass eels, led to many Asian eel farms in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, supplementing farms with the European Eel (<a name=""_Hlk17273106"">Briand <em>et al</em>. 2008</a>, Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>Concerns over the impact international trade was having on European Eel led to it being listed in Appendix II of CITES in 2007. This listing came into force on 13 March 2009 – since then any international trade in this species needs to be accompanied by a permit. In December 2010, however, the European Union (EU) decided to ban all imports and exports of European Eel to and from the EU, as authorities felt they were unable to determine that trade would not be detrimental to the conservation of the species (a requirement for issuance of permits for CITES Appendix II-listed species). There were a number of exceptions to this ban: trade in “pre-Convention” specimens was permitted until the end of 2015), and internal EU trade is still allowed. Trade from non-EU range States to non-EU countries also still occurs (Musing <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>Global FAO catch data for European Eel are available for the period of 1950–2017, peaking at nearly 20,000 t in 1968 but declining thereafter and between 2013 and 2017, annual catches averaged just over 3,000 t. Over 60% of these catches were reported by five EU Member States: Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The principal non-EU range States reporting catches (10% of the total) were Egypt, Norway, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco (FAO 2019). Fishing of various life stages continues in a number of range States, but in many cases, catch is now being limited by quotas or other measures set as part of National Eel Management Plans, fulfilling requirements outlined in Eel Regulation - see Conservation Measures. Reported annual glass eel landings in the EU have declined since 1980, to 62.2 t in 2018, and 58.6 t in 2019 (provisional) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years. According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight; China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown in farms, which includes <em>A. anguilla </em>(Musing<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2018).</p><p>Due to a lack of species-specific Customs data, the precise quantities of European Eel in trade are still unknown. However, imports reported by East Asian Customs of live juvenile <em>Anguilla</em> eels from European Eel range States for farming purposes (defined as “live eel fry” in East Asia) provide a good indication of the amount of European glass eels in trade outside of the EU (both legal and illegal). Between 2003 and 2008, annual live eel fry imports from European eel range States to mainland China, Taiwan, Province of China, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong fluctuated between ~36 and 70 t. In 2009, annual imports dropped to ~9 t and in 2010 they increased again to nearly 28 t. Since 2011, reported annual imports of live eel fry from <em>A. anguilla </em>range States remained less than 10 t. France and Spain were the principal source countries among <em>A. anguilla </em>range States until 2010 (when commercial<em> A. anguilla</em> trade to and from the EU was banned). Imports from non-EU <em>A. anguilla </em>range States, especially from Morocco, began in 2009 and gradually increased over the years, despite a ban for export of glass eels being imposed in this range state since 2013 (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). Due to the reduced availability of European glass eels over the last decade, increasing quantities of glass eels of other <em>Anguilla</em> species have also been imported into East Asia to fulfil demand in farms (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>Since 2009, species-specific CITES trade data for European eel have been reported. Between 2009 and 2016, over 1000 t of live <em>A. anguilla </em>and another ~1000 t of meat/bodies were reportedly exported from a number of European Eel range States (mainly Morocco and Tunisia). Main destinations were Korea and Hong Kong. In addition, over 50,000 t of meat/bodies were re-exported, mainly from China to Japan (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There are serious concerns over illegal harvesting and trade of <em>A. anguilla.</em> In recent years, authorities have increasingly reported the involvement of organised criminal networks in the movement of legally and illegally sourced European glass eels from the EU to East Asia, principally to China, and have seen traders regularly change travelling routes and their <em>modus operandi </em>to circumvent controls (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). In 2015, EUROPOL initiated Operation LAKE, a European initiative aimed at combatting illegal eel trade. Under this umbrella, there have been a number of investigations into eel smuggling in air freight and personal luggage. For example, in 2017, Greek and Spanish authorities dismantled an international criminal network suspected of having smuggled 10 t of eels from the EU to China; raids led to the arrest of 32 individuals and seizure of 2 t of <em>A. anguilla </em>worth EUR 2 million (Europol 2017). However, European Eel appears to still be in the supply chain in East Asia – a recent paper indicated it was prevalent in supermarket products in Hong Kong (Richards&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>While there is demand for the species, pressures from trade, and unknown quantities in illegal trade, continue to be a serious conservation concern for the species. </p><p>                    </p><p>A detailed recent analysis of trade in <em>A. anguilla</em>, including Customs, CITES and seizure data, is provided in Musing <em>et al. </em>(2018).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The majority of conservation actions historically in place for the European eel were set up and controlled at local and national level, often with little coordination, which is of particular concern when dealing with a panmictic stock. Protection can be achieved effectively at a national or local level, distributed throughout individual management units, but an international objective is necessary to orchestrate this management (Dekker 2016).<br/> <br/> The Eel Regulation (EC Regulation 1100/2007; EU 2007) is an EU-wide recovery plan for the European Eel, adopted in 2007. As instructed by the regulation, EU member states have been developing and implementing Eel Management Plans (EMPs) with the objective to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.” (EU 2007). Member States are responsible for implementing measures to achieve their targets, and most actions have focussed on commercial and recreational fisheries, followed by hydropower-pumping station obstacles, and measures on habitat, restocking, and predator control (ICES 2013<em>b</em>,&#160;European Commission 2020<em>a</em>). Other actions expected to have indirect effects, such as implementing monitoring programmes and scientific studies, have been almost as common as controls on fisheries (ICES 2013<em>b</em>).</p><p>In a review of EMPs, eel biomass per hectare fell within a narrow range for most countries, apart from France and Spain, whose values were higher than what was reported for other countries (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). The most recent reporting (2018) did not provide mortality rate estimates for all EMPs, and therefore rates could not be summed to reflect the state of impacts across Europe (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). In December 2017, EU Member States reached an agreement prohibiting fishing for eels &gt;12 cm in marine waters of the Atlantic and North Sea over a three-month period (determined by each Member State) between 2018 and 2019 to aid eel recovery (Council of the EU 2018). In 2019, in line with measures implemented by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), this decision extended the mandatory closures to recreational and glass eel fisheries covering brackish waters (Council of the EU 2019).</p><p> As part of the EMPs, any Member State that allowed fishing for eels of &lt;12 cm total was required to reserve a minimum of 60% of their catch from 31 July 2013 onwards for restocking purposes (i.e. restocking waters with glass eels from elsewhere). Although there is evidence showing restocking to be beneficial at enhancing silver eel production within water bodies, the overall effectiveness of restocking programmes at enhancing the spawning stock remains open to debate (ICES 2016). Reviews (ICES 2012, 2016, Pawson 2012) on the contribution of restocking to the recovery of the panmictic European Eel state that there are major knowledge gaps to be filled before firm conclusions can be drawn either way. Until restocking studies are accompanied by suitable controls of areas without translocation, it is very difficult to determine whether there is a net increase in silver eel escapement or differences in growth rates and/or sex ratios in manipulated populations (Pawson 2012). </p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). Overall, escapement of silver eels remains below the 40% target biomass (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Catches of yellow and silver eel life stages were found to have declined, while glass eel catch has been steadily increasing (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Overall, there has been progress towards a reduction in fishing effort, but in some Member States’ effort has risen (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Anthropogenic mortality unrelated to fishing has not significantly declined, and this has received little focus in the EMPs and related actions (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). The report ultimately stated ""The Regulation’s success in ensuring the recovery of the European eel is still far from certain, as it is widely recognised that the recovery of the European eel will take many decades. In this respect, further ambition is needed to implement the Regulation with a greater focus on non-fisheries related measures.""</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In addition to the Eel Regulation, in 2007, the European eel was included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (CITES 2007). The listing came into effect on 13 March 2009, after which time exporters were required to acquire permits. An export permit may be issued only if the specimen was legally obtained and export is deemed non-detrimental to the survival of the species i.e. a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF). In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded an NDF was not possible for this species, and so a zero import/export policy was set for the EU, which is still in place (EC 2010, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2018, several reports investigating the challenges and lessons learnt in relation to implementing the Appendix II listing, including its enforcement and illegal trade were published (CITES 2018, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2008, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2010). In 2014, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) to catalyse collaborative conservation across range States, providing additional support for conservation and monitoring of the species (CMS 2014). Since the listing there have been three range state meetings in order to develop a mechanism under which signatories will work. At the most recent CMS Conference of the Parties in 2020, it was agreed a species Action Plan would be developed for the European Eel.</p><p>              </p><p>Across Europe, programmes for “trap and transport” (downriver transport), and “assisted migration” (upriver transport), are in place to provide eels with access to habitat that has been lost through the construction of migratory barriers. When applied to migrating silver eels, it can have a significant and immediate effect on local escapement. It is hoped that translocation can mitigate against the loss of habitat and positively contribute to enhanced escapement, and by association, future recruitment (e.g. for barriers: van der Meer 2012, McCarthy <em>et al.</em> 2014, Béguer-Pon <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is a necessity in the future, however, to reduce the level of direct human intervention by eliminating the barriers to navigation, or at least, providing more effective passage for eels.<br/> <br/> Continuous monitoring of eel escapement on a national or international scale is currently very rare and so in addition to localised monitoring, modelling has been explored for providing estimates of escapement in eel subpopulations. A number of assessment models have been developed; Demographic model of the Camargue (DemCam) (Bevacqua and De Leo 2006), Eel Density Analysis (EDA) (EDA 2.2: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2015, EDA 2.2.1: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2018), German Eel Model (GEM) (GEM II: Oeberst and Fladung 2012, GEM III: Oeberst and Fladung 2014), and, Scenario-based Model of Eel Production II (SMEP II) (SMEP: developed by El-Hosaini, Bark, Knights, Williams and Kirkwood; Aprahamian <em>et al</em>. 2007). Using time series eel data sets from a variety of locations across Europe, earlier iterations of these models were reviewed by Walker <em>et al.</em> (2011). The conclusions of this report suggest that all four models were capable of predicting escapement to a degree of accuracy (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/> <br/> In 2019,&#160; ICES stated that: “The status of European eel remains critical”, and that “all anthropogenic impacts (e.g. caused by recreational and commercial fishing on all stages, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) that decrease production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to,&#160; or kept as close as possible to,&#160; zero in 2020” (ICES 2019<em>b</em>). In 2019, provisional recruitment estimates remain low across the geographical range. Although, recruitment during the period of 2011–2019 has shown an increasing trend, statistically significant from zero. This highlights the necessity for continued, effective conservation across the range for <em>A. anguilla</em>.&#160;</p><p></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In the wintering range, habitat has been cleared for agriculture and grazing, reducing the potential suitable area or causing habitat fragmentation and declines in habitat quality (<span class=""hps"">Miles <em>et al</em>. 2006, González-Medina<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009)<span class=""hps"">. Further threats include brood parasitism. Brown-headed Cowbirds (<em>Molothrus ater</em>) inflict rates of parasitism of up to 100% at some sites (Grzybowski 1995, Farrell <em>et al</em>. 2011). Rates of nest predation as high as 50% in some locations have been reported. Snakes and birds are the primary predators of this species, with mammals, ants (e.g. fire ants <em>Solenopsis </em>spp.) and katydids also found to predate the species (Stake and Cimprich 2003, Campomizzi <em>et al</em>. 2009, Conkling <em>et al</em>. 2012, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Furthermore, habitat may be fragmented by the development of oil and gas pipelines as well as access corridors for windfarms (L. O'Donnell <em>in litt</em>. 2019). The high return rates of birds to breeding territories suggests few threats on the wintering grounds, even though less than 10% of the wintering area is protected (Grzybowski 1995, <span class=""hps""><span class=""hps"">Vega Rivera <em>et al</em>. 2011, USFWS 2018a).

Rosenberg <em>et al. </em>(2016) estimate the global population size to be 24,000 mature individuals. This number is based on an estimate of c.12,000 mature individuals in U.S.A. (Wilkins <em>et al</em>. 2006) and recent discoveries  of high-density breeding populations in Mexico, which could mean that a  doubling of the U.S.A. estimate may be appropriate (Rosenberg <em>et al. </em>2016).  It should be noted, though, that while Benson and Benson (1990) estimate c.6,300 ± 3,200 pairs in northern Coahuila, other estimates for  Mexican populations have been very low. Wilkins <em>et al. </em>(2006)  estimated only 259 males in Mexico, and Morrison and González-Rojas  (2014) found only 341 individuals in three states of Mexico. Therefore, the global population size is here tentatively placed in the range 10,000-19,999  mature individuals. All individuals belong to the same subpopulation (Zink <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Decreasing,"This species&#160;once bred from Kansas through Oklahoma and Texas (<strong>U.S.A.)</strong> into central Coahuila, northwestern and southern Nuevo Leon and southwestern Tamaulipas (<strong>Mexico</strong>) (Contreras-Balderas <em>et al</em>. 2012, &#160;González-Rojas <em>et al</em>. 2014, J.

154210757,4201,Cercocebus torquatus,Endangered,A2abcd+4abcd,2019,2019-01-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<a name=""_GoBack""></a>This species is listed as Endangered, as it has been heavily impacted by both habitat loss and hunting in most of its range. <em>Cercocebus torquatus </em>has been extirpated in Benin and the extreme west of Nigeria (the former westernmost limit of its range) and in the extreme south of its range (part of coastal Congo). Multiple examples of population reduction have been documented in Cameroon, Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea, and these monkeys are now considered rare across much of their range (Oates 2011). This species lives in proximity to the Atlantic coast, where the forests have been greatly modified for agriculture; industrial agricultural plantations (bananas, oil palm, rubber) and smallholder farming have now replaced much of the original forest. It is likely that this species has undergone a decline exceeding 50% during the past 27 years (three generations), qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A2.<br/><br/>The causes of this decline have not ceased, are unlikely to be reversible, and will continue into the foreseeable future. With the human population growing at a rate of 2.7% annually (i.e. the human population will double in less than 30 years), there will be an 18% increase in the number of people living in this region by 2028. As a consequence, both bushmeat hunting pressure and habitat loss (to agriculture) will continue to increase throughout the geographic range of C. torquatus. More forest will be converted to the type of habitat that is highly unsuitable for these monkeys (monocultures of food crops and rubber). The resulting ongoing population reduction is likely to exceed 50% over three generations (2001–2028), also qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A4.","This species is usually found in high forest, but it also occurs in mangrove, dryland, gallery and swamp forest (Cooke 2005, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007, Oates 2011). It can also be found in young secondary forests and around cultivated areas. Group size is generally between 14 and 25 animals (and occasionally up to ~60) (Oates 2011).","<em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> is threatened by habitat loss, particularly in the northern half of its range. The Atlantic coastal forests have been greatly modified for agriculture, especially in coastal Cameroon, where industrial agricultural plantations (bananas, oil palm, rubber) and smallholder farming have replaced much of the original forest.<br/><br/>The taxon is also threatened by illegal hunting for bushmeat throughout its range, both for local consumption and for commercial sale to distant urban populations. Its large body size (~10-11 kg for males, ~5-6 for females (Ehardt 2013, Oates 2011), semi-terrestrial habits, large group size and loud vocalisations mean that it is easily detected from a distance, easily shot (or snared), and is selected by bushmeat hunters as it provides more meat per individual shot and cartridge expended. The species was highly intolerant of hunting pressure in a study in Korup NP in Cameroon (Linder and Oates 2011).<br/><br/>Human population growth in the range states of <em>C. torquatus</em> continues at roughly 2.7% annually and will not slow down for several decades (UN 2015, World Bank 2017). More and more land will be required for food for these people, and the increasing industrialisation of agriculture in all of these countries will mean that more and more forest is converted monocultures of food crops and rubber, which are highly unsuitable for these monkeys.<br/><br/>Road access into once-remote forests has increased greatly during the last 20–30 years and will continue to do so at an accelerated rate (Laporte <em>et al</em>. 2007, Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015), facilitating hunting and transport of bushmeat to both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013, Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2016). Habitat loss will also greatly increase along the broad corridors created by these roads (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015). By 2050 the region will have little, if any, land left untouched by hunting (Nasi <em>et al</em>. 2011).","<p>                 <a name=""_GoBack""></a>Although the mapped extent of occurrence appears extensive along the coasts of five countries, and the species is sometimes locally abundant in scattered localities, <em>Cercoceus torquatus</em> now appears to be absent from many areas with even low-to-medium hunting pressure (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007), although it is still present in several areas of Nigeria and western Cameroon that have low-to-medium and sometimes high hunting pressure. In their preferred habitat, if there is no hunting, they can be the most abundant primate: this was the case in the south of Loango National Park in Gabon in 2003 (Cooke 2005), where the species was still in good shape a few years later (Morgan 2007).<br/><br/><em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> abundance has, however, been declining for some time and they are now considered rare across much of their range (Oates 2011). They have almost certainly been extirpated from Benin (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Nigeria, surveys since 1995 suggest that the species has been extirpated or is now locally rare in several areas of the Niger Delta and Akwa Ibom State (Ehardt 2013, Ikemeh 2014). They are still relatively abundant in the Cross River NP (Abanyam and Imong 2016), and some adjoining unprotected forests, such as the Eko Esai Community Forest (Imong, pers. obs. 2016); in the southwest of the country in Okomu NP, Omo Forest Reserve, Idanre Forest Reserve and Akure-Ofosu Forest Reserve; and in the Niger Delta, including the Apoi Creek forest area (R. Ikemeh, pers. obs. 2016).<br/><br/>Over 40 years ago, these monkeys were considered to be common in Cameroon, in both Korup NP and Douala-Edea (Struhsaker 1972), but their abundance has subsequently declined greatly (Ehardt 2013). Surveys conducted along the same line transects in Korup NP (2001-2003, 2004-2005, 2013-2015) indicated consistently low sighting frequencies of 0.01-0.02 groups/km walked (Linder <em>et al</em>. 2015). In those surveys, <em>C. torquatus</em> made up only 2-3% of all sightings of primates. In Equatorial Guinea, the species was already declining in 1983 (Ehardt 2013) and a nationwide survey in 2011 failed to record the species at all on 234 km of transects. Interviews in villages indicated that the species was present near only nine of the 40 or so areas surveyed across the country; it was in fact the second rarest monkey in the country according to the interviewees (Ruffler <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In coastal Congo (Conkouati-Douli NP) and Gabon (Loango, Moukalaba-Doudou and Mayumba NPs), <em>C. torquatus</em> is still found in reasonable numbers. In the latter two areas, large troops of both Mandrills (<em>Mandrillus sphinx</em>) and of White-collared Mangabeys have been recorded living sympatrically (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007). <em>Cercocebus torquatus </em>and all but two other monkey species were hunted out of the Kouilou area, south of Conkouati, by 1991 (Dowsett <em>et al</em>. 1991).</p>",Decreasing,"This species’ range is about 270,000 km² of which a separate fragment just north of the main coastal strip could be up to about 3,500 km². <em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> occurs in a wide band of coastal forest from western Nigeria into southern Cameroon, and throughout mainland Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni) and Gabon (Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>. 1999) to the Gabon-Congo border on the Atlantic shore (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007). The old western limit may have been in Benin, but the species has not been recorded there since at least the 1980s (Neuenschwander <em>et al</em>. 2011). Local hunters interviewed in 2003 mentioned the species occurring near the Benin-Nigeria border (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2008), but their presence has not been confirmed (Oates 2011). <em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> seems never to occur more than 350 km from the coast (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2007). Its southern limit is probably the Kouilou River in Congo and it certainly still thrives in the Gabon-Congo border area (Makaya 2010). In 1966, an isolated population occurred in Igalaland, Nigeria, about 100 km northeast of the main coastal population in the vicinity of Anyigba in Kogi State, but they are almost certainly gone by now (Oates 2011). This monkey is absent from Bioko Island.","This species is killed illegally for local consumption and for bushmeat trade in local markets.<br/><br/>Surveys of 30 hunters living at the periphery of Korup NP indicated that <em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> made up less than 1% of the total primate offtake (Astaras pers. comm. 2016) and in nearby Banyang Mbo, southwest Cameroon, <em>C. torquatus </em>was the rarest monkey recorded in the bushmeat trade, and indeed made up only 0.5% of the animals recorded (of over 3,000 individuals) (Willcox and Nambu 2007). The extremely low proportion of <em>C. torquatus</em> seen in bushmeat markets is likely due to the animals having been selected out of the available prey base, due to their size. A hunter gets more meat for the bullet with larger animals, and typically, faunal assemblages under human hunting pressure in this region lose the larger species first.",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Hunting is banned within all the national parks of the range states where <em>C. torquatus</em> occurs, so the species is protected on paper within those areas. However, weak application of and poor compliance with the law both in and outside protected areas results in hunting throughout its range.<br/><br/>Each of the range states has a list of protected species. <em>Cercocebus torquatus</em> status in each country is as follows: Cameroon: they are on Class C (may be hunted with a permit (MINFOF 2006); Congo: partly protected (on “Annex II”), meaning they can be hunted with a big game permit (MEFDD 2011); Equatorial Guinea: the hunting, sale and consumption of all primates are forbidden by Presidential Decree (Republic of Equatorial Guinea 2007); Gabon: not mentioned on the Completely or Partially protected lists; and Nigeria: Completely Protected (Federal Ministry of Nigeria 2004).<br/><br/>In Central Africa, south of the Sanaga River, the stronghold of this species appears to be the coastal areas of Congo (Conkouati-Douli NP) and Gabon (Loango, Moukalaba-Doudou and Mayumba). Its strongholds in West Africa include Korup NP in Cameroon, and Okomu and Cross River NPs, and Omo Forest Reserve in Nigeria. The species is still present in a number of protected areas including: Banyang-Mbo Wildlife Sanctuary, Campo-Ma'an NP, Douala-Edea Reserve, Korup NP and the proposed Ebo NP (Cameroon); Conkouati-Douli NP (Congo); Monte Alén NP (Equatorial Guinea); Loango, Mayumba, Moukalaba-Doudou and Pongara NPs, and Sette Cama Forest Reserve (Gabon); and Okomu NP, Cross River NP (Nigeria). Outside the protected areas, the species is increasingly rare to absent, especially in areas with medium-to-high human population density, high agricultural activity, or active logging concessions.<br/></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The recent decline may be part of a longer-term fluctuation and the population should be monitored carefully to ascertain whether it shows signs of stabilising.,"The species breeds on coastal saltmarshes, sand and shingle beaches, dunes, cliff-tops with short grass and occasionally rocky shores, as well as inland along the shores of lakes, reservoirs and rivers or on agricultural grass and cereal fields, often some distance from water (Hayman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;Outside of the breeding season the species is chiefly coastal, frequenting estuarine mudflats, saltmarshes and sandy and rocky shores (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996).&#160;The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground often on raised surfaces (e.g. earth banks) in the open or in short vegetation on cultivated or uncultivated land, cliff-tops, rocky outcrops or clearings in taller vegetation including woods and moorland (Hayman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1986,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996,&#160;Snow &amp;&#160;Perrins 1998).<br/><br/>Most populations of this species are fully migratory, inland breeders moving to the coast for the winter (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds from April to July (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986) in solitary pairs or small groups (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), during the winter foraging singly or in small groups of up to 10 individuals (Snow &amp; Perrins 1998) and with larger flocks often forming in major bays and estuaries and at roosting sites (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow &amp; Perrins 1998). When foraging on soft intertidal substrates bivalves and gastropods are the most important food items for this species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Polychaetes and crustaceans are more important in estuaries however, and molluscs (e.g. mussels, limpets and whelks) are most important on rocky shores (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). When inland, prey such as earthworms and insect larvae (e.g. caterpillars and cranefly larvae) are also taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).","The main threat to the species is the over-fishing of benthic shellfish and the resulting disappearance of intertidal mussel and cockle beds (Atkinson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003, Verhulst <em>et al.</em> 2004, Ens 2006, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Bait digging has also been identified as a threat through loss of prey species and disturbance to the benthic fauna (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is also threatened by habitat degradation on its wintering grounds due to land reclamation (for example in the Yellow Sea [Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014]), pollution, human disturbance (Kelin &amp; Qiang 2006) (e.g. from construction work or recreational activities [Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014]), coastal barrage construction (Burton 2006), industrial development including development of ports and oil extraction, oil spills, wind farms (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014) and reduced river flows (Kelin &amp; Qiang 2006). Rapid and extensive land reclamation is reported from staging and wintering grounds for the <em>osculans</em> population in South Korea and China and large-scale planting of <em>Spartina alterniflora</em> on the coast of eastern China may cause loss of foraging and nesting habitats (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014). Intensive agriculture including frequent mowing of grasslands and high densities of grazing livestock threatens chicks, eggs and nests and high levels of fertilizers and pesticides can reduce soil invertebrate biomass (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). A reduction in eutrophication is likely to have contributed to declines in some areas, owing to a loss of food resources (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014, H. Meltofte <em>in litt</em>. 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Sea level rise leading to increased coastal erosion and flooding is contributing to habitat loss in some areas (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014, van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Climate change has advanced the average egg-laying date of the species and is likely to reduce recruitment of bivalves, however warmer winters are expected to benefit the species leading to lower winter mortality (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Droughts in some inland areas are likely to lead to a loss of suitable habitat (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sarychev &amp; Mischenko 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is hunted in France but the effects of hunting at the population level are not known (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). It may be subject to subsistence egg collection in China (Melville <em>et al</em>, 2014) and illegal hunting elsewhere (Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014). Eggs and chicks are known to be predated by Corvidae, gulls, American Mink&#160;<em>Neovison vison</em>, dogs and foxes&#160;<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>&#160;(Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014).&#160;The invasive Pacific Oyster <em>Crassostrea gigas</em> has become abundant in the Oosterschelde (Netherlands) and is increasing in the Dutch Wadden Sea (van de Pol et al. 2014). Eurasian Oystercatcher generally does not eat this species of oyster which is reported to be invading mussel beds and may compete with cockles and mussels thus reducing food availability. However Pacific Oyster beds could also provide an area for mussel beds to re-establish. The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville &amp;&#160;Shortridge 2006).<br/><br/>In the northern part of the <em>longipes</em> population breeding range, cessation of grazing in coastal areas leading to development of shrubby vegetation threatens breeding habitats (Sarychev and Mischenko 2014). Conversely, intensive grazing in some areas may pose a threat to this population. Pollution from sewage, heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides have been identified as potential threats for the&#160;<em>osculans&#160;</em>population (Melville&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).","The global   population is estimated to number c. 925,000-1,030,000 individuals, based on expert opinion (Wetlands   International 2019), and comprising the three separate subspecies of <em>H. o. ostralegus</em>&#160;(820,000),&#160;<em>H. o.&#160;longpipes</em>&#160;(100,000-200,000) and <em>H. o. osculans</em>&#160;(5,000-10,000; Wetlands International 2019). This is roughly equivalent to 616,667-686,667 mature individuals, here placed in the band 500,000-999,999 mature individuals. Population estimates are lower than those of recent assessments due to the recent taxonomic split, whereby <em>Haematopus finschi</em>&#160;(South Island Oystercatcher), previously considered a subspecies of <em>Haematopus ostralegus</em>&#160;(del Hoyo <em>et. al.</em> 2014), was designated a separate species.",Decreasing,"The species has a wide range comprising three flyway populations. <em>H. o. ostralegus</em> breeds from <strong>Iceland</strong> and <strong>Scandinavia</strong> east to north-west&#160;<strong>Russia</strong>, south through <strong>U.K.</strong> to north-west <strong>France</strong>, with isolated populations in the Mediterranean, and winters on coasts south to West Africa. <em>H. o. longipes</em> breeds from west and central Russia south to the Black, Caspian and Aral Seas, and east to western Siberia, and winters on coasts from East Africa through Arabia to <strong>India</strong>; <em>H. o. osculans</em> breeds from coastal north-east Russia through Manchuria to the west and south coasts of the Korean Peninsula south to Fujian province, <strong>China</strong>, and winters in eastern China and along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula (more than 50% of the population is thought to winter at just one site, Yubu Island, <strong>South Korea </strong>and a further 25% are thought to winter at Lianyunggang, Jiangsu, China; Melville&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>H. o. ostralegus</em>&#160;is not significantly exploited by human populations. Across most of its distribution, the species is legally protected and has not been hunted since the mid-1980s however, hunting remains a major source of mortality for <em>ostralegus</em>&#160;throughout France (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Between 1993-99, between 1,800-2,000 (mild winters) and 8,000-17,000 (severe winters where birds wintered in France to avoid more northerly locations) were shot per year (Trolliet 2000, Triplet 2000).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>The species is listed on Annex II (B) of the EU Birds Directive.

There is also evidence that the creation of large marine protected areas (MPAs) to protect this species from the threat of anthropogenic shellfish over-fishing may not be an effective management or conservation technique on a global scale, especially if over-fishing continues to occur in adjacent areas (Verhulst&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). Limit human activities in some areas to prevent disturbance (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Limit hunting in France when cold weather pushes large numbers of birds into France (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Increase awareness of the species. Support traditional farming methods that benefit the species in the range of the&#160;<em>longipes</em>&#160;population (Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014).<br/><br/>Monitor populations at wintering and breeding areas throughout its range, and record breeding success. Introduce frequent standardised surveys, particularly in the Nordic countries (van de Pol <em>et al</em>. 2014). Research breeding distribution of the&#160;<em>osculans</em>&#160;population, conduct ringing studies to understand migratory patterns and investigate why Yubu Island in South Korea and southern Shandong/northern Jiangsu in China are key sites for the species (Melville&#160;<em>et al</em>, 2014). Identify stopover sites and wintering areas for the&#160;<em>longipes</em>&#160;population (Sarychev &amp;&#160;Mischenko 2014). Assess impacts of land reclamation on the species in South Korea and China (Melville <em>et al</em>. 2014). Further research is needed to investigate the cause of declines in areas such as Germany and Denmark, to model the potential effects of climate change on the species, assess the impact of human disturbance and to look at population dynamics (van de Pol&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
155057916,11533,Lepidochelys kempii,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2019,2019-01-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The global population of the Kemp's Ridley is represented   by a single population with no known subpopulations (Bowen 1991, Bowen and   Karl 2007). This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with   approximately 71.2% of nesting for the species occurring on a single, 30.4 km   stretch of nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at Rancho   Nuevo, Mexico. The Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under   the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd based on an observed population   size reduction of more than 80% (estimated reduction = 82.6–88.3%) over the past three generations (<span class=""MsoHyperlink"">Bevan <em>et al</em>.   2016), whose causes are known and reversible, (e.g. egg collection   for human consumption), but some of which have not yet ceased (e.g.   incidental capture in fisheries, pollution).<br/><br/><strong>Justification<br/></strong>The Kemp's Ridley population qualifies for Critically   Endangered under criterion A2bd due to a long-term reduction in population   size that exceeds 80% (82.6–88.3%) the causes of which are known but have   not ceased. This reduction in nesting is based on comprehensive nesting data   since 1978 and on estimates of historic population size based on the 1947   Herrera film (Hildebrand, 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) (see Figure 2 in Supplementary Information). The availability   of long-term nest counts (as an index of population abundance), and their   comparison to historic population estimates by Hildebrand (1963),   documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic   and current nesting data&#160;<span class=""MsoHyperlink"">(<span class=""MsoHyperlink"">Bevan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016), indicate that the current population represents a greater   than 80% reduction in historic population size (i.e. 82.6–88.3%   reduction). &#160;By comparing abundance   trends from recent years with an independent quantification of the estimated   number of turtles in the 1947 arribada filmed by Andres Herrera (i.e.   estimate of 26,916 turtles in a single arribada, one of several that occur   annually) and a previous estimate of total nesting abundance in that arribada   (40,000 turtles; Hildebrand [1963]) facilitated updated estimates of total   nest abundance in 1947. Using this approach, Bevan <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated   between 121,517 and 180,587 nests during the 1947 nesting season. In   contrast, the maximum annual abundance of nests over the past several decades   was 25,654 in 2017, and has averaged 21,156 from 2016 to 2018 (see Figure 2&#160;in Supplementary Information).   Causes for this recent deviation from exponential recovery are unknown at   present, but possibly include factors such as fisheries bycatch, impact of   the 2010 'Deepwater Horizon' oil   spill (DWH NRDA Trustees 2016; Gallaway <em>et al</em>. 2016a, b; McDonald <em>et   al</em>. 2017; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2017; Mitchelmore <em>et al</em>. 2017), and current   carrying capacity of the GoM&#160; (Caillouet   <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The causes for the decline from 1947–1985, ranging from   an estimate of 99.4% to 99.6% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) were   clearly understood (e.g. incidental capture by fisheries, egg harvesting, and   natural predation at the nesting beach), and were reversible. The population   exhibited an exponential increase from approximately mid 1990s to 2009 due   to reduction of egg harvest on key nesting beaches as well as implementation   of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in trawl gear operating in the Gulf of   Mexico (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is   unknown whether or not the recent deviation from exponential recovery is temporary, and if the recovery of the   Kemp's Ridley will regain its exponential recovery rate that was present   prior to 2010.<br/><br/>In summary, the current population   represents &lt;20% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) of the historic population, or a &gt;80%   decline in abundance, and though causes for this decline are understood, they   have not yet ceased. For these reasons, the Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion A: <em>Critically   Endangered<br/></em>Rationale: An observed population size reduction of ≥80%   (estimate ranging from to 88.3% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) to 82.6%   (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016)) over three generations based on b) an index of abundance   appropriate for the Kemp's Ridley (i.e. total number of nests per season),   and d) actual or potential levels of exploitation. Primary factors   contributing to the decline included 1) harvesting of eggs on the nesting   beach (Hildebrand 1963; Adams, 1966), 2) incidental capture by fisheries   (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011. Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990), and 3) natural predation on the   nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963, Pritchard and Marquez 1973, Marquez 1994).&#160; The observed decline is based   on a comparison to historic population estimates in Hildebrand (1963),   documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic   and current nesting data (Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Despite an exponential increase   in abundance from the 1990s through 2009, the recent deviation from this   exponential recovery rate since 2009 is currently not understood and may not   be reversible. These factors are also the basis for the conclusion that the   Kemp's Ridley is Critically Endangered   under Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion B: <em>Least   Concern<br/></em>Although the Kemp's Ridley occurs throughout the   coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of USA, all   Kemp’s belong to a single location (i.e. genetic stock). The Kemp's Ridley has shown a strong site fidelity   over time for the primary nesting beach near Rancho Nuevo (at least since   1947 Herrera film). Approximately 71.2% of global Kemp's nesting occurs on   30.4 linear km of beach near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and approximately 97% of   the Kemp's Ridley global population’s nesting activity occurs on a 146 km   stretch of beach that includes Rancho Nuevo along the western Gulf of Mexico   in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Thus, the area of occupancy (AOO) is less   than 500 km<sup>2</sup>. Lower levels of nesting occur in scattered areas   along the coasts of Veracruz, Mexico, and Texas, US, but these beaches serve   as nesting habitat for less than 3% of the population. The occurrence of a   single primary nesting beach qualifies under B2a “Severely fragmented or   known to exist at only a single location” and it has an area of less than 500   km<sup>2</sup> (B2). Additionally, the Kemp's Ridley has had an unexpected   deviation from its exponent recovery rate, but it is unclear whether this is   actually a continuing decline in population size. Therefore, this   subpopulation is Least Concern under criterion B.<br/><br/>Criterion C and D: <em>Least   Concern<br/></em>Population of mature individuals (adult males and   females) is currently estimated as 15,664 therefore, the Kemp's Ridley does   not qualify for a threatened category under criteria C or D. The   current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (22,341) was   calculated using standard IUCN protocol for sea turtle red list assessment.&#160; The calculation takes into account the average   number of annual nests from 2016-2018 (n=21,156), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, a   remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males   (all values are reviewed in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's   Ridley; NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Criterion E: Not assessed<br/>Rationale: There have been no formal PVAs conducted</span></p>","The Kemp's Ridley inhabits coastal areas throughout the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States (Hildebrand 1982, Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994) (Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (see Geographic Range for detailed range/distribution). Although the primary nesting beach is located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, coastal areas throughout the GoM are important developmental and foraging habitat, as well as migratory corridors for reproductively active adults (Dobie <em>et al</em>. 1961; Hildebrand 1963, 1982; Ogren and McVea 1982; Marquez 1984; Hildebrand 1987; Ogren 1989; Witzell and Schmid 2005; Pritchard 2007; Shaver and Rubio 2008; Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013; Shaver <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160;2016a, 2016b; Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017). Additionally, the regular occurrence of juvenile Kemp's Ridleys in coastal areas along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. indicate that these areas also represent developmental and foraging habitats (Lazell 1980, Morreale <em>et al</em>. 1992, Musick and Limpus 1997). In addition to the coastal neritic habitats, the offshore (‘oceanic’) waters of the GoM and Atlantic Coast of the U.S. are also habitats for hatchling, post hatchling, and juvenile Kemp's Ridleys (Witherington <em>et al.</em> 2012, Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013, McDonald <em>et al</em>. 2017). These areas of the GoM and Atlantic represent important developmental and foraging habitat for both oceanic and neritic life history stages of the Kemp's Ridley. &#160;&#160;For further information on Kemp's Ridley habitat use and ecology, see reviews in NMFS <em>et al</em>.

This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with a single primary nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico.<br/><br/>Population assessment methods for sea turtles have been addressed recently (Committee on Sea Turtle Population Assessment Methods 2010, Bjorndal <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2016). A variety of metrics can provide insight on the size and dynamics within a population.&#160; In the case of the Kemp's Ridley, the number of nests produced per year by this species represents an accurate metric for estimating the size of the adult population. Further, this metric has been has been consistently recorded for several decades in the Kemp's Ridley.<br/><br/>The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (n=22,341) was calculated using the standard IUCN&#160; protocol for sea turtle Red List assessments. The calculation takes into account the total average number of annual nests from 2016–2018 (n=21,156; see Table 1 in Supplementary Information), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, an average remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males. All values are reviewed and reported in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Kemp's Ridley has one of the most restricted distributions of all sea turtles (Wallace   <em>et al</em>. 2010; see range map and Figure 1 in Supplementary Information). This species is primarily distributed throughout the   Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States (Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973; Marquez 1984, 1994;   Pritchard 2007), with rare occurrences&#160; along the Atlantic coasts of Canada, Europe,   as well as Bermuda, the Azores, Madeira, and the Mediterranean Sea (Carr and   Caldwell 1956;&#160;Carr 1957, 1980; Mowbray and Caldwell 1958; Zwinenberg 1977; Brongersma <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. 1979;   Brongersma 1982; Bolton and Martins 1990; Tomás <em>et al</em>. 2003; Marquez-M.&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004; Guzman-Hernandez   <em>et al</em>. 2007; Witt <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007; Tomás and Raga 2008;&#160;Ernst and Lovich 2009; Insacco and Spadola 2010; Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2015; Shaver <em>et al</em>. 2015). Nesting is primarily restricted to the western Gulf of   Mexico, ranging from Texas, United States, to Veracruz, Mexico, with the   majority of nesting occurring on an approximate 30 km stretch of the primary   nesting beach with an epicenter located near Playa de Rancho Nuevo, in the   state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. (see Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994, Pritchard 2007, NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011, Shaver <em>et al</em>. 2016b).</p>",The Kemp's Ridley is a protected species throughout its distribution in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastal waters of the U.S. There is no legal trade of this species.,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>Sections   G.1.1. through G.3.1 of the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley   Sea Turtle (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011) provide a comprehensive review of the   conservation actions that have been implemented to protect the Kemp's Ridley   and facilitate its recovery.&#160; Those   sections are shown below:<br/><br/><strong>G.1. Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</strong><br/><br/><em>G.1.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Efforts   to protect nesting Kemp's Ridleys and nesting beaches in Mexico have been   ongoing since the 1960s (Marquez 1994). Legal ordinances were enacted that   prohibited harvest of certain marine turtle species seasonally from May to   August in the Gulf of Mexico in 1973 (DOF 1973); and all marine turtle   species that occurred along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico were protected   year-round in 1978 (Márquez <em>et al</em>. 1989). In 1990, take of all marine turtle   species was prohibited by presidential decree (DOF 1990). Also in 1990, the Secretariat of Urban   Development and Ecology (SEDUE) and Secretariat of Fisheries (SEPESCA)   published the “Programa Nacional de Protection y Conservacion de Tortugas   Marinas (Propuesta).” This document was the origin of the National Program   for Protection, Conservation, Research and Management of Marine Turtles,   which was implemented in 2000 and which proposed strategies and actions for   the protection, conservation, and recovery of marine turtle populations that   nest in Mexico. Rancho Nuevo was declared a Natural Reservation in 1977 (DOF   1977) and further protection measures were added in 1986 (DOF 1986, Marquez <em>et   al</em>. 1989). Rancho Nuevo was declared a   Sanctuary in 2002 (DOF 2002). In 2004, it was included in the listing of   Wetlands of International Importance under the Convention on Wetlands   (RAMSAR).<br/><br/>In   1993, Mexico mandated the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in the Gulf   of Mexico and the Caribbean through the publication of the Official Mexican   Norm NOM-002-PESC-1993 (DOF 1993). In   1997, the NOM was modified to require the use of hard TEDs along the Pacific,   Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean coasts (DOF 1997). Hard TEDs are similar to those used in the   U.S., consisting of a metal grid installed in front of the codend and an   escape opening either at the top or bottom of the net. These, and a number of factors are   responsible for the post-1990 increase in survival rates (e.g. nest   protection, TEDs, decreased shrimping effort), which have contributed to the   increase in reproduction documented on the nesting beaches (TEWG 1998,   Heppell <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>G.1.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>The   Kemp's Ridley has been protected under U.S. law since its listing as an   endangered species on December 2, 1970. The US Endangered Species Act (ESA)   prohibits ‘take’ of species listed under its authority. Take is defined as   “harass, harm [to the species or its habitat], pursue, hunt, shoot, wound,   kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such   conduct.” Exceptions to the take prohibitions may be provided under the ESA   for research, experimental populations, and take incidental to otherwise   legal activities as long as the take does not jeopardize the continued   existence of the species or adversely modify the species’ critical habitat.   The ESA also calls for recovery plans, such as this one, to help guide the   recovery of the species. Protection from international trade has been   afforded by CITES under which the Kemp's Ridley is listed on Appendix I.<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Beach Protection</strong><br/><br/><em>G.2.1.&#160; Mexico<br/></em>In   1966, Mexico sent a team of biologists that included Humberto Chavez, Martin   Contreras, and, in 1967, Rene Marquez, to Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, to survey   the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle population at Rancho Nuevo, and to establish a   conservation effort for this diminishing population (Chavez <em>et al.</em> 1967). The   objective of the effort in Mexico was to protect the remaining nesting females,   their eggs and hatchlings from human and animal predators thus eliminating   the land-based mortality from the life cycle.<br/><br/>From   1966 to 1987, the conservation program focused on the area of Rancho Nuevo   with the camp located first at Barra Calabazas and then at Barra Coma where   it presently exists. In 1977, the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (FWS),   Mexico’s National Park Service (NPS), the US National Marine Fisheries   Service (NMFS), and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) all joined   in the conservation efforts with Mexico’s Instituo Nacional de Pesca (INP) at   Rancho Nuevo (Manzella <em>et al</em>. 1988, Woody 1989).&#160; In 1988, the program (now a bi-national   one), expanded to the south to Barra del Tordo with a camp at Playa Dos. In   1989, a third camp was established to the north at Barra Ostionales on Rancho   Los Pericos. The north camp's location was changed 10 km to the north of its   original location, to near the town of Tepehuajes in 1996 for logistical   reasons. Also in 1996, in coordination with SEMARNAP and the Tamaulipas'   State Government, a camp was established in La Pesca. Under SEMARNAP’s   supervision, Gladys Porter Zoo (GPZ), Administracion’ Portuaria Integral de   Altamira (API Altamira) and Universidad del Noreste expanded the project to   include the beaches of Tampico and Altamira. In Veracruz, El Raudal camp was   installed in 1994, but was later transferred to Lechuguillas, municipality of   Vega de Alatorre. In 1997, this camp   was incorporated into the bi-national program.<br/><br/>In   the 2002 season, two auxiliary corrals were constructed on the Rancho Nuevo   beach. One was located to the north at Barra Carrizo and the other was   constructed to the south. The additional corrals were constructed to protect   nests from predation, decrease the distance eggs were transported, and   provide additional space to the main corral at Rancho Nuevo.<br/><br/>Today,   general monitoring and protection activities consist of daily beach patrols   made by one team to search for nesting females and protect observed nests.   When several females are counted in one trip, the monitoring team alerts the   camps of a possible arribada event. During the arribadas, several teams   patrol the beach on all-terrain vehicles, collecting biological data from   females and relocating clutches to the protected corrals. The clutches are   collected and transported to the corrals as soon as possible, with the   necessary precautions to avoid the early embryo mortality caused by handling.   Each clutch is reburied in a cavity of similar size and depth as the <em>in situ</em>   nest and marked for monitoring throughout the incubation period.&#160; After hatchlings emerge from their nests,   they are counted, collected, and released in large groups in different spots   on the beach. The content of the nest is excavated after the hatchlings are   released to determine hatching success.<br/><br/><em>G.2.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>During   the last 50 years, more confirmed Kemp's Ridley nests have been located at Padre   Island National Sea Shore (PAIS) in south Texas than at any other location in   the U.S. (Shaver and Caillouet 1998, Shaver 2005a).&#160; The first documented record of Kemp's Ridley nesting on the Texas coast was made in 1948 (Carr 1967) at what was   later designated as PAIS. PAIS is considered a secondary nesting colony   (Shaver 1998a, Shaver 1999). Nests have been found elsewhere in the   southeastern U.S. in conjunction with reports from the public and during   monitoring conducted for loggerhead nesting activity (Anonymous 1992, Marquez   <em>et al</em>. 1996, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1999, Foote and Mueller 2002, Williams<em> et al</em>.   2006).<br/><br/>Since   1986, NPS staff and volunteers have conducted patrols on North Padre Island   to detect and protect nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles and their eggs, determine   results of the imprinting and headstarting experiment (see G.4.2. Imprinting   and Headstarting), and gather biological data (Shaver 1990, 2005a).&#160; Patrols are conducted along the entire 128   km Gulf of Mexico shoreline of North Padre Island, including 104 km of PAIS   and 24 km north of the PAIS north boundary and patrol effort increased over   time (Shaver 2004, 2005a).&#160; From   1986–1994, the entire North Padre Island target patrol area was covered from   2–5 days each week. From 1995–1997, the entire area was covered seven days each   week. Starting in 1998, the entire area was repeatedly traversed each day to   increase the likelihood of observing nesting females and locating their eggs.<br/><br/>Systematic   patrol programs were developed by various entities to detect Kemp's nesting   at other locations in Texas starting in 1999.&#160;   NPS staff at PAIS aided with development of many of these other   nesting patrol projects by providing training, technical assistance, and some   equipment.<br/><br/>FWS,   Sea Turtle, Inc., and GPZ (some years) led a program of repeated daily   patrols by staff, volunteers, and interns on the 11 km of Boca Chica Beach   beginning in 1999 and on the northernmost 51 km of South Padre Island   beginning in 2000. Additional walking patrols were conducted on the southern   developed portion of South Padre Island starting in 2006. FWS staff and Texas   Master Naturalists volunteers began patrols on 45 km of Matagorda Island in   2003 and later expanded this program to include more days per week, repeated   daily patrols, and the entire Kemp's Ridley nesting season. Staff and   volunteers with the Animal Rehabilitation Keep (ARK) and University of Texas   Marine Science Institute at Port Aransas conducted a few nesting patrols on   30 km of Mustang Island during the 2004 nesting season. The program was   reinstituted and expanded to encompass at least one patrol per day during   most days of the nesting season in 2006 and all days of the nesting season   starting in 2007. San Jose Island has been patrolled once every eighth day   since the mid-1990s. In 2005, volunteers with Help Endangered Animals-Ridley   Turtles (HEART) and the Sea Turtle Restoration Project conducted patrols   intermittently during the nesting season along various segments of the 230 km   shoreline between Sabine Pass and the Matagorda Peninsula. This effort   continued, but starting in 2006 FWS led the intermittent patrols by staff and   volunteers on the northern end of Matagorda Peninsula. Texas A&amp;M   University at Galveston (TAMU) conducted patrols on Galveston Island starting   in 2007 and on Bolivar Peninsula starting in 2008.<br/><br/>Educational   programs alerting beach users to report nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles were   implemented at PAIS in the mid-1980s and later expanded coast-wide by various   groups (Shaver 1990, 2004, 2005a, 2006b, 2006c; Shaver and Miller 1999).   Beach user reports have been investigated, resulting in documentation of up   to half of the Kemp's Ridley nests found in Texas each year through the   mid-2000s. However, from 2006–2010, beach users only found 14–21% of the   annual number nests documented in Texas, likely due to the more comprehensive   patrol programs conducted state-wide during those years.<br/><br/>From   1978-1999, eggs from the nests found by patrollers and beach users along the   entire Texas coast were transported to the incubation facility at PAIS for   protected care. After 2000, eggs from most nests located on North Padre   Island and northward on the Texas coast were transferred to the   facility.&#160; The first two incubation   facilities at PAIS were screen-enclosed structures attached to   buildings.&#160; The first was operated from   1978–1982, the second was operated from 1983-2005, and both were used to hold   over 22,000 incubating eggs received from Mexico during the experimental   imprinting and headstarting project from 1978-1988 (see G.4.2. Imprinting and   Headstarting).&#160; A larger solid-walled   building was used starting in 2006. Further information on the incubation   facilities and egg care procedures can be found in Shaver (1989, 1990, 1994,   1997a, 1997b, 1998a, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2006a,   2006b) and Shaver <em>et al</em>. (1988). Nearly all of the turtles hatched in the   incubation facility were released during the early evening, night, or morning   at the northern end of PAIS, in the vicinity of the incubation facility,   although a few were released elsewhere on the beach. Healthy hatchlings from   all but one of the nests found in Texas were allowed to go free after   release.<br/><br/>However,   hatchlings from one Texas nest were transferred to the NMFS Galveston   Laboratory for headstarting, as were the majority of hatchlings that emerged   from eggs that were part of the 1978–1988 experimental imprinting effort (see   G.4.2. Imprinting and Headstarting).<br/><br/>Starting   in 2008, some nests found at the southern end of PAIS were incubated in a   corral located at the turtle patrol base camp, near the PAIS 64-km marker.   The hatchlings from these nests were released at the southern end of PAIS (D.   Shaver, PAIS, pers. comm. 2009).<br/><br/>In   2000 and 2001, eggs found on Boca Chica Beach and South Padre Island were   transferred to a corral on Boca Chica Beach.&#160;   In 2002, eggs found on Boca Chica Beach were transferred to a corral   there and on South Padre Island were transferred to a corral there. Starting   in 2003, eggs from both South Padre Island and Boca Chica Beach nests were   incubated in a corral on South Padre Island.&#160;   The hatchlings were released at the corral locations that they emerged   from on Boca Chica Beach or South Padre Island.<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Marine Protection<br/><br/></strong><em>G.3.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Mexico   has implemented several protection measures for turtles in the marine   environment. Sailing and fishing within 6.44 km of the beach at Rancho Nuevo   was prohibited through the 1986 amendment to the declaration of Rancho Nuevo   as a National Reservation and the 2002 declaration as a Sanctuary. TEDs have   been required in the shrimp fishery operating in the Gulf of Mexico and   Caribbean since 1993.<br/><br/>Mexican   Official Standard NOM-029 (DOF 2006) prohibits the longline shark fishery   from fishing in a 5 km buffer zone off the six beaches of Tamaulipas from   March through June and the five beaches of Veracruz from March through   August, which overlap with the nesting period of the Kemp's Ridley.&#160; The NOM also mandated removal of fish hooks   from turtles captured incidentally and required longlines to be used in the   marine zone, away from a coastal band of 18.53 km starting from the baseline   from which the Territorial Sea is measured (DOF 2007).<br/><br/><em>G.3.2.   United States</em><br/>Development   of TEDs began in the late 1970s to reduce incidental capture of sea turtles   in the shrimp fishery (Henwood <em>et al</em>. 1992). TEDs consist of a device that   prevents the turtle from entering the codend of the net and an escape opening   that allows the turtle to escape. TEDs were first required by Florida state   law in 1987 to be used by large shrimp vessels operating along the east coast   of Florida between 28° and 29° N. latitudes.&#160;   From 1987 through 1990, their seasonal use in the shrimp fishery   expanded to include all ocean waters south of the North Carolina/Virginia   border all the way around to Texas. Beginning in 1992, TEDs were required in   the summer flounder fishery operating in waters off North Carolina to   southern Virginia; at the same time, the shrimp fishery rules were expanded   to require TED use in both inshore and ocean waters during all times of the   year. The National Research Council (Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990) reviewed numerous   studies and data and determined that there was strong evidence that shrimp   trawling was the primary cause of sea turtle mortality in the southeast   United States. They estimated that shrimp trawling caused 86% of the human   caused mortalities of juvenile and adult sea turtles. The consistent and   correct use of TEDs has reduced mortality due to shrimp fishing and   contributed to the Kemp's Ridley population increase. It is also likely that   the decline in the shrimp fishing effort in the northern Gulf of Mexico since   the early 1990s has reduced sea turtle mortalities from shrimp trawling   (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart and Nance, 2013, NMFS 2007a).<br/><br/>Since   1990, corresponding with the more widespread use of TEDs in U.S. waters, the   instantaneous mortality rate of neritic sea turtles (all species observed to   interact with the shrimp fishery) has been reduced by 44%-50% (TEWG 2000).   The range in annual mortality reduction represents the post-1990 mortality   multiplier necessary to be included in the model to obtain the observed rate   of the Kemp's Ridley population increase. Age-based models indicate an   increase in large benthic and adult survival post-1990s (Heppell <em>et al</em>.   2005).<br/><br/>In   addition to the use of TEDs, time and area closures have been established to   enhance shrimp catch. The Texas Legislature established the Texas Closure   through the Shrimp Conservation Act of 1959. The Texas Closure was   implemented to delay harvest of brown shrimp in the Texas Territorial Sea   (TTS) until the shrimp reach a larger, more valuable size and to minimize   waste caused by discarding smaller shrimp during Gulf harvest (Fuls 2001).   The timing of the closure can be altered by Texas, but generally occurs   mid-May through mid-July, which coincides with the peak Kemp's Ridley nesting   period. In addition, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council Shrimp   Fishery Management Plan implements a closure of the U.S. waters off Texas to   complement the traditional Texas Closure. Several rules were adopted in the   early 2000s by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission to reduce fishing   effort on shrimp stocks and provide additional protection to sea turtles,   particularly in the nearshore Gulf (Osburn <em>et al</em>. 2003). The most significant rule conserving Kemp's Ridleys in Texas is a seasonal shrimping closure from Corpus Christi Fish   Pass to the Texas-Mexico border (177 linear km) including all of PAIS from   the beach out to 5 nautical miles from December 1 to the Summer Gulf opening   or July 15. Historically, 68% of the   turtle strandings and less than 3% of the total Texas shrimp weight of   landings occur in this area during this timeframe. However, despite TED   regulations and reductions in fishing effort, significant correlations   between sea turtle stranding rates and shrimp trawling intensities in the northwestern   Gulf of Mexico continued to exist through at least 1993 (Caillouet <em>et al</em>.   1996).<br/><br/>Other   gear regulations may also protect Kemp's Ridleys. Several states, including   Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Hampshire and Florida, maintain offshore   areas permanently closed to trawling. The State of Georgia requires the use   of NMFS-approved TEDs in all trawl fisheries operating in state waters. South   Carolina uses a water-temperature trigger to ensure whelk trawling occurs   only when sea turtles are less abundant.&#160;   Many states (South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas)   have prohibited gillnets, but there remain active fisheries in other states   and in Federal waters.&#160; Several   regulations have been implemented to protect sea turtles, including Kemp's Ridleys. Since 2001, gillnet   restrictions have been implemented in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and in   offshore waters of the Economic Exclusive Zone to reduce sea turtle   interactions.&#160; In 2002, NMFS   prohibited, in certain areas and at certain times in the Chesapeake Bay,   Virginia, pound nets with leaders having mesh greater than or equal to 30.5   cm and leaders with stringers.<br/><br/>The   Marine Pollution Act was enacted under the International Convention for the   Prevention of Pollution from Ships and subsequent regulations by the United   States Coast Guard (USCG) to restrict the discharge of plastics and set the   standards for other solid waste dumping into the marine environment (Shaver   and Plotkin 1998). A large portion of the debris found washed ashore at the   nesting beach, and presumably floating in neonatal/juvenile pelagic habitat,   is garbage dumped from ships and oil platforms. Over 90% of the trash is   composed of inorganic material, mainly plastic (Sarti <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160; The regulations prohibit the disposal by   all vessels and offshore platforms of all plastics, paper, rags, glass,   metal, bottles, crockery, and similar refuse.<br/><br/>Oil   and gas exploration activities require mitigation and measures to minimize   the impacts to the Kemp's Ridley nesting beaches and marine environment.   Various Federal, state, and local entities have developed spill contingency   plans that are updated annually. These entities formed emergency response   teams to reduce potential impacts from these spills. Oil and gas exploration   and development occur at PAIS. The NPS   strictly regulates these activities through the use of NPS regulations,   in-depth environmental assessments under the National Environmental Policy   Act, consultation with resource agencies, and close coordination with the mineral   owners and developers. The NPS and FWS   work to make sure that the conditions under which approval of this drilling   is granted protect the park's resources, especially the Kemp's Ridley turtle.   Measures have been developed to protect Kemp's Ridleys, and the plans   allowing for the drilling of new wells incorporate these strict   measures. Patrols are conducted at   PAIS to locate and move eggs for protected incubation, thereby limiting   threats from oil and gas activities and natural threats to the eggs and   hatchlings. Beach patrols also involve location and protection of nesting and   live- stranded turtles, although beach visitors sometimes find them before   patrollers arrive. Oil and gas development and exploration in other areas on   the Texas coast where Kemp's Ridleys have been documented nesting are   regulated by various local, state, and Federal regulations.</p>",Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is also restricted to a very small area when breeding and these breeding grounds remain highly threatened. <p></p> <p></p>,"It breeds either on broad sandy beaches and dunes (100-200 m from the high tide mark) associated with wetlands (Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008a), or in desert plains 1-3 km inland (Vilina 1998, Guerra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2003, Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008a). The shallow waters of wetlands are thought to offer optimal conditions for foraging, both within and outside the breeding season (Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009). Egg-laying is asynchronous both within and between groups, and occurs from August to February (Vilina 1998, Guerra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003), particularly October to late January (Zavalaga<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2008b). Clutch size is one or two eggs, but usually only one chick fledges (Vilina 1998, Guerra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2003). To counteract high levels of predation it nests in homogeneous habitat in small groups (3-25 nests), loosely aggregated, with inter-nest distances usually over 100 m (Vilina 1998, Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008b), thus making nests difficult to detect (Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008a). Eggs and chicks are well camouflaged with the bare ground. Inland nesting is believed to be a strategy to reduce risk from terrestrial predation, as predators often patrol closer to the shore. Birds are known to be absent during El Niño events (Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008a) and do not attempt to breed (Zavalaga<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2008b). Post-breeding dispersal occurs from April until July, to unknown areas, probably offshore (Mackiernan <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2001). During the 1997-1998 El Niño event, hundreds were sighted 25-200 km offshore, suggesting they can disperse widely during oceanographic anomalies (Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008a).  It generally forages in inshore areas, but is occasionally seen 10-70 km offshore (Mackiernan <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2001). Main prey items include Anchovies <em>Engraulis ringens</em>, South Pacific Sauris <em>Scomberesox saurus scombroides</em> (Guerra <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2003), Peruvian Silversides <em>Odonthestes regia regia</em> and Mote Sculpins <em>Normanychtis crocker</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">i</span>.  Prey items found in nests measured less than 8 cm, indicating a prey size limit imposed by chick body size (Zavalaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008b). <p></p>","<p></p><p>As a ground nesting species, the Peruvian Tern is vulnerable to human activities, which can cause disturbance of nesting adults and a subsequent loss of reproductive success, as well as the loss and degradation of vital nesting habitat. Local small scale harvesting of marine resources such as seaweed, fish and shellfish has been recorded at multiple breeding and non-breeding sited (e.g. Pacasmayo and Paraiso) and is associated with the use of 4x4 vehicles on the beach, introduction of dogs and construction of small fishing camps (Zavalaga <em>et al.</em> 2008ab, Zavalaga <em>et al</em>. 2009). Similar disturbance also occurs due to recreational activities such as off-road driving and dog walking, with disturbance intensifying in Paraiso between 2003 and 2008 (Zavalaga <em>et al.</em> 2009). Feral Cats <em>Felis catus&#160;</em>were recorded at multiple breeding sites in 2008, including Isla Lobos de Tierra and Tres Hermanas-Yanyarina and have been seen to attack Peruvian Terns (Zavalaga <em>et al</em>. 2008a) and may deter settlement and breeding (Zavalaga&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Foxes <em>Pseudolopex </em>spp. have been recorded at almost all nesting sites studies&#160;and are considered among the main predators of tern nests (Zavalaga<em> et al. </em>2008ab, 2009).</p><p></p>  <p>Well known breeding sites have been lost to heavy residential development (Zavalaga <em>et al.</em> 2008a), including the building of shanty towns and summer homes in Puerto Viejo as well as residential and commercial development at Pampa de Mejillones, Northern Chile, causing a reduction in the breeding habitat available to the largest colony of Peruvian Terns (Braby 2011). The expansion of tourist and recreational areas is also a threat to breeding sites (Zavalaga <em>et al.</em> 2009). Conversion of desert plains into agricultural land at nesting sites (e.g. Punta Literas-Pativilica) through the use of irrigation (Zavalaga <em>et al.</em> 2009) represents a further loss of breeding habitat. Significant as only a handful of breeding sites known. Abstraction for irrigation degrades wetland foraging habitat, with the construction of 1.5m sand dam at the Ite site in 2008 increasing water levels in the area, possibly making it unsuitable for the terns, with birds recorded in 2007 but not in 2008 (Zavalaga 2009). Oil exploration near tern nests at San Pedro de Vice is likely to have destroyed possible nesting sites, as well as causing irreversible damage to mangrove ecosystem which Peruvian Terns use to forage (Zavalaga <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p>  <p>Further to this, breeding success at nesting sites in 1980s El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event was reported to drop to 0% at some sites, with breeding not attempted or chicks dying of starvation. This species has been highlighted as being vulnerable to the impacts of ENSO due to the effects of decreased prey availability.</p><p></p>","Estimates range from 100 pairs (G.

In Chile all colonies have been found in the desert plains, generally within 1 km of the coast, but in other locations colonies have also been found on sandy beaches associated with wetlands. A well-known former breeding site at Puerto Viejo is now heavily developed and no longer supports breeding birds<strong> </strong>(Zavalaga <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2008a), and population declines have been noted at Pampa Mejillones and La Portada in Chile.

Some reports suggest that the population may have declined by 50% in the last 10 years<strong> </strong>(Luchsinger 2007). However, there are still unsurveyed sandy beaches away from the Pan-American Highway that could be suitable for nesting, and old colonies that have not been visited since their discovery decades ago, while signs of previously unknown breeding sites have recently been recorded in La Libertad, Peru (Amorós 2011); the total is therefore likely to fall in the range of 1,000-2,500 individuals. <p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>In Chile, CONAMA (2006) has recognized the species as threatened with extinction, and it has been officially classified as Endangered.

It is migratory fish that spawns in rivers. At&#160;10-12 months before spawning, it migrates to turbid waters of rivers such as the Kura and Kuma. Spawning occurs behind sandy scythes on solid ground at a depth of 1-2 m and water temperatures of 20-23°C. This begins in April with a peak in June, and ends in August (Berg 1964). It has semi-pelagic eggs of 1.4 mm in diameter,&#160;which develop in the bottom layer of water. Its&#160;average fecundity is 200,000 eggs, with large females able to have as many as 1,259,000 eggs. The development of fertilised eggs occurs in turbulent water in rivers and early ontogeny takes place in downstream rivers and deltas. Fry and fingerlings usually linger in the river for no more than a year, feeding on benthos, where they then move into the sea (Reshetnikov&#160;2010, Makeeva&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2011).It is benthopelagic and at sea it feeds on molluscs (e.g.&#160;<em>Adacna</em>), river crayfish and aquatic insect larvae.

Adults generally remain within 400 km of their breeding locality, although they have been recorded up to 900 km away (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005, Roberts 2015). They breed and moult on land before taking to the sea, where they can remain for up to four months (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2013, Roberts 2015). On gaining independence, juveniles disperse up to 2,000 km from their natal colonies, with those from the east heading west, and those from the west and south moving north (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Sherley <em>et al. </em>2017). Most birds later return to their natal colony to moult and breed (Randall <em>et al.</em> 1987, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2014a), although the growth of some colonies has been attributed to the immigration of first-time breeders tracking food availability (Crawford 1998, Crawford<em> et al. </em>2013).<strong> </strong>Adults nest colonially, but may also nest in isolation. At sea they forage singly, in pairs or sometimes co-operatively in small groups of up to 150 individuals (Wilson <em>et al. </em>1986, Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Ryan<em> et al. </em>2012, McInnes <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). African Penguins forage more successfully in groups when feeding on schooling fish (McInnes <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;The species breeds year round with peak months varying locally (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the north-western part of the range, peak laying occurs during the months of November to January; in the south-west it occurs between May and July, and in the east between April and June (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2013). The average age at first breeding is thought to be 4-6 years (Whittington <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2005). </p><p><strong>Habitat </strong>This species is marine and usually found within 40 km of the coast (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 1988, Petersen <em>et al.</em> 2006, Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2012), coming ashore on islands or at non-contiguous areas of the mainland coast to breed, moult and rest (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <em>Breeding: </em>Breeding habitats range from flat, sandy islands with varying degrees of vegetation cover, to steep rocky islands with little vegetation (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). African Penguins are sometimes found close to the summit of islands and may move over a kilometre inland in search of breeding sites (Hockey 2001). They usually feed within 20 km of the colony when breeding, although at some colonies the distance is greater (Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2009, Waller 2011, Ludynia<em> et al.</em> 2012, Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160;<em>Non-breeding: </em>At sea, their distribution is mainly restricted to the greater Benguela Current region (Williams 1995).&#160;Juveniles have been observed to travel ~600 km from their natal colonies (Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2017), while immatures up to 700 km with an average of ~370 km from the colony (Grigg and Sherley 2019).&#160; Pre- and post moulting adults have been observed up to 550 km from their colonies (de Blocq <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;</p><p><strong>Diet</strong> Adults feed predominantly on pelagic schooling fish of 50-120 mm length, with important prey including sardine <em>Sardinops sagax,</em> anchovy <em>Engraulis capensis</em>, bearded goby <em>Sufflogobius bibarbatus</em> and round herring <em>Etrumeus </em><em>whiteheadi</em> (Crawford <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1985, Ludynia <em>et al.</em> 2010, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2011). In some localities, cephalopods represent an important food source (Crawford <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1985, Connan <em>et al.</em> 2016). Juveniles are thought to prey on fish larvae (Wilson 1985).<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Breeding site </strong>In the past, nests were usually built in burrows dug in guano or sand (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1976a, Shelton <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1984). Today, with the lack of guano at most colonies, nesting in open areas has become increasingly common (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2012, Pichegru 2013). At some sites, artificial nest-burrows made from pipes and boxes sunken into the ground, and shelters shaped from dry vegetation have been regularly used by the species (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Sherley <em>et al</em>. 2012, Pichegru 2013).   </p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Population declines have been attributed to food shortages resulting from shifts in the distributions of prey species, competition with commercial purse-seine fisheries and environmental fluctuations (e.g. Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2011). A decrease in foraging effort at St Croix Island (Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2012, Sherley <em>et al. </em>2019b) and an increase in chick survival and chick condition at Robben Island (Sherley <em>et al. </em>2015,&#160; 2018, 2019b) following the establishment of 20 km no-take zones provides some support for this theory. In the early 2000s, there was an eastward shift in sardine and anchovy stocks, with the mature biomass of these species decreasing near the breeding islands north of Cape Town (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2011). The abundance of these prey species is known to influence foraging success (Campbell <em>et al. </em>2019, McInnes <em>et al.</em> 2019), breeding success (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2006, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2013b), adult survival (Sherley <em>et al. </em>2014a, Robinson <em>et al. </em>2015), and juvenile survival (Weller <em>et al. </em>2016; Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2017), all of which may often be too low off South Africa’s west coast to maintain population equilibrium (Weller<em> et al. </em>2014, 2016). Western Cape populations declined by 69% between 2001-2009, considered at least partly due to this climate-induced shift in fish stocks. African penguin fledglings travelled to areas of low sea surface temperatures and high chlorophyll-a which were historically reliable cues for fish availability.&#160; Climate change and industrial fishing have depleted forage fish in these areas, resulting in an ecological trap for the species and associated low juvenile survival (Sherley<em> et al. </em>2017).&#160; In Namibia, where sardine and anchovy are virtually absent from the foraging ranges of breeding penguins, breeding birds feed principally on the energy-poor Bearded Goby <em>Sufflogobius bibarbatus</em> (Ludynia <em>et al. </em>2010). Limited penguin mortality in fishing nets may increase if gill-nets are set near colonies (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1998, Crawford <em>et al. </em>2017).</p><p>Human disturbance and egg-collecting were important factors in the decline of the species in the early 20th century (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1976b, Ellis<em> et al.</em> 1998, Shannon and Crawford 1999). While egg collection is now illegal.&#160; an incident of egg poaching was recorded in South Africa in 2016 (Brophy 2016). Guano collection was historically a major cause of disturbance at many colonies and the removal of guano deprived penguins of nest-burrowing sites, causing birds to nest on open ground where they are more vulnerable to heat stress resulting in the abandonment of nests, flooding of nests by rain, and increased predation (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1976b, Shannon and Crawford 1999, Pichegru 2013, Kemper 2015). Guano harvesting is no longer practiced in South Africa, and, according to the Namibian Island’s Marine Protected Area Regulations, guano scraping is not permitted following the expiry of existing guano rights for Ichaboe Island in 2016 (MRA 27 of 2000). <br/><br/>Both chronic oil pollution and individual large oil spills appear to have long-term significant impacts on colonies. Past mortality from oil spills has been serious (Wolfaardt <em>et al.</em> 2009) and may increase if proposed development of harbours close to colonies proceeds. Most of the population is confined to areas that are near existing or planned major shipping ports (Nel and Whittington 2003, J. Kemper pers. comm.). There has been a dramatic increase in the number of birds oiled since 1990: two individual oil spills (in 1994 and 2000) killed 30,000 individuals, despite successful rehabilitation programmes (Nel and Whittington 2003, Wolfaardt <em>et al. </em>2008, 2009). Ship to ship bunkering activities off the south east coast in Algoa Bay in 2016 and 2019, resulted in 200 African penguins and 125 seabirds oiled respectively (SANCCOB unpubl. data).&#160; Breeding success on Robben Island fell to 0.23 chicks per pair in 2000, compared with an average of 0.62 ±0.19 over the other 15 years from 1989 to 2004 (Crawford<em> et al.</em> 2006). Rehabilitation does not necessarily prevent problems in the years after a spill. During 2001-2005, pairs involving at least one bird rehabilitated from the oil spill in 2000 achieved lower fledging success (43%) compared to unaffected pairs (61%) and those involving at least one bird affected by a previous oil spill (71%), mostly owing to higher mortality in older chicks (Barham <em>et al.</em> 2007). This may indicate physiological or behavioural problems that reduce the parents ability to meet the food requirements of older chicks, perhaps owing to the toxicity of the heavy oil in the 2000 spill; the effects of prolonged captivity; or the time between oiling and washing (Barham <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p><p>The Cape Fur Seal <em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em> competes with penguins for food, displaces them from breeding sites and imposes significant mortality at some colonies (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 1989, Makhado <em>et al.</em> 2013, Weller <em>et al.</em> 2016, MFMR unpubl. data). Modelling of the interaction of multiple pressures on the colonies at Robben and Dyer Islands indicate that predation by Cape Fur Seals is a key driver in current population declines at Dyer Island (Weller <em>et al.</em> 2016). However, this was found to be in addition to immature emigration, suggesting there may be additional bottom-up pressures impacting the viability of colonies.</p><p>The potential effects of individual storms on breeding colonies at certain sites has been highlighted (de Villiers 2002) and, as such, the increased frequency and severity of storms may cause localised losses. Sharks take some birds at sea and Kelp Gulls <em>Larus dominicanus</em>, dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em> and feral cats <em>Felis catus </em>prey on eggs and chicks at colonies (Underhill<em> et al. </em>2006, Pichegru 2013, Weller<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016). In some mainland colonies, predation by mongooses <em>Herpestes </em>spp., leopards <em>Panthera pardus&#160;</em>and caracals <em>Caracal caracal</em>, or illegal egg collection may have notable impacts (e.g. Underhill <em>et al.</em> 2006), with the Simonstown colony experiencing considerable mortality due to caracal (SANParks and City of Cape Town, unpubl. data, Vanstreels <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;&#160;</p><p>While a number of diseases have been documented in African penguins, few records of mass mortality through disease have been observed in the wild, up until 2018 and 2019, when a high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain killed approximately 100 penguins in South Africa and up to 600 in Namibia respectively (Khomenko <em>et al.</em> 2018, Molini <em>et al.</em> 2020)&#160; &#160;</p><br/><p>  </p>","<p>In 2015, the overall number of pairs was about 20,850 pairs, or 41,700 mature individuals (Sherley <em>et al. </em>2019a).

It has been recorded as far north as Gabon and Mozambique (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>  </p><p>In Namibia, Neglectus Islet and Penguin Island were recolonised in 2001 and 2006 respectively (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007a). In the 1980s, the species colonised Stony Point and Boulders Beach on the South African mainland and recolonised Robben Island, all in the southwest of the country (Underhill <em>et al</em>. 2006). A colony formed on the southern mainland at De Hoop in 2003, but disappeared after 2007. The northernmost colony at Lambert’s Bay became extinct in 2006 (Underhill <em>et al</em>. 2006, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2011). </p><p>In 2015, the population for Namibia was estimated at 5,700 to 5,800 pairs (MFMR <em>unpubl. data</em>), the uncertainty in the estimate arising from a few islands that had not been counted for several years (J.

Just seven colonies now support 97% of the South African population. Recent declines at South African colonies are coincident with changes in the abundance and availability of forage fish and an eastward movement of spawning forage fish (Crawford<em> et al.</em> 2011, Waller 2011, Sherley <em>et al. </em>2014a).&#160;</p><p>  </p>","Previously egg-collecting and guano harvesting were carried out at a significant scale, but both have now ceased and are prohibited or illegal.

CMS Appendix II. US Endangered Species Act. Continuous monitoring of population trends is carried out at all colonies annually in South Africa but less regularly in Namibia. In South Africa, most breeding localities are national parks or nature reserves. The colonies at Simonstown and Stony Point are in the process of receiving formal protection status. Collection of guano and eggs is prohibited within penguin colonies (Harrison <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Currie <em>et al.</em> 2009). <br/>The Namibian Islands’ Marine Protected Area (NIMPA), proclaimed in 2009, protects almost 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> of ocean in southern Namibia, including all penguin breeding localities and key foraging habitats (Currie <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ludynia <em>et al.</em> 2012). <br/>Oiled birds are rehabilitated with success (Barham <em>et al.</em> 2007, Wolfaardt <em>et al</em>. 2008). More than 80% of birds admitted for rehabilitation are returned successfully to the wild (Nel and Whittington 2003). <br/>Lost nesting habitat has been augmented using artificial nests at a number of colonies. Some designs have proved successful, increasing breeding success (Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2012). At other locations, the same designs have not been as successful (Pichegru 2013, Lei <em>et al.</em> 2014). The optimal design of artificial nests is currently being researched. Maintenance of natural breeding habitat takes place where possible. <br/>Research into foraging behaviour using biologging technology (GPS and satellite-transmitters) is ongoing (Ludynia 2007, Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2010, Waller 2011, Ludynia <em>et al.</em> 2012, Pichegru <em>et al.</em> 2012, Waller 2011, Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2013a, Campbell<em> et al.</em> 2019, BirdLife South Africa unpubl. data). In South Africa, a research project into the potential positive impacts of small marine no-take zones surrounding breeding colonies is underway. Results suggest a decrease in adult foraging effort and increases in chick survival and condition, but not uniformly across the colonies involved (Pichegru <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010, 2012;<strong> </strong>Sherley <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2018, 2019b). South Africa declared new Marine Protected Areas in 2019, including around some of the seabird colonies, but they are largely ineffective in protecting penguin foraging habitat. <br/>Population reinforcement through hand rearing of abandoned chicks, or chicks removed from nests in compromised areas where survival was unlikely, added over 7000 fledglings to the population between 2001 and 2019. These hand-reared fledglings survive and recruit in to breeding populations at similar rates to their wild counterparts (Sherley<em> et al.</em> 2014b). Attempts are made to decrease predation of eggs, chicks and grown birds (e.g. Makhado <em>et al</em>. 2013, Pichegru 2013). A national (South African) capture-mark-recapture programme using Passive Integrated Transponders has been implemented to monitor survival, recruitment and movements amongst colonies.</p><p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/> In South Africa, the African penguin Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP), gazetted in 2013, guided the conservation actions to be implemented with the aim to halt the decline of the species. This 5-year BMP included the above actions and identified additional ones, such as: ensuring adequate prey for penguins during the breeding and non-breeding seasons; spatial management of the pelagic fishery; investigating conservation translocations in this species; improving the disaster response to oiling, disease and fire; establish minimum standards for rehabilitation and rehabilitation facilities; improving penguin numbers through targeted interventions at existing but declining breeding localities where the reasons for the decline can be addressed.&#160;<br/>This plan did not achieve its aims, and a revised plan has been prepared for the next 5 years and is expected to be approved for implementation in 2020. Threats such as predation and disaster prevention and mitigation are addressed in this plan as well as conservation translocations, habitat improvement and ongoing essential population monitoring and disease surveillance. Critically, actions dealing with the food availability threat with protecting at sea habitat and the management of resources that are critical for the penguin’s survival at all phases in its life-cycle are included.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>  </p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It has a maximum extent of occurrence of 87 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>and the entire known population is significantly threatened by oil and gas drilling around the lake, which has led to pollution, major fish kills, increased rates of disease and parasites, and potentially to changes in the hydrological regime. Other additional threats include invasive species. This species is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered B1ab(iii).","This lacustrine species has been recorded from mud bottoms among dense reeds at 0-1.5 m depth. It is commonly seen buried in mud with only the snout, eyes and a small portion of the back protruding. It can reach a maximum size of about 12 cm SL (Jenkins <em>et al</em>. 2000).","Oil and gas drilling is a major significant threat to this species. Fish kills have occurred in Lake Kutubu and its surrounding tributaries from industrial pollution, drilling operations and accidents from 1996 to the present. Activities related to oil and gas drilling such as the laying of the pipelines have caused large amounts of pollution in the lake and surrounding wetlands, including from heavy metals and sedimentation. This pollution has caused increased disease and parasites in fish species within the lake. The most recent fish kill in December 2012 to September 2013 had devastating effects on fish stocks within the lake (Imbun <em>et al</em>. 2015). Drilling may have also caused problems for the hydrological regime in the area, as there is evidence of a significant drop in the lake water level, draining of swamps and reduction in river flow (U. Kolkolo pers. comm. 2019). Recent introduction of invasive fish species for aquaculture, such as Common Carp (<em>Cyprinus carpio</em>) and tilapia (<em>Oreochromis</em>) threatens this species alongside invasive Water Hyacinth (<em>Eichhornia crassipes</em>) through an increased risk of disease and habitat degradation (Imbun and Smith 2018). Overharvesting for subsistence fisheries may be an additional threat, but the impact of this is unknown.","This species was relatively common on the southern shore, but rare in other areas of Lake Kutubu (G.R.

Their population is currently estimated at approximately 6,600 adults in 39 subpopulations, of which only 1,400 are mature individuals. Population size is continuing to decline as a result of ongoing habitat fragmentation, conflict with human activities, and infectious disease. Given uncertainty surrounding population estimates, and the species’ tendency to population fluctuations, the largest subpopulations might well number &lt;250 mature individuals, thereby warranting listing as Endangered under criterion C2a(i).","African Wild Dogs are generalist predators, occupying a range of habitats including short-grass plains, semi-desert, bushy savannas and upland forest. While early studies in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, led to a belief that African Wild Dogs were primarily an open plains species, more recent data indicate that they reach their highest densities in thicker bush (e.g., Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania; Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe; and northern Botswana). Several relict populations occupy dense upland forest (e.g., Harenna Forest, Ethiopia; Malcolm and Sillero-Zubiri 2001). African Wild Dogs have been recorded in desert (Lhotse 1946) (although most desert populations are now extirpated), but not in lowland forest. It appears that their current distribution is limited primarily by human activities and the availability of prey, rather than by the loss of a specific habitat type.<br/><br/>African Wild Dogs mostly hunt medium-sized antelope. Whereas they weigh 20–30 kg, their prey average around 50 kg, and may be as large as 200 kg. In most areas their principal prey are Impala (<em>Aepyceros melampus</em>), Greater Kudu (<em>Tragelaphus strepsiceros</em>), Thomson's Gazelle (<em>Eudorcas thomsonii</em>) and Common Wildebeest (<em>Connochaetes taurinus</em>). They will give chase of larger species, such as Common Eland (<em>Tragelaphus oryx</em>) and African Buffalo (<em>Syncerus caffer</em>), but rarely kill such prey. Small antelope, such as Dik-dik (<em>Madoqua</em> spp.), Steenbok (<em>Raphicerus campestris</em>) and Duiker (tribe Cephalophini) are important in some areas, and warthogs (<em>Phacochoerus </em>spp.) are also taken in some populations. African Wild Dogs also take very small prey such as hares, lizards and even eggs, but these make a very small contribution to their diet.<br/><br/><strong>Generation length</strong><br/>Data on lifetime reproductive success of 19 alpha (breeding) females in western Zimbabwe indicate that 50% of reproductive output was achieved by age 5.5 years (SD 1.35, range 3–8; G.S.A. Rasmussen, unpubl. data). An alternative method, considers the average age of mothers of known litters, without the need for data on lifetime reproductive success. This method gives good agreement with the IUCN recommendations on calculating generation length, indicating a mean female breeding age of 5.7 years from the Zimbabwe dataset. Using this method, data from 18 litters born in Kenya to known-age mothers suggest a mean generation length of 5.0 years (R. Woodroffe, unpubl. data). Both studies suggest a minimum age at first breeding of approximately three years. Based on these data, for convenience we have estimated changes in African Wild Dog populations using a generation time of five years.","The principal threat to African Wild Dogs is habitat fragmentation, which increases their contact with people and domestic animals, resulting in human-wildlife conflict and transmission of infectious disease. The important role played by human-induced mortality has two long-term implications. First, it makes it likely that, outside protected areas, African Wild Dogs may be unable to coexist with increasing human populations unless land use plans and other conservation actions are implemented. Second, African Wild Dog ranging behaviour leads to a very substantial ""edge effect"", even in large reserves. Simple geometry dictates that a reserve of 5,000 km² contains no point more than 40 km from its borders – a distance well within the range of distances travelled by a pack of African Wild Dogs in their usual ranging behaviour. Thus, from an African Wild Dog's perspective, a reserve of this size (fairly large by most standards) would be all edge. As human populations rise around reserve borders, the risks to African Wild Dogs venturing outside are also likely to increase. Under these conditions, only the very largest unfenced reserves will be able to provide any level of protection for African Wild Dogs. In South Africa, “predator proof” fencing around small reserves has proved reasonably effective at keeping dogs confined to the reserve, but such fencing is not 100% effective (Davies-Mostert <em>et al</em>. 2009) and is unlikely to be long-term beneficial for wildlife communities.<br/><br/>Even in large, well-protected reserves, or in stable populations remaining largely independent of protected areas (as in northern Botswana), African Wild Dogs live at low population densities. Predation by Lions, and perhaps competition with Spotted Hyaenas, contribute to keeping African Wild Dog numbers below the level that their prey base could support. Such low population density brings its own problems. The largest areas contain only relatively small wild dog populations; for example, the Selous Game Reserve, with an area of 43,000 km² (about the size of Switzerland), is estimated to contain about 800 African Wild Dogs. Most reserves, and probably most African Wild Dog populations, are smaller. For example, the population in Niokolo-Koba National Park and buffer zones (about 25,000 km²) is likely to be not more than 50–100 dogs. Such small populations are vulnerable to extinction. ""Catastrophic"" events such as outbreaks of epidemic disease may drive them to extinction when larger populations have a greater probability of recovery – such an event seems to have led to the local extinction of the small African Wild Dog population in the Serengeti ecosystem on the Kenya-Tanzania border. Problems of small population size will be exacerbated if, as seems likely, small populations occur in small reserves or habitat patches. As discussed above, animals inhabiting such areas suffer a strong ""edge effect"". Thus, small populations might be expected to suffer disproportionately high mortality as a result of their contact with humans and human activity.","<strong>Background</strong><br/>African Wild Dogs are rarely seen, even where they are relatively common, and it appears that populations have always existed at very low densities. Table 2 in the supplementary material (see below) presents estimates of the sizes of African Wild Dog subpopulations occupying all discrete areas of resident range identified by participants in the range-wide conservation planning process (IUCN SSC 2008, 2009, in prep.). These comprise a total of 39 distinct subpopulations estimated to range in size from two to 276 mature individuals.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the number of “mature individuals” is challenging, because African Wild Dogs are obligate cooperative breeders: within a pack, the alpha male and female are the parents of the majority of surviving pups (Girman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1997). The IUCN Red List User Guidelines (IUCN 2010) define mature individuals as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction”, but do not specify the time period within which reproduction is considered possible. The User Guidelines go on to state “in many taxa there is a pool of non-reproductive (e.g., suppressed) individuals that will quickly become reproductive if a mature individual dies. These individuals can be considered to be capable of reproduction”.<br/><br/>In African Wild Dogs, a high proportion of individuals are indeed reproductively suppressed, but these animals do not always become reproductive “quickly” if an alpha individual dies. In a mature pack, most pack members are offspring of the alpha pair; for these animals, death of an alpha would usually not open up a breeding opportunity because no unrelated mates would be available within the pack. In our experience, death of an alpha often leads to disintegration of the pack, with no breeding until new packs are formed. Given these complexities, and in keeping with the spirit of capturing a “snapshot” of current conditions, we have chosen to define mature individuals as those considered capable of reproduction within the current breeding season. The number of mature individuals thus comprises the number of alpha males and females, and the number of sub-dominant (i.e. non-alpha) animals which breed successfully.<br/><br/>Table 1 in the supplementary material (see below) provides demographic data to allow the estimation of numbers of mature individuals (Nm) from the census population of adults and yearlings (Nc). Using these data, the number of alpha males (NaM) and females (NaF) would be estimated thus:<br/><br/>NaM = Nc x 0.55 x 0.176<br/>NaF &#160;= Nc x 0.45 x 0.215<br/><br/>Reassuringly, these equations return approximately equal estimates of the numbers of alpha males and alpha females.<br/><br/>No published estimate is available of the proportion of adults and yearlings which breed successfully as sub-dominants. However, Girman et al. (1997) report the proportions of surviving pups with sub-dominant mothers and/or fathers. Using a simple assumption that litter size was unrelated to social status, we therefore estimate the number of sub-dominant breeders (Nsub) as:<br/><br/>Nsub = (NaM x 0.10) + (NaF x 0.08)<br/><br/>The number of mature individuals is then calculated as&#160;<br/><br/>Nm = NaM + NaF + Nsub<br/><br/>We made exploratory calculations to investigate the effect of including the probability of currently-suppressed individuals surviving and breeding in subsequent years. These calculations became highly complex, and risked double-counting animals which might breed as sub-dominants in the current year and then attain alpha (dominant) status in later years. It is also important to note that, in the previous listing, the number of mature individuals was estimated simply as the number of alpha animals (i.e., NaM + NaF). These alternative ways of calculating numbers of mature individuals contribute to considerable uncertainty about African Wild Dog numbers.<br/><br/><strong>Current population size</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong></strong>Table 2 in the supplementary material (see below) presents estimates of the sizes of African Wild Dog subpopulations occupying all discrete areas of resident range identified by participants in the range-wide conservation planning process (IUCN SSC 2008, 2009, in prep.). These comprise a total of 39 distinct sub-populations estimated to range in size from two to 276 mature individuals. Few wild dog subpopulations have been systematically monitored, and these estimates are subject to considerable imprecision. This imprecision, combined with uncertainty about the calculation of mature individuals, and the species’ propensity for substantial population fluctuations, means that these population estimates should be viewed with great caution. Lack of precision has important consequences for Red List assessment; the two largest sub-populations (estimated at 268 and 276 mature individuals) are only slightly larger than one of the threshold sub-population sizes used by the Red List criteria (250 mature individuals: EN C2(i)). Had only alpha animals been considered mature individuals (as in the previous assessment), the sizes of these two largest sub-populations fall to 246 and 253 respectively. This uncertainty needs to be taken into account in comparing estimates of African Wild Dogs’ population sizes with IUCN Red List criteria.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Change in population size</strong><br/>Data on African Wild Dogs’ past global population size are taken from Ginsberg and Woodroffe (1997). It is important to note, once again, that few of these population estimates are based on systematic monitoring, and all should be viewed with caution. Assessing changes in population size is complicated by the fact that a less complete dataset was available in 1997 than in 2012. As a result of these improved data, the global estimate of African Wild Dog population size is in fact higher for 2012 than for 1997. However, this difference reflects the greater area surveyed in 2012.<br/><br/>To try to overcome this problem, Table 3 in the supplementary material (see below) compares estimates of subpopulation size in 1997 (taken from Ginsberg and Woodroffe 1997) with estimates of African Wild Dog subpopulations from the same areas in 2012. Subpopulations known in 2012 but not known in 1997 are excluded. However, sub-populations known to be absent in 1997 (e.g. the managed metapopulation in South Africa, and the sub-population in Laikipia District, Kenya) are included in Table 3 . Hence, Table 3 represents our best assessment of a like-with-like comparison of African Wild Dog numbers in 1997 and 2012<br/><br/><strong>Causes of decline</strong><br/>The causes of African Wild Dogs’ decline are reasonably well understood and include extreme sensitivity to habitat fragmentation as a consequence of wide-ranging behaviour, conflict with livestock and game farmers, accidental killing by people in snares and road accidents, and infectious disease. All of these causes are associated with human encroachment on African Wild Dog habitat and, as such, have not ceased and are unlikely to be reversible across the majority of the species’ historical range.<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Fluctuations in population size</strong><br/>Populations of African Wild Dogs are prone to marked fluctuations at a variety of temporal and geographical scales which are likely to both increase extinction risks and undermine the precision of population estimates. At the local scale, a combination of high mortality, high fecundity, and dispersal by both sexes means that pack size fluctuates substantially over short periods (Figure 1 in the supplementary material), although fluctuation in numbers of mature individuals would be less dramatic. Because African Wild Dogs are seasonal breeders across most of their remaining geographic range, fluctuations may be synchronised across packs (see Figure 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>The same demographic characteristics – high mortality, high fecundity, and long-distance dispersal – likewise lead to fluctuations at the population scale. This pattern is further exaggerated by the species’ susceptibility to infectious disease which can cause rapid die-offs. Local extinctions are not uncommon, and are often both rapid and unanticipated. Figure 2 in the supplementary material presents data from three relatively well-documented cases of local extinction involving small wild dog subpopulations affected by rabies.<br/><br/>Similar die-offs have been documented in larger African Wild Dog populations. For example, five of 12 study packs in Botswana (Alexander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and three of eight study packs in Kenya (Woodroffe 2011) have been reported as having died within short time periods during disease outbreaks. Although these relatively large study populations recovered, the majority of African Wild Dog sub-populations are estimated to comprise ≤20 mature individuals and could be severely compromised by outbreaks of this size.<br/><br/>For comparison, under good conditions African Wild Dog populations are also able to grow relatively quickly. African Wild dogs’ capacity for very long-range dispersal means that sub-populations sometimes reappear unexpectedly and grow rapidly; examples include natural recoveries in Samburu and Laikipia Districts, Kenya (Woodroffe 2011), Savé Valley Conservancy in Zimbabwe (Pole 2000), and the Serengeti ecosystem of Tanzania (Marsden<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2011). As an example of the speed of recovery, the subpopulation in Laikipia District, Kenya, grew from 0 in 1999 to 17 adults and yearlings in two packs by 2000, and by 2006 had increased 10-fold to 170 adults and yearlings (Woodroffe 2011).<br/><br/>On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that African Wild Dogs show substantial population fluctuations, but may not experience extreme fluctuations in sub-population size as outlined in the Red List guidelines. Nevertheless, the substantial fluctuations which do occur contribute to further uncertainty about sub-population sizes.",Decreasing,"Historical data indicate that African Wild Dogs were formerly distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, from desert (Lhotse 1946) to mountain summits (Thesiger 1970), and probably were absent only from lowland rainforest and the driest desert (Schaller 1972). They have disappeared from much of their former range. The species is virtually eradicated from North and West Africa, and greatly reduced in Central Africa and North-east Africa. The largest populations remain in southern Africa (especially northern Botswana, western Zimbabwe, eastern Namibia, and western Zambia) and the southern part of East Africa (especially Tanzania and northern Mozambique).<br/><br/>The current geographic distribution of African Wild Dogs was estimated using data compiled by the IUCN SSC range-wide conservation planning process for Cheetahs and African Wild Dogs, including regional strategies (IUCN SSC 2008, in prep.) and subsequent associated national action plans (<a href=""http://www.cheetahandwilddog.org"">www.cheetahandwilddog.org</a>). Current African Wild Dog range was considered to comprise only the “resident range” identified by participants in the IUCN SSC process: this represents land where participants were confident that African Wild Dogs had been confirmed to be resident within the previous 10 years. Land where residence was not confirmed (e.g., possible range, unknown range) was excluded.","Across most of its geographical range, there is minimal utilization of this species. There is evidence of localized traditional use in Zimbabwe (Davies and Du Toit 2004), but this is unlikely to threaten the species’ persistence. There are also some reports of trade in captive and wild-caught animals from southern Africa; the possible impact of such trade is currently being assessed.",Terrestrial,"Conservation strategies have been developed for the species in all regions of Africa&#160;Sillero-Zubiri&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Woodroffe&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997, (IUCN SSC 2008, 2009, in prep.), and many range states have used these strategies as templates for their own national action plans (Department of Wildlife and National Parks 2008, Wildlife Service 2010). Although each regional strategy was developed independently through a separate participatory process, the three strategies have a similar structure, comprising objectives aimed at improving coexistence between people and African Wild Dogs, encouraging land use planning to maintain and expand wild dog populations, building capacity for wild dog conservation within range states, outreach to improve public perceptions of wild dogs at all levels of society, ensuring a policy framework compatible with wild dog conservation.

Furthermore, linear infrastructure (e.g. roads, railways, canals) - if not carefully designed and mitigated - are likely to result in high mortalities if Wild Asses are impeded in their long-distance movements and become cut-off from important resources or refuge areas. Mongolia, which currently houses over 75% of the global population, is at a crossroad and the outcome will depend on Mongolia’s ability to become “a global model for demonstrating that major economic development projects can proceed without degrading ungulate migrations” (Batsaikhan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Though global dynamics are primarily driven by the large Mongolian population, locally there are both increasing and decreasing trends with some populations in Turkmenistan, Iran, Kazakhstan and China being threatened with immediate extinction.

Wild Asses can be found in hill country and are able to cross over mountain ranges, but generally seem to avoid steeper terrain, particularly slopes &gt;20° (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have a feeding strategy similar to that observed in other equids in xeric environments. When grass is plentiful, Asiatic Wild Asses are predominately grazers. During the dry season and in drier habitats, Asiatic Wild Asses will supplement their diet with shrubs and switch to become mixed-feeders during certain seasons (Bannikov 1981, Xu <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Burnik-Sturm in prep.). Wild Asses, like all equids, need regular access to water and in captivity drink 1,020 litres daily, although they seem to be able to go without water for two to four days depending on ambient temperature and moisture content of the feed (Bannikov 1981, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Water availability is a key resource and in summer months the species primarily occurs within 10-15 km of standing water. In Mongolia where the ground water level is high, Asiatic Wild Ass have been observed digging holes as deep as 60 cm in dry riverbeds to access water (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>Wild Asses are highly mobile, in the Mongolian Gobi collared animals covered average daily straight line distances of 11.9 km (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006) or cumulative distances of 21.8 km (Kaczensky unpubl. data) within 24 hours. Wild Ass movements do not seem to follow easily predictable patterns (classical migration), but are rather nomadic. This is likely the result of the unpredictability in the availability of pasture and water in space and time (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, von Wehrden <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In the past, when Wild Asses still occurred on mountain steppe and steppe habitats, they made seasonal migrations between summer ranges on the productive steppe habitats in the north to winter ranges in the drier, but less snowy areas in the south (Bannikov 1981).<br/><br/>Asiatic Wild Asses in Mongolia have huge annual ranges, the size of which increase from east to west, likely as a result of increasing unpredictability of pasture and water availability. In the Dzungarian Gobi annual ranges averaged 5,860 km<sup>2</sup>, in the Transaltai Gobi they ranged between 14,695-16,907&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, but in the southeast Gobi ranged from 18,186-69,988&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, Batsaikhan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Age at first reproduction seems to be three years for mares and five years for stallions. Mares can produce a foal annually under favourable conditions up to at least 15 years of age. Sex-ratio at birth is close to 50/50 (Bannikov 1981, Saltz and Rubenstein 1995, Volf 2010). Area specific data of Asiatic Wild Ass population dynamics parameters are largely lacking or anecdotal. For the re-introduced and intensively studied population on Barsa Kelmes Island average fertility of adult mares was estimated at 66.6%, but varied depending on pasture condition and winter severity (Bannikov 1981). Foal survival in the wild likely is in the magnitude of 50% and yearling survival is lower than adult survival (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Nowzari <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Kaczensky pers. obs.). Age determination of 350 skulls of Asiatic Wild Ass carcasses from the Mongolian Gobi documented a mean age of 9.1 years (for animals ≥3 years) and a maximum age of 29 years (Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). Average annual foal rates seem to be somewhere in the range of 1,020% (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). The species is polygynous and thus only a portion of the adult males contributes to reproduction, though what percentage is unknown, particularly as there is still limited understanding of the social organization of the species (Solomatin 1973, Bannikov 1981, Rubenstein 1986, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994, Klingel 1998 Shah 1993, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002 Neumann-Denzau and Denzau 2007, Rubenstein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Shah and Qureshi, 2007, Sundaresan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Data on population composition and age specific mortality rates are unavailable and most surveys did not state if and how foals were included in the estimates. Without more robust population dynamics data we assumed that the number of mature individuals roughly equals 50% of the total population making for a global population of mature animals of 27,900 animals.<br/><br/>We also compared our estimate with the known population composition of one re-introduced Przewalski’s horse (<em>Equus ferus przewalski</em>) population that shares part of the range of Asiatic Wild Asses in the Mongolian Gobi and nine Cape mountain zebra populations in South Africa. In the Przewalski’s horse population the proportion of mature individuals (≥3 years for mares and ≥5 years for stallions) averaged 61% (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpubl. data 2009, 2014) and for the Cape Mountain zebra populations ranged between 55-65% (S. King pers. comm. 2014, based on H. Hrabar unpubl. data).","Threats to Asiatic Wild Asses stem from illegal hunting for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties (Bannikov 1981, Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007), competition with humans and livestock over water and pasture use (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006), and crop depredation (primarily in India, Iran and Turkmenistan; S. Esmaeili pers. comm. 2013, N. Shah pers. comm. 2014, N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014, Feh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Other threats are habitat loss as a result of human settlement and cultivation, overgrazing and degradation, and limited access to open water sources (the mere presence of people and their livestock at water points can limit or block access for wild ass; Denzau and Denzau 1999, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Of increasing concern is the continued habitat fragmentation by linear infrastructure development projects (mostly roads and railways) associated with the booming extractive industry in Mongolia and China. Asiatic Wild Asses are unable to cross fences (e.g. along the border between Mongolia and China or Iran and Turkmenistan, or fenced transportation corridors like the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway), have long flight distances from vehicles in areas with a high poaching pressure, and suffer from vehicle collisions (e.g., from 2009-2013, 26 Wild Asses were killed by traffic in Israel; Waner 2014). If not mitigated, fenced and/or high volume traffic corridors can be expected to create serious movement barriers (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have become largely confined to semi-desert and desert areas with a high variability in water and pasture availability. To cope with this unpredictable environment and track the scarce resources available, Wild Asses need to have access to large tracts of land. This is particularly true in times of weather extremes, when&#160;Wild Asses&#160;need to outrun summer droughts or extreme winters (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b). Although protected areas may provide important refuges, long-term conservation of&#160;Wild Asses&#160;will have to happen on the landscape scale. New planning tools are needed, like the “planning for a moving target” approach suggested for Saiga (<em>Saiga tatarica</em>) in Kazakhstan (Singh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Bull <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Small, isolated populations are demographically and genetically vulnerable and prone to extinction, particularly in habitats with frequent environmental extremes (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Small and localised populations also have limited resilience to disease outbreaks&#160;or climate change. For example, a disease outbreak of African horse sickness in the 1960s resulted in a major decline and the extinction of small Khur populations (Gee 1963).<br/><br/><strong>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below:</strong><br/><br/>The main threats to Khulan in <strong>Mongolia </strong>remain competition for water and pasture with livestock. The temporally high illegal offtake in Mongolia seems to have largely ceased, but could be resumed if the economic situation becomes unstable. Newly emerging threats are rapid infrastructure development particularly in connection with resource extraction industries (mining) that could result in barriers to migrations/nomadic movements (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014) and habitat loss and degradation. The impacts of mining operation tapping into “ancient” aquifers on the active ground water table are not fully understood. The situation is complicated by a lack of capacity and funding to implement landscape scale planning and conservation. Furthermore, an estimated 60,0000 illegal “ninja” miners are degrading the habitat, polluting water sources and causing huge disturbance, though initiatives are under way transforming ninja mining into a formal sub-sector and developing mercury free processing techniques.<br/><br/>Threats in northern <strong>China </strong>stem from intensified resource extraction which already resulted in the de-gazetting of parts of Kalamaili Nature Reserve, fencing and competition with local herders and their livestock (Xia <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The situation in Gansu province is data deficient and potentially Wild Asses no longer occur in that region. The situation in Inner Mongolia is also unclear, the fence along the international border with Mongolia currently inhibits population exchange between the two countries.<br/><br/>Threats to Khur in the Little Rann of Kutch in <strong>India </strong>stem from increasing human activities. Land use patterns have changed since the Mega Narmada Dam Project which resulted in the Sardar Sarovar canals all around the protected area (Goyal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). Uninformed release of Sardar Sarovar canal excess waters into the Rann is having an impact on the micro-habitat, the short grasslands and is restricting the movement of Khur and other species across the saline desert. Increased agricultural practices have converted fallow lands into irrigation fields, resulting in shrinking habitat for the existing Khur population. Religious activities, cattle breeding and influx of people have accelerated on the Islands or Bets of the Rann.<em> Prosopis juliflora</em> invasion is an additional threat to the habitat. An estimated 30-35% of the Khur population lives outside the protected area and human-Khur conflicts are increasing, particularly crop raiding. In recent years Khur have also been increasingly hit on the major express highway. The International Boundary with Pakistan has been fenced thus restricting any possibility of Khur movement beyond borders. Although the population has somewhat increased over the past years, foaling rates in Khur have been on the decline in recent years (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014). <br/><br/>In <strong>Kazakhstan </strong>Kulan in Altyn Emel National Park are thriving, but are believed to have reached carrying capacity. Transfers to Andassay Sanctuary have been resumed, but the status and whereabouts of the reintroduced animals is largely unknown due to a lack of post-release management. Poaching still seems to be a threat outside of Altyn Emel National Park.<br/><br/>In <strong>Iran </strong>upgrading the core zone of Bahram-e-Goor protected area to Qatrouiyeh National Park and providing water supplies and occasional hay resulted in an increase of the Onager population. In contrast, the large adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area seems to act as a sink for the population due to occupation of water sources and productive ranges by livestock coupled with insufficient capacity for ranger presence and patrolling. As a result, the Onager population is concentrated in Qatrouyeh national park, which is starting to show signs of high herbivory pressure from Onagers. In Touran protected area the distribution range and abundance of Onagers have been decreasing. Occupation of suitable Onager habitats by livestock, poaching (usually by chasing the animal by motorbike) and insufficient protection are the most important threats to the species in this reserve.<br/><br/>The situation of Kulan in <strong>Turkmenistan </strong>and <strong>Uzbekistan </strong>is largely data deficient. The accuracy of population estimates and the distribution range are unclear. The border fence with Iran and Afghanistan does not allow for cross-border movements to the south any more. The autochthonous population in the Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area is declining. Large parts of the Wild Ass population in Badkhyz leave the Strictly Protected Area in summer to access water sources like the Kuska or Islim rivers close to the Afghan border. Outside the protected area, competition with livestock and crop raiding leads to conflicts with the local population. Poaching remains a problem and harassment by shepherds and their dogs and overgrazing by livestock limits Kulan access to pastures and water outside the reserve (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The reintroduced wild ass population in <strong>Israel </strong>lives in an extremely arid environment prone to droughts and in summer there are only three permanent water sources (all artificial) within the current distribution area. Presently the major known mortality cause is Wild Ass vehicle collisions. Although population size has doubled since 1999, an increase in the probability of extreme events under the predicted climate change scenario may still make this population vulnerable to extinction as modelled by Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2006). Another simulation model, based on changes in allele frequencies, suggests that a strong polygynous mating system is leading to increased genetic drift (Renan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).","Population estimates of Asiatic Wild Asses are based on a wide variety of different field methods and estimation techniques ranging from attempted total counts based on ground transects or counts at strategically important habitat features (e.g. water points, winter range), population estimates based on strip transects or line transects either from the ground or air, and sign surveys. Details on survey design or details on the statistical procedures that lead to the final population estimates were rarely available. Funds and capacity for monitoring are often very limited and several population estimates are rather old. Consequently, estimates provided should be treated as best available information on the magnitude of the Wild Ass populations and their trends in the respective countries.<br/><br/>Free ranging Asiatic Wild Ass populations currently occur in eight countries in 17 more or less isolated populations with an estimated global population of 55,000 animals.<br/><br/>The largest remaining Wild Ass population, found in southern Mongolia and parts of adjacent China, had been estimated at 18,411 (± 898) for Mongolia in 2003 based on ground transects (Lhagvasuren 2007). However, new counts suggest that this survey greatly underestimated the population due to methodological constrains of covering such a huge area on the ground. A large-scale aerial survey estimated 32,843 (± 10,571) Wild Asses over 150,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the southeast Gobi in 2013 (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015) plus likely an additional 1,723 Wild Asses in the no-flight buffer zone along the Mongolian-Chinese border based on a parallel ground survey (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Three large-scale spring time ground surveys resulted in comparable population estimates of 35,899 (18 %CV) in 2013, 39,998 (27%CV) in 2014, and 36,298 (27%CV) in 2015 (Buuveibaatar <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> in prep.) A simultaneous point count in 2010 estimated another 5,671 (3611–8907) Wild Asses over 11,027 km<sup>2</sup> in the Dzungarian Gobi (Ransom <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). These data suggest a population of over 40,000 individuals in Mongolia, with likely an additional 1,500 in the Transaltai Gobi as there have been no reported changes there since the 1997 aerial survey (Reading <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2001), plus further animals in the eastern Gobi, giving an estimate of over 42,000 animals. Based on these updated population estimates, Mongolia houses 75% of the global population of Asiatic Wild Ass. Genetic analysis of samples collected from 2002–2005 suggested gene flow over the entire range in Mongolia (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011), but this may have been compromised by recent infrastructure development.<br/><br/>An additional ~5,000 Wild Asses are believed to occur in adjacent China, primarily in Xinjiang province (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). With the upgrading of the fence along the international border in the 1980s and 1990s, population exchange between Mongolia and China has likely ceased or at least become minimal (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011a, Kaczensky unpubl. data). Consequently, the Chinese populations should be regarded as separate from Mongolia.<br/><br/>The third largest population is found in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007). In 2009 the official estimate for this population was ~4,000 animals (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The fourth largest population is found in Altyn Emel National Park in southeast Kazakhstan. This population was re-established via reintroductions and is currently estimated at ~2,500-3,000 animals (Plakhov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, S.V. Sokolov pers. comm. 2011, R. Habibrakhmanov pers. comm. 2014). Two additional, isolated reintroduced populations are found in Kazakhstan: 1) on Barsa-Kelmes Island with an estimated ~347 animals (Meldebekov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 2) in Andassay Sanctuary with an estimated ~35 animals (Levanov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The total population in Kazakhstan is approximately 3,100 animals.<br/><br/>The fifth largest population is found in Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in south-central Iran, estimated at 632 (429-939) individuals of which 15% were foals in summer 2014 (M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014). While the Bahram-e-Gour population has shown a positive trend in recent years, the second population in the Touran protected area complex in northern Iran seems to have severely decreased to a mere ~145 animals (summer census 2014 - M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014, Hamidi <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Any potential exchange with the population in adjacent Turkmenistan is inhibited by the fence along the international border. A recent reintroduction resulted in 12 free-ranging animals in Kalmand protected area. The total population in Iran is around 790 animals.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan Wild Asses only survived in Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area, bordering Iran and Afghanistan. The 2013 estimate for Badkhyz was ~420 individuals (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014), a 50% reduction in the population since the 2008 assessment. Rapid assessments from 2012, 2014 and 2015 suggest that the population may be even lower than 420 individuals (Kuznetsov pers. comm. 2015, Kaczensky and Linnell 2015). From Badkhyz Wild Asses were reintroduced to multiple other localities within Turkmenistan (Pavlov 1996, Lukarevskiy and Gorelov. 2007). The reintroduction to the Sarykamysh reserve was the most successful and the population is estimated at ~300-350 animals, also spreading into adjacent Uzbekistan where another ~50 animals are believed to live (Kuznetsov 2014, N. Marmazinskaja unpubl. data 2012/2013). The other reintroduction sites are all in the south, with an estimated ~100 animals in Meana Chaacha Reserve, ~13 in Western Kopetdag, and ~10-15 in Kuruhaudan (V. Kuznetsov unpubl. data 2012 and 2013). The total population in Turkmenistan and adjacent Uzbekistan is about 920 animals.<br/><br/>The reintroduced population in the Negev in Israel is currently estimated at 250 animals (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Two projects reintroduced Wild Ass populations into large enclosures – so called semi-reserves. The Dzheiran Ecocentre in Uzbekistan is 51 km<sup>2</sup> and houses a population of 98 animals (N. Soldatova unpubl. data 2013) and the Birjutschii peninsula in Ukraine is 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and houses 91 animals (Pavlov 1996, O. Yaremchenko pers. comm. 2014). However, these populations were not included in the IUCN Red List assessment. The planned reintroduction in Taif, Saudi Arabia never happened and no animals remain at the enclosure (Denzau and Denzau 1999, Int. Studbook Of Asiatic Wild Asses - Onager Studbook).<br/><br/>The population trend since the last Red List assessment in 2008 seems more or less stable in Mongolia, is data deficient in China, seems stable or slightly increasing in India, shows a mixed trend in Iran (with Touran dramatically decreasing, but Bahram-e-Goor increasing), is increasing or stable in Kazakhstan,&#160;data deficient&#160;in Turkmenistan (decrease in Badkhyz, but increase in Sarykamysh Reserve), increasing in Uzbekistan from Sarykamysh Reserve, and increasing in Israel.<br/><br/>See Table 1 and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material.",Stable,"In historic times the Asiatic Wild Ass ranged throughout the steppes and desert steppes of the Russian Federation, Mongolia, northern China, northwest India, Central Asia, the Middle East, including Iran, the Arabian Peninsula and Asia Minor (Bannikov 1981, Heptner <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>1988, Denzau and Denzau 1999). Today the species' main stronghold is southern Mongolia and adjacent China. All other remaining populations are small and largely isolated from each other. One subspecies, the Syrian Wild Ass (<em>E. h. hemippus</em>), became extinct in 1927.<br/> <br/> <em>Equus hemionus</em> may have lost as much as 70% of its range since the 19th century and is now regionally extinct in most of its former range countries primarily due to competition with livestock for pastures and water and severe over-hunting (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002). The largest remaining population is found in southern Mongolia (Reading <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Ransom <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,Norton-Griffiths&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and parts of adjacent China (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). The species also survives as isolated populations in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007), the Badkhyz Reserve in Turkmenistan (Lukarevski and Gorelov 2007) and in the Touran protected area complex and Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in Iran (Tatin <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2003, Hemami and Momeni 2013). <br/> <br/> The species has been re-established via reintroductions in Kazakhstan and Israel. Additional reintroductions have somewhat re-expanded its range in Turkmenistan (also spreading into Uzbekistan) and established two populations in large enclosures in Uzbekistan and Ukraine. The re-established population in Israel is not of the subspecies that originally occurred there, but rather of mixed <em>E. h. kulan</em> and <em>E. h. onager</em> origin (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2014).<p></p>","Illegal trade seems to happen primarily on a national level and stem from poaching for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties.<br/><br/>Illegal off-take in Mongolia peaked in the early 2000s and also included large scale market hunting (Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em>et al.</em> 2007), but currently seems to be much reduced. However, illegal off-take has been identified as a key threat in parts of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iran and China and may well drive some of the small populations into extinction if not stopped.",Terrestrial,"The Asiatic Wild Ass is legally protected in all range countries. CITES has listed the subspecies <em>E.h. hemionus</em> (Mongolian Khulan) and <em>E.h. khur</em> (Indian Khur) on Appendix I and all other subspecies on Appendix II since 1975. The full species is listed on Annex A of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2013. The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) listed the species on Appendix II in 2002 (UNEP/CMS 2002b). The&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;is one of the key species in the Central Asian Mammals Initiative (CAMI) of CMS (Karlstetter and Mallon 2014).<br/><br/>In all range countries protected areas have been established with the goal to protect&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses. However, almost all protected areas seem too small to sustain a population year-round or accommodate population recovery. At the fringes of protected areas conflicts with the local population tend to be increasing and/or Asiatic Wild Asses are subject to high levels of illegal killing. Consequently, landscape scale planning and integrative approaches that also take local people’s needs into account are needed for future conservation planning. Unfortunately China just de-gazetted substantial parts of the Kalamaili Nature reserve, a major stronghold of wild asses in Xinjiang, to allow coal mining (Xia <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>On the other hand, Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area in Turkmenistan (M. Day pers. comm. 2014) and the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia (T. Jaeger pers. comm. 2014) have been listed as possible candidate sites for nomination as UNESCO world heritage sites. For Badkhyz an expansion of the State Nature Reserve, additional adjacent nature reserves and an ecological corridor safeguarding the seasonal migrations of&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are being currently implemented. A ‘transboundary ecological corridor’ connecting Kalamaili Nature Reserve in Xinjiang province in China, and Great Gobi A and B Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia via the limited entry border area of northern Xinjiang and southern Mongolia has been suggested to re-establish transboundary&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;movements (Kaczensky <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011a, Xu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), but will likely fail without political lobbying.<br/><br/>Although rapid infrastructure development is likely creating one of the biggest challenges for the conservation of migratory and nomadic ungulates, No Net Loss (NNL) or Net Positive Impact (NPI) policies adopted by industry, and newly emerging standards on Biodiversity Offsets (BBOP 2012) are powerful tools that may enable economic development to combine with biodiversity conservation, and offsets may actually provide a more flexible tool to conserve nomadic species (Bull <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). In Mongolia, the largest mine Oyu Tolgoi is operating on a NPI policy and&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are a key species of concern.<br/><br/>Reintroductions have re-established the&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Israel and somewhat expanded its range in Turkmenistan. The reintroduced populations contribute ~8% to the global population, but only managed to reoccupy a tiny fraction of the species former range. New reintroductions are currently discussed in Kazakhstan and Iran. However, care has to be taken that reintroduction projects do not distract attention and funds from conserving the remaining autochthonous populations.<br/><br/>Whereas increasing monitoring and research efforts are made in Mongolia, Israel, Xinjiang province in China, India and Bahram-e-Goor in Iran, little systematic information is available from Inner Mongolia and Gansu province in China, Touran protected area complex in Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Furthermore, major research gaps exist regarding: i) the human dimension of&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;management and conservation, ii) site specific population dynamics parameters, iii) triggers, drivers, and scale of nomadic or seasonal movements, iv) impact and mitigation of barriers.<br/><br/>A Programme of Work for the CMS Central Asian Mammal Initiative (CAMI) was agreed during the Stakeholder Meeting on the Conservation of Large Mammals in Central Asia, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (2325 September 2014) and included a recommendation to develop a single-species action plan for the Asiatic Wild Ass as a high priority.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Like all other red colobus species (Struhsaker 2005), Oustalet’s Red Colobus is slow moving and is easily hunted. Hunting threatens populations in a number of areas, including portions of the range with low human population densities. At the northern and eastern edges of its range, the primary threat to this species is habitat loss and degradation. Large areas of the range comprise areas of rapidly advancing deforestation and agricultural expansion (Harris <em>et al.</em> 2017) and the species now appears to be absent in a number of locations where it was recorded historically. Further loss, degradation and fragmentation of the species’ range are expected into the foreseeable future. Projected to 2035, it is suspected that the population decline will exceed 30% over 30 years (equivalent to three generations), thus qualifying <em>P. oustaleti </em>as Vulnerable under criterion A4cd.","<p>Oustalet’s Red Colobus&#160;shows at least three distinct ecological modes, each covering significant portions of the range<em>. </em>It<em>&#160;</em>is found in contiguous, mature primary lowland tropical moist forest; seasonally- or permanently-inundated swamp forest, and in gallery forest and isolated forest islands in savanna woodland.</p><p>Large contiguous lowland forest blocks that contain important populations of this red colobus are found in Ituri, Rubi Tele and Aketi in DRC and in northern Congo. In these areas, this red colobus is recorded mostly in primary evergreen forest, though it also uses older secondary forest, and appears to prefer riversides and swamp forests. The species uses a range of mature forest types. In the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, they are found in monodominant stands of <em>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</em>, where they feed on flower buds and immature seeds during periods of mast flowering and fruiting (J. Hart, unpublished observations 2007). They do not occur in younger secondary forest. In lowland evergreen forests, <em>P. oustaleti</em> can form large groups where they are not hunted. Counts of up to 70 animals were made in some groups in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the past (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2008); up to 50 in 2011, but the more recent dataset (which only covers about a quarter of the reserve at the time of writing) suggests that group sizes are now smaller (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2018).</p><p>In the Ngotto Forest in CAR, this species only occurs in flooded riverine forests (Gautier-Hion &amp; Brugière 2005). Galat-Luong &amp; Galat (1979) reported that they spent 30% of their time below 10 m above ground and regularly enter into water to collect bulbs of aquatic plants. Large blocks of seasonally- or permanently-inundated forest are found in the west of the species range, in the confluence region of the Congo, Sangha and Ubangi rivers, including Lac Télé in Congo.</p><p>The eastern-most populations of <em>P. oustaleti </em>occupy small isolated forest islands and galleries on the Lake Albert escarpment. Semi-deciduous tree species dominate the high elevation gallery forests where <em>P. oustaleti </em>has been studied recently (Laudisoit <em>et al</em>. 2016, Scholier 2017). Home range size in some of these blocks is highly constrained, suggesting that these populations, which have no means of dispersal, are likely under periodic resource stress.</p>","<p>Habitat loss and hunting are the primary threats to this species. Habitat loss is particularly severe for the populations that occur in small forest islands and galleries at the northern and eastern limits of the range. Sources of deforestation in this environment include growing numbers of small holder farmers, expansion of nomadic pastoralism, small-scale logging and charcoal production. These latter threats are growing in a zone where ready sources of timber and fuel wood are scarce. Even low levels of firewood, house pole collection and timber harvest could have severe impact on populations in these areas, as they are constrained to very small home ranges and may be exposed to periods of stress exacerbated by the removal of key resources.</p>  <p>In parts of DRC, in portions of the range originally covered by contiguous forest, there are growing halos of deforestation around the population centres of Bunia, Isiro, Buta, Lisala and Gemena. A band of forest loss and degradation up to 100 km wide now isolates <em>P. oustaleti</em> populations in the Abubumbazi forest block. Commercial scale oil-palm plantations established in the Lisala area have led to permanent loss of habitat. Areas showing high rates of deforestation affect about 25% of <em>P. oustaleti’s</em> range (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss in the current geographic range of the taxon totaled around 15,000&#160;km²&#160;between 2001 and 2016 (Global Forest Watch/WRI 2018).</p>  <p>Hunting, usually with shotguns, is a threat to <em>P. oustaleti</em>&#160;in a number of areas, including Buta and the Rubi-Télé Hunting Domain (T. Hart, pers. comm. 2007), and across the whole of northern Congo and southwestern CAR outside the areas protected by wildlife guards. Though hunting is not yet common in the Ituri forest, it appears to be a growing threat in the Ituri landscape, in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve and the adjacent, unprotected Mai Tatu forest (R. Mwinyihali, pers. comm. 2018). Widespread hunting was recorded in the Abubumbazi Forest in the northwest extreme of the species range in DRC, where no red colobus were recorded during a brief survey (J. Hart pers. obs. 1989). The bushmeat trade is active around Buta-Aketi (Hicks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Two red colobus were amng 169 monkey carcasses recorded for sale during 2007 and 2008 surveys (Hicks, unpublished data). One red colobus was among 21 identified monkey carcasses encountered between Banalia-Buta-Titulé in 2012 (Hicks 2014).</p>","<p>Given the size of its geographic range,&#160;Oustalet’s Red Colobus&#160;is likely to be among the more numerous of the red colobus taxa (Struhsaker and Grubb 2013). No estimates of <em>P. oustaleti</em>&#160;density are available; however, it has been recorded as common by a number of large-scale surveys. <em>Piliocolobus oustaleti</em> was the third most observed species in the flooded forests of Ngotto in southwestern CAR (Brugière <em>et al</em>. 2005), and was classified as common at eight of 12 survey sites covering the central portion of its range (Buta-Aketi Region) from 24 to 26° E (Hicks 2010, 2014, unpublished data). The species was among the most commonly recorded primates in surveys of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve between 1993 and 2011 (Grossman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart <em>et al</em>. 2008, Vosper <em>et al</em>. 2011) although the most recent information shows that its abundance has fallen relative to other species (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2018). A large area in the eastern Ituri forest (Mai Tatu) also harbours this red colobus, although again it is now one of the least commonly recorded (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2008, 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Piliocolobus oustaleti</em>&#160;occurs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Republic of Congo (Congo), and has been recorded historically or marginally in South Sudan. It is also present in the extreme southwest of the Central African Republic (CAR). Its extent of occurrence (EEO) is estimated at 766,035 km². The eastern limit of its range is at about 31°E and includes the gallery forests and forest islands on the escarpments above Lake Albert. The northernmost record for the species is 4.50 N is northeastern DRC (Garamba National Park; Groves 2007). North of the Uélé River headwaters, the species has been historically recorded sporadically in gallery forests and forest islands in savanna from northern DRC to southern South Sudan. The Uélé River defines the northern limit of the range from about 210 through 270 E.&#160; Historically, the species was recorded near the forest-savanna boundary between Lisala and Gemena (M. Collet unpublished data 1983). The southern limits of its range are the Aruwimi (Ituri) River and the Congo River to its confluence with the Sangha river at 1013’ S. The western limit is the Sangha River up to the savanna-forest ecotone. <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">P. oustaleti</em> ranges from 350 m elevation at the confluence of the Sangha and Congo rivers, to 1,850 m in the gallery forests above Lake Albert.<br/><br/>The species appears to be absent from a number of locations at its northern and eastern limits, where it was known historically, including Garamba National Park (K. Smith pers. comm. 2018). Contrary to Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>. (1999), <em>P. oustaleti</em> does not occur north of the Uélé River west of 27 0 E. This includes large undisturbed blocks of closed forest in the Bili-Gangu region where recent surveys documented a rich forest primate fauna, but failed to find this species (Hart 2012; Hicks 2010, 2014). It appears that the populations that have been documented in small forest islands and galleries in the northern Uélé headwaters, never ranged west across the open savannas of the Ango-Digba region to reach these closed forests. The Uélé River, at this longitude, apparently represents a major barrier to dispersal by populations from the forest blocks to the south.</p><p>  </p><p>&#160;</p>  <p><br/></p>  <br/><p></p>",This species is hunted illegally.

Poaching of this species for the bushmeat trade is intensifying, and much of the forest in its range is now almost “empty” of large mammals. Because of its relatively large body size, the Black Mangabey is more attractive to hunters than the smaller <em>Cercopithecu</em>s monkeys with which it shares its range. The species is also threatened by habitat loss and is suspected to have declined by at least 30% over the past three generations (30 years).</p>","<p>This species is found in primary and secondary moist forests. In Salonga National Park, the Black Mangabey also uses swamp forests, but does not occupy swamp in Lomako (McGraw 1994). It uses all forest strata (especially the middle canopy layers), but seldom descends to the ground (Horn 1987, McGraw 1994). Its diet consists largely of fruits and seeds, with high rates of nectarivory in some months of the year. Foraging activity is concentrated in the early morning (Horn 1987, Gautier-Hion &amp; Maisels 1994, McGraw 1994).</p>","<p>Little is known about the status of this species. However, it is subject to intense, uncontrolled poaching for its meat in most parts of its range. It is also threatened by loss of forest habitat in the south of its range. Bushmeat data collected along the Congo River suggest that very few of these monkeys have been sold at the markets during the past decade; implying that very few are left in the forest (Laudisoit, pers. obs. late 2010s). Black Mangabeys are large-bodied, and provide more meat per unit effort than the smaller guenons (<em>Cercopithecus</em> spp.) with which they share the habitat. They are, therefore, more attractive to hunters, especially if shotguns are used (a shotgun cartridge costs about US$1 in the region). Quantitatively, a recce survey between the two sectors of the Salonga National Park in 2009 (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2009) showed that monkeys in general, and Black Mangabeys in particular, were very rare to the west of the park headquarters at Monkoto, and increasingly rare to absent at the western extreme (where the highest concentrations of people are located in the corridor). Overall encounter rate was 0.13 groups/km. A recce survey carried out at the same time and using the same survey method in the unprotected Sankuru Reserve (Liengola <em>et al</em>. 2010) recorded the species only 10 times in 400 km of survey effort – an encounter rate of only 0.025/km walked, and one-fifth of that recorded in the Salonga corridor, which was (and still is) at least partially protected by forest guards.</p>  <p>In Salonga in 2016–2017, encounter rate of groups on transects varied between 0.2 (southern sector of the park) to 0.3 (northern sector) (Wildlife Conservation Society unpublished data 2016 and 2017, Ikati <em>et al</em>. 2017), so still an order of magnitude greater than encounter rates outside the park. It is likely that most unprotected forests in the range of this species are defaunated of the larger-bodied species, including Black Mangabeys. They had completely vanished from the Swa-Kabula Reserve in the southwest of the country before 1990 (Dino 2014). The same is likely to have occurred throughout their range, especially where human populations can travel freely and rapidly through the habitat (the case in savanna-forest mosaics south of the Kasai River).</p>  <p>Rates of forest loss differ in the geographic ranges of the two subspecies.

A total of 3.7% of the forest cover that existed in 2001 was lost between 2001 and 2016 (GFW/WRI 2018). In <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">L. a. aterrimus </em>range, in the more closed-canopy continuous Congo Basin forests further north, the forest cover loss was only 2% during the same period – just over half of the rate of loss further south (of the subspecies' total range of 585,300&#160;km²).</p>","<p>Although <em>Lophocebus aterrimus</em><strong> </strong>is widespread, its total population size is unknown and surveys are needed. Several decades ago, densities of around 70 individuals/km² were recorded in Lomako and Lac Tumba in DRC (Horn 1987, McGraw 1994). The population is suspected to have undergone a reduction of at least 30% over the last 30 years (three generations) based on intensifying hunting pressure on this species for the bushmeat trade and habitat loss in the south of its range.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Lophocebus aterrimus&#160;</em>occurs&#160;south of the Congo River in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in lowland rainforest areas of the southwest Congo Basin. It is also found in gallery forests and more fragmented forests reaching down into northern Angola to about 8°45’ S (Gautier-Hion <em>et al.</em> 1999). The western, northern and eastern limits of the geographic range are the left bank of the Congo River. South of the Kasai River, the taxon is limited to the west by the Kwango River, and to the south by the forest-savanna boundary.</p>  <p>There are two subspecies (following Grubb <em>et al</em>. 2003): <em>L. </em><em>aterrimus<em> aterrimus</em></em> is found in the central Congo basin; <em>L. a. opdenboschi</em> is/was found in a very small area of northeastern Angola (Machado 1969, Gautier-Hion 2013), and in southwestern DRC. The two subspecies are separated by the Kasai River, which cuts diagonally across the range at roughly 3°&#160;to 4°&#160;S. The Black Mangabey was extirpated from the Swa-Kibula Reserve, a protected area on the Angolan border, before 1990 (Dino 2014).

The primary drivers of these threats—human population growth and the expansion of artisanal mining—are likely to increase into the foreseeable future. Most of the species’ range is in a region of endemic and ongoing human conflict, which has exacerbated known threats, and weakened organised efforts to protect these primates. It is suspected that the population decline of <em>C. hamlyni</em> will continue, resulting in an overall population reduction of more than 30% over a 30-year time frame from 2003 to 2033 (given a 10-year generation length). The taxon thus meets the Vulnerable threshold for criterion A4cd.","<p>A predominantly terrestrial species recorded from lowland to mid-montane tropical moist forest and montane bamboo forest. In the lowland forest zone (450–1,000 m), which comprises the major portion of the range, <em>C. hamlyni</em> occurs mainly in primary forest areas. The species occupies older secondary forest in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, but does not favour young secondary forests, and is not known to occur in gallery forests in savannas at the southern limit of its range (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013). The isolated forest blocks south of the species’ contiguous EOO, where <em>C. hamlyni</em> have been recorded historically, range in size from 200–450&#160;km²&#160;and are located on small chains of hills. There is no evidence that these blocks were isolated due to historic human activities, and they may represent relictual range areas, isolated by climate-induced habitat change during the Quaternary or Holocene. In any case, they suggest that isolated populations of <em>C. hamlyni</em> may be able to persist even in a fragmented landscape. Further investigation of the current status of these populations, and exploration of other isolated forest massifs in this region for presence of the species is urgently needed.</p>  <p>Mean group size in the Kahuzi-Biega lowlands and Ituri Forest is 2–3 animals (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2002-2003), In Nyungwe National Park group size averaged 3.6 animals (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011). These estimates are based on sightings of animals from line transects. However, given the difficulties of directly observing these monkeys, this may be an underestimate of group size. The species feeds primarily on the ground. Diet is poorly documented but known to include fruits and seeds. In the Ituri Forest (elevation 700–750 m) <em>C. hamlyni</em> forages opportunistically on sprouting seedlings when&#160;<em>Gilbertiondendron dewevrei</em>&#160;undergoes&#160;<a style=""mso-comment-reference:eaw_1;mso-comment-date:20180408T1956"">mast</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;fruiting. Fungi and herbaceous vegetation are eaten during periods of fruit scarcity (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Nyungwe population feeds extensively on bamboo shoots, and this is likely to be the case in other montane locations such as Kahuzi-Biega and Mt. Tshiaberimu, where the species occurs in the bamboo zones. Given the range of habitats occupied<em>, C. hamlyn</em>i appears to have a wide dietary tolerance with specialization based on local and seasonal food availability.</p><p><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Leopards and crowned eagles are known to prey on<em> C. hamlyni</em> in the Ituri Forest; nonetheless, the species was recorded at a low frequency in one study of leopard diets (Hart <em>et al</em>. 1996).</span></p>","<p>This species is threatened by habitat loss and poaching. Habitat loss and degradation, due primarily to deforestation by shifting cultivators and small holder farmers, is the most significant threat at present and is growing rapidly. Forest loss in DRC increased by a factor of 2.5 between 2011 and 2017 (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss and associated degradation have been particularly intense in the eastern and southern portions of <em>C. hamlyni’s</em> range. The impact is most severe in the submontane and montane portions of the range, where human population densities are highest.</p>  <p>Factors promoting habitat loss include rural population growth and expansion of artisanal mining. These will continue to prevail into the foreseeable future. Within the range of <em>C. hamlyni</em>, high rates of forest loss are particularly evident around growing settlements of Beni, Kalima, Kindu, Kisangani, Lubutu, Mambasa,&#160;Opienge and Punia. Deforestation and forest degradation are expanding along networks of abandoned roads emanating from these centres, leading to fragmentation of previously intact forest blocks. East of Kisangani, and in the peripheries of Kahuzi-Biega and Maiko national parks, large roadless forest blocks have been invaded by artisanal miners leading to new clearings in remote areas. A recent deforestation hotspot analysis (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017) indicates that about 40% of <em>C. hamlyni</em> range has been affected by moderate to severe forest loss and degradation. Vast areas of newly-emerging deforestation hot spots intersect with intact primary forests and extend into several protected areas (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>For the past two decades, eastern DRC has been the theatre of entrenched conflict promulgated by a multiplicity of rural militia, a number of whom are based in national parks. The militia attack and loot villages, and exploit artisanal mining or are involved in it themselves. The conflict has led to large movements of internally displaced people (IDPs) and has contributed to the opening of new settlements and expansion of existing settlements. In 2017, over 850,00 unsettled IDPs were registered in administrative territories within the geographic range of <em>C. hamlyni</em> (UNOCHA 2018).</p>  <p>Expanding settlement and artisanal mining are associated with increased hunting and poaching. <em>Cercopithecus hamlyni</em> is shy and difficult to detect. Although this species is not a frequent target of hunters, its terrestrial habits make it vulnerable to snares set for other species. A recent survey of bushmeat market vendors in Kalima, a mining centre in the southern portion of its range, revealed only one fresh <em>C. hamlyni</em> carcass among 38 primates (dried and fresh) on sale. According to vendors interviewed, as recently as five years ago, they could expect to offer 3–5 fresh <em>C. hamlyni</em> per day. Four hunters in three villages to the south and west of Kalima, bordering the region’s remaining forest areas, stated that snare captures of <em>C. hamlyni </em>have been declining for the past 15 years, and are now uncommon. (J. Hart unpublished data 2018).</p>","<p><em>Cercopithecus hamlyni</em> is widespread and variably abundant. Important populations have been documented in the lowland sector of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, with densities of 5-7 individuals per km² (Hall <em>et al. </em>2002-2003) and the species persists throughout this park (Kujirakwinja <em>et al. </em>2015; Spira <em>et al. </em>2015a, 2015b, 2017). Populations surveyed at montane sites at the species’ altitudinal limit appear to be small. In Nyungwe Nation al Park, encounter rates&#160;averaged 0.08 groups/km (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011). <em>Cercopithecus hamlyni</em> is a cryptic and quiet species, which is difficult to census and characteristically moves away from observers before detection, therefore population estimates based on visual contact probably underestimate population sizes. Surveys at dawn in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve of “booming” male vocalisations suggest that <em>C. hamlyni</em> is locally common, and that this is a stronghold for the species (J. Hart, unpublished data 2012). Methods&#160;appropriate for estimating&#160;<em>C. hamlyni</em>&#160;population size, such as camera trap surveys, show&#160;promise (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011), but have not yet been conducted.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>The range of&#160;<em>Cercopithecus</em>&#160;<em>hamlyni </em>resembles that of <em>Allochrocebus lhoesti</em>, with a continuous EOO from the Congo/Lualaba River in the west, through the forested basins of the Lindi, Ituri, Maiko, Lowa, Ulindi and Elila rivers in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the bulk of the range falls, into the submontane and montane forests of the Albertine Rift, where a small portion of the range is located. The range is bounded in the north by the Lindi-Nepoko river system and in the south by the southern limit of tropical moist forest (about 4° S). The only known population outside DRC occurs in an area of about 32 km² in Rwanda's Nyungwe National Park (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011). A second Rwandan population in Gishwati is now likely extirpated due to habitat loss (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013). Historically, populations of <em>C. hamlyni</em> have been reported from several small, isolated forest blocks, south to nearly 6° S (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013); however, its current status in these areas is unknown. The eastern-most highland populations of <em>C. hamlyni </em>are now isolated in fragmented habitat islands, some of which have been recently extirpated, such as the forest islands between Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Masisi.

In Odzala-Kokoua National Park in Congo, they use seasonally-inundated and riverine habitats and occasionally the Marantaceae-dominated terra firma forests (Maisels 1995, 1996). In the area east of Makokou in Gabon, they were found in riverine forests (Quris 1975). By contrast, a study group at Mondika in CAR spent most of its time in terra firma mixed forest, and was never observed along the Mondika River, nor in swamp forest along the Ndoki River (Shah 2003), whereas a group at Bai Hokou, also in CAR, spent some time along rivers and streams (N. Shah pers. obs. 2003). <em>Cercocebus agilis</em><strong> </strong>also uses open-understorey <em>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei </em>dominated forest (Shah 2003, Devreese 2011). In the north of its range, the species will use the gallery forests in savanna-forest mosaics of northern CAR (Fay 1988), and in the east (e.g., Okapi Wildlife Reserve), it uses terra firma forests, but will sometimes forage on crops (Kambale Saambere 1999). These monkeys are usually active in lower strata (0–10 m) of the habitat (Quris 1975, Shah 2003), although they spend less time on the ground than other <em>Cercocebus</em> spp. (Shah 2003). Home-range size was estimated to be ca 3&#160;km²&#160;in Dzanga-Sangha in CAR (Shah 2003), and 2&#160;km²&#160;in Gabon (Quris 1975).</p><p>Agile Mangabeys have strong dietary preferences for fruit, seeds and monocotyledon shoots, and can bite through the hard shells of some fruits, such as <em>Strychnos </em>(Shah 2003). They also prey on animals up to the size of infant Peters’ Duikers (Knights <em>et al</em>. 2008, Shah 2013).<br/><br/>In CAR, mean group size was 21 at Mondika, but a habituated group at nearby Bai Hokou numbered 135 animals, and on occasion it reached 330 individuals (Devreese <em>et al</em>. 2013). In northeastern Gabon, group size ranged between 8 and 18 (Quris 1975). In Odzala-Kokoua National Park (Congo), group size was usually &gt;20 (Maisels 1996). In Ituri (DRC), it was 24 (Kambale Saambili 1999), in Ngotto Forest (CAR) it was 20 (D. Brugière, pers. comm. 2013). Groups of 50–200 have been observed in southeast Cameroon (Usongo and Fimbel 1995), northeast Gabon (Quris 1975) and northeast DRC (Kambale Saambili 1999).</p>","<p><em>Cercocebus agilis</em><strong> </strong>is hunted throughout its range for bushmeat and sometimes persecuted for crop raiding. Because these monkeys spend a fair proportion of time on the ground, they are vulnerable to snaring – a method of hunting used throughout its geographic range. Snares are usually set for forest antelopes and rodents, but can catch any terrestrial animal.<br/><br/>At the western, northern and eastern edges of its range, this species is threatened by habitat loss caused by deforestation for timber and firewood. An analysis of forest loss suggests that 1.3% of the forest in its range was lost between 2001 and 2016 (13,368 km²&#160;of the 1 million km² range). However, because this taxon occurs primarily along rivers, this may be an underestimate of the true loss of habitat, as forest loss in the savanna-forest mosaic will be concentrated along rivers and galleries.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Few data exist on abundance relative to human pressure, but even in 1996, in the more westerly part of its range (Lobéké NP, Cameroon), the abundance of <em>C. agilis</em> was an order of magnitude lower than the smaller-bodied, sympatric guenons at that site, and it was recorded only at distances of over 20 km from a road (an indicator of high hunting pressure), whereas smaller-bodied primate species still occurred close to the road (WCS unpublished data 1996). In the most easterly part of its range, in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, encounter rates on surveys declined by an order of magnitude (WCS unpublished data 2018) over the last decade. This is attributed to increased hunting pressure, due to easier access along a much-improved main road, to the influx of large numbers of people into the area for artisanal mining, and to ongoing civil unrest in eastern DRC.</p><p>Densities of Agile Mangabeys appear to be highly variable, presumably influenced by both habitat type and hunting pressure. Population density in Gabon has been recorded at between 6.7 and 12.5 individuals/km² (Quris 1975). At Mondika in Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park (Congo), density was 6.9 individuals/km²&#160;(Shah 2003). In Odzala-Kokoua National Park (Congo), group size was usually at least 20, and there were between 0.5 and 2 groups/km²&#160;(10–40 animals/km²), depending on the habitat type (Maisels 1996). In the Ituri Forest (DRC), densities varied between 2 individuals/km²&#160;(Thomas 1991) and 38 individuals/km²&#160;(Kambale Saambili 1998). In the Ngotto Forest (CAR), densities varied between 7.2 and 41 individuals/km²&#160;– variation here was related to hunting intensity by humans (D.

Until recently the Orinoco River Basin in Venezuela experienced strong human activity expansion, with new and growing urban centers, industrialized agriculture of corn, sorghum, sugar cane, and sunflowers, and piedmont production of coffee bananas and plantains, as well as widespread cattle ranching in the llanos (Winemiller<em> et al. </em>1996, Rodríguez-Olarte <em>et al. </em>2017). This led to extensive deforestation with loss of riparian forests, heavy sedimentation and run-off of fertilizers and pesticides. In addition, oil was exploited throughout much of the savannas of Apure, Barinas, Portuguesa, Cojedes, Guárico Anzoátegui and Monagas. An industrial center in Ciudad Bolivar produced iron, aluminum gold and diamonds, and created large deposits of byproducts of those industries such as red clay that has been known to drain into the Orinoco River channel. Today, most of those activities have ceased, except for gold and diamond mining which have increased greatly. In Colombia the opposite was true for most of the Orinoco River Basin which was under the control of anti-government military forces that preclude development. However, the government routed the rebels and the Orinoco River Basin in Colombia is now experiencing a boom in agriculture and cattle ranching, and commercial fishing, as well as urban expansion, with all concomitant negative impacts along with the economic prosperity.

Further, fluviomarine plains are associated with the regional tourism centre in beaches of Morrocoy National Park and agroindustrial developments. All rivers have cities, towns and villages on their banks. Urban and agricultural effluents are not treated before entering the rivers, and the extraction of water is high and permanent. In the plains there are several industrial centres (e.g. oil refineries). There are dams and artificial lagoons that can favour the species, but many are depauperated by urban and industrial effluents (e.g. Cumaripa and Durute reservoirs), introduced species (e.g. <em>Oreochromis </em>sp.) or desiccation by sedimentation.","<em>Hyphessobrycon fernandezi</em> is not a common species.

These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p><em>Anguilla mossambica</em>&#160;is found in fresh and saline water habitats of East Africa, Madagascar and other West Indian Ocean island chains. Documented threats to this species include barriers to migration (Mafuca and Bills 2012), parasites&#160;(Sasal <em>et al</em>. 2008, Weyl&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, McHugh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017), and the growing exploitation of this species in Madagascar and South Africa, for export to Asia and Europe (Robinet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Gollock&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a decline in range of ~50% over three generations (30 years) has been estimated in some rivers in the province (C. Hanzen unpub. data). Elsewhere in South Africa, there is anecdotal evidence of declines in the Eerste River catchment in False Bay due to poor water quality, and the Rietvlei-Diep system in Table Bay where recent records have only been of dead <em>A. marmorata</em> individuals with visible lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). In Réunion Island, this species occurs frequently in some rivers, whereas in Mayotte, <em>A. mossambica</em> are considered scarce (Valade <em>et al</em>. 2018, DEAL and OCEA 2019). Dam construction has also thought to have led to declines in Tanzania (Tamatamah 2012). In the Cahora Bassa Lake, Mozambique, eels (<em>A. marmorata, A. mossambica</em>, and <em>A. bengalensis</em>) were found to be absent where historical studies had reported them as extant prior to dam construction (Mafuca and Bills 2012).</p>  <p>If observed range declines in some areas are reflected in other regions across the distribution of this species, there would be significant cause for concern. This, coupled with growing interest and demand for this species for farming and consumption, has led to&#160;<em>A. mossambica</em> being assessed as Near Threatened (NT). The listing for this species is based on inference from limited data across a small range and it is therefore strongly advised that monitoring for this species be conducted to better determine population status. As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal in conserving the population.</p>  <p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup>&#160;of November, 2018.</p><p></p>","<p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p>In South Africa this species inhabits a broad ecological niche, being found in rivers from the headwater to lower reaches (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015; Kadye and Booth 2019). Similar to other anguillids, <em>Anguilla mossambica</em> is catadromous, whereby a proportion of the growth phase (yellow eel) reside in freshwater and the other remaining in sea, coastal, or brackish habitats (Tsukamoto 1998, Lin <em>et al</em>. 2015). Elvers in the Eastern Cape, South Africa arrive in considerably higher numbers in the summer (November/December) than during the winter (June/July) or spring months (Wasserman <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Although yellow eels are usually fairly sedentary, otolith microchemistry suggests that some individuals in South Africa are inter-habitat migrants that move between freshwater and saline habitats (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2012). In a later study using otolith Sr:Ca ratios, Lin <em>et al</em>. (2015) found 16.7% (n = 5) of individuals in the Maningory River, Madagascar, to exhibit freshwater residency, and 13.3% to be habitat-shifters (n = 4).</p><p>Females can attain lengths of up to 120 cm and are generally longer and heavier than males (Froese and Pauly 2011). This species is thought to remain in the yellow stage for 8–18 years before metamorphosing into the silver stage, prior to beginning the spawning migration (McEwan and Hecht 1984, Bruton <em>et al</em>. 1987 in Lin <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2015).</p><p>It has been suggested that spawning of this species occurs continuously between June and November in an area north-east of Madagascar and west of the Mascerene Ridge in the Indian Ocean (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008). The age of leptocephali increases as they are found further south of the proposed spawning area and it is suggested that individuals are transported by the South Equatorial Current (SEC) (Réveillac <em>et al</em>. 2009b). The present continental range suggests a migration of 1,000 to 2,000 km from the proposed spawning area (Réveillac <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Of the three species that inhabit the Malagasy area (<em>A. mossambica</em>,&#160;<em>A. marmorata</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>A. bicolor</em>),&#160;<em>A. mossambica</em>&#160;have the slowest otolith growth rate due to its southernmost distribution (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p>        </p><p>Note: <span class=""Accentuation"">Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</p><p></p>","<p><em>Anguilla mossambica</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; <span lang=""EN-US"">barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are potentially less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments.</p><p>Barriers to migration appear to be problematic in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with dams such as the Cahora Bassa and Kariba dams&#160;preventing migration (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Mafuca and Bills 2012). A study investigating fish diversity in the Cahora Bassa Lake, found eels (<em>A. marmorata, A. mossambica</em>, and <em>A. bengalensis</em>) to be absent (Mafuca and Bills 2012). Historic studies had previously reported these species in this area prior to the construction of the Cahora Bassa Dam (Mafuca and Bills 2012). However, in both the Sundays River (Wasserman <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Baakens River (Muller <em>et al</em>. 2015) in South Africa, <em>A. mossambica</em> was found upstream of the obstructions, and in both studies was the only species able to transverse the weirs. </p><p><a name=""_Hlk17467190"">In South Africa, poor water quality is anecdotally suggested to have caused eel species to become rare in some localities, such as the False Bay catchments, and few specimens remaining in this area have been observed to have severe skin lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Non-native species now found in many systems in South Africa, such as the predatory bass (<em>Micropterus</em> spp.) and catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), may also have contributed to the decline (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</a></p><p>Fisheries for eels based in Madagascar, Mozambique, and South Africa appear to be increasing, and over the last 15 years, glass eels have been increasingly exported directly from Madagascar to East Asia (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). There are also concerns over illegal fishing and trade in the region (see Use and Trade). Weyl <em>et al</em>. (2013) cautioned that the trade of live <em>A. mossambica</em> may result in parasitic introductions into other regions, as a result of its rich parasitic fauna. In the Eastern Cape of South Africa this species is particularly vulnerable to a parasitic gill worm (<em>Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae</em>) (Parker <em>et al</em>. 2011, McHugh <em>et al</em>. 2017). This parasite has been shown to cause damage to gills resulting in impaired respiration (McHugh <em>et al</em>. 2017). Under aquaculture conditions, where fish are kept in high numbers, infection has led to mortalities (McHugh <em>et al</em>. 2017). <a name=""_Hlk17468384"">Parasitic infection by the invasive swim bladder nematode <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> has also been observed in <em>A. mossambica, A. bicolor </em>and<em> A. marmorata</em> from Reunion (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). Two <em>A. marmorata </em>(n = 80), one <em>A. bicolor</em> (n = 23) and one <em>A. mossambica</em> (n = 15) were infected (Sasal <em>et al.</em> 2008). While the infection prevalence was low in these samples, this parasite is known to spread extremely quickly (Kirk 2003).</a></p><p>          </p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in anguillid species – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment – however, our knowledge of these processes, and the scale of their influence, if any, is very limited (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There is little quantitative information available to infer the population status of <em>Anguilla mossambica</em>.

In a study of 4099 glass eels sampled between April 2005 and February 2006 from rivers in Reunion, Mauritius, Mayotte, and Madagascar, 3790 <em>A. mossambica, </em>246 <em>A. marmorata</em>, and 63 <em>A. bicolor</em> were identifiable (Réveillac <em>et al</em>. 2009a), indicating the latter was a small proportion of the recruitment to these islands at the time.</p><p>Other recent monitoring data has been collected from South Africa between 2015 and 2019, predominantly in KwaZulu-Natal (C. Hanzen unpub. data.). A comparison of historical (Scott <em>et al</em>. 2006, GBIF 2018) and current data from the samples collected across this province was carried out. Using this method, the decline in extent of occurrence (EOO) was 51% over three generation lengths, and 59% over the full time series (1959-2019). These records indicate a decline in distribution – and very likely abundance – of this species in some rivers of KwaZulu-Natal. This pattern, if reflected in other areas across the range of this species, would be significant cause for concern.</p><p>In some areas in South Africa, such as the Eerste River catchment in False Bay, eels were historically considered a problem species, and recruiting elvers caused blockages in irrigation pumps (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Since the 1970s, eels are no longer common in False Bay catchments; this has been suggested to be due to poor water quality (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). <a name=""_Hlk10104968"">In Tanzania, the decline in native eels (<em>A. bengalensis</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>) is thought to have begun in the 1980s, as a result of dam construction (Tamatamah 2012). Fishing surveys carried out over the past decade only found a few individual eels in comparison to pre-impoundment fish studies (Tamatamah 2012).</a> <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em> once occurred in the Rietvlei-Diep system in Table Bay, although recent records have only been of dead <em>A. marmorata</em> individuals with visible lesions (S.

Along the east coast of Africa, <em>Anguilla mossambica</em> is found in rivers from Kenya south to Table Bay (South Africa), also found on Madagascar and other western Indian Ocean islands (Mascarene: Réunion and Mauritius Islands, Comoros:&#160;Mayotte Island and the Seychelles: Mahé and Praslin Islands). <em>Anguilla mossambica</em>,&#160;is also the most common anguillid species in the Eastern Cape, South Africa and in eastern Madagascar (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p>  </p><p>Spawning is thought to occur in an area north-east of Madagascar and west of the Mascerene Ridge in the Indian Ocean (Robinet <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan<a name=""_Hlk17467804"">, The Republic of Korea (hereafter South Korea) </a>and mainland China (hereafter China). A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global production of <em>Anguilla </em>has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). Being a plain-coloured eel, there has been an increase in interest in <em>A. mossambica </em>to stock farms in East Asia and elsewhere from 2010 onwards (after <em>A. anguilla </em>was listed in CITES Appendix II in 2009 and the EU banned all trade in <em>A. anguilla </em>from and to the EU), and in particular when the price of <em>A. japonica </em>glass eels increased dramatically due to shortages in 2011–2013.</p><p>According to East Asian Customs data, the first known records of imports of live glass eels into Asia from Africa are from 2005, and between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~14 t of live eel fry for farming (glass eels and larger juveniles) from Africa (99% from Madagascar). Live eel fry imports from Madagascar (believed to be mainly composed of <em>A. mossambica</em>) reached a peak of 5.6 t in 2013, after which they dropped to less than 600 kg in 2014 and 2015, with no imports recorded in 2016–2017. South Korea reported farming input 0.5 t of <em>A. mossambica </em>in 2012–2013 (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018); South Korea tried farming <em>A. mossambica </em>and <em>A. bicolor </em>when the price of <em>A. japonica </em>glass eels increased dramatically due to their shortage during 2011–2013, most of which was reportedly unsuccessful (Fan and Qin 2016, Back and Park 2017).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160;</p><p><em>Anguilla mossambica </em>is found in subsistence and commercial fisheries and in international trade, however as its range overlaps with many other anguillids, species specific data is very limited. No country from the species’ range has reported eel catch or farming data to FAO, however in recent years there has been a reported increase in interest in commercial harvesting of eels (all life stages) from South Africa, Mozambique and Madagascar, with a focus on <em>A. mossambica</em> for export to Europe and Asia. Illegal fishing and trade of glass eels has been reported from the region, and this has been linked to several applications for setting up eel farms in South Africa mainly using <em>A. mossambica</em> imported from Madagascar, all of which have been rejected by national authorities over concerns of disease, introduced parasites and population status (S.

These life history traits, coupled with the limited information available to infer abundance trends, pose particular challenges in applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is widely distributed from east and southeast African water systems, across the Indian Ocean to mainland India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia, and is an occasional vagrant to the Arabian Peninsula. Although there is some evidence to suggest its range may have declined as a result of barriers to migration in various localities (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Attaala and Rubaia 2005, Tamatamah 2012, Mafuca and Bills 2012, Freyhof <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mzuza <em>et al</em>. 2017). For example, two large dams in the&#160;Zambezi&#160;(Kariba and Cahora Bassa) block the migration of elvers, posing a threat to future escapement and the spawning stock (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Mafuca and Bills 2012). Throughout India too, declines have been observed in the area of occupancy possibly as a result threats such as reduced habitat availability (Shrestha 2003, Islam 2015). The species is reported as almost absent from some regions, such as the Western Ghats (J. Freyhof pers. comm. 2014). <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is exploited for consumption and is being offered for sale on business-to-business (B2B) trade platforms, however, metrics of catch or effort are not available.</p><p>While there areno quantitative time-series data relating to declines in the species, there is some evidence indicating that both range and abundance of the species are shrinking. The species has been assessed as Near Threatened (NT); it is suspected that a reduction of close to 30% is likely to have occurred over the last 3 generations (36 years), based on reports of declines across its range. It is strongly advised that monitoring for this species be conducted to better determine population status. As with all anguillids, co-ordination of the management across this species’ range will also be pivotal for conservation.</p><p>      </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> of November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em>&#160;juveniles feed on insects and other aquatic invertebrates while adults feed on fishes&#160;(including trout in the streams of the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe)&#160;and crabs (Okeyo 1998).&#160;This species inhabits various niches in river systems from quiet undisturbed areas containing mud substrate to deep water, fast-flowing rock pools of rivers (Bell-Cross and Minshull 1988).&#160;In Malaysia <em>A. bengalensis</em> has been found to reside in upper/mid-stream areas at higher elevation with cooler water temperatures (Arai and Kadir 2017<em>a</em>). Length estimates for this species range between 80–200 cm (Shrestha 2003) and Pantulu (1957) found there to be strong positive length/weight relationships. Further, a close linear relationship between fecundity and total length has been observed (Kadir <em>et al</em>. 2017). Total length and body weight at silvering has been found to range from 487 to 1295 mm, and 257 to 5100 g, and age at silvering has been found to range from 5.5 to 10.5 years (Chai and Arai 2018). In a study of 47 specimens from Malaysia, seaward spawning migration occurred in individuals displaying high gonadosomatic indices between April and September (Arai and Kadir 2017<em>b</em>). This suggests their spawning season may extend for at least six months of the year (Arai and Kadir 2017<em>b</em>). </p><p>    </p><p>Note: <span class=""Accentuation"">Within the IUCN Habitat Classification Scheme table, most listed habitats are considered important for eels. The Marine Oceanic habitats were listed as ‘Major Importance’ due to there likely being a discrete spawning area.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em>,<em> </em>like all anguillid eels, is susceptible to a number of, primarily anthropogenic, threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures, are potentially less likely to have a significant positive effect on eel abundance. All anguillids are catadromous and semelparous, migrating from continental waters to the ocean to breed, and spawning only once before death. These traits arguably increase the impact of threats, through the terminal nature of reproduction and exposing them to pressures in both freshwater and marine environments. </p><p>In India and Bangladesh in particular, harvesting of this species occurs, but it is not known what impact fishing is having on the overall population. As a mottled species, <em>A. bengalensis</em> is perhaps less desirable to the East Asian market, where plain coloured eels are generally preferred. There is, however, a growing market for mottled eels, although to date this is mainly for <em>A. marmorata</em> (Shiraishi and Crook 2015).&#160;</p><p>The Conservation Assessment and Management Plan (CAMP) report on the freshwater fishes of India (Molur and Walker 1998) declared <em>A. bengalensis</em> as ‘Endangered’ according to IUCN criteria. In Bangladesh, <em>A. bengalensis</em> was assessed as ‘Vulnerable’ resulting from population decline attributable to “habitat loss and perceived over-exploitation for export” (Islam 2015). Threats reported to be affecting this species in both localities, were damming, fishing, loss of habitat, invasive species, disease, pollution, climate change, overexploitation and domestic trade (Molur and Walker 1998, Shrestha 2003, IUCN Bangladesh 2015). In Nepal specifically, most dams do not have fish and/or eel ladders, and loss of freshwater habitat is a significant problem (Shrestha 2003). </p><p><a name=""_Hlk17376556"">Barriers to migration appear to be problematic in Mozambique and Zimbabwe with dams such as the Cabora Bassa and Kariba dams&#160;preventing migration (Matiza and Crafter 1994, Mafuca and Bills 2012). A study investigating fish diversity in the Cahora Bassa Lake, found eels (<em>A. marmorata, A. mossambica</em>, and <em>A. bengalensis</em>) to be absent (Mafuca and Bills 2012). Historic studies had previously reported these species in this area prior to the construction of the Cahora Bassa Dam (Mafuca and Bills 2012). </a>In Malawi, Nkula Dam is located on the Shire River (Mzuza <em>et al</em>. 2017), which may limit available habitat and movement. In Tanzania, the construction of large dams is also thought to have contributed to eel declines (Tamatamah 2012) Within the Arabian region, vagrant individuals of this species are known from a single location in the Wadi Hajr river, which is dammed 3–4 km from the mouth, possibly blocking upstream access for eels (Attaala and Rubaia 2005, Freyhof <em>et al</em>. 2015). </p><p>In South Africa, poor water quality is anecdotally suggested to have caused eel species to become rare in some localities, such as the False Bay catchments, and few specimens remaining in this area have been observed to have severe skin lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Non-native species now found in many systems in South Africa, such as the predatory bass (<em>Micropterus</em> spp.) and catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), may also have contributed to the decline (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</p><p>In 2012 a new species of parasitic nematode was discovered in the intestines of&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em> collected from the freshwater bodies of Kerala State in southern Indian (Moravec <em>et al</em>. 2012). In some parts of India, this species has also been found to contain levels of pollutants that could be toxic to humans. In the Ganges River, West Bengal for example,&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em> specimens that were caught contained methyl mercury concentrations that were higher than the limits set by the PFA (Provention of Food Adulteration Act) for human consumption (Pal <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;</p><p>            </p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in anguillid species – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment – however, our understanding of these processes, and the scale of their influence, if any, is very limited <a name=""_Hlk17376667"">(Jacoby <em>et al</em>. 2015)</a>.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk6388497"">There is little quantitative information available to infer the population status of <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em>. It is reasonable to assume that there will have been some effects as a result of the identified threats, although considerably more information would be necessary to determine accurate estimates and associated changes.</a></p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is the most common eel in Indian freshwater systems, and in particular in Nagaland and Assam. In 1998, this species was classified as ‘Endangered’ in India in accordance with a decline in AOO (area of occupancy) and a decline in the extent and/or quality of habitat (Molur and Walker 1998). During a systematic sampling survey carried out between 2004 and 2006 in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (a large river system in Kerala), its relative abundance was deemed 'rare' across the ten sampling locations (Radhakrishnan and Kurup 2010). The IUCN Red List of Bangladesh assessed <em>A. bengalensis</em> as ‘Vulnerable’ within its regional assessment (Islam 2015). This is due to a suspected population decline of 30% over the last ten years, resulting from habitat-loss and unsustainable exploitation (Islam 2015).</p><p>For other localities, there is limited information.&#160;There is some anecdotal evidence for localised extirpation in Africa, for example in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe where fisherman, in 1998, reported no freshwater eel had been found since the construction of a large hydroelectric dam in 1959 (S. Watanabe pers. comm. 2014). In Manyame River, Zimbabwe, <em>A. bengalensis</em> was described as “formerly more numerous”, with individuals having not been collected or caught more recently, possibly indicating decline as a result of dams (Gratwicke <em>et al</em>. 2003). In Tanzania, the decline in native eels (<em>A. bengalensis</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>) is thought to have begun in the 1980s, also as a result of dam construction (Tamatamah 2012). Fishing trials carried out over the past decade have only found a few individual eels in comparison to pre-impoundment fish studies (Tamatamah 2012).</p><p>In some areas in South Africa, such as the Eerste River catchment in False Bay, eels were historically considered a problem species, and recruiting elvers caused blockages in irrigation pumps (<a name=""_Hlk17375676"">S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019</a>). Since the 1970s, eels are no longer common in False Bay catchments; this has been suggested to be due to poor water quality (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). <a name=""_Hlk10104968"">In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, river surveys for anguillid eels combined with historical distribution data found <em>A. bengalensis</em> not to be present in areas where they were previously extant (C. Hanzen unpub. data).</a> Since 2000, <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. bengalensis</em> have disappeared from longline sample catches in some catchments in Western Cape. One example is the Breede River, home to the invasive catfish (<em>Clarias</em> spp.), and so this may be a result of predation (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019). Similar to <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica, A. bengalensis </em>may have once occurred in the Rietvlei-Diep system in Table Bay, although recent records have been of dead <em>A. marmorata</em> individuals with visible lesions (S. Lamberth pers. comm. 2019).</p><p>        </p><p>In Réunion, <em>A. bengalensis </em>(listed under the redundant synonym <em>A. labiata</em>), as well as other recruiting anguillid eels (<em>A. bicolor</em>, <em>A. marmorata</em> and <em>A. mossambica</em>), are classified as ‘Critically Endangered’ under the regional Red List (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009). Listed threats include fisheries (target species and bycatch), habitat loss, construction of barriers to migration, and parasites (Fricke <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is found in Pakistan, India (Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Arunanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Assam, and Nagaland (Tsurang River)), Bangladesh, Nepal (Gandaki, Koshi, Karnali, Mahakali), Sri Lanka, Myanmar, South Africa (Sympatric with <em>A. marmorata</em> in the Western Cape), Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Eswatini (Komati river system), Lake Kariba, Middle Zambezi and its larger tributaries on the plateau, Limpopo (Umzingwane River and Inyankuni Dam), Pungwe, Buzi, Upper and Lower Save/Runde systems in Zimbabwe. It is also found in Lake Malawi and its catchment area as well as the Shire River and its tributaries and the eastward flowing Athi and Tana drainages (Seegers&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). In Ethiopia <em>A. bengalensis</em> has been reported from the middle reaches of the Genale River catchment in the southwest of the country and is currently the only anguillid species found in the country (Golubtsov <em>et al</em>. 2012). An electrofishing study conducted in upper estuaries of the Seychelles, Mayotte, Mauritius, Reunion and the east coast of Madagascar recorded no <em>A. bengalensis</em> out of 4,172 collected eels (Robinet <em>et al.</em> 2008). Most recently, this species’ range has been extended to Aceh in Indonesia (Muchlisin <em>et al.</em> 2017), and north-western Peninsular Malaysia (Arai 2014, Arai <em>et al</em>. 2015, Arai and Wong 2016, Arai and Kadir 2017<em>a,b</em>). There are also occasional records of vagrant individuals in the Arabian Peninsula (Wadi Haj in Yemen; Ataala and Rubaia 2005). </p><p>  </p><p>There remains some uncertainty surrounding where freshwater eels including&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em> spawn in the Indian Ocean. Indeed, compared to other species, very few leptocephali have been gathered for&#160;<em>A. bengalensis</em>&#160;and it is still not known whether this species has a single, or multiple spawning locations, or whether spawning location overlaps with other anguillids (see Robinet <em>et al.</em> 2008, Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2014 for discussion).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan, the Republic of Korea (also known as South Korea) and mainland China (hereafter China). A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>According to FAO data, annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Although the preferred species for farming in East Asia is <em>A. japonica</em>, which is native to the region, declines in availability and ongoing demand has led to increase in harvest and trade in juveniles of other <em>Anguilla</em> spp. in recent years (Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). According to East Asian Customs data, between 2008 and 2017 East Asian countries/territories imported ~14 t of live eel fry for farming (glass eels and larger juveniles) from Africa (99% from Madagascar) and 7.6 t from Bangladesh (all in 2014). There is, however, no information suggesting that <em>A. bengalensis </em>is currently used (or there are plans to use it) in eel farms in East Asia.</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years.&#160; According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight, and China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer. As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown out in farms.&#160;</p><p><em>Anguilla bengalensis </em>is found in subsistence and commercial fisheries and in international trade, however as its range overlaps with many other anguillids, species specific data is very limited and no catch data has been reported to FAO by any of its main African or Asian range States. <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em> is the most common eel in Indian inland waters and is of considerable commercial value in India and the Andaman Islands. On local markets in both India and Bangladesh <em>A. bengalensis</em> is only sold during the yellow or silver eel stage; live eels (greater than 100 g) of this species, originating in Bangladesh, are being offered for sale on B2B marketplaces/trade platforms. <em>Anguilla bengalensis</em><span class=""a0""> is harvested in small quantities (on average between one and six specimens a day per fisherman) in the Ganale Dawa river basin in Ethiopia (Abelti <em>et al. </em><span class=""a0"">2014). Yellow eel bycatch in Myanmar was reported as 12 t in 2017 with 10% of this believed to be <em>A. marmorata </em><span class=""a0"">or <em>A. bengalensis </em><span class=""a0"">(SEAFDEC 2018). Other uses of the species include treatment of arthritis, piles and meningitis in India (Talwar and Jhingran 1991, Chanu <em>et al.</em><span class=""a0""> 2014).

Myanmar reported exports live eels in 2010, 2014 and 2016, totalling ~10,900 t, however, live eel exports in the region are known to include other non-<em>Anguilla</em> eel species such as <em>Monopterus albus </em>(Swamp Eels). Madagascar, South Africa, Tanzania and Mauritius also exported <em>Anguilla </em>commodities between 2008 and 2017, with most exports being live and frozen eels from Madagascar (273 t) and South Africa (129 t).

The Palcazú Valley is severely fragmented in its lower and mid-altitudinal reaches. The establishment of large livestock grazing  areas is identified as the main mechanism of habitat fragmentation in the vicinity of Yanachaga Chemillén National Park. Illegal logging inside the Oxapampa-Asháninka-Yánesha Biosphere Reserve, as well as&#160;migratory agriculture and unsustainable use of agrochemicals are also threats (UNESCO 2016). Although the environmental impact assessment study of Block 107 did not record this species in 2008, the establishment of several oil concessions in the area could likely pose a threat to the remaining subpopulation (Larsen 2015), should it still be extant at this site.","This species is only known from the type series and museum specimens.

Extent of Occurrence (EOO) is estimated to be 97,772 km<sup>2</sup>. This species is highly abundant in western Ecuador and often comprises a dominant portion of the ichthyofauna based on the total number of individuals. Population may be declining locally, but is suspected to be relatively stable range-wide. Despite a number of pervasive threats in western Ecuador and northern Peru, this species remains abundant and does not appear to be under significant threat. Therefore, <em>R. altipinna</em> is assessed as Least Concern.</p>","<p>This omnivorous, benthopelagic species occurs in rivers with moderate water velocity and rocky substrates (Revelo and Laaz 2012). In the Santa Rosa River drainage, this species was more common in pool mesohabitats when compared to riffle mesohabitats (Aguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Maximum reported body size is 17 cm, but adults more commonly reach 10 cm standard length (SL) (Jiménez-Prado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Weight-length relationships have been established in the Atacames and Súa watersheds, based on extensive sampling of 1,720 individuals (Jiménez-Prado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).</p>","<p>Western Ecuador is heavily impacted by anthropogenic factors including habitat transformation for the development of agricultural fields and towns, the building of dams and creation of artificial reservoirs, habitat deterioration due to pollution, mining and severe river bank modification, and heavy fishing pressure (Aguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).</p>  <p>The Guayas River basin is subject to a number of anthropogenic stressors on local and regional scales (Loh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, 2018). In a basin-wide ecological water quality analysis, poor water quality was consistently detected around arable land and adjacent to residential areas (Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). The Guayas River basin supports much of the Ecuador’s industrial scale agricultural production, has contributed to high concentrations of pesticide pollutants throughout the watershed (Deknock&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019, Cambien&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020), and continues to drive deforestation as agricultural land-use expands (Borbor-Cordova&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Aguirre <em>et al.</em> 2021). Intensive grazing is a standard practice for cattle farming in the lower reaches of the drainage (Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The basin supports a human population of approximately 5.5 million inhabitants (Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Population growth and associated increases in urban expansion and industrial processes have degraded habitat quality around urban population centres (Damanik-Ambarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Rivera Vera 2017). The agricultural industry in the Guayas River basin is based on monoculture systems, and contributes to the production of about 20% of bananas and 83% of rice for Ecuador (INEC 2016). Mining activity near the Guayas or Santa Rosa River basins presents a threat to aquatic species, including areas such as Ponce Enriquez where the mercury toxicity threshold was three times higher than the threshold recommended for the protection of aquatic life (Appleton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001).</p>  <p>Gold mining is the primary economic activity in the upper basin of the Puyango-Tumbes River basin (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Schudel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Amalgamation processing occurs primarily in the municipality of Portovelo, Ecuador, where byproducts and wastewater is discharged directly into the Puyango watershed (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, Aguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021). Agricultural production and cattle ranching dominate the landscape in the middle and lower region of the basin, and include the production of bananas, rice, corn, fruit, chickens, goats, cattle, hogs, and sheep (Marshall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Coastal margins and the Tumbes River delta have been developed extensively for shrimp farming (Mialhe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p>  <p>Despite inferred and continuous declines in freshwater habitat quality, population trend is suspected to be stable or declining slowly. </p>","<p>The total population size of <em>R. altipinna</em> is unknown. However, it is one of the most common species of fishes on the Pacific coast of Ecuador (Jiménez-Prado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). This species was dominant in the Abras de Mantequilla wetland, despite a number of localized pervasive threats (e.g., hydroelectric damming, intense fertilizer use, deforestation, and agricultural expansion) (Alvarez-Mieles&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), and in the Ruidoso River (Aucapiña Franco 2017). In the Santa Rosa River, it was the second most abundant species (Aguirre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In the Viches River, it comprised 16.9% of relative fish abundance by number of individuals captured (Angulo Collahuazo 2020).</p>  <p>Population may be declining locally in the Jubobes River Basin due to the loss of natural refuges, habitat, and riparian vegetation associated with hydroelectric development (Jiménez-Prado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). However, this species does not appear to be threatened on a range-wide scale and population trend is suspected to be stable or declining slowly.</p>",Stable,"<p><em>Rhoadsia altipinna</em> occurs at low to moderate elevations from the Guayas River drainage (Barriga&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) southward to the Tumbes River (Valenzuela Reyna 2014), on the Pacific slope of western Ecuador and northwestern Peru (Loh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) and including the Catamayo, Chira, and Jubones rivers (Jiménez-Prado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).

This species is planktivorous, with juveniles targeting rotifers, and larger individuals targeting successively larger zooplankton (Unger and Lewis 1983). Spawning occurs in the littoral zone of water bodies throughout the year (Unger and Lewis 1991). Adults typically live 1-2 years (Unger and Lewis 1991).

In the last three decades, the majority of rivers and streams feeding Lago de Valencia have been filled with industrial waste and raw sewage. Most pollutants come from the Cabriales River in Carabobo as it passes through the city of Valencia. Los Guayos River receives a number of chemical wastes as it passes through industrial zones. Similarly, the Tapa Tapa River in Aragua passes through a large industrial zone, and eventually transports these wastes in Lago de Valencia (O.M. Lasso-Alcalá pers. comm. 2020). Increased water use around Lago de Valencia has contributed significantly to the loss of tributaries feeding the lake (López-Rojas and Bonillo-Rivero 2000). A number of construction activities have contributed to increased sedimentation and destruction of river channels (López-Rojas and Bonillo-Rivero 2000).</p>  <p>There is considerable evidence to suggest that the introduction of <em>Oreochromic mossambicus</em> into Lago de Valencia in 1959 was a primary driver of population decline (Pérez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004, Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).

It arrives on its breeding grounds between late-April and May and breeds from late-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in highly dispersed (Kear 2005) solitary pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). After mating (from June onwards), males migrate long distances prior to their flightless moult, most travelling in small groups to inshore or offshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988). Females and juveniles leave the breeding grounds in September (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious when not breeding (Madge and Burn 1988) with males forming large congregations during the flightless moulting period (Kear 2005). Large flocks of several hundred to a thousand (Snow and Perrins 1998) or occasionally over 100,000 individuals can be observed during winter (Scott and Rose 1996). Non-breeders often oversummer on the wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species breeds on Arctic dwarf heath (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005) or boggy tundra on pools, small lakes, streams (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and slow-flowing rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for freshwater habitats<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) with low banks (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), small islets (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys<strong><sup> </sup></strong>or among mossy bogs (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). It generally avoids areas with steep slopes or wetlands enclosed by forest (Kear 2005). <em>Non-breeding</em> Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) the majority moult and overwinter at sea (Kear 2005) or shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep (Kear 2005) (optimally 5-15 m [Scott and Rose 1996]) with abundant benthic fauna (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. barnacles and shrimps [Johnsgard 1978]), worms<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), echinoderms, isopods, amphidods (Kear 2005) and insects&#160;(e.g. midges and caddisflies [del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992]) as well as small fish<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and fish eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) such as seeds, roots and tubers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) close to water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) or placed further away in dwarf heath (Kear 2005).</p>    <p></p>","<p>Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions have been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011), and future ocean acidification may lead to sustained declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten the species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while oil drilling sites could also cause low-level impacts through human disturbance and degradation of food resources (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, Nikolaeva <em>et al.</em> 2006). In parts of the range, avoidance of busy shipping areas by flocks of the species could displace flocks from preferred feeding areas. Hunting represents another threat to the species, with an average of 9,500 birds reported to be shot annually in the US and an additional 7,000 per year in Canada through the 1980s and 1990s. However, the actual number killed may have been much higher with maximum estimates exceeding 24,000 in the US in 1974 and 23,000 annually in Canada between 1974 and 1982 (Bordage and Savard 2011). Since this period, numbers of hunters have decreased considerably and the annual harvest has fallen concomitantly. The species is susceptible to avian influenza and may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is unlikely to affect the majority of the population at once and only small numbers of birds tested in various countries have developed the disease despite evident exposure to the virus. High-speed ferries can cause disturbance to this species (Larsen and Laubek 2005).

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures.

They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008).

Thus the species is listed here as Near Threatened, but future surveys could show that the species is declining at an even greater rate.","This species breeds on small lakes, pools, bogs and streams of the tundra. It mainly feeds on molluscs but will also take crustaceans, with a more varied diet in summer including insects, arachnids, berries and seeds. It feeds by diving, and will pluck or dabble on the surface. Breeding begins in May or June in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1992)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","<p>Climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Warming and sea ice retreat poses an ongoing and future threat to the species’ habitat as sea ice provides an important resting platform when not foraging (Lovvorn <em>et al</em>. 2009). Reductions in ice habitat are predicted to result in large decreases in the area of viable habitat, even in the absence of other impacts such as shifts in food availability (Lovvorn <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160; Such habitat shifts have been seen in almost one third of winters between 1998 and 2011, denying access to preferred foraging locations and forcing prey switching, resulting in adult body fat being one third lower than in winters with access to these resources (Lovvorn <em>et al.</em> 2014). A recent modelling study by Christie <em>et al</em>. (2018) reveals that under an RCP 8.5 scenario, the species's abundance will likely increase through to 2040 before declining rapidly through to near extirpation in the late 21st century as the Bering Sea becomes ice-free. There appears to be no difference in mean survival between widely separated breeding areas, indicating that survival is mainly a function of wintering conditions (Solovyeva <em>et al.</em> 2017). Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for the species, and remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith <em>et al. </em>2005, Riordan <em>et al. </em>2006), while the alteration of habitats through coastal erosion, inundation and salinization from storm surges, thawing permafrost, and sedimentation changes due to sea level rise and increased river discharge could change the suitability of current nesting areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, no link between wetland loss and population decline has been made for this species yet. Nevertheless, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region, with unknown impacts on the long-term survival of the species (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2015). Climate change has also been held responsible for severely reducing the Eiders’ benthic prey, likely due to ocean acidification (e.g. molluscs which form a large part of Eider diet) (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017); <em>Macoma calcarea</em>,&#160;a key prey of the Spectacled Eider, is evidenced to be decreasing in abundance throughout sites in the Bering Sea, influencing the Eider's winter foraging (Goethel <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Direct persecution poses another major threat to the species, with 10s to 100s of individuals harvested in Alaska and 10,000-14,000 in Russia per annum (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). This represents around 5% annual mortality, based on a population of 330,000 (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Pollution also threatens this species with lethal and sub-lethal levels of lead poisoning from ingested lead shot found in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding population, with levels high enough to influence regional subpopulation dynamics (Flint <em>et al.</em> 2016, Sea Duck Joint Venture 2016). Exposure to lead reduced estimated survival from 0.78 to 0.44 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010), while the survival of females exposed to lead was 0.34 lower than that of those with blood lead levels at or below background levels (Grand <em>et al.</em> 1998). Lead levels exceeding typical exposure thresholds were found in 30.7% of females in the Chaun Delta, Russia between 2003-2010; however, only 8.8% exhibited levels above the critical threshold (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt</em>. 2012, 2020). Lead shot is likely not a serious threat to Siberian populations due to the low human density in the breeding range (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt</em>. 2020).</p>  <p>Oil spills occur in the species range, and although infrequent, represent a significant risk to the population (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). Oil and gas development on the central coast of Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain has altered nesting habitat, causing potential threats from oil contamination, off-road vehicle use, wetland filling as well as the indirect effects of human disturbance (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, the development related to the petroleum industry is not regarded a significant threat to the species as only a small proportion of the species’s range is within or near developed areas. The risk to eiders from collisions and disturbance resulting from industrial activities and interaction with shipping lanes linked to oil and gas development is thought to be low and is unlikely to have population-level effects (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, but at present, the disease appears not to have any significant effects on the population. Seroprevalence of avian influenza in Spectacled Eider is approximately 90% (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013), but less than 5% tested positive for the virus (Ip <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  Arctic Foxes <em>Vulpes lagopus</em> are present in the species’s range and may contribute to mortality through predation. Density of wolverine and now brown bear appear to have increased in low Arctic tundra as a result of climate change impacts (Solovyeva 2016). Modelling of breeding success indicates that predation is likely to be driving reductions in productivity, although factors operating over winter are likely to be the main drivers of observed declines across the range (Solovyeva <em>et al</em>. 2017a). Changes in the species community composition may be also having an effect, with a decline in Sabine’s Gull <em>Xema sabini</em> and Arctic Tern <em>Sterna paradise</em> (which provide nest protection) and an increase in mammalian predators and Vega Gull <em>Larus smithsonianus vegae</em> potentially leading to reduced breeding success (see Solovyeva and Zelenskaya 2016, Solovyeva <em>et al</em>. 2017b). It is possible that these community changes are a result of climate change (D. Solovyeva <em>in litt. </em>2018).","Wetlands International (2020) estimate the global population to number 360,000-400,000 individuals, in line with the 2010 estimate based on aerial surveys of winter flocks in the Bering Sea of 369,122 individuals, rounded here to 370,000 individuals (Larned&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). This equates to 246,081 mature individuals, rounded here to 250,000 mature individuals, as estimated by Partners in Flight (2019).",Decreasing,"This species breeds along the coasts of north-east Siberia, <strong>Russia,&#160;</strong>east from the Yana Delta to Cape Schmidt, and also along the Beaufort Sea coast of Alaska's North Slope and the&#160;Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, <strong>USA</strong>. 90% of the breeding population is thought to inhabit the Russian range with just 5% of the population residing in the northern Alaskan and Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta ranges respectively (Goldman <em>et al</em>. 2017).

Nests are generally in trees within closed-canopy forest, (usually in cavities or on stick platforms constructed originally by raptors, wood rats or squirrels) on cliff-ledges in steep-walled canyons (and occasionally in caves (Wilk <em>et al</em>. 2018). Eggs are laid from March to May. Young birds are obligate dispersers, whilst unpaired birds or those that have failed to breed previously also disperse (Forsman <em>et al. </em>2002,&#160;Blakesley <em>et al</em>. 2006, Ganey <em>et al. </em>2014a);&#160;this may help to sustain some sink populations. It may make some movements in winter, including to recently burnt areas as these can have greater food availability (Ganey <em>et al. </em>2014b). It feeds principally on nocturnal mammals.<p></p>","The two principle threats to the Spotted Owl are currently considered to be competition with the Barred Owl (<em>Strix varia</em>) and logging of the species's habitat. Spotted Owl faces strong competition from Barred Owl which is gradually displacing Spotted Owls from much of the northern part of their range, outcompeting Spotted Owls for food and space, reducing Spotted Owl occupancy and breeding propensity, and occasionally hybridising (Kelly and Forsman 2004, Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Wiens <em>et al</em>. 2014, Dugger&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Long and Wolfe 2019, Mangan <em>et al</em>. 2019)<strong></strong>. While&#160;<em>S. varia&#160;</em>is not known to have affected the population trend in California yet, some hybrids have been noted there and it does appear to be spreading into the range of California Spotted Owl (Tempel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014a, Gutiérrez <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2017, Wood <em>et al</em>. 2019). Degradation and fragmentation of its habitat through clear felling and selective logging of large trees is a primary threat to the species (Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2018); with habitat fragmentation shown to correlate with decreased probability of survival (Schilling <em>et al. </em>2013); the rate of logging is however reported to have declined notably in the past 20-30 years (Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, J. Dunk <em>in litt</em>. 2020). This has been compounded by the removal of a legal requirement that the U. S. Forest Service assess the viability of wildlife on national forest lands (Noon and Blakesley 2006)<strong></strong>. Forest loss throughout the species's range is currently estimated at ~7.25% over three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). Populations in the&#160;southwest of its range, California, and dry inland forests of the Pacific Northwest&#160;are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation caused by high-severity fire (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2019) and drought associated with climate change  (see Peery <em>et al. </em>2011, Jones <em>et al. </em>2016, T. Supplee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al. </em>2017, Wan <em>et al</em>. 2019) although low- and moderate-severity fires are not thought to significantly affect the species (see Bond <em>et al</em>. 2002, Roberts <em>et al. </em>2011, Lee <em>et al. </em>2012, Willey and van Riper III 2014, Ganey <em>et al</em>. 2017) and may even create favourable foraging conditions (Eyes <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;Habitat loss to wildfire has been greater than expected in recent years, raising the economic value of remaining habitat (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Projected climate change may result in hotter and drier summers with longer fire seasons and larger more intense fires, as well as increased tree mortality from drought and insects, and uncertainty over the viability of habitat restoration. Further effects from climate change may affect different areas differently (see Peery <em>et al. </em>2011) and could include changes in the frequency and duration of inclement weather during the breeding season (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012); and in the Pacific Northwest it may lead to wetter and warmer winters (Glenn <em>et al. </em>2010). Timber harvesting on private land is a significant threat, as well as renewed pressure to eliminate protections for the species on federal land in Oregon, in order to allow increased logging (T. Supplee  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, R. Gutiérrez&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Unfavourable management includes intensive thinning of suitable habitat,  which is expected to result in declines over the short term (T. Supplee  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011), as well as logging and manipulation of canopy vegetation to reduce the risk of wildfire (B. Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The species may also face high levels of disturbance, especially in recreational areas where it occurs such as National Parks (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Energy development and associated habitat loss and mortalities from collisions with powerlines could also be affecting this species, but the degree of impact is essentially unknown (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Potentially serious threats include West Nile virus, which is fatal to the species (although it may be absent from some subpopulations [Hull <em>et al. </em>2010]), the potential loss of habitat to Sudden Oak Death Syndrome  (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), and avian malaria, which has been discovered in the species and found to weaken infected individuals, probably reducing reproductive success (Ishak<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008, D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Enhanced exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (AR), illegally utilised, in and widely contaminating the remote forests of California, USA, may also be adversely impacting the species (Gabriel <em>et al</em>. 2018, Wiens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019a). Other potential threats have been put forward, for instance it has been mooted that water management could possibly have an impact on the species through indirect effects, though these will require further study (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012, Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 2017).<p></p>","Its population size was estimated at c.15,000 mature individuals (Rich <em>et al</em>. 2004).

Mexican Spotted Owl may be considered to be declining (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012), although Mexican populations may be stable because forestry activities there typically modify rather than destroy habitat (Lammertink <em>et al.</em> 1996, J. M. Lammertink <em>in litt.</em> 1998) and at least locally in New Mexico some subpopualations may be increasing (Ganey <em>et al. </em>2014b). Most other populations are declining and, in some, the decline is accelerating because of clear-felling and selective logging (Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Noon and McKelvey 1996)<strong></strong>. Subspecies <em>caurina</em> is estimated to be in significant decline, at 3.8% per year range-wide and 8.4% per year in Washington State (1985-2013; Dugger&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016), and  is close to extinction in Canada.

Protected Activity Centres are advocated for as an effective mechanism of conserving the species in parts of its range (Verner <em>et al</em>. 1992, Willey and van Riper III 2007)<strong></strong>. In 2012 9.6 million acres of habitat was designated as critical habitat for the Northern Spotted Owl by U. S.

Maintain and restore habitat; large reserves, encompassing suitable habitat and widely distributed are needed to retain the owl's current range and a halt to logging operations throughout parts of its range are required to prevent local extinctions. Use analyses to inform habitat management decisions, and ensure appropriate habitat management, which may involve habitat restoration and recovery (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011, 2012, Peery <em>et al</em>. 2017). Large-scale Barred Owl control efforts are likely to be needed, especially for the Northern Spotted Owl, but may also be required within the range of the California Spotted Owl to prevent local extinctions in parts of the species's range.

Nests generally have surrounding vegetation that conceals them from visual contact with conspecifics (Seddon and Davis 1989), but this is not believed to be a prerequisite for successful breeding (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2015). Two eggs are laid from mid-September to mid-October, with hatching occurring at the beginning of November. Chicks fledge from mid-February to mid-March (Seddon <em>et al. </em>2013). Prey species on the mainland are primarily opalfish, sprat, silversides, ahuru, blue cod and arrow squid; red cod used to be an important prey species in the 1980s (van Heezik 1990, Moore and Wakelin 1997, Browne <em>et al.</em> 2011). Blue Cod DNA has been found in 100% of all faecal samples taken from mainland Yellow-eyed Penguins, indicating a significant change in prey quality and type (M. Young <em>et al. </em>unpublished). Yellow-eyed Penguins forage predominantly along the seafloor (87% of all dives) whereas pelagic dives mostly occur when they travel back to their breeding areas (Mattern <em>et al. </em>2007). They occasionally dive deeper than 120 m but predominantly forage in depths of less than 100 m (Seddon <em>et al.</em> 2013). Individuals have preferred foraging sites that they revisit on subsequent foraging trips and even between years (Moore 1999, Mattern <em>et al.</em> 2007). They appear very sensitive to disturbance and degradation of their benthic foraging habitat (Browne <em>et al. </em>2011, Ellenberg and Mattern 2012, Mattern <em>et al.</em> 2013). &#160;<p></p>","<p>By-catch mortality in the commercial gillnet fisheries is thought have driven significant declines over the past two decades, both on predator-free islands, such as Whenua Hou, and along the mainland coast (Ellenberg and Mattern 2012, Mattern <em>et al. </em>2017). Current estimates are 17 (95% CI 6-34) birds caught annually (Ministries for Private Industries, 2019) but this is likely an underestimate and modelling suggests that even these low numbers are sufficient to drive significant population declines (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017). Recreational gillnets are likely to have had an effect on the yellow-eyed penguin population, but are currently banned within coastal waters of up to 4 miles around the South Island (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017), excluding Rakiura, and as such, represent less of a threat. However, if this ban were lifted, this threat would be of similar magnitude to the large-scale gillnets that principally operate further out. Furthermore, fisheries activities appear to affect prey availability and prey quality (Mattern 2007; Browne <em>et al.</em> 2011), and influence penguin foraging behaviour (Mattern<em> et al. </em>2013). Modelling has found a likely correlation between changing sea surface temperature and penguin vital rates, whereby productivity and survival are projected to decline under predicted climate change (Mattern <em>et al.</em> 2017). This has been seen in the Boulder Beach colony, where changes in SST have been found to account for 33% of the population fluctuations (Mattern <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>Introduced ferret <em>Mustela furo</em>, stoat <em>M. erminea</em>, unleashed dogs <em>Canis familiaris</em>, and possibly feral cats <em>Felis catus</em>, are predators in the South Island. Predation by pigs <em>Sus domesticus&#160;</em>on the main Auckland Island and in the Catlins is known to occur (B. McKinlay per D. Houston <em>in litt.</em> 2012). A rogue female New Zealand sea lion <em>Phocarctos hookeri</em> and her daughter had been estimated to eat 20-30 birds annually on the Otago Peninsula (Lalas <em>et al. </em>2007), but they have since died of natural causes. Accidental fires in breeding areas are a known, but infrequent, threat. Repeated adult die-off events remain little understood but might be due to toxins (Gill and Darby 1993). Disease appears to be a growing problem in some populations in most recent years, with diphtheritic stomatitis (caused by the bacteria <em>Corynebacterium</em> spp.) and the blood parasites <em>Plasmodium spp. </em>and&#160;<em>Leucocytozoon tawaki</em>, the latter formerly only known from Fiordland penguins, causes of mortality for chicks (Argilla <em>et al.</em> 2013, Gartrell <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Human disturbance, particularly from unregulated tourists at breeding areas, negatively affects energy budgets, fledgling weight and probability of survival (McClung <em>et al.</em> 2004; Ellenberg <em>et al. </em>2007, 2009, 2013), with human to penguin distance being a predictor of the likelihood of defensive behaviour (French <em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;</p><p></p><p></p>","Past estimates suggested there were around 1,700 breeding pairs (3,400 breeders), with an estimated 60% of these in the sub-Antarctic (Auckland Campbell Islands) (Seddon<em> et al.</em> 2013), but recent declines on mainland New Zealand indicate the total population is lower that previously thought.&#160;Surveys in the Auckland Islands in 2017 estimated 577 pairs (Muller&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2020). The Campbell Island population was last estimated in 1992 at 350-540 pairs (Moore 2001). Stewart Island and outliers were estimated at 220-400 pairs in 1994, dropping to 178 pairs in 1999-2001 (Massaro and Blair 2003). In 2011-2012 South Island's south-east coast was thought to hold 452 pairs (Seddon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013), in 2015, there were 252 breeding pairs counted on the South Island, while in 2019, the total number of breeding pairs counted in the South Island was 227 (DOC;&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>).

Recent data indicates that the rate of decline has slowed, although breeding data indicates continuing reductions in Scandinavia, and the trend in the Russian breeding population is unknown. Further information on the rate of decline here, as well as potential shifts in distribution and the drivers of the rapid past decline are needed to inform conservation actions.","The species breeds on wooded&#160;<strong><sup></sup></strong>coastlines, small freshwater lakes,&#160;pools and rivers&#160;in northern coniferous forests, wooded Arctic tundra&#160;and alpine zones, especially where there are boulder-covered or small rocky islands available for nesting with extensive herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and low trees&#160;(Johnsgard 1978,&#160;del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992,&#160;Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005).&#160;The majority of birds winter at sea on shallow inshore coastal waters, especially in estuaries or inlets where there are large mussel-beds<strong></strong>&#160;(Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also occur on freshwater lakes and estuaries during migration<strong>&#160;</strong>(Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005).&#160;Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, as well as crustaceans, worms, echinoderms, amphipods, isopods, small fish, and (in freshwater habitats) adult and larval insects<strong>&#160;</strong>(del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Kear 2005). The species may also consume plant material on its breeding grounds&#160;(e.g. leaves and shoots)<strong></strong>&#160;(Flint&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992).&#160;It mainly forages by diving and may feed at depths of 30-40 m during the winter (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1992)<strong></strong>.&#160;This species is highly migratory&#160;and breeds from mid-May onwards&#160;in solitary pairs or loose groups, occasionally nesting in association with gull or tern colonies<strong> </strong>(Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1992, Kear 2005).<p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species, at present and in the future. Decreasing spring snow cover duration has been linked to declining Scoter populations in North America, likely due to trophic mismatch, and is likely to also affect Siberian populations (Drever <em>et al.</em> 2011). Ocean acidification could lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of the Velvet Scoter diet (Steinacher <em>et al.</em> 2009, Carboneras&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Another major threat is bycatch in fishing gear, occurring particularly in wintering grounds (Dagys &amp; Hearn 2018). Population declines in the Baltic Sea have coincided with heavy bycatch mortality in gillnet fisheries and Velvet Scoters are amongst the most frequent victims as their foraging ecology puts them at high risk of entanglement (Dagys &amp; Žydelis 2002, Žydelis <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2013, Dagys 2017).</p>  <p>Invasive species pose a threat to Velvet Scoters in parts of the range, but the extent of impacts are largely unknown at present (Almquist <em>et al.</em> 2010, Dagys 2017). Predation from introduced American mink <em>Neovison vison</em> may impair populations on Scandinavian islands (Nordstrom <em>et al.</em> 2002), and the Round Goby <em>Neogobius melanostomus</em> feeds on benthic invertebrates and may impact the abundance and distribution of Scoter food supplies.</p>  During moulting and winter aggregations, the species is highly susceptible to oil spills and other marine pollutants (Gorski <em>et al.</em> 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005, UICN France 2011) and one catastrophic oil spill occurring in a key moulting or wintering area could affect a large proportion of the global population (Madge &amp; Burn 1988). Velvet Scoter have been found to be susceptible to avian influenza (Melville &amp; Shortridge 2006) and future outbreaks of disease may be expected and could compound observed declines in parts of its range. The species is also hunted in some areas however, this is generally considered to be sustainable, with annual bags estimated to be between 1,600 and 2,800 individuals in Denmark (Bregnballe <em>et al.</em> 2006). Habitat degradation caused by sand-dredging operations, bottom-trawling fisheries and the installation of wind farms causes the loss, degradation or avoidance of feeding areas (Garthe and Huppop 2004, Skov <em>et al.</em> 2011, Dierschke <em>et al.</em> 2016, Dagys &amp; Hearn 2018), while additional habitat degradation on breeding grounds has resulted from human exploitation of natural resources such as marine benthic organisms and shellfish in the taiga and lower tundra regions (Kear 2005).<p></p><p></p>","Population data supplied the&#160;to the European Commission (EC) in late 2019 by Member States under Article 12 of the EU Birds Directive totalled 202,000-384,000 individuals.

Subsequently, numbers in the main wintering areas appear largely stable (BirdLife International in prep., M. Ellermaa <em>in litt. </em>2020, N. Markones <em>in litt. </em>2020, S.

The EU breeding population, while a small portion of the global total (<em>c.&#160;</em>80% breed in Russia), is estimated to be declining at a rate of approximately 30% over the past three generations (BirdLife International in prep), and the population that winters in the Black Sea and Caspian region appears to be suffering a rapid decline on breeding grounds (S. Isfendiyaroglu <em>in litt. </em>2020, Paposhvili 2018).

Groups are composed of several males, several females, juveniles and infants (Defler 2010). This subspecies<em>&#160;</em>can be found in flooded and terra firma forest, near to riverbanks (Defler 2010).</p>","<p>The main threats for <em>Saimiri c. albigena</em>&#160;are habitat loss and fragmentation. The principal pressures driving the negative changes in the populations of this subspecies are mainly agricultural activity and, especially, the rapid conversion of the land to palm oil plantations, as well as new areas of petroleum exploration in its distribution area. In the San Martín area, Meta department, two new exploitation sites were implemented between October 2013 and August 2014, affecting several forest fragments where this subspecies presence have been confirmed (Carretero-Pinzón, pers. obs., unpubl. data). Additionally, there seems to be high attrition from animals trying to disperse across roads and over open ground, judging from the frequent dead animals observed in the last ten years in the San Martin area (Carretero-Pinzon 2013).<br/><br/>Elsewhere in its range, the species does not have major threats at the moment. However, continuous deforestation in the Colombian, Ecuadorian and Peruvian Amazon could have an effect on the species if the deforestation rates increase.</p>","<p>Population trends for the species are unknown.<em></em></p><p><em>Saimiri c. albigena:&#160;</em>An estimated total census number (reproductive individuals) of 191 was found for an area of around 533 km², composed by forest fragments of different sizes around San Martin town (Carretero-Pinzón 2013). A recent estimation (2014) based on direct counts on forest fragments from an area of 3154.5 km<sup>2</sup>, found 560 reproductive adults, divided in 52 groups and 10 subpopulations, with poor or none connection between them (area between San Carlos de Guaroa, Fuente de Oro, San Martín and Cubarral towns in Meta department). At least four of these subpopulations may disappear in the next decade if the habitat loss and fragmentation continues, as they inhabit many degraded fragments with low dispersal opportunities. Similar estimates can be expected from most of their distribution area, except for populations inhabiting Macarena and Tinigua National Parks, however information from these two parks are unavailable due to social unrest, guerrillas and illegal crops present inside the parks, that prevent us to make accurate estimations (Carretero-Pinzón 2013). Populations in the Upper Magdalena River valley are also decreasing, only one population of this subspecies seems to have a future, as it is found inside Cueva de los Guacharos National Park, Huila department (P. Stevenson pers. com. 2012; Carretero-Pinzón 2013). Population densities of this subspecies have been estimated for Tinigua National Park (12.7 ind/ km<sup>2</sup>, Stevenson 2007) and forest fragments in the San Martin area (3.85 – 170.24 ind/ km² (Carretero-Pinzón 2013).<em></em></p><p><em>Saimiri c. macrodon:&#160;</em>Densities reported for the Colombian Amazon are varied, with 6-9 individuals/km²) in the low Apaporis River, 17,7 individuals/km² in the Pure River (Amazonas) and 8,5 to 11,5 individuals/km² in the Purité River in Colombia.

The eastern limits in Arauca and Casanare are poorly defined but, an increase of grasslands, decreasing rainfall and reduced extent of gallery forest, seem to be the limiting factors for their distribution.

The global population is thought to comprise a single, migratory subpopulation. It is therefore listed as Endangered.<br/><p></p>","It is closely associated with wetlands, principally large lakes and rivers, from the lowlands to 5,000 m. It generally nests in trees near water. Breeding takes place from September-February in northern India and Myanmar (BirdLife International 2001), and in Bangladesh it returns to nest sites in late August (Sourav <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Three satellite-tracked birds recently provided evidence that the species undertakes extensive, seasonal migrations of over 4,000 km from India to Mongolia  and Russia. Tracked  individuals also demonstrated a previously unknown capability to fly  directly over the Himalayas at altitudes exceeding 6,000 m  (Steele 2017).<p></p>","Key threats are habitat loss, degradation and disturbance. Across the Indian subcontinent, and probably most of its range, wetlands have been drained or converted for agriculture and human settlements. The felling of large trees near wetlands has reduced the availability of nest and roost sites. The spread of water hyacinth <em>Eichhornia crassipes </em>is a problem in India, as is the siltation of lakes due to catchment deforestation. Pollution of wetlands with pesticides and industrial effluents reduces breeding success. Habitat loss and degradation are compounded by disturbance of wetlands. Reductions in the prey base, primarily through hunting and over-fishing, are further consequences of increasing human pressure. In Myanmar, the development of oil and gas fields is a threat and, in China, hunting is a localised problem (Orta<em> et al. </em>2020). In Mongolia, during surveys in summer 2009, it was noted that two recently completed hydroelectric dams were severely disrupting water levels in the affected drainage basins and could potentially affect all sites where the species occurs in the Great Lake Basin (Gilbert and Gombobataar 2009). Over-fishing was also noted at several sites and low rainfall was leading to falling water levels in some areas (Gilbert and Gombobataar 2009). Loss of mature trees following two major cyclones may have affected breeding sites in Odisha, India (M. Bhujabal <em>in litt.</em> 2017).<br/><p></p>","Based on surveys and available data from across the species's extant distribution, the population is estimated to fall well below 2,500 mature individuals (M. Steele and M. Gilbert <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016). It is therefore placed here in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals. The global population is considered to comprise a single migratory population, rather than multiple isolated subpopulations (Steele 2017).",Decreasing,"This species was previously thought to be a migratory breeder north of the Himalayas, with a stronghold in <strong>Mongolia</strong>, and a resident population in the Indian subcontinent, recent evidence and re-evaluation of historical data has since suggested that this is not, and may never have been, the case. Surveys in Mongolia between 2005-2009 found the species to be absent from 13 of 21  historically known sites (Gilbert <em>et al. </em>2014), and found very little evidence for the species breeding anywhere north of  the Himalayas. Further surveys in Mongolia between June-August in 2012-2015 similarly found no evidence of breeding (M. Steele <em>in litt.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The species may instead breed only in northern <strong>India</strong> (apparent strongholds in Assam and Uttarakhand), <strong>Bangladesh </strong>and <strong>Myanmar</strong>, with very small numbers in <strong>Bhutan</strong>, dispersing north of the Himalayas to <strong>Kazakhstan</strong>, <strong>Russia </strong>and Mongolia in its non-breeding season (May to September). There is no recent record of breeding in <strong>Afghanistan </strong>(S. Ostrowski <em>in litt.</em> 2017), the current status in <strong>Pakistan </strong>appears to be uncertain, and there is uncertainty around the extent of any historical breeding in central <strong>China</strong>,  though virtually all Chinese records also fall outside of the time of  year the species has been confirmed breeding, and while there are many  records of adults and juveniles together, there is a notable lack of  records of nests or collected eggs from north of the Himalayas. Further evidence for this hypothesis comes from recent telemetry studies which confirmed connectivity between India and Mongolia (Steele 2017; M. Steele <em>in litt.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Formerly considered one of the most numerous Asian raptors, declines were first noticed as early as the 1960s. Long term declines are well known from the west of the range,  and the species is now virtually extirpated from former sites in west Asia.

The population trend is stable overall with localised decreases in population size, usually driven by human disturbance and climatic variability. Increasing ocean temperature and strong winds are linked to negative effects on adult foraging and chick survival. The stable trend should be taken cautiously as 60% of the sites have an “unknown” population trends due to data deficiency. In Australia, there is a decrease in the population size in New South Wales and South Australia while Tasmania is data deficient. Populations are stable in WA and increasing in Victoria. In New Zealand, the situation of the species remains unclear due to inconsistent monitoring efforts over large parts of the country. Little penguins along the South Island’s West Coast, Banks Peninsula seem to be decreasing over the past decades while penguin numbers around Oamaru are stable if not increasing. Although the species has a large estimated extent of occurrence, about 69% of sites have fewer than 100 breeding individuals. For the remaining sites, 28% have between 100 and 5000 individuals and only 3% of sites have a population size above 5,000 individuals. Sites with small populations are more vulnerable with reported local extinctions. Several sites without active conservation measures have experienced a severe decrease in population size, while many former breeding colonies no longer exist. The population range and size do not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable criteria (extent of occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and &lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p>","<p>The little penguin (<em>Eudyptula minor</em>), the smallest of all penguins (~30-40 cm), is endemic to southern Australia and New Zealand, breeding during the austral autumn to summer months. These dark indigo-blue coloured penguins are the only genuinely nocturnal penguin species on land; adults always arrive after dusk and leave before dawn (Klomp &amp; Wooller 1991, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2007, Rodríguez <em>et al. </em>2016). The global population is estimated as 469,760 individuals. The little penguin population trend is stable overall with localised decrease in some sites. This species is a generalist feeder with significant variability in diet between colonies and even between years at the same colony (Klomp and Wooller 1988, Gales &amp; Pemberton 1990, Cullen <em>et al.</em> 1992, Fraser and Lalas 2004, Chiaradia<em> et al.</em> 2010, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2016). They feed mainly on clupeids such as anchovy <em>Engraulis</em> sp and sardines <em>Sardinops sagax </em>when feeding chicks but they may also feed on krill <em>Nyctiphanes australis </em>and several species of cephalopods at all stages of breeding (Gales &amp; Pemberton 1990, Cullen <em>et al.</em> 1992, Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2016) and jellyfish (Cavallo <em>et al.</em> 2018). This variability in the diet is also found in their trophic interactions where penguins can reduce the prey trophic range in response to years of low breeding success (Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2010) and segregate foraging areas within the same colony (Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2018). The species dives to a maximum 72 metres, with a preferred depth zone between 20 to 30 metres (Chiaradia <em>et al. </em>2007, Ropert-Coudert <em>et al. </em>2009)</p><p>Penguins typically lay two eggs per clutch (Stahel <em>et al. </em>1987), and up to three clutches over a breeding season (Johannesen <em>et al</em>. 2003). The penguins exhibit six main breeding stages: courtship, pre-laying exodus, pre-laying, incubation, guard and post-guard (Chiaradia &amp; Kerry 1999); followed by moulting and inter-breeding stages (Salton <em>et al.</em> 2015). When feeding chicks, some parents make more foraging trips than their mates. This situation represents the norm (72% of cases), rather than the previously expected equal parenting (Saraux<em> et al.</em> 2011). Individuals can also alternate between two consecutive long foraging trips and several shorter ones throughout the chick-rearing period (Saraux<em> et al. </em>2011). Short trips allow for regular food provisioning of chicks (high feeding frequency and larger meals), whereas longer trips are triggered by a parent’s low body mass and therefore the need to replenish its energy reserves. Little penguins form groups when crossing the beach to nesting sites and individuals seem to choose their travelling partners (Daniel<em> et al. </em>2007). When foraging,&#160; some individuals can take advantage of human-made features, like ship channels to aid in their foraging (Preston <em>et al.</em> 2008). Breeding age, ranging from 2 to 18+ years, seems to play a crucial role as well, as middle-aged (8-12 years) penguins are better breeders (Nisbet &amp; Dann 2009), employ more effective foraging strategies (Zimmer <em>et al. </em>2011) and feed in different locations (Pelletier<em> et al.</em> 2014).</p><p></p>","<p>Many populations of little penguins are severely threatened by human disturbance such as introduced predators, domestic dogs, roadkill, coastal development, watercraft injuries, oil spills and gillnet fishing in both Australia and New Zealand (Cannel <em>et al.</em> 2016; Chiaradia 2013, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017, Dann 2013). Reduction in prey abundance is another major vulnerability to little penguin populations (Cannel <em>et al. </em>2016; Chiaradia 2013) as well as natural predators such as fur seals and corvids (Ekanayake at al. 2015a,b). Changes in the abundance of major prey can result in a dramatic change in their diet composition and trophic interactions, resulting in increased mortality and decreased breeding success (Dann <em>et al.</em> 2000; Chiaradia <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>A newer and additional challenge for this species is in the fast-changing marine and terrestrial environment, particularly in the rapidly warming sea of south-eastern Australia (Ramirez <em>et al.</em> 2017, Voice <em>et al.</em> 2006; Wu<em> et al. </em>2012), wherein southwestern Australia the warming sea has been associated with poorer breeding (Cannell <em>et al. </em>2012). Penguins have also been shown to catch less prey under warmer conditions (Carroll <em>et al. </em>2016). Oceanographic change may lead to a mismatch between plankton and the small pelagic fish that are also penguin prey (Hinder<em> et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Increasing terrestrial temperatures in the spring and summer months can cause fatal hyperthermia in both chicks and adults (Cannell <em>et al.</em> 2011, Cannell <em>et al. </em>2012, Cannell <em>et al.</em> 2016). This issue is particularly relevant in those colonies where nesting occurs within the vegetation rather than in burrows as a result of a soft, sandy substrate. <br/><br/>Remarkably, some of these pressures can be locally offset by a wide range of conservation efforts, such as the case of increasing population size at Phillip Island (Sutherland &amp; Dann 2012, 2014), St Kilda (Preston <em>et al.</em> 2010; Preston 2011), Manly (Carlile<em> et al. </em>2015), Oamaru (Agnew <em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160; Sites without active conservation measures have experienced a severe decrease, where many known breeding colonies no longer exist (Dann 1994; Stevenson &amp; Woehler 2007, Wilson &amp; Mattern 2019). Local extinction of many small colonies continues in Australia and New Zealand.</p>","<p>The global population size has been quantified for most sites, with the current population estimate of 469,760 breeding adults. This population size is smaller than the previously estimate, where the total population was only considered as under 1,000,000 individuals, but was based on non-quantified data. With quantified data, there is an increase of 18% in population size when historic and recent data are compared. However, this increase should be interpreted with caution as it is very likely to be related to improved population survey effort rather than an actual increase in population. For sites with current population estimates, 60% of the sites have an “unknown” trend due to data deficiency. Nevertheless, for the sites where data were available, 51% of sites were stable, 29% deteriorating and 20% improving.

Analysis of estimates from 334 localities across their global range indicates a reduction of more than 50% of the continental population in the past three generations (75 years) that is understood to be continuing and likely irreversible. The continental trend is not, however, spatially uniform; some subpopulations are increasing or stable while others are declining significantly faster than the continental rate. Many local subpopulations have been extirpated.<br/><br/>A generation length (GL) of 25 years is used; calculated in the standard format as the average age of mothers in the population (IUCN SPC 2019, p. 29). This figure is based on analysis of the life table of culled Savanna Elephant family groups in South Africa (Whyte 2001) and a 14-year study of Savanna Elephants in Kenya (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2013) which generated a range of 24.1–25 years.<br/><br/>Subcriterion A2 is applied because some of the major causes for population reduction, such as habitat loss due to human population expansion, have not ceased and are projected to increase in coming decades as well as unlikely to be reversible. The population reduction assessment for subcriterion A2 (considering three generations back) is inferred from published survey data using a modelling approach described in the Supplementary Information document. Density and distribution estimates for the African Savanna Elephant vary in methodology, completeness, regularity, date of first survey and confidence limits. Few credible estimates exist prior to the 1970s, and there is no credible estimate for the continental population more than two generations back. For this Red List assessment, an attempt was made to model the data three generations back to 1940 (see the attached Supplementary Information for description of data that is current as of and up to the end of 2015); however, given the sparseness of information available to inform the model, such modelling was of limited value. Therefore, rather than projecting declines well beyond the available data, we made the assumption that the continental African Savanna Elephant population of three generations back (1940) was equal to that of two generations back (i.e., 1965). Additional assumptions, necessary to fill gaps in the dataset, are detailed in the attached Supplementary Information document.<br/><br/>Subcriterion A3 has not been applied, because although the major threats to the species are known, projecting the level of such threats 25 or more years into the future (i.e., three generations, up to a maximum of 100 years) would likely introduce high levels of uncertainty.<br/><br/>An assessment of population reduction according to subcriterion A4 considering two generations back and one forward is in progress by this team of Assessors (Edwards <em>et al</em>. in prep.). Analysis of poaching and human influence in the recent past and anticipated in the future based upon available data of two representative indices (i.e., proportion of illegal killed elephants (PIKE) and the human footprint index) are being included as covariates in the projection.<br/><br/>Criteria B, C and D are not relevant to the threatened status as the species currently occupies more than 20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and there are more than 10,000 mature individuals. No quantitative analysis of the probability of extinction in the wild was conducted, and therefore criterion E does not apply.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Previous Assessments of African Elephant:<br/></strong>This is the first assessment of the African Savanna Elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) as a species separate from the African Forest Elephant (<em>L. cyclotis</em>).<br/><br/>The African Elephant, as a single species, was listed as Vulnerable (VU A2a) in the 2004 and 2008 updates of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, under the same IUCN Categories and Criteria used in this assessment (Version 3.1; IUCN 2001).<br/><br/>Previously the African Elephant, as a single species, was listed as Endangered (EN A1b) under the IUCN Categories and Criteria Version 2.3 (IUCN 1994), in an assessment conducted in 1996 by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group.</p>","<p>African Savanna Elephants are found over a wide latitudinal range between the northern tropics in Mali (16° North) to the southern temperate zone (34° South) in South Africa. They occupy a variety of habitats ranging from montane forest, miombo and mopane woodland, thicket, savanna and grasslands to arid deserts and a wide altitudinal range from mountain slopes to oceanic beaches.<br/><br/>See also the list of habitats.<br/><br/>African Savanna Elephants are capable of moving long distances and naturally do so in arid ecosystems and in response to climatic conditions (e.g., seasonality and drought). Depending on productivity, and water availability African Savanna Elephants demonstrate range residence, migratory, semi-migratory and near nomadic movement patterns in different regions of the continent. Home range sizes vary by several orders of magnitude primarily in relation to plant productivity and human activity in different ecosystems (Loarie <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wall <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thirty African Savanna Elephant subpopulations (eight of which number more than 1,000 individuals) span international boundaries, including the more than 200,000 elephants in the five-country Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017, KAZA Secretariat 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services:<br/></strong>Ecosystem services provided by African Savanna Elephants vary and depend to a large extent on the ecosystem (forest, savanna, grassland or desert), specific conditions on the ground and the geographical context under consideration. In general, they play an important ecological role as bulk processors of plant material (Owen-Smith 1989). In savannas, African Savanna Elephants are manipulators of woody vegetation structure which in turn influences the tree to grass ratio with knock-on consequences for the fire regime and potentially species composition in the area (Dublin <em>et al</em>. 1990, Augustine and McNaughton 2004, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2008, Holdo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, Goheen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Pringle <em>et al</em>. 2016). Where they are associated with wetlands African Savanna Elephants can be important in maintaining channels and open water ways. Soil fertility can be maintained by the transport of nutrients by large herbivores from nutrient rich sources (e.g., eutrophic soils in flood plains and termite mounds) to dystrophic soils (e.g., upland miombo woodlands) (Cumming <em>et al</em>. 1997, Doughty <em>et al</em>. 2016, Malhi <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p><br/>The charismatic nature of African Savanna Elephants plays an important role in attracting tourism into national parks. They also hold important symbolic significance within the cultures of many African communities. African Savanna Elephants are one of the few iconic species that occur in the majority of African countries, and innumerable stories, songs, and cultural traditions revolve around them.</p>","Poaching of African Savanna Elephants for ivory is a major cause of individual death and population decline (Wittemyer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). After a sustained period of intense poaching between the late 1970s and 1989, many African Savanna Elephant populations (e.g., in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda) experienced two to three decades of recovery. Some northern African Savanna Elephant populations, however, experienced persistent poaching pressure through the last three decades (Bouche <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012). Data collected as a part of the CITES Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants programme (MIKE), indicate that poaching significantly intensified across the continent starting in 2008 and peaking in 2011 – an unsustainably high level of poaching has continued into current times in some areas of the continent (CITES 2018, 2019), and may be increasing in some of the historically less-affected southern African populations (CITES 2018, 2019). Rapid land use change by humans is driving the direct loss and fragmentation of habitat for African Savanna Elephants and is an increasing threat to populations across their range (Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016, Mpakairi <em>et al</em>. 2019). Land conversion is a product of the ongoing expansion of the human population and associated agriculture and infrastructure development, which in turn are driven by economic and technological advances. A manifestation of this trend is the reported increase in human-elephant conflict (e.g., Pozo <em>et al</em>. 2018). Human population growth projections suggest land conversion will accelerate rapidly in the coming decades across Africa (see <a href=""http://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/"">https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/</a>) which will likely increase this threat.","<p>Over the past century, African Savanna Elephant subpopulations have declined across most of their range. The African Elephant Status Report 2016&#160;estimated a continental population of 415,428 (+/- 95% C.I. 20,111) for both African Savanna and African Forest Elephants combined and reported a continental decline of approximately 111,000 elephants since 2006 (Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). For a similar time period, following a survey of approximately 90% of their range, a decline of 30% of African Savanna Elephants was reported (Chase <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p><br/>For further information about this species, see the attached Supplementary Information document.</p><p><em></em></p>",Decreasing,"<p>African Savanna Elephants once occurred across all of Africa (Sikes 1971) and currently are found in 24 countries (see range map). Although knowledge of African Savanna Elephant distribution varies spatially and temporally, it is evident that the species’ distribution is retracting and becoming increasingly fragmented across their range in the continent. African Savanna Elephants occupy an estimated 15% of their historic pre- agricultural range (Chase <em>et al</em>. 2016). African Savanna Elephants are considered nationally extirpated in Burundi and Mauritania. In Eswatini, the once extirpated population has been re-established through reintroductions that began in the 1980s. Recent range expansion is evident in Kenya and Botswana (Douglas-Hamilton 1979; Said <em>et al</em>. 1995; Barnes <em>et al</em>. 1998; Blanc <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2007; Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The species' range map associated with this assessment is complete with the exception that some small private reserves in South Africa with less than 50 elephants each are absent as they were excluded from the African Elephant Database due to concerns about the census techniques.</p>","<strong>Ivory:</strong> Use of African Savanna Elephant ivory is entrenched in numerous cultures across the globe, primarily for ornamental and decorative items. Historically, demand for African Savanna Elephant ivory has been high in Europe, the USA and Asia. For example, beginning in the 1920s, Japanese carvers turned to African elephant ivory as Asian supplies diminished through the 1970s when Japan accounted for about 40% of the global ivory market (Martin 1986; Nishihara 2003, 2012).<br/><br/>In 1989, the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) banned the international commercial trade of ivory in response to a steep decline in African elephants across a substantial portion of their range. Thereafter, two CITES-sanctioned sales of national ivory stockpiles occurred in 2002 and 2008 with Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa selling ivory to China and Japan. At the same time, a nine-year moratorium (ending in 2017) on any new ivory sale proposals from the four African countries followed (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>). In the 2000s, Chinese demand for ivory greatly surpassed that of Japan where demand for ivory appeared to substantially decline (CITES 2014). As a consequence, prices rose steeply in China and in Africa (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Debates about the benefits and consequences of the sale of national ivory stockpiles are highly polarized with limited consensus (Stiles 2004, 't Sas-Rolfes <em>et al</em>. 2014, Bennett 2015, Biggs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Analysis of ivory seizure data indicates that the volume of illegally trafficked ivory has increased substantially since 2006 (Underwood <em>et al</em>. 2013; Milliken 2016; CITES 2018, 2019). Undercover investigations and DNA forensics point to the laundering of illegal ivory in legal domestic ivory markets. Seizure analyses indicate that the majority of illegally trafficked ivory is destined for Asia, especially China, Viet Nam and Thailand (CITES 2016, 2018 and 2019; Lui 2015; Krishnasamy 2016). In response to this and other concerns, China closed its legal domestic ivory market in 2017; Hong Kong SAR took steps to do the same by 2021 (<a href=""http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm"">https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm</a>), and Thailand tightened its domestic Asian Elephant ivory trade regulations in 2015 (<a href=""http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.htm"">http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.html</a>). A substantial drop in ivory prices in mainland China has been associated with this action (Vigne and Martin 2017, Meijer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Significant illegal ivory markets remain in several Southeast Asian countries, such as Lao PDR and Viet Nam (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>; Vigne and Martin 2017).<br/><strong><br/>Non-consumptive Tourism:&#160;</strong>African Savanna Elephants have significant tourism draw for wildlife watching and photographic tourism throughout their range substantially contributing to local economies (Naidoo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Tourism operations occur in national and local government protected areas, as well as on land under private or communal tenure.<br/><br/><strong>Trophy Hunting:</strong>&#160;In some range states sport hunting of African Savanna Elephants is legally permitted and forms an integral element of those countries’ wildlife management and community support programs (e.g., Naidoo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe have trophy hunting industries and in 2020 applied to CITES for a combined quota of 2,404 tusks <a href=""http://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php"">(https://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php</a> Accessed 16 August 2020). Depending on the governance and management structures, government bodies, private operations and local communities derive revenue from trophy hunting.<br/><br/><strong>Other Trade:</strong> A legal domestic trade in African Savanna Elephant hides is present in South Africa. There have been limited reports of African Savanna Elephant poaching for other body parts beyond ivory, such as meat, bone, skin and hair (Blignaut <em>et al</em>. 2008). International live trade in African Savanna Elephants occurs between South Africa and other countries, mainly in an effort to re-establish or fortify dwindling populations in some protected areas. Live trade in young African Savanna Elephants from Zimbabwe (Russo and Cruise 2016) and Eswatini (Madowo 2019) to Asia and elsewhere for zoological collections also occurs. Controversy surrounds these transactions as the conservation benefit to the species has been questioned. Domestic trade in African Savanna Elephants exists in South Africa at a low level for reintroduction purposes between reserves (Pretorius <em>et al</em>. 2018).",Terrestrial,"<p>The African Savanna Elephant was listed in CITES Appendix I in 1989 when all African elephants were considered a single species. Subsequently, the populations of Botswana (1997), Namibia (1997), South Africa (2000) and Zimbabwe (1997) were transferred to Appendix II, each with specific annotations. These annotations have been recently replaced by a single annotation for all four countries, with specific sub-annotations for the populations of Namibia and Zimbabwe. A separate CITES listing for each species has not occurred yet because a formal designation as two separate species (i.e.,&#160;<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>L. cyclotis</em>) is still in progress.<br/><br/>The African Elephant Action Plan (AEAP; developed and adopted by African elephant range countries) was adopted by CITES in March 2010 and is a statement by all range countries regarding the most important and immediate activities which require implementation and funding if Africa’s elephants are to be conserved. The African Elephant Fund was established to support the implementation of the African Elephant Action Plan. It should be noted that the AEAP does not distinguish different taxa of African elephant. The African Savanna Elephants which occur in transboundary populations introduce complications (e.g., matters of sovereignty) when considering national populations for CITES purposes (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>A number of CITES-initiated instruments were created to monitor and combat illegal trade in ivory. The CITES MIKE programme, which was established in 2002, has 66 designated sites across African elephant range and provides the most detailed and reliable data available on continental poaching pressure (CITES 2018, 2019); this includes 39 sites in 18 range countries of the African Savanna Elephant (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/prog/mike"">https://cites.org/eng/prog/mike</a>, Accessed 16 August 2020). Eswatini, South Sudan, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia do not have MIKE sites for their African Savanna Elephants. The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), established in 1996, is managed by TRAFFIC as a comprehensive information system for tracking illegal trade in ivory and other elephant products (CITES 2016, 2019). At a national level National Ivory Action Plans (NIAPs) are a tool designed to track significant and timely action to combat the illegal trade in ivory. Currently 24 African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries, as identified by ETIS analyses, are required to produce and implement a NIAP (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/niaps"">https://cites.org/eng/niaps</a>, Accessed 16 August 2020); 11 of these are range countries of the African Savanna Elephant.<br/><br/>At a national level the African Savanna Elephant is subject to varying degrees of legal protection in the 23 range states, with most countries granting the species the highest protection status. Providing this protection is complicated by the fact that over half of the species’ range may extend beyond the boundaries of protected areas (Taylor 2009). This point is emphasized by the evidence that the degree of protection is an important predictor of African Savanna Elephant’s presence and density (de Boer <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Conservation measures usually include habitat management and protection through policy, legislation and law enforcement. Successful anti-poaching and management at a site level has contributed to the re-establishment or recovery of a number of populations of African Savanna Elephants. In instances where protection efforts have failed, the African Savanna Elephant population was reduced by 70% or more in a matter of a decade (Chase <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the context where management culling was undertaken (mainly southern Africa) up until the late 1980s or early 1990s, culling has largely ceased and population density management is being attempted through actions such as translocation, contraception and range manipulation such as closure of artificial water point (Scholes and Mennell 2008). Fire management is being attempted in some transboundary situations to mitigate further habitat and/or woodland modification as a consequence of African Savanna Elephant activity (Starfield <em>et al</em>. 1993, Mapaure 2013, Eastment 2020).&#160;</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Analysis of estimates from 161 localities across the species range indicates a reduction of more than 80% of the continental population in the past three generations (93 years) that is understood to be continuing and likely irreversible. The continental trend is not, however, spatially uniform with some subpopulations increasing or stable while others are declining significantly faster than the continental rate. Many local subpopulations have been extirpated.<br/><br/>A generation length (GL) of 31 years is used; calculated in the standard format as the average age of mothers in the population (IUCN SPC 2019, p. 29). This figure is based on findings from demographic studies on GL for African Forest Elephants on the basis of a 23-year study in Central African Republic (Turkalo <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Subcriterion A2 is applied because some of the major causes for population reduction such as habitat loss due to human population expansion have not ceased, are projected to increase in coming decades and are unlikely to be reversible. The population reduction assessment for subcriterion A2 (considering three generations back) is inferred from published survey data. Density and distribution estimates for the African Forest Elephant across its continental range vary in methodology, completeness, regularity, date of first survey and certainty. Few credible site-specific estimates exist prior to the 1980s, and there is no available estimate for the species' population across its combined central and west African range. For this assessment, an attempt was made to model the data three generations back to 1922 (see Supplementary Information for description of data that is current as of and up to the end of 2015); however, given the sparseness of information available to inform the model, such modelling was not informative. Therefore, rather than projecting declines well beyond the extent of the survey data used in the assessment, we made the assumption that the continental population of three generations back (1922) is equal to that of one generation back (1984). Additional assumptions, necessary to fill gaps in the dataset, are detailed in the attached Supplementary Information document.<br/><br/>Subcriterion A3 has not been applied, because although the major threats to the species are known, projecting the level of such threats 31 to 93 years into the future (i.e., three generations, up to a maximum of 100 years) would likely introduce high levels of uncertainty.<br/><br/>An assessment of population reduction according to subcriterion A4 considering one to two generations back and one to two forward is in progress by this team of Assessors (Edwards <em>et al</em>. in prep.).

No quantitative analysis of the probability of extinction in the wild was conducted, and therefore criterion E does not apply.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Previous Assessments of African Elephant:<br/></strong>This is the first assessment of the African Forest Elephant (<em>Loxodonta cyclotis</em>) as a species separate from the African Savanna Elephant (<em>L. africana</em>).<br/><br/>The African Elephant, as a single species, was listed as Vulnerable (VU A2a) in the 2004 and 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, under the same IUCN Categories and Criteria used in this assessment (Version 3.1; IUCN 2001). In the 2008 Assessment, the Central African region, which consists mainly of Forest Elephant range plus Savanna Elephant range in Cameroon, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was considered Data Deficient.<br/><br/>In an assessment conducted in 1996 by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group, the African Elephant was listed as Endangered (EN A1b) under the IUCN Categories and Criteria Version 2.3 (IUCN 1994).</p>","<p>African Forest Elephants are found across the Guineao-Congolian tropical forests of west and central Africa stretching from remnant habitat in the northwest in Guinea and Sierra Leone (10 ° North, 12° West) to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (4° South, 29° East). They occupy a variety of forest habitats including lowland humid forest on terra firma, swamp forests, the lower reaches of Afro-montane forests, dry forests and forest-savanna mosaics. They have a wide altitudinal range from the littoral forests along the Atlantic coast to about 2,000 metres in the Albertine Rift.<br/><br/>African Forest Elephants are capable of moving long distances and may do so regularly, usually depending on fruiting events and a requirement for mineral salts. African Forest Elephants also demonstrate range residence and regular movement patterns with home ranges varying between less than 10 km<sup>2</sup> to more than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2008, Schuttler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Their movements are largely predicted by human pressure such as roads and villages rather than by vegetation type (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2008, Molina-Vacas <em>et al</em>. 2019). Fifteen African Forest Elephant subpopulations (seven of which number more than 1,000 individuals) span international boundaries, including more than 25,000 African Forest Elephants in the three-country TRIDOM landscape where a transfrontier management agreement is formalized between Cameroon, the Republic of Congo and Gabon (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017). Such management agreements also exist for the WAP complex in Burkina-Faso, Benin, and Niger, and for the Sangha Tri-National Landscape in Cameroon, Congo, and the Central African Republic.<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services:<br/></strong>Specific ecosystem services provided by both species of African elephants vary and depend to a large extent on the ecosystem (forest, savanna, grassland or desert) specific conditions on the ground and geographical context under consideration. In general, they play an important ecological role as bulk processors of plant material (Owen-Smith 1989). African Forest Elephants are highly frugivorous and are instrumental in dispersing many tree species (Blake 2009, Terborgh 2016). They are obligate seed dispersers for some tree species (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2009, Campos Arceiz and Blake 2011, Beaune <em>et al</em>. 2013) and particularly the seeds of large trees which tend to have high carbon content (Stephenson<em> et al</em>. 2014). The loss of the largest herbivores has repercussions on carbon storage in Amazonia (Doughty <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016) and the same may occur in Africa. African Forest Elephants create and maintain forest clearings in mineral-rich soil on which a wide variety of African forest fauna depend; they distribute the limited micronutrients available in “bais” to outlying areas (Turkalo and Fay 1995, 2001; Turkalo <em>et al</em>. 2013; Cromsigt <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>African Forest Elephants are an important symbol within the cultures of many African communities. African elephants (both species combined) are one of the few iconic animals that occur in the majority of African countries, and innumerable stories, songs, and cultural traditions revolve around them.</p>","Poaching for ivory is currently the principal cause of death of African Forest Elephants (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2014, Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016) with persistent poaching pressure at many sites evident from their first surveys in the 1970s to the present day (Douglas-Hamilton 1989, Barnes <em>et al</em>. 1993, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013). Data collected as a part of the CITES Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants programme (MIKE), indicate that poaching significantly intensified across the continent starting in 2008 and peaking in 2011 – an unsustainably high level of poaching has continued into current times (CITES 2018, 2019).<br/><br/>Rapid land use change, driving the direct loss and fragmentation of habitat, is an increasing threat to African elephants across their range. Land conversion is a product of the ongoing expansion of the human population and associated agriculture and infrastructure development, which in turn are driven by economic and technological advances. A specific manifestation of this trend is the reported increase in human-elephant conflict (e.g., Ngama <em>et al</em>. 2016). Human population growth projections suggest land conversion will accelerate rapidly in the coming decades across Africa (see <a href=""http://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/"">https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/</a>) which will likely increase this threat.","<p>Over the past century, African Forest Elephant populations have declined across most of their range. The African Elephant Status Report 2016 estimated a continental population of 415,428 (+/- 95% C.I. 20,111) for both African Savanna and African Forest Elephants combined and reported a continental decline of approximately 111,000 elephants since 2006 (Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). An assessment of African Forest Elephants in the central African range (representing approximately 95% of their present geographic range) estimated an overall decline of 62% between 2002 and 2011 with 72% of the remaining population being located in Gabon and the Republic of Congo (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>For further information about this species, see the attached Supplementary Information document.</p><p><em></em></p>",Decreasing,"<p>African Forest Elephants once occurred across the entire humid forest area of western and central Africa, and currently are found in 20 countries (see range map). Their range is decreasing and is highly fragmented in western Africa where seven range countries are reported to have fewer than a hundred African Forest Elephants each (this includes Senegal subject to genetic confirmation of its very small population as <em>Loxodonta cyclotis) </em>(Bouche <em>et al.</em> 2011, Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). Recent observations in Angola and South Sudan indicate African Forest Elephant presence though no population survey data is available. African Forest Elephants are considered nationally extirpated in the Gambia. The majority of the remaining population is found in six central African countries where they occupy an estimated 25% of their former range (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;</p>","<strong>Ivory:</strong>&#160;Use of African elephant ivory is entrenched in numerous cultures across the globe, primarily for ornamental and decorative items. Historically, demand for African elephant ivory has been high in Europe, the USA and Asia. For example, beginning in the 1920s, Japanese carvers turned to African elephant ivory as Asian supplies diminished through the 1970s when Japan accounted for about 40% of the global ivory market with a particular preference in Japan for African Forest Elephant ivory due to its hardness, suitable for hankos and the large plectrums for shamisen (Martin 1986; Nishihara 2003, 2012).<br/><br/>In 1989, the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) banned the international commercial trade of ivory in response to a steep decline in African elephants across a substantial portion of their range. Thereafter, two CITES-sanctioned sales of national ivory stockpiles occurred in 2002 and 2008 with Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa selling ivory to China and Japan. At the same time, a nine-year moratorium (ending in 2017) on any new ivory sale proposals from the four African countries followed (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>). In the 2000s, Chinese demand for ivory greatly surpassed that of Japan where demand for ivory appeared to substantially decline (CITES 2014). As a consequence, prices rose steeply in China and in Africa (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Debates about the benefits and consequences of the sale of national ivory stockpiles are highly polarized with limited consensus (Stiles 2004, 't Sas-Rolfes <em>et al</em>. 2014, Bennett 2015, Biggs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Analysis of ivory seizure data indicates illegally trafficked ivory has increased substantially since 2006 (Underwood <em>et al</em>. 2013; Milliken 2016; CITES 2018, 2019). Undercover investigations and DNA forensics point to the laundering of illegal ivory in legal domestic ivory markets and seizure analyses indicate that the majority of illegally trafficked ivory is destined for Asia, especially China, Viet Nam and Thailand (CITES 2016, 2018 and 2019; Lui 2015; Krishnasamy 2016). As a result of this and other concerns, China closed its legal domestic ivory market in 2017, Hong Kong SAR took steps to do the same by 2021 (<a href=""http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm"">https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm</a>), and Thailand tightened its domestic Asian elephant ivory trade regulations in 2015 (<a href=""http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.html"">http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.html</a>). A considerable drop in ivory prices in mainland China was associated with this action (Vigne and Martin 2017, Meijer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Significant illegal ivory markets remain in several Southeast Asian countries, such as Lao PDR and Viet Nam (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>; Vigne and Martin 2017).<br/><strong><br/>Non-consumptive Tourism:</strong>&#160;African Forest Elephants potentially have a significant tourism draw for wildlife watching and photographic tourism along with other iconic species that share their habitat such as western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees. National parks in Gabon, Republic of Congo and Benin among others, are actively developing tourism opportunities despite the species’ cryptic nature and often closed canopy habitat. Unlike the African savanna elephant, tourism does not contribute substantially to the conservation of African Forest Elephants in central Africa (Naidoo <em>et al</em>. 2016) and little documentation of its success in west Africa exists.<br/><strong><br/>Trophy Hunting:</strong>&#160;Trophy hunting for African Forest Elephant is rare; Cameroon is the only range country to submit trophy quotas (80 individuals annually) in recent decades but it has ceased to do so since 2019 <a href=""http://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php"">(https://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php</a>, Assessed 26 January 2019).<br/><strong><br/>Other Trade:</strong>&#160;There have been limited reports of African Forest Elephant poaching for body parts other than ivory, such as tails, bone, skin and hair (e.g.,&#160;<a href=""http://www.enca.com/africa/tusks-and-elephant-tails-seized-in-ivory-coast-ngo"">www.enca.com/africa/tusks-and-elephant-tails-seized-in-ivory-coast-ngo</a>). The bushmeat trade is thriving in parts of west and central Africa and likely includes a considerable volume of African Forest Elephant meat as indicated in hunter interviews (Stiles 2011, Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013). No live trade of African Forest Elephants is known to occur.",Terrestrial,"<p>The African Forest Elephant was listed in CITES Appendix I in 1989 when all African elephants were considered a single species. Subsequently, the populations of Botswana (1997), Namibia (1997), South Africa (2000) and Zimbabwe (1997) were transferred to Appendix II, each with specific annotations. These annotations have been recently replaced by a single annotation for all four countries, with specific sub-annotations for the populations of Namibia and Zimbabwe. A separate CITES listing for each species has not occurred yet because a formal designation as two separate species (i.e.,&#160;<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>L. cyclotis</em>) is still in progress.<br/><br/>The African Elephant Action Plan (developed and adopted by African elephant range countries) was adopted by CITES in March 2010 and is a sanctioned statement by all range countries regarding the most important and immediate activities which require implementation which require implementation and funding if Africa’s elephants are to be conserved. The African Elephant Fund was established to support the implementation of the African Elephant Action Plan. It should be noted that the AEAP does not distinguish different taxa of African elephant. The African Forest Elephants which occur in transboundary populations require that matters of sovereignty are considered when national populations are being presented for CITES purposes (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>A number of CITES-initiated instruments were created to monitor and combat illegal trade in ivory. The CITES MIKE programme was established in 2002, has 66 designated sites across the range of both African elephants; this includes 29 sites in 15 range countries of the African Forest Elephant (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/prog/mike"">https://cites.org/eng/prog/mike</a>, Accessed 21 July 2020). Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone and Nigeria do not have MIKE sites for their African Forest Elephant populations. The MIKE programme provides the most detailed and reliable data available on continental poaching pressure (CITES 2018, 2019). However, metrics used by the MIKE programme that depend on carcass finds are less statistically sensitive and reliable in the closed canopy forest habitat because detection of carcasses is difficult and decomposition in humid environments is relatively rapid. The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) established in 1996, is managed by TRAFFIC as a comprehensive information system for tracking illegal trade in ivory and other elephant products (CITES 2016, 2019). At a national level the implementation of National Ivory Action Plans (NIAPs) are a practical tool designed to track significant and timely action to combat the illegal trade in ivory. Currently 24 African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries, as identified by ETIS analyses, are required to produce and implement a NIAP (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/niaps"">https://cites.org/eng/niaps</a>, Accessed 21 July 2020); six of these are range countries of the African Forest Elephant.<br/><br/>At a national level African Forest Elephants are subject to varying degrees of legal protection in the 20 range states, with most granting them the highest possible protection status. However, up to 70% of the animals may live outside protected areas (Maisels <em>et al.</em> 2013) and are vulnerable to poaching, as the degree of protection (by anti-poaching agents) and road access are both important predictors of their density (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2008, Yackulic <em>et al</em>. 2011, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Conservation measures usually include habitat management and protection through legislation, policy and law enforcement. Successful anti-poaching and management has resulted in the maintenance of numbers of African Forest Elephants in some localities. In other instances where protection efforts have failed, African Forest Elephant numbers have been reduced by 70% or more in a decade (ANPN, WCS, and WWF 2013; Nzooh Dongmo <em>et al</em>. 2016; Poulsen<em> et al</em>. 2017).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Overall it is suspected to have undergone a very rapid decline of 63-89% over three generations owing to intentional and unintentional poisoning, habitat loss and conversion to agro-pastoral systems, declines in wild ungulate populations, hunting for trade and collisions. These declines are likely to continue into the future. For this reason it is listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p>","<em>Gyps africanus </em>is primarily a lowland species of open wooded savanna, particularly areas of <em>Acacia</em>. It requires tall trees for nesting, but has also been recorded nesting on electricity pylons in South Africa (de Swardt 2013). It is a gregarious species congregating at carcasses, in thermals and at roost sites. It nests in loose colonies. <p></p>","The species faces similar threats to other African vultures, being susceptible to habitat conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for trade, persecution and poisoning (see Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160; <br/><br/>In East Africa, the primary issue is poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide carbofuran), which occurs primarily   outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>species and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. rueppellii </span>puts them at significant risk, as this means they inevitably spend  considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010,   Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Kendall and  Virani 2012). Hunting with lead ammunition may also be incidentally contributing to species mortality (Naidoo <em>et al. </em>2017, Garbett <em>et al. </em>2018). Evidence from wing-tagging and telemetry  studies suggests that  annual mortality, primarily from incidental  poisoning, can be as high as  25% for the species&#160;(Kendall and Virani 2012). Cases across Africa suggest that the species may be subject to deliberate and accidental poisoning, respectively (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada<em> et al. </em>2016b): in the former case for belief-based use and to prevent birds from drawing attention to poaching activities. Mass poisoning events include at least 144 White-backed Vultures killed after feeding on an elephant carcass in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012 (Groom <em>et al</em>. 2013); 76 died after feeding on 6 poisoned lion carcasses near Ruaha National Park, Tanzania in March 2018 (SSC<em>&#160;</em>2018); 468 died after feeding on 3 elephant carcasses in Botswana in June 2019 (BirdGuides 2019). Modelling has shown that even one poisoned elephant carcass can have a dramatic impact on a population (Murn and Botha 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007), and the decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria has been attributed to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P. Hall&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2011). The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa, with an estimated 924-1,386 individuals traded over a six year period in West Africa, probably representing a significant proportion of the species's regional population (Buij&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). In South Africa, White-backed Vulture is one of the preferred vulture species in trade, according to a survey of traditional healers and traders (McKean&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). As a result of this and environmental pressures, it is predicted that the population in Zululand could become locally extinct in 26 years, unless harvest rates have been underestimated, in which case local extinction could be 10-11 years away (McKean and Botha 2007)<strong></strong>.&#160; There is also evidence that it is captured for international trade; for example in 2005, 13 individuals of this species being kept illegally in Italy were reportedly confiscated (F. Genero<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to&#160;<em>Gyps&#160;</em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. It was also reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2007)<strong></strong>&#160;and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. However, given that livestock carrion is not generally left out for scavenger consumption, this is likely to have less of an impact than it has in south-east Asia (C. Kendall&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/>Electrocution on powerlines is also a problem in parts of its range, and it is vulnerable to nest harvesting or disturbance by humans (Bamford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009); perhaps more so than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. rueppellii</span>, as it breeds in trees rather than on inaccessible cliffs (C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Additionally, the wild ungulate populations on which this species relies have declined precipitously throughout West and East Africa, even in protected areas (Western&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009, Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), and, despite increased livestock numbers, improved animal husbandry and carcass disposal has reduced the number of livestock carcasses available (Mundy <em>et al. </em>1992). There is also a minor threat from road traffic, with individuals occasionally killed by vehicles (BirdLife Botswana 2008). Reported threats in the Athi-Kaputiei area in Kenya (an important breeding site for the species) include wind energy development, illegal logging of large trees (although Kendall <em>et al. </em>[2017] concluded that tree availability was not a limiting factor for vultures breeding in Masai Mara National Reserve), and natural gas exploration (Shema 2019).&#160;<p></p>","The species's global population was estimated at 270,000 individuals in 1992 (Mundy <em>et al. </em>1992), but it may now be more than an order of magnitude lower than this due to rapid population declines in recent years (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). The median estimate of the rate of decline, 4.1% annually (2.5-5.4%) (Ogada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016a), is equivalent to a three generation reduction of 81% (63-89%).",Decreasing,"This species is the most widespread and common vulture in Africa, although it is now undergoing rapid declines. It occurs from <strong>Senegal, Gambia</strong> and <strong>Mali</strong> in the west, throughout the Sahel region to <strong>Ethiopia</strong> and <strong>Somalia</strong> in the east, through East Africa into <strong>Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia</strong> and <strong>South Africa</strong> in the south. Its global population has been estimated at 270,000 individuals. Consistent with other vulture species, it has declined by over 90% in West Africa (<strong></strong>J. M.

The species occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range, and ongoing monitoring efforts are underway in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Namibia, Ethiopia, and Botswana with plans to extend these to Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (BirdLife Botswana 2008, C.

Bowden&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2008, Woodford&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2008). A press release was also circulated in July 2007 to raise awareness of the impacts of hunting for medicinal and cultural reasons in southern Africa (McKean and Botha 2007), while&#160;BirdLife Botswana have launched a campaign to tackle illegal poisoning (Anon. 2013). At the 2014 Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Migratory Species, a set of guidelines to address poisoning was formally adopted (Ogada <em>et al</em>. 2016a). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are  currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning  teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to respond  to a neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Since 2015, more than 1,500 rangers, veterinarians, police and other law enforcement and conservation staff have been trained in poisoning response and intervention in 10 countries, and initial results suggest that this can reduce vulture mortality by up to 30% (SSC<em>&#160;</em>2018).<br/><br/>The species is listed as nationally Critically Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Allan<em> </em>2015), and Endangered in Uganda and Namibia (Brown and Simmons 2015, WCS 2016).<br/><strong></strong><br/><br/><strong>Conservation&#160;</strong><strong>and Research&#160;</strong><strong>Actions Proposed<br/></strong>As part of the Multi-species Action Plan for African-Eurasian Vultures, over 120 key actions were put forward (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). Of these, 117 are considered relevant to African species. Full details for these can be found in Table 6 of Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017), but those actions considered 'Essential' by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) are presented here.<br/><br/>The two objectives with the most essential actions are to address knowledge gaps, and to reduce vulture unintentional mortality caused by the hunting of vertebrates. Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) say that the essential actions when trying to address knowledge gaps are to monitor the population sizes, distributions and trends; conduct a study to put a value on the ecosystem services and eco-tourism benefits vultures provide; and develop criteria for Vulture Safe Zones and implement these throughout the range states of the MsAP. To address the objective to reduce unintentional vulture mortality, Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) suggest an overall analysis of poisoning's role in human-wildlife conflict, focusing on vultures; further awareness campaigns; training of staff to rapidly respond to poisoning incidents; and review and enforce penalties for wildlife poisoning, and if necessary introduce new penalties.<br/><br/>Further objectives also look into combating vulture mortality due to a range of factors. To combat the threat from NSAIDs, the essential actions proposed by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) are to prohibit the use of vulture-toxic NSAIDs in livestock and substitute them for vulture-friendly alternatives; and develop and implement a formal process to identify whether veterinary NSAIDs are toxic prior to them going on the market. For the threat from lead poisoning, the essential action proposed by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) is to implement CMS Resolution 11.15 as well as encouraging the voluntary uptake of lead ammunition bans in countries not part of CMS. In order to combat the threats from illegal trade and sentinel poisoning awareness and engagement programmes with stakeholders and training of rapid response units, respectively, have been proposed as essential actions (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017; Murn and Botha 2018). There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies (Craig <em>et al. </em>2018). The threats from infrastructure (collisions and electrocution) have similar essential actions, which are to conduct sensitivity mapping exercises to identify key regions; and promoting CMS guidelines to reduce mortality due to these threats (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>Finally, Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) recommend as an essential action the establishment of a framework to effectively implement the MsAP, including both global and regional coordination units, which may be key to implementing not only these other essential actions, but as many of the other high and medium priority actions laid out in the action plan.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It is suspected that it will decline at a rate of 20-30% over three generations in the future as significant threats are ongoing, and some (such as climate change) are predicted to worsen. It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable.   <p></p>","It breeds on sea coasts and inland near larger rivers (mostly on lower stretches) or lakes, where there are stands of mature trees. In the Magadan district of Russia, successful breeding pairs along coasts appear to produce more fledged chicks than successful pairs on rivers, and average brood size is larger for coastal pairs (Potapov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, 2012). Annual net chick production showed an increase in constantly monitored coastal sites, but a decrease in river sites (Potapov <em>et al.</em> 2012). &#160;During the autumn birds forage along rivers where dead salmon are abundant. During mid-winter, birds in Russia tend to remain on the coast, except some that winter in Kamchatka along inland rivers fed by hot springs and at Lake Kurilskoye (M.

Industrial pollution of rivers and high levels of DDT/DDE, PCBs and heavy metals are further threats (Iwata <em>et al. </em>2000; Kim <em>et al. </em>1999). Over-fishing has caused a decline of fish stocks in Russia and Japan which has led to an increasing tendency of birds on Hokkaido to move inland and scavenge on sika deer carcasses left by hunters, exposing them to a risk of lead poisoning through ingestion of lead shot (Ferguson-Lees &amp; Christie 2001). Despite laws being introduced in Japan in 2004 prohibiting the use of lead ammunition for hunting large animals, and further laws in 2014 prohibiting possession of lead ammunition, lead poisoning continues to be a significant threat (Ishii <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160; On Sakhalin Island, the most significant threat to breeding success is nestling predation by brown bears, while other threats include adverse weather (which may form ecological traps on migration routes), food shortages due to overfishing, habitat alteration, disturbance at nest sites, and infection by the blood parasite haemosporida (Romanov and&#160;Masterov 2020). Shooting may also be a local threat in parts of the wintering range (GRIN 2021). Declines in reproductive output along the coastline and rivers of the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk are predominantly caused by&#160;increasing frequency and intensity of spring floods, which impede successful hunting and therefore reduce breeding output, and reduced ice cover in spring (Potapov&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;<p></p>","M.

Monitor population trends through regular surveys. Minimise the damaging effects of industrial development in its Russian breeding grounds. In some wintering areas, consider establishing special artificial feeding-sites. Ensure regular sampling of the environment and the species for DDT/DDE, PCBs and other pollutants in Khabarovsk and Magadan, and for lead in Japan. Enforce laws prohibiting the use or possession of lead ammunition, and increase availability of affordable, non-toxic alternatives (Ishii <em>et al. </em>2017). Protect important salmon spawning grounds. Encourage sustainable management of key fish stocks. Preserve potential nest trees in river valleys within 30 km of the sea (M. McGrady <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Establish no disturbance zones in estuaries where conflicts exist between fishers and eagles (M. McGrady <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).

This species is therefore listed as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>","This species inhabits open, arid and sparsely vegetated steppe and semi-desert (Launay <em>et al.</em> 1997, Osborne <em>et al.</em> 1997, Mian 2003, Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003). It favours scattered shrubby vegetation, typically comprising xerophytic or halophytic plants (Collar 1996). Those wintering in Iran have been shown to prefer more densely vegetated bush-steppe to sparser shrub-steppe; however, within those bush-steppe habitats they favour areas with reduced vegetation cover (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Bush-steppe is thought to contain a higher abundance of food sources such as<em> Salsola</em> spp. and arthropods (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). Birds wintering in Iran also routinely visit neighbouring farmland where alfalfa and salad rocket is grown, but avoid pistachio crops (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Although dense vegetation may provide a sanctuary from danger, as well as thermal protection when overnight temperatures drop in winter (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al.</em> 2010), more open, unvegetated areas are often favoured as night-time roosts in order to minimise the risk of ambush by nocturnal predators (Combreau and Smith 1997). On the breeding grounds, nesting females may also favour sites away from vegetation patches, which could provide cover for predators (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2012). Abundance of breeding males has been found to be higher in flat areas with shorter shrub vegetation which is likely to be more suitable for displaying (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<br/><p>The species feeds throughout the day, but is most active at dawn and dusk (Combreau and Launay 1996). It has an eclectic diet, mainly comprising plants and invertebrates (especially ants Formicidae and beetles Tenebrionidae: Tigar and Osborne 2000), but also including vertebrates such as rodents, lizards, small snakes and even young birds (Collar 1996, Tourenq <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/></p><p>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1996). Males play no part in rearing the young, and a brood may contain young sired by several different individuals (Lesobre <em>et al</em>. 2010). Females create a shallow scrape in the ground in which they typically lay 3-4 eggs, and occasionally up to six eggs in long-distance migrants (Collar 1996, Combreau <em>et al</em>. 2002). The incubation period is typically 24 days, whilst fledging takes around 35 days.<br/></p><p></p>","The principal threat is from hunting (primarily using falconry), largely but not exclusively on the species's wintering grounds (Judas <em>et al. </em>2009). Large numbers are also trapped, mainly in Pakistan and Iran, and shipped to Arabia for use in the training of falcons (Combreau 2007); hunting and trapping are responsible for more than 50% of mortality in Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;In 2014 an illegal shipment of 240 birds was intercepted en route from Pakistan to Bahrain (Shafaeipour <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Arab countries, the meat of this species is considered an aphrodisiac, attracting hunters of high status (Nabi <em>et al., </em>2019); in 2017-2019, permits for hunting of the Asian Houbara were given by Pakistan to royal Arabs, and unregulated hunting seems to be continuing. Eggs are also collected during the breeding season (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021). In recent years the species has been heavily hunted in Iraq, as the country has opened up to visits by hunters from other countries (R. Porter&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>In parts of the region, fast-paced development related to the growth of the petroleum industry has reduced the availability of undisturbed habitats and further exacerbated the species's decline. Oil exploration, road building, oil and water pipelines, mining and quarrying activities, powerlines and the general disturbance caused by four-wheel drive vehicles have all been identified as significant auxiliary threats.  Powerlines in particular may be a significant threat (M. Koshkin <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Preliminary data from Uzbekistan suggests that powerlines may contribute to species mortality (Burnside <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Livestock grazing is reported to have a negative impact on the species, both indirectly, by degrading the desert vegetation on which birds rely for food and concealment, and directly, through the trampling of nests and disturbance of nesting females (Lavee 1988). Recent research on the effects of pastoralism on this species in the Kyzylkum Desert in Uzbekistan, however, has found that low intensity livestock grazing may not widely degrade rangelands at a landscape scale (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has no effect on male abundance and female nesting success (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a,b). In Iran, loss of habitat to croplands, mainly through the planting of pistachio, has been judged to be a significant threat (Mansoori 2006); however, it has also been found that the species exploits other crops such as alfalfa and salad rocket (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Yousefi (2017) reported a high degree of dependence on habitats in the vicinity of croplands, with habitats more than 6 km away losing their suitability. In Saudi Arabia, eggs and nests are predated by a range of mammalian predators (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<p></p>Habitat modelling and climate projections predict an increase in suitable habitat in the future, including shifts in geographic distribution of suitable habitat (Yousefi <em>et al., </em>2017); however, the probability of chick survival may decrease in areas with relatively higher temperatures (Koshkin <em>et al., </em>2016), and higher mortality has been reported from Iran in harsh wintering conditions (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).<br/><br/>The primary conservation approach for this species has been captive-breeding and release, however this may be unsustainable and detrimental to wild populations. Over reliance on supplementation of wild populations with captive-bred individuals risks domestication and replacement, rather than conservation reinforcement, with the potential of release of less-fit individuals causing a long-term reduction in the size, genetic diversity and viability of wild populations (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018). With the current extent of unregulated harvest, one model reports that wild populations would require releasing over 3000 captive-bred females a year, more than the initial wild stock, to attain population stabilisation (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018).&#160;Releasing captive-bred stock may also create the allusion that mitigation measures are successful, which can lead to increased hunting pressure.","The population was last estimated to be between 78,960 and 97,000 individuals globally (O. Combreau&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2014, BirdLife International 2014), and stated as poorly known in 2016 (BirdLife International). Studies since have primarily focused on nest site selection and reintroduced populations; available data on breeding parameters of wild populations are insufficient (Azar&#160;<em>et al.,&#160;</em>2018). Accurately establishing the global population is extremely challenging. The population is expected to fall within the population band for 50,000-99,999 individuals, which is assumed to equate to c.33,000-67,000 mature individuals. The breeding population in Kazakhstan has been estimated at c.49,000 individuals (Riou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;extends from <strong>Egypt</strong> east of the Nile, through <strong>Israel</strong>, <strong>Palestine</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, <strong>Yemen</strong>, <strong>Oman</strong>, <strong>U.A.E.</strong>, <strong>Bahrain</strong>, <strong>Qatar</strong>, <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Kuwait</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>, <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>, <strong>Tajikistan</strong>, <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> and <strong>Mongolia</strong> to<strong> China</strong>.

The species is considered Critically Endangered on the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015). Studies have been conducted into the status, ecology and migration of the species in various parts of its range, most notably Kazakhstan (Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2002, Tourenq <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt</em><em>.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004, Riou <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Uzbekistan (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016a,b). Through its network of breeding facilities in the U.A.E., Morocco and Kazakhstan, the International Fund for Houbara Conservation (IFHC) has a long-term goal to produce 35,000 Asian Houbaras each year for reintroduction into the wild (IFHC 2014). The first releases were made in Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in central Saudi Arabia in 1991. This population is currently estimated to number 250–300 individuals. Further releases have taken place elsewhere in Saudi  Arabia (including at Saja Umm ar Rimth with c.50 individuals [M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016]) and also in U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Yemen, Jordan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. By the end of 2016, 13,504 houbara had been released into the UAE (Azar <em>et al., </em>2018). It is not yet clear what impact the releases of captive-reared birds have on the demographics and genetic integrity of the overall population,&#160;however according to Burnside <em>et al.</em> (2016), in order to compensate for the loss of wild adults to hunting, the number of released birds may need to be as much as 10 times higher than hunting quotas. At least three birds have been satellite tracked from Saudi Arabia to the breeding grounds in Kazakhstan (Zafar-ul Islam <em>et al</em>. 2014). The CMS Asian Houbara Agreement (2005) urges all range countries to take necessary measures to prevent the extinction of any population of Houbara and maintain a favourable status.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The most urgently needed conservation measures are those that will reduce exploitation to a biologically sustainable level. This will require precautionary and scientifically determined limits on the number of birds that can be harvested legally and stricter enforcement of bans on illegal forms of trade and hunting; it also requires in-depth studies of natural productivity in Asian Houbaras in relation to habitat selection and predator abundance. Carry out further surveys to gain an improved estimate of the overall population size and trend; continue research to determine the migration routes, schedules and strategies of all populations. Survey the species throughout the wintering range (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Produce a range-wide action and recovery plan, based on agreement under the Convention on Migratory Species; the CMS Asian Houbara Agreement has been drafted but has not been opened for signature. Develop and implement national and regional species action plans (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Create managed protected areas and review current protected areas. For example, approximately 85% of suitable habitat are outside the existing protected area network of Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;Where they can be shown to be detrimental, reduce grazing and other farming pressures (Goriup 1997, Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004). Establish long-term, range-wide population monitoring studies. Study the overall demographic and genetic consequences of releasing captive-reared birds. Engage local communities in the protection of houbara through education, such as is provided by the IFHC, and through entrepreneurship developments like ecotourism (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;<br/><p></p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In parts of Fennoscandia, intensive hunting of grouse (Tucker and Heath 1994), such as Ptarmigan (<em>Lagopus mutus</em>) and Willow Grouse (<em>Lagopus lagopus</em>) may affect numbers of this species. In the past, Arctic Fox (<em>Vulpes lagopus</em>) trapping was the main threat in Russia (Potapov 2011). Disturbance of nests through tourism is also a problem (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species is also threatened by climate change (Booms&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). It was not affected by organochlorines in the 1960s and 1970s (White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013), however it was found to contain very high levels of organochlorines which probably derive from marine prey (Ólafsdóttir <em>et al</em>. 2001). In Russia, disturbance caused by oil pipeline installation may pose a threat in some regions, however in others abandoned oil extraction rigs provide new nesting sites and may therefore be beneficial (Potapov 2011). Development of the oil industry also facilitates development of roads, which make it easier for illegal bird trappers to access nests (Potapov 2011).","Partners in Flight (2020) estimate the population in Canada and the USA to be c.42,000 mature individuals, and the global population to be c.83,000 mature individuals.
