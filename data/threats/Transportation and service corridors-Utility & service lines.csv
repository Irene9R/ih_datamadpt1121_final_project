It has also been found in creeks surrounded by secondary forest and shade coffee plantations (Infante-Rivero <em>et al</em>. 2009). It exhibits direct development, and female parental care. During mating, the eggs adhere to the female's back and are carried by her until hatching, when the froglets emerge and disperse to begin their independent life. Females carrying 16–45 eggs, and froglets, have been observed during both dry and rainy seasons (Infante-Rivero <em>et al</em>. 2009, Granado 2010) from which it is inferred that breeding occurs during several months of the year. Although this species is markedly associated to streams, the finding of a specimen within a forest without nearby creeks (Infante-Rivero <em>et al</em>. 2009) suggests that it is capable of dispersing overland between creeks.</p>","<p>  </p><p>Six of the seven known localities for this species are near small human settlements.

During the last decades forests are increasingly being converted into cocoyam plantations (<em>Xanthosoma sagittifolium</em>) in the upper basin of Socuy River (northern limit of its distribution) and the foothills of Cerro Las Antenas. Cocoyam crops, in addition to promoting forest clearing, cause abstraction of water from the creeks where this species inhabits. Although the creeks and the evergreen forests at Cerro Las Antenas are still well preserved, this is an unprotected area, and potentially vulnerable due to the expansion of agriculture and urban frontiers (Rojas-Runjaic and Infante-Rivero 2018). The localities of Toromo and Manastara, both in the Río Negro river basin, despite being within the limits of a protected area (Sierra de Perijá National Park) are currently being modified by small-scale agriculture (corn, bananas, and some citrus) and small-scale goat and cow grazing. Furthermore, an increase in the frequency and intensity of fires during the dry season affects the submontane and montane forests of the Río Negro basin.</p><p></p>","<p>It is a common and very abundant species in fast-flowing streams within its range (Infante-Rivero <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rojas-Runjaic and Infante-Rivero 2018).

Rojas-Runjaic and Infante-Rivero (2018) registered 93 and 60 specimens, respectively, in two different creeks also in Cerro Las Antenas. Infante-Rivero <em>et al</em>.

If it is still  extant in its natural range in the Río Tafí basin, in the northern Argentinean Andes, it seems plausible that the population contains fewer than 50 mature  individuals.","It is a wholly aquatic, stream-breeding species of mountain streams within bog land areas (Lavilla and Barrionuevo 2005); at higher elevations, the surrounding vegetation is grassland, while the vegetation in lowland areas includes some trees (<em>Alnus</em> spp.). The species is not present in any modified habitats. Its clutch size has been documented to vary between 80 and 500 eggs (Pisanó 1955 in Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008), and available data suggest that this species breeds throughout the year (Montero and Pisanó 1990 in Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008).","In this species' previous (2004) assessment, listed threats included predation by introduced exotic fishes (trout), urbanization and the drainage of bogs, alterations of watercourses (through measures such as canalization), degradation of bog habitat by four-wheel drive vehicles, potato cultivation close to the stream edges (increasing sedimentation), overgrazing, construction of roads across the streams, plantation of exotic tree species (pines, with subsequent sedimentation during harvesting), and construction of power-lines in the gorges and within the streams (also resulting in stream sedimentation), with water pollution through mining activities and chytridiomycosis listed as potential future threats.&#160;Chytridiomycosis has been recorded in another species in the genus (<em>T. pisanoi</em>)&#160;<em>ca</em>&#160;60 km airline distance from&#160;the valley of Tafí&#160;(Barrionuevo 2012).<br/><br/>More recently, Barrionuevo and Ponssa (2008) found that one tadpole collected in 1984 had a mouthpart abnormality, which could be linked to chytrid fungus. These authors suggest that a complex synergistic effect of an abnormally dry and warm period between 1988 and 1993, the presence of <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> in the area, and increased frequency of debris flows may have caused the extinction of this species (Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008).","This species was considered to be abundant in the past, to such an extent that it was used as a study organism for research between the 1940s and 1980s (Lavilla and Barrionuevo 2005, Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008).&#160;It was last recorded in 1993, and exhaustive surveys conducted in 2001–2005 in suitable habitats and historical and new localities failed to record any individuals (Barrionuevo and Ponssa 2008).

3150871,97246272,Gopherus agassizii,Critically Endangered,A2abce+4abce,2021,2020-10-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"A provisional Red List Assessment of the widespread Desert Tortoise,&#160;<em>Gopherus agassizii</em> (<em>sensu lato</em>), was performed at a Desert Tortoise Council workshop in 2010 and updated by the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group (TFTSG) in 2011, at which time the Mojave Desert subpopulation, now considered&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu stricto</em>) following taxonomic analysis and splitting into three separate species (<em>G. agassizii, G. morafkai, </em>and<em> G. evgoodei</em>), was assessed as Critically Endangered A2bce+A4bce based on population reduction (decreasing density), habit loss of over 80% over three generations (90 years), including past reductions and predicted future declines, as well as the effects of disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis). <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> (<em>sensu stricto</em>) comprises tortoises in the most well-studied 30% of the larger range; this portion of the original range has seen the most human impacts and is where the largest past population losses had been documented.&#160;A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of <em>G. agassizii</em> (<em>sensu stricto</em>) has demonstrated continued adult population and density declines of about 90% over three generations (two in the past and one ongoing) in four of the five <em>G. agassizii</em> recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units. As such, we reaffirm the prior assessment of the taxonomically restricted Mojave Desert Tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, as Critically Endangered, and add criterion “a” for direct population observations: CR A2abce+A4abce. The previously defined widespread species&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu lato</em>)&#160;was last assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1996; a separate assessment currently in progress by the TFTSG for the Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai </em>(previously considered part of <em>G. agassizii</em>)&#160;has provisionally assessed that species as Vulnerable.","The life history of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is typical of long-lived chelonians and has been reviewed by Berry and Murphy (2019). Tortoises require 17–20 years to reach sexual maturity at a straight-line carapace length (CL) of 18 cm or more (Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, Medica <em>et al</em>. 2012). Variation in years is dependent on desert region, frequency of droughts, and quality of available forage. In the northern part of the geographic range, females smaller than 20.9 cm were not reproducing (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998).&#160; Maximum lifespan was estimated by Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) at 75 years, but few live beyond 50 yrs in the wild (Germano 1992). Generation time was estimated to be 20–32 years (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, USFWS 1994). Based on data from three desert regions, mean sizes of females ranges from 21.4 to 23.1 cm, whereas the mean sizes of males ranged from 24.3 to 24.9 cm; the largest desert tortoises on record, a male, reached 38.1 cm carapace length (Stebbins 2003), whereas a female was 37.4 cm, but these animals were exceptions (Berry and Murphy 2019).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Mature females may lay clutches of one to 10 eggs in up to three clutches per year in spring and early summer; in some years, some females do not lay eggs (Rostal <em>et al</em>. 1994, Henen 1997, Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wallis <em>et al</em>. 1999, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2015). Annual fecundity ranges from 0 to 16 eggs (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2015). Several factors may affect egg production: site, year, size of female, size and number of eggs, and available water and protein from precipitation and forage in the year preceding egg laying, as well as the year eggs are laid (Henen 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Incubation times for eggs range from 67 to 104 days (Burge 1977, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hatching success varies and appears to depend on year, location of the nest, and whether it is the first or second clutch. Eggs may be infertile or broken during laying (e.g., 12%; Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). Many nests are destroyed by predators before hatching and the loss of eggs (and nests) varies by year (Turner et al. 1987); they estimated an average loss of 37.1% of nests in a multi-year study. Hatching success in intact nests, undisturbed by predators, has been shown to vary from 73 to 100% (McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Rostal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bjurlin and Bissonette 2004, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises inhabit desert scrub habitats, including saltbush, creosote bush, Joshua Trees and Mojave yuccas, and microphyll woodlands with ironwood, palo verde, desert willow, and smoke trees (Berry and Murphy 2019). In the northeastern part of their geographic range, they occur in an ecotone between the Mojave and Great Basin deserts with sand sagebrush and junipers. Actual occurrences tend to be in valleys, alluvial fans, bajadas, and ephemeral stream channels, although tortoises can be found in low sand dunes and on steep slopes of mesas and cliffs (Berry and Murphy 2019).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises are herbivorous and selective in their choice of plant species (Jennings 1993, Oftedal 2002, Oftedal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jennings and Berry 2015). They primarily eat forbs when available. In years of abundant precipitation, they are selective feeders and prefer specific species of annuals and herbaceous perennials in the legume, mallow, borage, aster, four o’clock, and cactus families (as well as other families). Although they eat grasses, a diet solely of grasses is deficient in nutrients and is likely to inhibit growth and survival, especially in neonate, juveniles, and immature tortoises (Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The quality and quantity of preferred plant foods has diminished because of continuing invasion of non-native annual grasses and forbs and increased fire associated with the highly combustible&#160;non-native grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).&#160;<br/><br/>Annual survival and mortality of adults is dependent on sex, size of the tortoise, frequency and severity of droughts, numbers and types of anthropogenic uses, location, and decade of study. In a multi-year study in the eastern Mojave Desert, annual survivorship of juveniles increased with size, ranging from 0.767 when &lt;6.0 cm to 0.861 when 6.0 to 17.9 cm (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). When tortoises reach breeding age at an estimated 18.0 cm, survival rates were 0.87 to 0.944. Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported an annual survival of 0.883 for adults at Joshua Tree National Park. In a study in the Colorado Desert, Agha <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated adult survival at a wind-turbine energy site (0.96) and an adjacent area (0.92). At two sites in the eastern Mojave Desert, Longshore <em>et al</em>. (2003) reported annual survival of adults of 0.985 and 0.829, with the lower survival rate at a site affected by drought.<br/><br/>Woodbury and Hardy (1948) estimated that 1% of adults died per year in a population mostly comprised of adults. In the northeastern Mojave Desert, Turner <em>et al</em>. (1984) reported mortality rates of 18.4% in a year of drought and 4.4% in a normal year. In the western Mojave Desert, death rates were lowest at a protected Research Natural Area (2.8%/yr) and highest in critical habitat (20.4%/yr). At Joshua Tree National Park, the mortality rate was 11.7% (Freilich <em>et al.</em> 2000), and in Red Rock State Park, 67% (Berry et al. 2008). In a demographic study of tortoises at 21 sites in the central Mojave Desert, mortality rates of adults ranged from 1.9 to 95.2% (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) predicted an annual rate of population increase of <em>ca</em>. 2% in a model based on a tortoise subpopulation in the eastern Mojave Desert between 1977 and 1985. By 2000, this subpopulation had declined precipitously, apparently due to disease (see Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2002) estimated the recruitment rate of young tortoises into the adult subpopulation at 0.092 in a plot in Joshua Tree National Park. This number of tortoises on this plot was thought to be stable between 1991 and 1995, but later declined (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>Gopherus agassizii</em>&#160;faces&#160;multiple threats to individuals, populations, and habitat (for annotated bibliographies of reports and published papers, see Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980; Berry 1984; USFWS 1990, 1994, 2010, 2011; Grover and DeFalco 1995; Bury and Luckenbach 2002; von Senckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002; Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2011; Lovich and Ennen 2013a; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015; Berry and Murphy 2019). Recent articles document further examples of threats (Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b,c). Much of the information with numerous references are contained in Berry and Murphy (2019). Substantial tortoise habitat was already lost to cities, towns, settlements, agriculture, energy developments, and military bases in the 20th century, and continuing habitat loss and degradation, combined with high mortality rates in dwindling low-density populations due to disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis), road and off-road vehicle-induced mortality, subsidized predators (e.g., ravens), poaching for pets, and mortality from increasing droughts associated with climate change, are threatening most remaining populations of Desert Tortoises (summarized in Berry and Murphy 2019). The majority of desert tortoise populations are currently considered non-viable because of the low density of adults and their existence in isolated and fragmented pieces of habitat (Berry 1984, USFWS 2010, Allison and McLuckie 2018, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).&#160;<br/><br/>Many threats are cumulative in nature and interact synergistically with others. By rating them separately in the Standard Threats Classification Scheme below, the severity of threats and their negative impacts are not described in full measure. One of the limitations of the classification scheme for threats are the ratings for severity. Severity is associated with declines (or not) by percent over 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer. For species such as desert tortoises with long generation times (<em>ca</em>. 20–30 years), this may be 60 to 90 or more years. Here we provide a detailed and expanded Threats Classification Scheme for <em>G. agassizii</em>.<br/><br/><strong>Detailed Threats Classification Scheme<br/><br/></strong>Classification Level<br/><br/>&#160; a. Examples<br/>&#160; b. Timing and Scope<br/><br/>1.1 Housing &amp; urban areas, towns, settlements, ranches<br/>&#160; a. Desert cities, towns, settlements, scattered homes in rural areas, desert land entry, e.g., Inyokern, Ridgecrest, Red Mountain, Trona, Boron, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, Lucerne Valley, Ft. Irwin, Barstow, Daggett, Mountain Pass, Joshua Tree, Twentynine Palms, Vidal Junction, Ludlow, Amboy, Needles, Las Vegas, St. George, Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, Parker, Blythe, El Centro,&#160;Stateline, Las Vegas, Mesquite, St. George.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, disappearance of tortoises and habitat; 20% of geographic range. Loss of habitat from widespread and rapidly growing and expanding cities, towns, and settlements associated with high levels of human population growth in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts and loss and degradation of adjacent habitat (Hughson 2009, U.S. Census Bureau 2010). In the northwest and southwest portions of the geographic range, tortoise populations are locally extinct, absent from valleys and fans and in low densities on military bases.<br/><br/>1.2 Commercial &amp; Industrial<br/>&#160; a. Airports and landing strips, military bases, solar and wind farms.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, loss of tortoises and habitat; 8% of geographic range. Development and use of multiple airports, landing strips, several large military bases with ground disturbing activities (military manoeuvres), and solar and wind farms (with associated transmission lines and roads)&#160;result in degradation and loss of substantial habitat in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts.<br/><br/>1.3 Residential &amp; commercial; golf courses, tourism, recreation<br/>&#160; a. Golf courses are associated with cities and towns that currently exist or are expanding within or near Desert Tortoise habitat (e.g., Las Vegas, Henderson). Vehicle-oriented recreation and visitation are very high in many parts of both deserts including what is now critical habitat, several State Parks and National Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, museums, and other points of interest.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Loss and degradation of habitat, illegal collecting of tortoises: 30%. The high levels of visitor use pose severe threats to <em>G. agassizii</em> throughout remaining habitat as well as in critical habitat. For example, at Lake Mead National Recreation, annual records of visitors from 1946 was &gt;1 million visitors per year; by 2018 more than 7.5 million visits occurred (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/"" style=""color: purple;"">https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/</a>). In parts of critical habitat in the western Mojave Desert, visitor use is very high, e.g., visits and visitor days recorded annually from 2008–2018 ranged from 55,874 to 94,474 visits and 26,218 to 90,445 visitor days per year (USBLM 2019). Visitor use, particularly vehicle-oriented use, is very difficult to control; a substantial portion occurs off-highway and designated trails.&#160;Off-road vehicle recreational uses are associated with higher rates of deaths from gunshots in tortoises occurring in areas with high visitor use days (Berry 1986, 2020a).<br/><br/>2.1.3 Agriculture: Agro-industry farming<br/>&#160; a. Farms for cotton, alfalfa, pistachio, goat-nut, and other crops and dry farming in parts of the geographic range (e.g., Fremont, Antelope, Indian Wells, Victor, Apple, Lucerne, Mojave River, Chuckwalla and Virgin River valleys, bordering the Colorado River).<br/>&#160; b. Severe, cleared land, local areas, often expansive, throughout the geographic range. Historic and ongoing. Habitat and tortoises lost, 10%. Farming began very early (late 1800s) and continues to the present. Farming has negatively affected the water table locally, causing subsidence and fissures to develop in at least one area (Berry 1984), as well as altering vegetation in the vicinity. Habitat cleared for farming generally is used for industrial purposes, e.g., solar or off-road vehicle recreation after abandonment. Both agricultural and industrial uses are associated with influx and proliferation of non-native plants onto adjacent, high quality desert tortoise habitat and protected areas.<br/><br/>2.3.2 and 2.3.3 Agriculture: livestock farming &amp; ranching<br/>&#160; a. Cattle ranching, sheep grazing and driveways, allotments, licenses, and leases (often on federal lands); growing herds of feral burros and expansion into critical habitat.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Moderate to severe, historic (from 1850s), ongoing; 80% of the geographic range affected. Grazing of livestock and use of driveways was widespread and often intensive throughout the geographic range until the Taylor Grazing Act in 1932. Livestock grazing was widespread after that time but managed as an important desert use (e.g., Berry 1984, USBLM 1980). In 1990, after the tortoise was listed as threatened, sheep grazing continued but was excluded from critical habitat. Cattle grazing continued throughout much of critical habitat and still occurs in an estimated 17% of critical habitat (USFWS 2010). Feral burros also graze in tortoise habitats and are encroaching into one critical habitat (USFWS 2010; Berry et al. 2020c). Livestock cause degradation and loss of habitat through development of piospheres, trampling, altering cover, composition of shrubs and forage plants available for tortoises to eat (Webb and Stielstra 1979, Fleischner 1994, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Abella 2008, Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016). The disturbances created by grazing contributes to growth and proliferation of non-native, fire-prone, invasive grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992).<br/><br/>3.1 Energy production &amp; mining: oil and gas<br/>&#160; a. Oil and gas, drilling and exploration.<br/>&#160; b. Medium severity, local areas, &lt;1% of geographic range. Exploratory drilling has occurred in tortoise habitat and has left degraded and cleared areas of &lt; 1-2 ha, with spoil piles, drilling waste, and trash from the drilling operations spread over the area. These sites became focal points for camping and vehicle-oriented recreation, enlarging over time (K.H. Berry pers. obs.).<br/><br/>3.2 Energy production &amp; mining: mining and quarrying<br/>&#160; a. Small and large mines, exploratory pits, bulldozed areas, shafts, and major mines; quarries.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation on a local or regional scale; 5%. Mining on small and large scales began in the late 1800s, killing tortoises and destroying habitat. Roads were constructed to access potential mining areas and districts (Mojave,&#160;Rand, Atolia, Goldstone, Calico, Mountain Pass). Tortoises fall into pits and shafts and were killed. Some mines cover 7.8 km<sup>2</sup> or more and their influence can expand beyond that. Gold mines are associated with spread of mercury and arsenic in soils and plants far beyond the source (e.g., &gt;12 km), transported by wind and water (Chaffee&#160;and Berry 2006; Kim <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014). Tortoises are negatively affected by these elemental toxicants with poor health; these toxicants were reported in livers, integument, lungs, etc.&#160;(Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, Selzer and Berry 2005, Foster <em>et a</em>l. 2009).<br/><br/>3.3 Energy production &amp; mining: renewable energy<br/>&#160; a. Windfarms, photovoltaic, solar fields; new utility and transmission lines, power poles and towers with adjacent roads accompany these developments.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, future. Severe degradation and loss locally over large areas, 5% over the geographic range. Windfarms occur in tortoise habitat, generally on slopes or on hills and small mountains. Solar panels have been constructed on abandoned agricultural fields or in low density or marginal habitat. However, some projects were built in prime habitat, causing loss of habitat and displacement of tortoises. Solar and wind energy is a growing industry with losses of &gt;106 km<sup>2 </sup>as of 2019 (Mark Massar, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>4.1 Transportation and service corridors: roads &amp; railroads<br/>&#160; a. Freeways, 2-lane highways, county gravel or dirt roads, and roads to points of interest; railroads (two major) and several spurs with associated dirt roads and tower lay-down areas for power towers and poles.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe loss and degradation of habitat. 5% throughout the geographic range. Roads were developed in the late 1800s and have proliferated and widened into freeways since that time. Several major freeways and state highways cross the geographic range. Importantly many more dirt roads exist to points of interest (e.g., mines, mining areas, water troughs and water sources, outlying rural areas, recreation areas). Tortoise populations are depleted on either side of highways and well-used roads for distances of &gt;4,000 m (von Seckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002). A very small portion of these roads and highways have tortoise-proof fencing.<br/><br/>4.2 Transportation &amp; service corridors: utility &amp; service lines<br/>&#160; a. Telephone and electric poles and lines; major transmission lines and corridors.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, moderate to severe. Telephone poles and electric poles and lines usually parallel major or minor paved and dirt roads and extend from towns and cities&#160;into remote areas to provide service to agricultural developments, mines, wind and solar farms and individual residences or small settlements. Electric transmission lines cross many parts of the geographic range, including critical habitat (critical habitat alone: 1,634 km of lines in corridors, total area of corridors, 1,743.5 km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2010).&#160; These corridors are accompanied by dirt roads and spurs to the towers. Often corridors contain several sets of towers and electrical lines. Utility lines also include ground disturbance from fibre optic cables, aqueducts, and gas lines, all of which disturb tortoise habitat. Utility poles and transmission lines have allowed for spread of predators (Common Raven, Red-tailed Hawk) into remote parts of the desert, because they make use of the towers and poles for perching and nesting, leading to increased predation on tortoises (Knight and Kawashima 1993, Anderson and Berry 2019).<br/><br/>4.4 Transportation and service corridors: flight paths or military use<p>&#160; a. Commercial, non-commercial, and Department of Defence flight paths.<br/>&#160; b. Numerous, ongoing. Flight paths are minor or no impact if not associated with release of ordnance (bombing ranges). The noise may have effects on wildlife, including tortoises (e.g., Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>5.1.1 Biological resource use: hunting &amp; trapping terrestrial animals: intentional use (species is the target)<br/>&#160; a. Illegal collecting of <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>for commercial sale, food, cultural purposes, and for international trade, etc.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Tortoises have been and continue to be collected for pets, food, tourism,&#160;commercial sale, and cultural purposes, although such collection has been unlawful since 1939 (Berry 1984, Berry <em>et al</em>. 1996, Berry and Murphy 2019, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.1 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: recreational activities<br/>&#160; a. Visits to State and National Parks and Preserves, National Recreation Areas, federal and state lands, private lands, and Open Recreation Use Areas (unrestricted vehicle play areas) by vehicle-oriented recreationists.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe impacts regionally and locally, especially in the western, central, and southern Mojave Desert and growing in the western Sonoran Desert; associated with proximity to cities, towns, and settlements. Formerly populated with Desert Tortoises, several intensively used areas are now severely degraded and have few if any tortoises (e.g., Bury and Luckenbach 2002, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014a, USFWS 2015, Berry and Murphy 2019). Vehicle-oriented visitation is exceptionally high, ranging from &gt;50,000 to 86,550 between 2008 and 2018 annually in some regions of the Mojave Desert (USBLM 2019). Other parts of the desert and critical habitat are also experiencing growing numbers of visitors. Deaths of desert tortoises from road kills and shooting is higher in areas with high levels of vehicle-oriented visitation (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.2 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: war, civil unrest &amp; military exercises<br/>&#160; a. World War II and subsequent. Military manoeuvres across substantial areas of habitat in the western Sonoran and eastern Mojave deserts to train troops using tanks and other vehicles for the war in North Africa. Since the 1960s, military manoeuvres with armoured vehicles in extensive areas in the western, southern, and central Mojave deserts; aerial bombing training in limited areas in the western Sonoran Desert.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Military manoeuvres in 1942 resulted in severely degraded habitat (compacted soils, damaged desert pavements, altered vegetation, including forage available for desert tortoises. Lands disturbed in 1942 have not recovered after 60 years (Prose 1985, 1986; Prose and Wilshire 2000). Similar disturbances have occurred and continue to occur in tortoise populations and habitat at military installations in the southern and central Mojave Desert. In the early 2000s, expansion of the Fort Irwin military installation in the central Mojave Desert caused loss and degradation of 760 km<sup>2</sup> of tortoise habitat and <em>ca</em>. 304 km<sup>2</sup> of the lost habitat was part of critical habitat (USFWS 2010, Berry and Murphy 2019). An estimated <em>ca</em>. 300 km<sup>2</sup> will be lost with additional, ongoing expansion of the same base. The western expansion of the Marine Corps base at 29 Palms caused hundreds of tortoises to be translocated and habitat lost in the southern Mojave Desert (USDD 2017).<br/><br/>6.3 Work and other activities: law enforcement, illegal immigrants, species research, vandalism<br/>&#160; a. Border patrol agents and illegal immigrants travel cross-country by foot and vehicle in tortoise habitat in the southern border range. Vandalism, specifically wanton shooting or killing of tortoises has affected some populations more than others, probably associated with higher visitor use and vehicle-oriented recreation.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, moderate severity. Border patrol agents travel north from the border into tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, to apprehend illegal immigrants. Vehicle travel can occur off dirt roads, widen existing roads, and create new disturbances. Shooting tortoises, running over them deliberately with vehicles, or otherwise killing them has been documented in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>7.1.1 Fires &amp; fire suppression<br/>&#160; a. Caused by lightning, car fires on highways or roads, arson.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, severe, with the severity dependent on the critical habitat unit or protected area. Mojave and Colorado Desert habitats did not evolve with fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). Fires increased in numbers, frequency, and amounts burned with the invasion and proliferation of non-native grasses which are highly combustible (Berry and Murphy 2019). Fires have occurred throughout the geographic range and have burned significant amounts of critical and other protected habitats in the southern, central, eastern and northeastern Mojave Desert regions. Once habitat burns, it is likely to burn again with higher frequencies and with potentially increased biomass of non-native annual grasses. Tortoises die in these fires or are injured, but some survive (Berry and Murphy 2019). Loss of cover of shrubs and food supply for the tortoises is severe in most burned areas. When fires are very hot, the seed bed may be damaged or destroyed. The most severely burned protected habitat is in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve with &gt;30% burned as of summer 2020 (McLuckie <em>et al</em>. 2021); the Mojave National Preserve also experienced a major fire and loss or degradation of 7% of the critical habitat unit in summer 2020 (Darby <em>et al</em>. 2021). <br/><br/>7.2.8 Abstraction of ground water<br/>&#160; a. For agriculture, primarily, followed by urban and cities.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, long-term degradation of habitat adjacent to cities, towns, industrial and agricultural developments. Depletion of the ground water table causing subsidence and formation of fissures has occurred in at least one part of the western Mojave Desert and in the northeastern Mojave Desert in the Las Vegas Valley in what was once desert tortoise habitat (Berry 1984, Burbey 2002). In the western Mojave Desert, the water table was depleted by agricultural uses (cotton, alfalfa) and now with solar energy development; and by cities in the Las Vegas Valley by depleted associated aquifers. Other regions have and continue to experience depletion of the water table in areas with agriculture and desert cities, e.g., adjacent to the Mojave, Colorado, and Virgin rivers (Stamos <em>et al</em>. 2001). Water is sought from sources and regions outside desert tortoise habitat (e.g., the Colorado River) to support cities and towns, as well as agriculture, because existing water tables are insufficient to support them.<br/><br/>8.1.2 Invasive and other problematic species, genes &amp; diseases: Named species<br/>&#160; a.&#160;<em>Bromus madritensis </em>ssp<em>. rubens, B. tectorum, Schismus </em>spp<em>., Erodium cicutarium, Hirschfeldia incana, Brassica tournefortii.<br/></em>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation of the Mojave and western Sonoran ecosystems. Landscape conservation forecasting (Provencher <em>et al</em>. 2011) quantified the pervasive abundance of annual brome grasses that foster destructive wildfires of a size and intensity far greater than the fire regime with which Mojave Desert habitats developed over the past millennia.&#160;In addition to supporting fires, the non-native grasses compete with native forage species of forbs required by tortoises to grow, reproduce, and remain healthy. Non-native grasses and forbs dominate the ecosystem in biomass in both wet and dry years in many tortoise habitats (Brooks and Berry 2006, Berry 2014b). Non-native grasses are not nutritious plants for tortoises to eat and cause weight loss and can cause death in juveniles (Hazard <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The awns of <em>Bromus</em> also can injure tortoise mouths. The non-native <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em> and especially <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, introduced through agricultural development, also compete with native forage species, changing the composition of the native flora (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b). They are not eaten by tortoises and can be high in oxalates, potentially a source of oxalosis in tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>8.1.2 Diseases. Named species<br/>&#160; a. Infectious diseases: <em>Mycoplasma agassizii, M. testudineum, </em>Testudinid herpesvirus 2 (TeHV2); Non-infectious diseases: oxalosis, gout, starvation, dehydration.<br/>&#160; b. Infectious diseases: ongoing, severe in some areas. The two species of <em>Mycoplasma</em> are infectious pathogens. The first (<em>M. agassizii</em>) was discovered in wild populations in 1989 and the second (<em>M. testudineum</em>) a few years later (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, 2014). These pathogens are spread by contact between tortoises cause disease and death in some populations, and inhibit olfaction necessary for foraging (Jacobson and Berry 2012, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Mycoplasma agassizii</em> is common in captive desert tortoises, more so than in wild populations. Epidemiological studies indicate that the distribution of the two species differs, and that tortoises with antibody-positive tests for the diseases occur closer to human habitations rather than more distant (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mycoplasmosis has been implicated as a major contributor to a catastrophic die-off of tortoises at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2020b). It is also associated with declines in other parts of the geographic range (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160; Non-infectious diseases of known etiology include oxalosis, gout, and starvation and dehydration (Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Some individuals and populations have been negatively affected by these diseases.<br/><br/>8.2.2 Problematic Native Species<br/>&#160; a. The Common Raven (<em>Corvus corax)</em>, an uncommon to rare resident between the 1920s and 1940s in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts, is now an abundant predator in ecosystems where the Desert Tortoise lives.&#160;Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>) is another similar predator, and Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>) can also be a hyper-predator.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe and negative effects on population structure; loss of juveniles and immature tortoises. Populations of the Common Raven have grown enormously, supported by subsidies of food, water, perch and nest sites available from humans (Boarman 1993, Boarman and Berry 1995). They have been able to access formerly remote parts of the desert by relying on settlements, road kills and trash along highways and roads, and utility poles and transmission lines for perching and nesting (Knight and Kawashima 1993). Common Ravens are very effective predators on hatchling, juvenile and immature tortoises, with dozens to hundreds of shells recorded beneath perch and nest sites. They are responsible for preventing recovery in many parts of the desert by depleting young tortoise cohorts in populations that can lead to local extinctions (Kristan and Boarman 2003). Red-tailed Hawks have expanded their use areas into remote parts of the desert ecosystems, using utility poles and towers as nest sites and juvenile tortoises for food (Anderson and Berry 2019). Similarly, Coyotes are subsidized predators found in increased numbers near cities, towns, and some military installations and at times have high predation rates on tortoises (Esque <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>8.4.2 Problematic Species/ Diseases: Named Species<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Several non-native species of tortoises and turtles carrying disease or potentially carrying disease have been released illegally into Desert Tortoise habitats, e.g., African Spurred Tortoise (<em>Centrochelys</em> <em>sulcata</em>; Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018) and Central Asian Steppe Tortoise (<em>Testudo horsfieldii</em>; Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe. Releases of tortoises, whether native or non-native are illegal in large parts of the geographic range. Nevertheless, introduced, non-native turtles and tortoises such as the African Spurred Tortoise and Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise have been found to carry new diseases that would negatively affect already declining <em>G. agassizii </em>populations (Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018). The African Spurred Tortoise can do damage to habitat and to the native tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, because of the large size and aggressive nature. One Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise was captured in the Central Mojave Desert with a new herpesvirus not previously described in <em>G. agassizii&#160;</em>(Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The concern is that this non-native tortoise may have transmitted the new herpesvirus to desert tortoises. New, non-native herpesviruses from other species and countries and continents are a threat to health in already declining <em>G. agassizii</em> populations.<br/><br/>8.5 Viral/Prion-induced Diseases<br/>&#160; a. Herpesviruses are implicated in illness and mortality in tortoises.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe if coupled with other stressors. Herpesviruses are a threat to health and survival of desert tortoises, especially those herpesviruses introduced from other, non-native species to the desert. Tortoises with clinical signs of the disease were among populations that severely declined between the 1990s and 2000s; herpesvirus may have contributed in some areas (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Testudinid herpesvirus 2 was first identified in captive tortoises, then confirmed in wild <em>G. agassizii</em> (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012). The estimated prevalence of this herpesvirus for captive and wild tortoises from the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts ranged from 15 to 56% (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>8.6 Diseases of Unknown Cause<br/>&#160; a. Shell diseases, i.e., cutaneous dyskeratosis, necrosis.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. A novel shell disease, cutaneous dyskeratosis and shell necrosis, was implicated in illness and deaths of Desert Tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1994; Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2001) and a decline of ca. 80% in a once-robust population. Other populations in critical habitats appear to be affected similarly. This is a metabolic disease with lesions of the shell and integument as outward manifestations. The causes are suspected to be toxicants (e.g., elemental toxicants and/or nutritional deficiencies). The disease is implicated in elevated death rates in adult tortoises in the western Sonoran Desert and eastern Mojave Desert (Berry and Medica 1995, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>9.2.2 Industrial &amp; military effluents<br/>&#160; a. Seepage from mining.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, unremediated regionally. There are links between some diseases in tortoises and toxicants from mining and other similar developments. Tortoises dying of upper respiratory tract disease caused by <em>Mycoplasma</em> spp. in the western Mojave Desert in close proximity to a mining district had high levels of mercury in livers compared to tortoises without the disease (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991). Ill tortoises with high levels of arsenic occurred in an area mining district with high levels of mercury and arsenic (Selzer and Berry 2005). Waste from the mines was transported by wind and water to distances of 15 km (Chaffee and Berry 2006; Kim et al. 2012, 2014). Mines in other tortoise habitat in different desert regions have yet to be examined.</p><p>9.4 Garbage &amp; Solid Waste<br/>&#160; a. Trash is a threat to tortoises because they can consume it or become entangled.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, low to moderate. Consumption of trash can lead to illness and death (Donoghue 2006, Walde <em>et al</em>. 2007). Balloons and other trash are common throughout the desert and most abundant near human habitations, along roads, and recreation use areas (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008, 2014a; Keith <em>et al</em>. 2008). Trash attracts predators—Common Ravens, Coyotes, and other canids—thus creating an additional risk to tortoises.<br/><br/>9.5 Air-borne Pollutants<br/>&#160; a. Pollutants such as atmospheric nitrogen and increases in CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the growth of invasive grasses and thus fire.<br/>&#160; b. Atmospheric nitrogen from urban or other areas is transported to deserts and tortoise habitat, and deposited on soils, thus enhancing growth of non-native grasses and plants prone to fire (Brooks 2003, Rao and Allen 2010).<br/><br/>11.1 Habitat Shifting &amp; Alteration<br/>&#160; a. Desertification; degradation of vegetation, soils, and topography<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Throughout the geographic range, most, if not all, tortoise habitats have received (and continue to receive) one or more anthropogenic uses and activities resulting in compacted or eroded soils and alteration of the natural structure and composition of annual and perennial vegetation (e.g., Lei 2009). Long-lived shrubs and native annual wildflowers and grasses have been replaced in part with short-lived colonizers (shrubs, non-native, fire-prone grasses) typical of disturbed areas. These changes have brought fewer places to dig burrows and a reduced supply of nutritious plants to eat (Brooks and Berry 2006, Webb and Wilshire 1983). In some areas, the rich diversity of shrubs and annual plants have been replaced by a few shrub species and the annuals replaced with primarily non-native annual species (Brooks and Berry 2006).<br/><br/>11.2 Droughts<br/>&#160; a. Desert Tortoises require water from precipitation and a diverse diet of native annuals to grow, reproduce and survive.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, increasingly severe with reduced survival throughout the geographic range, often associated with hyper-predation by coyotes. Although the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts are typified by droughts often lasting more than a year, tortoises have adaptations to cope. However, tortoises die of starvation and dehydration during prolonged droughts (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2002, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003, Longshore <em>et al</em>. 2003, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014). Juveniles are especially vulnerable. With climate change and warming, droughts, including megadroughts lasting 10 years or more, are predicted to occur in coming years (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2017, Steiger <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>11.3 Temperature Extremes<br/>&#160; a. Tortoises are able to withstand the extremes of temperature experienced in the desert; however, increases in warm temperatures coupled with drying and changes in precipitation patterns present high risks to the species.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing and a growing issue, with climate change having negative impacts throughout the geographic range. Tortoises cope with the extremes of summer and winter temperatures (and lack of water, see 11.2) by using deep burrows and restricting above-ground activities and reproduction during drought. As temperatures rise with the rise in CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases, tortoises will need to find habitats where deeper burrows can be excavated. At the higher temperatures, the spring season for foraging on ephemeral annuals and egg laying is likely to be shortened, reducing the time for eating, growing, and egg production. Sex of tortoises is determined by temperature of incubation in nests, with females produced at the higher temperatures and males at the lower temperatures. Eggs laid in nest that will experience the high temperatures of summer may be predominantly female, and if temperatures are excessive, may not be viable. Although the species could survive at higher (and cooler) elevations, the habitat in mountain ranges will be more limited, steep, rocky, with exposed bedrock in places with inadequate forage.<br/><br/>12.1 Other Threats<br/>&#160; a. Climate Change.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, see 11.2 and 11.3. Change in timing and amounts of precipitation coupled with increasing temperatures are likely to have profound negative effects on the species, further reducing available habitat (e.g., Barrows 2011). Profound changes are predicted to cause deterioration in composition, structure, diversity and biomass of trees and shrubs (Munson et al. 2016) that provide shade and cover to the tortoises. Barrows (2011) predicted that tortoises may survive if they move from the western Colorado Desert to higher elevations.&#160; However, the long-lived tortoises have strong fidelity to existing home ranges.</p>","Population estimates and trends have previously been difficult to obtain with certainty for large segments of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> populations due to their patchy distribution, difficulty of detection, and associated statistical weaknesses of population estimates. Population data have been variously documented or reviewed by Woodbury and Hardy (1948), Hardy (1976), Berry (1984, 1986, 1989), Bury and Corn (1995),&#160;Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Berry and Murphy (2019). A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;by Allison and McLuckie (2018) has demonstrated continued adult population declines in four of the five&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units and low densities in nearly all subpopulations near the minimum required to remain viable (3.9 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>Between the 1930s and early 2000s, estimates of density and trends in populations were based on demographic data, habitat condition, and anthropogenic threats from both long- and short-term study plots of varying sizes, as well as reports by government agency personnel and expert observers (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948; Hardy 1976; Berry 1984, 1989). The study plots were limited in number and did not represent the entirety of subpopulations across the geographic range (e.g., Berry 1984). The subpopulation on the Beaver Dam Slope, Utah, was federally listed as threatened in 1980 (USFWS 1980). A petition submitted by the Desert Tortoise Council in 1984 to list all wild populations in the United States was denied; the USFWS determined that listing of U.S. populations was warranted but precluded because of other higher priorities (USFWS&#160;<span style="""">1985</span>). In 1989 and 1990, the State of California and USFWS listed the tortoise as threatened (USFWS <span style="""">1989,&#160;1990;</span> California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2016). The appearance of upper respiratory tract disease and rapidly declining populations in the western Mojave and a major decline in tortoises in parts of the western Sonoran (Colorado Desert, California) associated with appearance of shell disease were additional threats to the many causes of declines (USFWS 1990, 1994, and references therein). Reflecting its concern over these declines, USFWS (1994:3) stated that: “The most serious problem facing the remaining desert tortoise population is the cumulative load of human and disease-related mortality accompanied by habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. Virtually every extant desert tortoise subpopulation has been affected by one or more of these factors.” As a result, the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994) also designated federal critical habitat units for desert tortoises at that time.&#160;In October 2020, the California Fish and Wildlife Commission accepted a petition from Defenders of Wildlife to up-list wild desert tortoises from threatened to endangered status; California has the largest subpopulation and geographic range of the species. The petition is currently under consideration by the agency with a response estimated in 2021.<br/><br/>To better measure trends in densities of adult populations in the threatened subpopulations, the Recovery Team proposed development of a landscape scale program (USFWS 1994). At the same time, the Recovery Team also noted the importance of study plot data, because more population attributes were provided than density of adults. After experimenting with different techniques, the USFWS decided to use distance sampling and initiated a formal, range-wide program for estimating densities of adult populations in critical habitat units (USFWS 2015, and references therein).<br/><br/>In the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994), population size, viability, and sizes of protected areas were discussed. Assuming the minimum density of adults in a population was “approximately 10 adults per square mile” (equivalent to 3.9 adults/km<sup>2</sup>), the target size for protected areas (then called Desert Wildlife Management Areas) was approximately 1,000 mi<sup>2</sup> (ca. 2,590 km<sup>2</sup>). This would ensure that even at such low densities and assuming half of such large areas might support no or few tortoises, each protected area would support enough adults for a genetically minimum viable population. The Recovery Team recommended six Recovery units with 12 different populations. The updated Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011) is based on the same number of populations but configured into five revised Recovery units with 17 different monitored subpopulations.<br/><br/>Most demographic data from study plots collected from the 1930s on the Beaver Dam Slope and between 1979–1980 in California and Nevada during the spring season indicated counts of 5–64 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Berry and Murphy 2019). In describing trends between 1978 and 1990 in California, the USFWS summarized data from 10 study plots in the Mojave and Colorado deserts and reported a highly significant downward trend (USFWS 1994). Additional data for the period showed some populations with low but potentially stable densities in Nevada (Berry and Medica 1995). A review of population status (Tracy <em>et al</em>. 2004) considered updated information from the permanent study plots in California and found that population declines in the western part of the range in California continued and declines were perhaps beginning in the eastern part of the California range.<br/><br/>The current population trends are based on landscape-level assessment using distance sampling for the 11-year period between 2004 and 2014 (USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). The sampling represented all five recovery units with 16 subpopulations in critical habitat units of from 115 to 3,763 km<sup>2</sup> described in the original Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994). Joshua Tree National Park is treated as a protected area and monitored as a 17th subpopulation although not designated as critical habitat. Consistent downward trends have continued in four of the five recovery units, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 11 years. Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014; the exceptions were adult densities in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) and the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (10.2/km<sup>2</sup>) (Berry et al. 2014, 2020). Unfortunately, in July 2020, a significant part of the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve burned and tortoises were found injured and dead. The Red Cliffs subpopulation declined from 2005 wildfires and with the recent 2020 fires, there will likely be further depression in densities. The six subpopulations with increasing densities had 2.7 to 6.4 adults/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2014. However, most of the 17 populations were near or below the 3.9 /km<sup>2</sup>&#160;density of adults considered as a minimum for viable populations (USFWS 1994, 2015).",Decreasing,"The Desert Tortoise was previously considered to be a single wide-ranging species, <em>Gopherus agassizii</em>, inhabiting the Mojave and Sonoran Desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico from southern California and Arizona through Sonora and into northern Sinaloa (Stebbins 1966, 2003; Iverson 1992). The species was found to be polytypic by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2011), who split the morphologically and genetically distinct Sonoran Desert populations as <em>Gopherus morafkai</em>, the Sonoran Desert Tortoise. Further analysis demonstrated that <em>G. morafkai</em> was also polytypic and split further to separate and describe the Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise further to the south as <em>Gopherus evgoodei</em> (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Geographically restricted <em>G. agassizii</em>, the Mojave or Agassiz’s Desert Tortoise, is endemic to the United States, inhabiting southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and extreme northwestern Arizona west and north of the Colorado River (TTWG 2017, Berry and Murphy 2019). The Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai</em>, occurs in both the United States and Mexico, inhabiting Arizona south and east of the Colorado River, Sonora (including Isla Tiburón), and extreme northern Sinaloa (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2011, TTWG 2017). The Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise, <em>G. evgoodei</em>, is endemic to Mexico and occurs in southern Sonora, northern Sinaloa, and extreme southwestern Chihuahua (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2016, TTWG 2017).<br/><br/>Within its geographic range, <em>G. agassizii</em> occurs in the Mojave Desert, the western Sonoran or Colorado Desert, the ecotone of the Mojave with the Great Basin Desert, and ecotones with vegetation types typical of higher elevations on the lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada, Transverse, Peninsular and desert mountain ranges (USFWS 1994). McLuckie <em>et al</em>. (1999) identified a subpopulation of <em>G. agassizii</em> east of the Colorado River in the Black Mountains of northwestern Arizona in which morphometric and mtDNA characteristics of the majority of the subpopulation were typically Mojavean; however, elements typical of tortoises in the Sonoran Desert were also evident. Edwards <em>et al.</em> (2015), using new genetic techniques, examined this and other nearby tortoise subpopulations, and identified hybrids (F2) in three mountain ranges near the Colorado River in Arizona. The two <em>Gopherus</em> species come in contact in limited places where Mojave Desert habitats meet Sonoran Desert habitats. The two species likely maintain largely independent taxonomic identities due to ecological niche partitioning (Inman <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species has been recorded at elevations of up to&#160;1,570 m asl (Rautenstrauch and O’Farrell 1998); however, tortoises may be found in unusual places, often transported by humans or other animals (e.g., the type specimen of <em>Xerobates lepidocephalus</em>&#160;[Ottley and Velázquez-Solis 1989] from southern Baja California, Mexico, is actually an introduced <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>[Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2011]).","Commercial take or use of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is prohibited by law, and few animals have been documented in (illegal) trade in recent decades. The evaluation of conservation status, conservation and monitoring actions for the species have generated significant financial investments in the species, supporting a range of local and visiting livelihoods. The approximate cost to develop and implement the 25-year recovery program for the Mojave Desert Tortoise was USD 100 million (USGAO 2002, Ernst and Lovich 2009, USFWS 2011, Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thirty years have passed since the federal listing of&#160; <em>G. agassizii</em> as threatened in 1989–1990, declines of breeding adults continue, and many tasks to reduce deaths, described first in 1994 (USFWS 1994), remain to be implemented (see also USFWS 2011, Reports from the Recovery Implementation Teams). If fully implemented, the recommended actions could exceed 159 million USD plus additional costs that could not be estimated in the 2011 Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011). As one of the keystone species of the Mojave Desert, <em>G. agassizii</em> plays an unquantified but substantial role in generating tourism income to regional protected areas (see Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/"">https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/</a>).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Conservation Measures taken:<br/></strong>The first legal conservation measures for <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> came from the State of California in 1939 (California Department of Fish and Game Code 1939–1981).&#160;Additional protective regulations followed until <em>G. agassizii </em>was listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act in 1989 (California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife 2016). Federal legislation to protect <em>G. agassizii</em> first occurred in 1980 and was restricted to the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utah (USFWS 1980). In 1989–1990, <em>G. agassizii</em> was federally listed as threatened (USDI&#160;<span style="""">1990&#160;</span>and references therein). The only population of <em>G. agassizii</em> that is not protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, is in the northwest corner of Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recovery efforts have been underway since 1990. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1994) published the first Recovery Plan in 1994, coupled with designations of critical habitat units by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994); this was followed by a revised Recovery Plan in 2011 (USFWS 2011), and regional Recovery Implementation Teams established in 2012. These teams are chaired by an employee of the USFWS Desert Tortoise Recovery Office, and are composed of federal, state, and county employees from the range of the desert tortoise, including representatives from local and national conservation and other stakeholder organizations. <br/><br/>The species is included in CITES Appendix II as part of Testudinidae spp., requiring that any commercial international trade be documented not to be detrimental to the survival of wild populations. CITES Trade records generally show very low levels of international exports of live animals; the vast majority of live traded Desert Tortoises are personal pets moving in-country with their owners, and many of the records in fact concern seizures of illegally transported specimens (CITES UNEP-WCMC trade database).<br/><br/>Conservation and recovery efforts began in the early 1970s, long before efforts of the federal actions by the USFWS in 1989–90. The Desert Tortoise Council formed in 1974-75 out of an interim recovery effort involving the four Southwestern states. This non-profit corporation was and continues to be dedicated to preserving representative populations of desert tortoises; educating the public; holding annual introductory workshops; and annual symposia to bring together representatives from government agencies, academia, and the public to learn and discuss important topics aimed at recovery of tortoise populations. The Desert Tortoise Council was instrumental in providing critical materials for federal and state listings of the species. The Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, Inc., was formed in 1974 to establish protected areas for <em>G. agassizii</em>. This non-profit organization is a land trust and mitigation bank, a source of education, and research. They were instrumental in establishing the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area and increasing its size.<br/><br/>Two preserves or protected areas exist with moderately high degrees of protection. One is the 100 km<sup>2</sup> (and increasing) Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area, which was formally designated by the U.S. Congress in 1980. It is fenced, with no vehicle access, livestock grazing, mining, or surface disturbances other than a few limited natural trails and a kiosk. The Natural Area is for wild tortoises only and populations are allowed to fluctuate naturally with no augmentation. Population density of adults throughout the Natural Area in 2011-12 was 10.2/km<sup>2</sup> (Berry et al. 2014a). The second preserve is Red Cliffs Desert Reserve in Utah (251 km<sup>2</sup>). The Red Cliffs National Conservation Area provides additional protection for federal lands within the Reserve. Several paved roads, fenced and unfenced, run through the Reserve and recreation occurs throughout (e.g., hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking).&#160;The next and lower level of protection could be described as occurring within National Parks, State Parks, and National Recreation Areas such as Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, Mojave National Preserve, Red Rock Canyon, Anza-Borrego, and Red Rocks State Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and the Beaver Dam Wash National Conservation Area. These parks and recreation areas have very high visitor use, unfenced paved roads, and some illegal collecting and release of captive tortoises of one or more species. <br/><br/>Twelve critical habitat units, the basis for Tortoise Conservation Areas (term defined in USFWS 2011), were designated by the USFWS (1994), and have far less protection than either the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area or the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve and are subject to multiple land uses that fragment and degrade habitat and create vulnerabilities and risks to the tortoises (e.g., invasive non-native grasses and other non-native species; highways; roads; utility poles, towers, and electrical transmission lines; gas lines and fibreoptic cables; recreational vehicle use; shooting; domestic and feral dogs; cattle grazing and feral burros; mining; military installations; fire that causes degradation of habitat).<br/><br/>Seventeen monitored subpopulations in the 12 critical habitat units are contained within five recovery units which cover a total of 25,678 km<sup>2</sup>. The following information for each recovery unit and the 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas reports area (km<sup>2</sup>), and density of breeding adults per km<sup>2</sup> in 2014. Western Mojave Recovery Unit: Fremont-Kramer (2,347 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Ord-Rodman (852 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Superior-Cronese (3,094 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Colorado Desert Recovery Unit: Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range (713 km<sup>2</sup>, 7.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Chuckwalla (2,818 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.3/km<sup>2</sup>), Chemehuevi (3,763 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Fenner (1,782 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Joshua Tree (1,152 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Pinto Mountain (508 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.4/km<sup>2</sup>), Piute Valley (927 km<sup>2</sup>, 5.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Eastern Mojave Recovery Unit: El Dorado Valley (999 km<sup>2</sup>, 1.5/km<sup>2</sup>), Ivanpah Valley (2,447 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Northeastern Mojave Recovery Unit: Beaver Dam Slope (750 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Coyote Spring (960 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.0/km<sup>2</sup>), Gold Butte (1,607 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Mormon Mesa (844 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit: Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (115 km<sup>2</sup>, 15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2015; Allison and McLuckie 2018). The overall decline in tortoise populations in critical habitats (Tortoise Conservation Areas) between 2004 and 2014 was 32.2% (USFWS 2015). Four of the five recovery units are in a state of decline, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 10 years (USFWS 2015). Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014 (USFWS 2015).<br/><br/>Extensive research has been published in peer-reviewed journals on many aspects of natural history, general ecology, physiological ecology, reproduction, health and diseases, population attributes, causes of death, movements and home range, predators, head-starting, translocation, and many other topics, making <em>G. agassizii</em> likely the most well-researched non-marine turtle species (Lovich and Ennen 2013b). Over 400 journal articles were published as of 2018, most between 1990 and 2018, as well as hundreds of reports (see three annotated bibliographies covering almost 160 years: Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980, Grover and DeFalco 1995, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016). Some information has been integrated into recovery programs, but many of the recovery measures recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) have not been implemented as of 2020.<br/><br/>Economic relevance: The approximate cost of USD 100 million to develop and implement the first and second Recovery Plans is significant within the regulatory, scientific and local economic sectors involved and much remains to be implemented (USFWS 1994, 2011; Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Measures needed:<br/></strong>The USFWS (1994) published recommended regulations for the areas that were designated as critical habitat. They described activities to be prohibited (e.g., all vehicle activity off designated roads; all competitive and organized recreational vehicle events on designated roads; habitat destructive military manoeuvres, clearing for agriculture, landfills and other surface disturbances; domestic livestock grazing, grazing by feral burros and horses; vegetation harvest; collection of biological specimens or vegetation harvest except by permit; dumping and littering; and deposition of captive or displace desert tortoises except under authorized translocation research projects; uncontrolled dogs out of vehicles; discharge of firearms except for hunting of game between September and February. There were many other recommended management actions but few of these recommendations were adopted when critical habitat units were officially described (USFWS 1994), and others have only been partially implemented by 2020.&#160;There were also recommendations for monitoring and research. In the second recovery plan, the USFWS (2011) identified and ranked (Darst <em>et al.</em> 2013) priority actions for recovering the Desert Tortoise and established regional Recovery Implementation Teams to implement these recovery actions. These Recovery Implementation Teams identify local, regional, and range-wide actions by submitting proposals to team members for discussion and prioritization. Ultimately the proposals are submitted to range-wide Management Oversight Groups composed of state, federal, and county government agencies for review, discussion, and potential sources of funding. Some projects are successfully funded and implemented, while many recommended in 1994 remain unfulfilled.<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Conservation Actions Needed, we provide the following notes:<br/></strong>1.1. Land/water protection -&gt; Site/area protection<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Better protection of Critical habitats could ensure that populations of tortoises become stable and/or increase. Examples of protective measures included in recovery measures for the tortoise are exclusion fencing and culverts along highways and roads; reduction in populations of hyper-predators such as the Common Ravens; control and removal of newly introduced and previously existing non-native plants; and control of recreational vehicle use.<br/><br/>2.1. Land/water management -&gt; Site/area management<br/>&#160; &#160; a. The first recovery plan identified site-specific or critical habitat-specific measures to ensure protection of habitat and reduction of deaths of tortoises from anthropogenic sources (USFWS 1994). Most of these recommendations are still relevant. The Recovery Implementation Teams have provided recommendations similar to those in the first recovery plan. Many of these measures remain to be implemented. For example, in the State of California where most desert tortoise habitat and populations occur, acquisition of private land would be beneficial, because a substantial portion of habitat is in multiple private ownership. Both the USFWS and State of California recommend that developers of tortoise habitat acquire replacement habitat for habitat lost to development, and such actions have been occurring for ~20 years. Another topic and critical area that would benefit from protection is the population and hybrid zone with <em>G. morafkai</em> east of the Colorado River in Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). This small population is not protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>2.2. Land/water management -&gt; Invasive/problematic species control<br/>&#160; a. Non-native grasses (e.g., <em>Schismus arabicus</em>, <em>S. barbatus</em>, <em>Bromus tectorum</em>, <em>B. madritensis rubens</em>) and forbs (e.g., <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em>) present serious and severe problems to tortoises because tortoises are selective in the choice of forage (Jennings and Berry 2015). The non-native annuals contribute to changes in forage availability, habitat structure, and increases in fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). These non-native species thrive under disturbance and spread via roads, livestock, military maneuvers, and disturbances created by recreational vehicle use off-road (e.g., D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006). The grasses are highly combustible and fire-prone in wildlands that did not evolve with short-term fire cycles (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). The grasses also compete with native annuals used as forage by the tortoises, and the species of grasses contain little nutrition, require water to metabolize, cause weight loss in the tortoises, and can become embedded in the jaws (Medica and Eckert 2007; Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). Similarly, <em>Brassica tournefortii</em> competes with native species used for forage and often occurs in dense stands, inhibiting movements of tortoises (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).<br/><br/>3.2. Species management -&gt; Species recovery<br/>&#160; a. Species management and recovery are guided by the Recovery Plan and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. On-the-ground management is by the administering agency, e.g., U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Department of Defense, States (for state land), and private owners. That being said, much can be done by implementing actions recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) and by restoring degraded habitat (e.g., Abella and Berry 2016); controlling recreation vehicle use off-road and reducing fragmentation of habitat; limiting spread of invasive, non-native grasses and forbs; controlling hyper-predation in common ravens (USFWS 2008)&#160;and coyotes; preventing dogs and dog packs from running loose in the desert; and acquiring habitat.<br/><br/>4.3. Education &amp; awareness -&gt; Awareness &amp; communications<br/>&#160; a. See Conservation Actions in Place. Expansion of on-going programs to prevent take or shooting in the wild and release of captive tortoises of several species.<br/><br/><br/><strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Research Needed, we provide the following notes:</strong></p>While research on some topics is desirable, more is known about <em>G. agassizii </em>than most other reptiles (Lovich and Ennen 2013b, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016 and references therein). Instead, implementation of previously identified actions to protect populations and habitat is more critical, specifically actions that will reduce deaths and loss or degradation of habitat.&#160;<br/><br/>1.1. Research -&gt; Taxonomy<br/>&#160; a. Genetic relationships between and within populations: human-mediated translocations of tortoises have occurred for decades, some authorized, some not (see Murphy et al. 2007). One recent question is the source of tortoises in Anza Borrego Desert State Park in the Colorado Desert of California. One might expect that the source would be tortoises occurring in the Colorado Desert, but instead tortoises have genotypes typical of the southwestern Mojave Desert population (Manning and Edwards 2019). More information on nearby tortoises (e.g. Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2020) occurring on the east-facing slopes of the Peninsular Range north of the Park may shed light on whether this is a naturally occurring population or a source that came from human-mediated translocations.<br/>&#160; b. Translocation of thousands of tortoises has occurred in the last &gt;20 years. Yet the only information available as to whether these translocated tortoises have been assimilated into the recipient or existing resident populations is research by Mulder <em>et al.</em> (2017) on assimilation of translocated males into the population of resident tortoises. Much more needs to be done on following males and females over a 10- to 20-year period to determine if and when adult males are assimilated into resident populations.<br/><br/>1.2. Research -&gt; Population size, distribution &amp; trends<br/>&#160; a. More information on current population attributes such as size-age class structure, recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, sex ratios of adult tortoises, and causes and contributors to death is highly desirable. Landscape sampling undertaken and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Desert Tortoise Recovery Office has provided valuable region-wide information on adult densities but not on other essential population attributes (i.e., Allison and McLuckie 2018). Resurvey of long-term, mark-recapture tortoise plots has been spotty for the past 20 years while support has increased for line-distance sampling representatively and on a landscape scale (see USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). Nonetheless, it is clear (USFWS 2011) that species recovery cannot be assumed based on patterns of adult counts alone, and active work to describe vital rates across the range will be an important part of assuring tortoise populations reflect healthy population dynamics or determining regional and size-specific recovery needs.<br/><br/>1.3. Research -&gt; Life history &amp; ecology<br/>&#160; a. More information is needed on survival of neonate, juvenile, and immature size classes (first 12 to 15 years of life) and causes of mortality in the wild. Frequent input of new data on causes of and contributors to mortality for all size classes is essential for improving management of the species and for achieving upward trends.<br/><br/>1.5. Research -&gt; Threats<br/>&#160; a. The USFWS developed a model to identify major threats to the species (Darst <em>et al</em>. 2013); the information in this model is based on published research only, and not on the hundreds of reports and manuscripts available in Annual Reports to the USFWS on research permits. The model is outdated and needs major revisions to more accurately reflect available information and more recent priorities. In addition, support could be provided to speed up publication of important research projects that will lead to more protective management actions.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>3.1. Monitoring -&gt; Population trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on population attributes in critical habitat, near highways, and in critical habitat near urban areas.<br/><br/>3.4. Monitoring -&gt; Habitat trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on wildfires, non-native plants, seed beds, and recovery of preferred forage plants.<br/><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

These reed brakes can be found on the edges of forests and in more in open habitats (K.V. Gururaja, pers. comm.). These frogs reside inside the hollow tube of the internodal region of <em>O. setigera</em> stems, and generally remain there throughout the day at a height of 2.25–2.7m above the ground (Gururaja <em>et al</em>., 2007). The frogs use slit-like openings in the bamboo stems to enter and leave (Gururaja <em>et al</em>., 2007). This species has only been found inside live bamboo stems, and the males call from inside the stems (Gururaja <em>et al</em>., 2007). An egg clutch with six developing embryos has been observed attached to inner walls of the hollow stems (Gururaja <em>et al</em>., 2007). The species breeds by direct development without dependence on water.","The habitat of this species in the Kakkayam Forest Reserve Reserve is being fragmented and reduced in area as a result of dam construction and other related activities (Gururaja <em>et al</em>., 2007), including: clearing of forest for access roads, power lines, and pipelines; cutting of the reeds to provide temporary shelters for the construction work force; and cutting of the reeds for fuel wood for the construction workers (K.V.

In the central coast of New South Wales the species is associated with sandy soils that support heath vegetation (Mahony 1993). Breeding activity occurs in spring to autumn (Gillespie 1990), although the species has been found to be active throughout the entire year, with activity peaks in the months of February, April and May (Penman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006). Males call from partially flooded burrows at the base of creek banks or beneath dense vegetation beside creeks (Littlejohn and Martin 1967, Gillespie 1990). Breeding occurs at ephemeral pools and sometimes-permanent pools. Watson and Martin (1973) recorded 775-1,239 eggs (2.6mm diameter) from four foamy egg masses deposited in standing or slow water in vegetation or burrows, while near Jervis Bay they ranged from 698-807 (Daly 1996 in Penman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2004). Tadpoles are free-living and metamorphosis occurs at 3 and 11 months (Daly 1996).","There are a number of threatening processes operating across the range of this species, including intensive timber harvesting, cattle grazing, fuel reduction burning, introduced terrestrial and aquatic predators, and disturbances resulting from urbanization (Gillespie 1990, Rescei 1997), in addition to pollution and disease (Penman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2004). Road mortality has also been observed (Mahony 1993). The potential impacts of most of these processes have not been examined. Foxes and cats are common and widespread throughout south-eastern Australia and are potentially a major threatening process to terrestrial frog species such as <em>H. australiacus</em> (Gillespie and Hines 1999). Chytrid fungus was detected in this species in Springwood, New South Wales. Fires may also constitute a threat to this species (Penman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004), and while logging is currently excluded from the species' known breeding habitat, it has the potential to impact individuals that may occur beyond these habitats (Penman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2005). Different degrees of suspended sediments in water (that may result from e.g. storms, logging activities) were found not to affect growth of tadpoles; however, survivorship was found to be higher in the high sediment regime (Green <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2004).","Available information indicates that <em>H. australiacus</em> is now rare (Webb 1987, Gillespie 1990, Rescei 1997), and populations appear to have declined. However, information is lacking on the demography of the species and on the size of populations. With few exceptions, recent records of this species have been of a single individual or few individuals (Gillespie 1990, Daly 1996).",Decreasing,"This species is confined to the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range and coastal regions from the south end of the Olney State Forest north of Sydney, New South Wales (Australian Museum records), to Walhalla in the central highlands of eastern Victoria (Littlejohn and Martin 1967). It has been found from near sea level up to 1,000 m asl, from the coast to almost 100 km inland along the escarpment of the Great Dividing Range (Gillespie 1990, Rescei 1997, Australian Museum records). Most records are either from the north end of the range in the Sydney region, or eastern Victoria and south-eastern New South Wales (see Gillespie 1990, Penman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004). There is a notable disjunction in records between Jervis Bay and the Eden District, which might be due to either the rarity of the species or the limited survey effort in the region.

10394015,41048,Pseudophryne covacevichae,Endangered,B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii),2004,2004-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Endangered because its Extent of Occurrence is much less than 5,000km2, and its Area of Occupancy is less than 500km2, its distribution is severely fragmented, and there is continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat in northern Queensland, Australia.","This species appears to be restricted to specific habitats with all records being from the rhyolites of the Glen Gorden Volcanics (McDonald <em>et al.</em> 2000). It has been found around seepage areas in open eucalypt forests with an understorey comprising <em>Themeda triandra</em>, <em>Xanthorrhoea</em> sp., <em>Gahnia</em> sp., <em>Lophostemon suaveolens</em>, <em>Allocasuarina littoralis</em> and <em>A. torulosa</em> (McDonald <em>et al.</em> 2000). In areas where cattle grazing has reduced ground cover the species has also been located in leaf-litter build up in first order streams (McDonald <em>et al.</em> 2000). Its non-breeding habitat is unknown. It generally calls from seepage areas at the base of grass tussocks on wet summer and autumn nights (McDonald <em>et al.</em> 2000). Though primarily nocturnal, it may also call on overcast days (McDonald <em>et al.</em> 2000). The call is very similar to the winter-breeding <em>Pseudophryne major</em>, from south and central Queensland (Ingram and Corben 1994). From 6-82 eggs are laid on moist soil in or near seepage, usually under vegetation (McDonald <em>et al.</em> 2000). Observations suggest that the development of eggs pauses prior to hatching (McDonald <em>et al.</em> 2000). After hatching, the larva makes its way down the seepage or is washed into first order streams where development continues in small pools (McDonald <em>et al.</em> 2000).","Habitat loss and degradation appears to be the major threat. Its habitat occurs on land under a variety of tenures, including national parks, state forests, local government reserves, grazing leasehold properties, crown land, freehold lands and road reserves. Ninety-seven percent of frog sites are located on unprotected land, most of which is in state forest or timber reserve. There are several activities likely to occur on these lands, which may impact on the amount and quality of the frog’s habitat, including grazing, logging, road works, clearing and development. Habitat in the south-east of Timber Reserve 245 and Tumoulin State Forest has been severely affected by cattle grazing. Grazing and trampling has the potential to degrade and destroy the seepage areas used by the frogs for breeding. Similarly, erosion and subsequent siltation may cover seepage areas if future logging or clearing occurs.

Although this species is not usually targeted for bushmeat hunting due to its ""foul-taste"", it is shot when encountered, and consumed or used in traditional ""medicine"" (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003, Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana 2006). It has been found in trade in China, where it may be used for ""medicinal"" purposes (Nadler pers. comm.), although this is likely to be limited activity. With the exception of the Khau Ca forest population, there is high hunting pressure in the area where it lives, as evidenced by several gunshots heard almost daily during field trips (2004-2005) in the Na Hang Nature Reserve (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana 2006) and observations of hunters camps (Thach Mai Hoang 2011). Shifting and settled cultivation, as well as other land development activities, also pose a threat (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003, Le Xuan Canh 2006, Le Khac Quyet <em>et al</em>. 2007, Covert <em>et al</em>. 2008, Le Khac Quyet and Covert 2010). In the past, excessively intense and unsustainable legal and illegal logging and gold mining were the biggest threats. Recently, the development of a hydroelectric power project along the Gam River in Na Hang has seriously impacted its habitat, plus the sudden increases in human populations, especially construction workers, have led to increased demand for meat, and thus increased hunting pressure (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana, 2006). At the present time, hunting pressure continues to be high in Na Hang. In the Tung Vai area the largest threat is extensive cardamom cultivation and the population at Khau Ca is primarily threatened by an ongoing low level of habitat degradation.","<p>Tonkin Snub-nosed Monkey has recently been observed in Na Hang Nature Reserve in Tuyen Quang Province and in Khau Ca Forest and Tung Vai Forest in Ha Giang Province. It is also possible that it still occurs in Cham Chu Nature Reserve in Tuyen Quang (Le Khac Quyet and Covert 2010). A study of the Tat Ke sector of the Na Hang Nature Reserve in 1993 estimated a density of fewer than eight individuals/km² (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana 2006). The latest study at this location, in 2009-2010, found far lower densities. It is thought that hunting pressure is the reason for low densities in Tat Ke Sector. The highest estimate for any one population was in the Ban Bung sector of the Na Hang Nature Reserve, at between 90 and 110 individuals in 1992 (Ratajszczak <em>et al</em>. 1992). There has been significant population decline in both sectors of the Na Hang Nature Reserve, Tat Ke and Ban Bung (Le Xuan Canh and Boonratana 2006, Thach Mai Hoang 2011). Understanding of the number or the size of the subpopulations, with the exception of Khau Ca, is poor: with estimate of <em>ca</em> 20 individuals in Na Hang Nature Reserve (Thach Mai Hoang 2011); lack of recent observations at Cham Chu Nature although it may still occur at this site (Dong Thanh Hai <em>et al</em>. 2006); 130 individuals confirmed in the Tonkin Snub Nosed Monkey Species/Habitat Conservation Area at Khau Ca (Le Khac Quyet, pers. obs. 2015); and possibly 30-40 individuals in Tung Vai forest of Quan Ba District, Ha Giang Province, close to Chinese-Vietnamese border (Nguyen Van Truong 2012).

Meanwhile, there was growing awareness that the size of Sri Lanka’s forests was inadequate for the country’s environmental stability, and led to a Presidential decree that forest cover must be increased from 27% to 36% of the land area (Rajapakse 2010; Yatwara 2011).

Therefore, a comprehensive conservation awareness program was added to the research initiative. This program included a schools lecture and nature walk initiative to promote conservation awareness among the next generation of environmental stewards. It also included vocational training programs for adults to improve their opportunities for employment and income generation. The needs of community elders were addressed as well, through a health clinics initiative that provided medicines for old age problems like diabetes, hypertension, arthritis and spectacles and free cataract surgery for seniors with visual impairments. The success of this program led to its replication at a locality within the range of <span class=""MsoPageNumber""><em>S. v. monticola</em><span class=""MsoPageNumber""> where a reforestation project and initiatives to prevent firewood extraction from natural habitats were also underway. While conservation actions during the past six years were limited to two areas, several newspaper articles were published to promote conservation awareness throughout the country. <br/><br/>Future conservation actions will include field surveys of the known ranges of all four subspecies with the objective of identifying two or more sites within each range that could be developed as protected areas. The above-mentioned activities will then be launched in nearby communities, and people will also be trained in protected area administration and management, nature guiding and interpretation, small business management and other vocations that help to promote the sustainable use of their protected area under the supervision of the government’s Department of Wildlife Conservation. Efforts to mitigate human-monkey conflicts with active participation of local communities will also be an important component of future conservation actions.<br/><br/>Active participation of local communities in managing and deriving sustainable benefits from natural habitats is a new concept in Sri Lanka. It was presented and discussed during two workshops where it received favourable responses from government authorities and non-governmental organizations. Therefore, this idea has been incorporated into a Conservation Action Plan for all Sri Lankan monkey species that is currently being developed according to IUCN guidelines. When this Action Plan is completed it will be submitted to the Sri Lankan government and the IUCN for approval.<br/><br/>While a sensible conservation action plan has been developed its implementation will depend a great deal on political will, financial support and many unknowns about people and their environment. Therefore, even with unfettered financial and political support it may take several years to bring this action plan to fruition. However, a start has been made with the hope that the threat of endangerment and extinction of the Purple-faced Langur will be eliminated as soon as possible.<span class=""MsoPageNumber""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

This species experiences a considerable range in elevation of near sea level in the south to above 2,607 m in the north at Chendebji (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wangchuk <em>et al</em>. 2003). One isolated population is found in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, Nayakgaon, in the Kokrajhar district of Assam (Medhi&#160;et al. 2004). Study of this population has shown that the animals can withstand the effects of habitat change to some extent and survive in altered habitats (Medhi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004). The diet consists of young and mature leaves, ripe and unripe fruits, and seeds, with most feeding spent on young leaves (Gupta 1998, 2002). Subba (1989) and Subba and Santiapillai (1989), however, found that this species prefers fruits and buds to leaves. In forest fragments they may depend on cultivated crops such as tapioca, betel, and guava. It is diurnal and arboreal (Khajuria 1977).<br/><br/>Long-term field studies show that the species spends 12.8–33% in feeding, 40–63.14%in resting, 6.29–19% in locomotion, 5–11.54% in monitoring, 2–3.7% time in playing and 0.35–6% time grooming and other social activities (Mukherjee 1996, Chetry 2002, Biswas 2004, Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). The home range of the species varies from 2 to 58 ha depending on the habitat quality (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Being a folivore the principal share of its diet is leaves, yet they consume other food item like fruits, seeds, flowers and insects on a regular basis. The species spends 60% of the time on feeding leaves, 24.6% time on fruits, 5.99% time on petiole, 2.5% on flower and flower buds, and 2.56% on stem cortex and shoot. They were also reported eating gum, soil, algae and burned wild potatoes and arium, snail (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Chirang Reserve Forest, the buffer between Manas and Ripu-Chirang Elephant Reserve, the langurs were seen to feed on <em>Cryptocoryne retrospiralis</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>","<p>Due to habitat destruction, the populations of this species are restricted to fragmented forest pockets, especially in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em> 2004). Habitat destruction is the major threat to this species in India (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em> 2004). Hunting is prohibited in the Abhaya Rubber Plantation, yet electrocution from power lines and hunting by dogs are local threats, which are affecting the population (Medhi&#160;<em>et al.,</em>&#160;2004). A comparative analysis based on satellite images taken in 1988 and 1998 showed a 50% loss of original habitat in India for this species (Srivastava <em>et al</em>., 2001). Although commercial logging is banned in reserves where this species is found, illegal encroachment and logging, woodcutting and domestic fuel wood collection have severely affected the habitsats of the species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>., 2001). The political unrest, the settlement of&#160; refugee in the habitat, developmental activities , shifting cultivation, commercial logging, rubber plantation, contributed the habitat destruction of the species (Chetry <em>et al</em>., 2010).&#160; Stone quarrying and its associated noise pollution, as well as artillery firing practices in the Bamuni hills, may also have a negative effect.</p> <p>Recorded forest cover lost during 1997-2001 has been reported in the following as Chirang Reserve Forest (593 km<sup>2</sup>) reduced to 393 km<sup>2</sup>, and&#160;Bengaltal Reserve Forest reduced to 5 km<sup>2</sup> during this period and similar trend was reported throughout the distribution range in India except in protected areas. The habitat is still under tremendous anthrpogernic pressure in the form encroachments, expansion of agricultural activities&#160;and other development activities are existing&#160;and which is expected to&#160;continue in future too.&#160;There was massive habitat loss between 1989 and 2000, which resulted in severe fragmentation into 19 pockets where the Golden Langur survived until sometime and eventually disappeared (Choudhury, 2002).</p> <p>Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2003) list the following threats for this species: “Crop plantations, grazing, harvesting non-woody vegetation for firewood and charcoal production, selective logging, timber collection, human settlement, deforestation, fragmentation, trade, killed by domestic dogs, habitat loss, high juvenile mortality, inbreeding, and local trade in live animals as pets and in road shows. Trade is insignificant.” Due to road construction and other human activities (settlements), the northern and southern populations are completely separated and this has led to loss of suitable habitats and fragmentation (J. Das pers. comm.). There are potential threats to the population in the near future in India due to mustard cultivation and other human activities, and therefore the population is also expected to decline (J. Das pers. comm.).&#160;Poisoning due to organochlorine insecticide is another threat to the population as witnessed in a rubber plantation in Kokrajhar, Assam (Nath and Chakraborthy, 2011).</p><p>It is suspected that the rate of decline in India is well above 60%, definitely more than in Bhutan; but given the overall disturbance in both the countries due to increasing number of development projects, damming, conversion of forests for settlements, cultivation and plantations, the destruction of habitat is on the increase and is expected to continue into the future for another two decades at least at the same rate.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>A total of&#160;5,141 individuals in 566 troops were sighted in&#160;India in mid-to-late 2000s (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ghosh <em>et al</em>. 2009) and 6,637 individual reported from Bhutan in early 2000s (Wangchuk 2003). Demographic trends indicate a decline in the population of this species (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2001). Groups were bigger and densities higher in areas of more degraded habitat (Srivastava&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001), however, owing to disturbance and felling, the langurs remained in higher densities&#160;for quite some time but currently they have totally disappeared from degraded habitats. The langurs near the National Highway such as Bismuri and other places have vanished. The high density was due to crowding from sudden habitat loss and degradation. The langurs survived for quite some time in such habitat as the local people generally do not kill for meat unlike many other areas of northeastern India (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>The population has declined by more than 30% in the last 30 years, and is expected to decline further in the near future due to various threats outlined by field biologists in both India and Bhutan (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Population densities in Manas National Park, and Ripu and Chirrang reserve forests are 8 ind/km², 46 ind/km², and 64 ind/km², respectively. The Golden Langur Conservation Project saw a rise in the langurs population across the range in India, from 1,500 in 1997 to 5,600 in 2007–2012, and in Bhutan, estimated to be 6,600 in number. Estimated range size at present is 1,506 km². The density has also significantly increased from one individual/km² to 3.71 individuals/km² in 2009. Distribution&#160;area&#160;in the protected area and outside protected area in India is 1,993 km² and in the protected areas of Bhutan is 2,992 km² (Chetry <em>et al.</em> 2010). Overall there is no increase (except in some pockets) but populations have declined sharply in areas such as Chirang RF. In 1997 count, the coverage was poorer than in 2007-12, hence larger population in 2007–2012&#160;(Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019). <br/><br/>Populations of Golden Langurs in smaller fragments have lower nucleotide diversity than those in larger fragments.

Its distribution in Bhutan is limited to the foothills of the Black Mountains (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001, Chetri and Chetri 2009). The total known range of this species in both India and Bhutan is less than 30,000 km², and much of it is not suitable habitat (Srivastava <em>et al.</em> 2001).

However, Srivastava <em>et al</em>. (2001) reports that the species is also found in Ripu, Chirrang, and Manas Forest Reserves. Yet these reserves are unstable, and the complete protection of Manas National Park is needed (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). By upgrading the protection and status of this species, it is believed that isolated populations can be linked through corridors that will prevent genetic fragmentation (Srivastava <em>et al</em>. 2001). A long-term study is needed to assess the actual impact of habitat alteration on the species over long periods of time (Medhi <em>et al.</em> 2004). Medhi <em>et al.</em> (2004) suggest the following actions to protect the population of this species in Nayakgaon: insulation or diversion of electric lines, motivate villagers to restrain their dogs, planting of trees to develop a corridor between the Nayakgaon population and the Chakrashila population, a long term study of behaviour and ecology, and regular monitoring of the population. <br/><br/>Chetry and Chetry (2009) suggested habitat conservation, forested corridors linking the fragments, habitat restoration of the degraded forest, wild to wild translocation of isolated populations, community participation in forest management and trans-boundary&#160;conservation programme for the conservation of the species.

The species has a wide distribution, tolerance of a broad range of habitats, and is presumed to have a large population. However, it is facing threats from deforestation and/or hunting across its range, and although the species has a wider distribution in India than in Sri Lanka, suspected declines due to various threats in the two countries indicates that the species is not Least Concern as it was previously thought to be. The population is suspected to be declining, but at a rate approaching, but not yet meeting, the threatened category thresholds.","This species occurs in tropical primary and secondary rainforests, dry semi-deciduous forests, scrub, swamp, acacia, bamboo, edge, and montane cloud forest up to 2,000 m asl. Understory in dry forests and canopies in wet forests. Also found in home gardens, tea plantations, hotel gardens probably surviving mainly on insects. Two long term studies have been conducted on the ecology and behaviour of this species in India, and one such study has been conducted in Sri Lanka (Nekaris and Bearder 2006, Radhakrishna and Singh 2004). The highest densities of lorises on Sri Lanka occurred in the dry zone forests; also, the presence of species of this genus is positively associated with insect presence, and negatively associated with secondary forest with little undergrowth (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004, Kumara&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/><em>Loris lydekkerianus malabaricus&#160;</em>is found to occur more in cardamom plantations and in degraded and stunted rainforests than in primary rainforests (Kumara&#160;<em>et al</em>.,   2006). This species is characterized by a multi male/multi female   social system of spatial overlap (Sasi and Kumara 2014, Radhakrishna <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><em>Loris lydekkerianus lydekkarianus&#160;</em>seems to rely heavily on  undergrowth, and is often found in secondary growth forest (Nekaris and  Jayewardene 2004, Radhakrishna and Singh 2002). Singh&#160;<em>et al</em>.  (1999) found that relatively scrub forests and adjoining croplands are  the preferred habitat types of lorises in the Dindigul Forests of Tamil  Nadu, India. Loris are social with the 38% of activity in association  with other individuals (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013). Though primarily insectivores,&#160;<em>L. l. lydekkerianus</em>&#160;was  found to include plant material, fruits and seeds in their diet  (Radhakrishna and Kumara 2010). There is inter-species home range  variation: Mysore Slender Loris adult males ranging 3.6 ha and&#160;&#160;1.6 ha  for adult females. Roving males can have home range as large as 117 ha.  Ranges might overlap for males but not so for females which are almost  ‘exclusive’ (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><em><br/></em>Prior to taxonomic revision in 2020 (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2020), three subspecies were recognised in Sri Lanka: <em>L. l. grandis</em>, <em>L. l. nordicus</em> and <em>L. l. uva</em>. These are no longer recognised as separate taxa (and are now synonyms of <em>L. l. lydekkerianus</em>), however since this Red List assessment was carried out in 2015, populations previously identified as these taxa are referred to by their former subspecies names below.<em><br/><br/>Loris lydekkerianus nordicus</em>&#160;is apparently able to survive well near human habitations (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2003), as it was found more often associated with disturbed human habitation than with forest (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004); similar trends in India were found by Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(1999) and were associated with agricultural pest abundance.&#160;<em>Loris l. nordicus</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>L.l. lydekkarianus&#160;</em>seem to rely heavily on undergrowth, and are often found in secondary growth forest (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004, Radhakrishna and Singh 2002). This species is characterized by a multiple-male/multiple-female social system of spatial overlap. They sleep in groups of up to seven individuals and interact commonly throughout the night (Nekaris 2006, Radhakrishna 2001). <em>Loris lydekkerianus nordicus&#160;</em>is very well studied in captivity (Schulze and Meier 1995). They are primarily insectivorous (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004) and are  apparently able to survive well near human habitations (Nekaris and  Jayewardene, 2003), as <em>L. l. nordicus</em> was found more often associated with disturbed  human habitation than with forest (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2004).<br/><br/>L<em>oris lydekkerianus grandis</em> much prefers undisturbed forests than disturbed forests and this may cause its patchy distribution. It is found in a wide variety of habitats, including low wet evergreen forests, moist mixed evergreen forests, dry riverine forests, mid-elevation evergreen forests and a small portion of montane evergreen forests (Gamage&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press). Phillips kept&#160;<em>grandis</em>&#160;in captivity, reported it feeding on tree frogs, geckoes, and various kinds of insects, and it was mainly carnivorous (Phillips 1998, Nekari and Jayawardena 2004).<br/><br/><em>Loris lydekkerianus uva</em>&#160;is very rare but common in pristine undisturbed moist mixed evergreen forests (Gamage <em>et al</em>. 2017).","Severe habitat loss in Sri Lanka and India threatens this species (Nekaris and Jayewardene 2003, Nekaris and Schulze 2005, Nekaris and Bearder 2006).

Additional threats: occasional road kills and electrocution (Nekaris and Jayawardena 2004).<p><em>Loris lydekkerianus uva</em>: habitat loss from agriculture, plantations, development and human settlements is causing severe fragmentation, deforestation and degradation (Gamage <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>","<p>The population is suspected to have declined by 20–25% over the past few generations. Furthermore, it is suspected that this rate of decline will continue into the future. Population reductions are suspected to have occurred primarily due to habitat degradation and loss, as well as due to a number of other threats. <br/><br/>The encounter rate of&#160;<em>L. l. malabaricus&#160;</em>in Talakaveri is  0.21/km, in Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary it is 0.28/km, and in  Sharavati Valley Wildlife Sanctuary 0.35/km. Relative abundance of&#160;<em>L. l. malabaricus</em>&#160;in Kerala is &lt;0.2 lorises/km, except Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary, Konni, Thiruvanthapuram, Nemmara, and Chimmoney.&#160;<strong></strong>The encounter rate for&#160;<em>L. l. malabaricus</em>&#160;is 0.21 animals/km&#160;(Sasi and Kumara 2014, Radhakrishna <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Although&#160;<em>Loris lydekkerianus lydekkerianu</em>s is widely distributed, it is highly fragmented, except for a few places where populations are contiguous due to habitat contiguity. The density is very high in certain fragments due to lack of space for the dispersal; for example, 0.16 individuals/ha in Devrayandurga State Forest to 2.57 individuals/ha in Ippadi State Forest with highest density of 165 individuals /km² in Tumkur Forest Division. Ujjaini, Ippadi, Nagavalli, and Savanadurga have high densities of Slender Lorises at 1.85 individuals/ha. Such high densities are found in small patches and therefore cannot be extrapolated to area of occurrence.&#160;In some localities of the Eastern Ghats, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the population densities of&#160;<em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">L. l. lydekkerianu</em>s are rather high, although not as high as in Dindigul region (Singh&#160;<em style=""font-size: 11pt;"">et al.</em> 2000, Kumara <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Prior to taxonomic revision in 2020 (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2020), three subspecies were recognised in Sri Lanka: <em>L. l. grandis</em>, <em>L. l. nordicus</em> and <em>L. l. uva</em>.

In this study population densities of the animals were estimated using animal encounter rate (ex: animal/km).&#160;According to these authors,<em> </em><em>L. l. nordicus&#160;</em>had an encounter rate of mean 3.6 loris/km (range 0.33 to 50/km), whereas <em>L. l. grandis&#160;</em>was encountered at a mean of 0.42 /km (range&#160;&#160;0.11 to 3.3/km). The greater prevalence of&#160;<em>L. l. nordicus</em>&#160;than&#160;<em>L. l. grandis</em>&#160;had been noted earlier by Petter and Hladik (1970) who estimated a density of one loris per ha (100/km²) for&#160;<em>L. l. nordicus</em>&#160;in the dry zone forest at the Polonnaruwa Sanctuary, but far fewer <em>L. l. grandis</em>&#160;at 0.2 loris/ha (18/km²) in the wet zone hills of Udawattakelle Santuary of Kandy. Local populations that were formerly identified as <em>L. l. nordicus</em> can be relatively high; for example, in the protected forest surrounding the Smithsonian Primate Research Station at Polonnaruwa, densities may reach 3-5 loris/ha (300–500/km²) (WPJ Dittus, pers comm), somewhat greater than the density of 1/ha observed in the Polonnaruwa Nature Sanctuary (Petter and Hladik 1970).<br/><br/><em>Loris lydekkerianus grandis</em> much preferred undisturbed forests than disturbed forests, which may cause its patchy distribution (Gamage&#160;<em>et al</em>. in press).

For example, India has lost 19% of tree cover from 2002 to 2019 (Global Forest Watch 2020). Meanwhile, Sri Lanka lost 5.7% of its total tree cover during the same time period (Global Forest Watch 2020).","This species is traded in India due to superstitious beliefs among many locals. Lorises are used for various dubious practices such as selecting horoscopes, sacrifices, black magic, and to ward of evil eye. In some instances lorises are caught and killed for improving eyesight in humans (Smitha Daniel, pers. comm.).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed in CITES Appendix II, and classified under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act (1972).

The population is severely fragmented in small subpopulations, none with more than 250 mature individuals. The species’ total area of occupancy is estimated as just above 200 km², separated into more than a hundred fragments of varying in size (4 to 3,000 ha). These fragments are situated in a landscape predominantly composed by cattle ranches, extensive agriculture (sugar cane, silviculture, citriculture) and expanding urban zones pervaded by roads and power-lines. Living in such a scenario, the remnant population is declining mainly due to deforestation. This results in the direct reduction and fragmentation of existing subpopulations. The continued degradation of occupied fragments is mainly due to edge effects and selective small-scale logging, resulting in a habitat quality reduction. Sporadic hunting, road accidents, electrocution and predation by domestic dogs represent additional threats to the species.","<em>Callicebus coimbrai</em> occurs in coastal Atlantic forests of the states of Bahia and Sergipe in northeastern Brazil. According to Souza-Alves <em>et al</em>. (2014) some forest fragments at Sergipe are mainly composed of plant species from the families Bignoniaceae, Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, Polygonaceae, Sapotaceae and Arecaceae. Souza-Alves and Barbosa (in press) identified phyto-sociological parameters for certain forest patches, demonstrating that areas with <em>C. coimbrai </em>consist of different conservation levels: forests in a secondary stage of regeneration (basal area: 21.2 m2/ha; tree density: 3,530 individuals/ha; mean diameter of trees: 6.9±6.0 cm; mean height of trees: 8.3±6 m; liana density: 940 m2/ha), and forest in an advanced stage of regeneration (basal area: 39.5 m2/ha; tree density: 1,540 individuals/ha; mean diameter of trees: 10.6±9.7 cm; mean height of trees: 10.7±5.1 m; liana density: 366.6 m2/ha).&#160;<br/><em><br/>Callicebus coimbrai</em> is an arboreal and quadrupedal species, usually observed in secondary habitats and in the middle or lower strata (3-8 m above ground; Chagas &amp; Ferrari 2010). The species was observed eating and playing on the ground whilst moving from one food trees to another (Souza-Alves <em>et al.</em> in prep.). The species is predominantly frugivorous, but also exploits other types of food such as mature and young leaves, flowers, seeds and insects (Souza-Alves <em>et al</em>. 2011). It was also observed preying on nesting birds (Vinhas and Souza-Alves 2014). Lianas are also used as a food sources, especially for the consumption of new leaves and unripe fruits.&#160;Studying two groups of<em> C. coimbrai</em> in Atlantic forest fragments of different size at Sergipe, Souza-Alves (2013) verified that the species spent most of time resting, followed by moving and feeding. A monogamous breeding pair and its offspring usually compose a familiar group, with the group size ranging from 2 to 8 individuals (Bicca-Marques and Heymann 2013). Home range size varies according to the size of forest fragments. Souza-Alves (2013) observed a home range of 7.4 ha for groups in a large forest fragment (522 ha), and 9.8 ha for groups in small fragments (14 ha). The daily path length of <em>C. coimbrai</em> varies from 694 m to 1073 m (Souza-Alves 2013).","<em>Callicebus coimbrai</em> is endemic to the Atlantic Forest, a biome reduced to app. 12% of its original coverage. The situation is even worse in those forests that are situated within the species range, in northeastern Brazil, where less than 5% forest cover is remaining (Ribeiro <em>et al.</em> 2009; Campanili and Schaffer 2010). This drastic reduction resulted from the excessive consumption of natural forest for agriculture (mainly cattle grazing) and cash crops (sugar cane) starting with the European colonization in the 16th century&#160; (Dean 1995; Coimbra-Filho and Câmara 1996). More recently the region faced some other intensive production schemes such as silviculture and citriculture, and is currently characterized by the rapid development of an extensive network of highways and the expansion of urban zones along the coast (Printes <em>et al.</em> 2013; Jerusalinsky 2013). Moreover, the implementation of federal programs aiming to improve the production and distribution of electric energy increased the density of power lines across the region.&#160;In this context, habitat loss and fragmentation represent the main threats for the species, as the small fragmented populations of titi monkeys are exposed to the synergistic effects of genetic and demographic risks (Ferrari <em>et al.</em> 2013; Printes <em>et al</em>. 2013; Jerusalinsky 2013). Almost two third of fragments in which the species was recorded measure not more than 100 ha, and half of them is below 25 ha, thus maintaining tiny population sizes, as low as a single group (Jerusalinsky 2013). hunting and capture for the pet trade were recently registered but due to the small body size and the shy behavior they do not represent a major threat to the species survival. (Sousa <em>et al</em>. 2008; Jerusalinsky 2013). Nevertheless, these threats may have an increasing impact on <em>C. coimbrai</em> as its populations become gradually more exposed to the reduction and fragmentation of forest patches (Jerusalinsky 2013). Electrocution, road kills and predation by domestic dogs represent another increasing risk since development programs advance and human populations grow larger and denser across the species’ range (Printes <em>et al.</em> 2013; Jerusalinsky 2013).","Considering that the area of occupancy estimated for <em>Callicebus coimbrai</em> covers approximately 22,500 ha, Jerusalinsky (2013) calculated a total remnant population of approximately 4,500 individuals. This estimate was based on an extrapolation of the medium population density established for the species (0.20 individuals/ha; Chagas and Ferrari 2011; Rocha 2011), on known group sizes and group densities (4 individuals per group and 5 groups/km²; Bicca-Marques and Heymann 2013) and on direct observations (Jerusalinsky 2013). In a more conservative estimation, Jerusalinsky (2013) considered only the effectively recorded groups and a medium group size of four individuals to calculate a population estimate of app. 650 individuals. Despite this wide variation, the number of mature individuals should be more than 250 and less than 2,500 individuals, which are the threshold values for the category Endangered under the criterion C. Furthermore, as the largest fragment occupied by the species measures app. 3,000 ha, Jerusalinsky (2013) concluded that no subpopulation contains more than 250 mature individuals. A population decline is suspected.",Decreasing,"Kobayashi and Langguth (1999) described <em>Callicebus coimbrai</em>&#160;from three sites in the state of Sergipe, northeastern Brazil, and proposed the range of the species to be limited to the coastal rainforest of this region, extending from the right (south) bank of the Rio São Francisco, in Sergipe, to the left (north) bank of the Rio Itapicuru, in northern Bahia. In the following years, some new localities were reported from inside this range (Sousa 2000, 2003). While searching for the distributional limits of <em>Callicebus barbarabrownae</em>, Printes (2005) recorded <em>C. coimbrai </em>at Lamarão do Passé, Bahia, extending the species’ range 200 km further south of that proposed by Kobayashi and Langguth (1999). Subsequently, several surveys have substantially increased the knowledge about the species’ distribution and conservation status (Jerusalinsky <em>et al.</em> 2006; Printes 2007; Sousa <em>et al.</em> 2008; Ferrari <em>et al</em>. 2013; Marques <em>et al.</em> 2013; Hilário 2013; Jerusalinsky 2013). The taxon is now confirmed for 125 sites in the states of Bahia and Sergipe, which encompass an estimated total area of occupancy of 22,500 ha (225 km²), representing less than 1% of its original extent of occurrence of about 30,000 km² (Jerusalinsky 2013). These sparsely occupied fragments vary in size from 5 ha or less (for example Lamerão/Minas d’Água, Bahia, and Fazenda Riacho Seco, Sergipe, both with 4 ha) to 1,000 ha. The largest fragment with about 3,000 ha is located in the southernmost part of its current distribution at São Francisco do Paraguaçu in Bahia (Sousa <em>et al</em>. 2008; Hilário 2013; Jerusalinsky 2013).&#160;To the north the species’ distribution is limited by the São Francisco River, since no records or reports of <em>Callicebus</em> were obtained from the left bank of this river which was systematically searched by several primates surveys recently conducted in the region (Jerusalinsky 2013, Fialho <em>et al.</em> 2014). To the East, a small forest belt along the Atlantic Ocean coast separates the species from reaching the coast since it seems the species is completely absent from certain vegetation (forest) types growing along the coast such as mangroves and restingas (Jerusalinsky 2013). To the South, the lower Paraguaçu River forms the limit between the geographic ranges of <em>C. coimbrai</em>, restricted to the left (or north) bank, and <em>C. melanochir</em>, found on the right (or south) bank (Printes <em>et al.</em> 2013; Jerusalinsky 2013). Further west, in the region of Feira de Santana, both banks of the Paraguaçu River are inhabited by <em>C. barbarabrownae</em> (Printes 2007; Printes <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2013). Without a physical barrier between the eastern distributional limit of <em>C. barbarabrownae</em> and the western limit of <em>C. coimbrai</em>, these two species appear to be delimited by an ecological barrier of about 50 km, that is the drier forests associated with the Caatinga biome to the West (<em>C. barbarabrownae</em>) and the more humid habitats associated with the Atlantic Forest to the East (<em>C. coimbrai</em>; Jerusalinsky 2013; Printes <em>et al.</em> 2013; Ferrari <em>et al.</em> 2013). Complementary surveys and genetic studies are required to fully understand the preterit and current patterns of distribution of these two species.","Although cases of hunting and live capture were reported for <em>C. coimbrai</em> (Jerusalinsky et al. 2006; Sousa <em>et al.</em> 2008; Jerusalinsky 2013), they do not represent the major threats for the species (Jerusalinsky 2013). Nevertheless, hunting may have an increasing impact on <em>C. coimbrai</em> as its population becomes gradually more exposed to hunting due to a reduction and fragmentation of forest patches, thus facilitating easy access for hunters (Jerusalinsky 2013). The few reported cases in which <em>C. coimbrai</em> was maintained as a pet, resulted from sporadic encounters of individuals dispersing through a fragmented landscape. Informants consistently report this species as non-adequate to be kept in captivity (Jerusalinsky 2013). There are no reported cases on the commercialization of this species for the pet trade (or other utilizations).",Terrestrial,"In 2011, the National Center for Research and Conservation of Brazilian Primates (CPB/ICMBio/MMA) coordinated the elaboration of the National Action Plan for the Conservation of Northeastern Primates, setting the conservation strategies for five species, including<em> C. coimbrai</em> (Brazil/ICMBio 2011). This plan established goals to protect the remaining habitats of the species and to work on establishing the connectivity between populations. The Action Plan initiated several studies to better understand the risks and the use of space by the species in a severely fragmented landscape. Although first scientific results (see Ferrari<em> et al</em>., 2013; Hilário 2013; Jerusalinsky 2013; Marques <em>et al.</em> 2013; Souza-Alves 2013) were transferred into conservation action, there is still more to do to effectively reduce the risks of extinction. The ‘Refúgio de Vida Silvestre Mata do Junco’ (Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge), decreed in December 2007 by the Sergipe State government, remains the only strictly protected area containing populations of <em>Callicebus coimbrai</em>. Measuring app. 900 ha, this protected area was particularly created to protect this species. Besides that, a dozen of small, privately owned reserves and a handful of non-federal and state protected areas also provide some protection to the few remaining habitat patches. Aiming to reduce pressure on remnant populations, some restrictions and mitigating measures were adopted at both the federal and the state level, for the establishment of new rural settlements and in environmental licensing processes (such as gas pipelines). At both state and municipal levels, less specific initiatives have already been implemented. The species is listed in CITES Appendix II.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Fortunately most immigrants come from southern Brazil, and they do not normally hunt primates.<br/>The principal threats for the species are rural settlements, agriculture, urban expansion, deforestation, extension of the energy network, increased road construction, reduction of habitat and hunting. Strong threats such as continuation of deforestation, construction of hydropower plants and small hydroelectric power plants, transmission lines and rural settlements affect approximately of 50% of the habitat in the distribution range of the taxon.

The species is found in 12 sites, with a total area of occupancy less than 2,000 km². Useable habitat changes periodically with monsoon flooding, especially in Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park, and Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary. Populations are severely fragmented, and more than 70% of the population is found in Assam's Kaziranga National Park; a catastrophic event there could have a devastating impact on the species. Habitat loss and degradation due to invasion by alien plants into grasslands, grazing, human encroachment and silting up is occurring in part of the species' range,","The species inhabits the riverine grasslands of the Terai and Brahmaputra Basins (Foose and van Strien 1997). The species prefers these alluvial plain grasslands, but was known to occur in adjacent swamps and forests. The populations are currently restricted to habitats surrounded by human-dominated landscapes, so that the species often occurs in adjacent cultivated areas, pastures, and secondary forests. The diet includes mainly grasses, but also some fruit, leaves, shrub and tree branches, and cultivated crops (Nowak 1999). Greater One-horned Rhinos also regularly utilize mineral licks. Males are solitary, with unstructured, overlapping territories. Females are solitary unless they have a calf. Calves remain with their mother for 3-4 years.<br/><br/>Its life history characteristics are not well known, with longevity estimated at 30-45 years, gestation length of approximately 16 months (as with other rhino species), and age at sexual maturity estimated at 5-7 years for females and 8-10 years for males (Nowak 1999, International Rhino Foundation website 2018).","The Greater One-horned Rhinoceros declined to near extinction in the early 1900s, primarily due to widespread conversion of alluvial plains grasslands to agricultural development, which led to human-rhino conflicts and easier accessibility for hunters. Sport hunting became common in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A reversal of government policies shortly thereafter protected many of the remaining populations. However, poaching, mainly for the use of the horn in Traditional Asian Medicine, has remained a constant threat and the success is precarious without continued support for conservation efforts in India and Nepal. Past poaching led to declines in several important populations, especially those in Chitwan, Manas, Laokhowa, and the Babai Valley area of Bardia, but in the past 5 years, poaching has decreased and the populations in these areas are increasing (except for Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary).<br/><br/>However, not all recent population decreases can be linked to poaching. There have been serious declines in quality of habitat in some areas. This is due to: 1) severe invasion by alien plants into grasslands affecting some populations; 2) demonstrated reductions in the extent of grasslands and wetland habitats due to woodland encroachment and silting up of beels; and 3) grazing by domestic livestock. In Chitwan National Park (the second largest population), poaching alone does not account for the observed level of population decline (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.), and there are trends in a number of reproductive indicators (i.e., decline in the percentage of adult females calving and in the percentage of the population that is calves) that are strongly indicative of negative changes in habitat quality. In Chitwan, there has been severe infestation of some riverine and grassland areas by the climbing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mikania micrantha</span> (which covers over indigenous vegetation), and invasion of <em>Eupatorium</em> in other areas (Murphy, et al., 2013). There is also heavy livestock grazing pressure and disturbance in buffer zone areas as well as some invasion of grasslands by <em>Acacia catechu</em> and <em>Dalbergia sissou</em>.&#160;<br/><br/>In India, there is not yet any evidence that invasion by alien plants has caused any population decreases. However, in Orang National Park, there have been marked habitat changes due to grazing, human encroachment and silting up. In particular, short grass areas have declined by 75% due to silting up and draining of <em>beels, </em>lake-like wetlands with static water&#160;(B.N. Talukdar, pers. comm.). <em>Mimosa</em> is also an alien invader in this area. In the Karnali floodplain area of Bardia there is also some invasion of habitat by the alien <em>Lantana camara</em>. <br/><br/>In Pabitora, there has been an invasion of <em>Ipomoea s</em><em>pp.</em>&#160;""weeds"" and <em>Parthenium spp.</em>&#160;into grassland areas (S. Dutta, pers. comm.). There also has been an invasion of woodland into grassland and siltation and drying up of some water bodies. There also has been some human encroachment and very heavy livestock grazing. With increasing human densities this pressure is unlikely to get any less (S. Dutta pers. comm.). Analysis of satellite imagery has shown that there has a substantial increase in woodland (34.51%) in Pabitora since 1977 accompanied by decline in alluvial grassland (68%)&#160;(Sarma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). This change of habitat is mostly because of natural succession process, livestock grazing from the nearby villages as well as improper management of the grassland habitat (Sarma <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <br/>The West Bengal populations (Jaldapara and Gorumara) are affected by high levels of grazing from fringe villages, and there have been weed and climber infestations by <em>Mikania cordata</em>, <em>M. scandens</em>, <em>Lantana camara, Christella dentata,</em> and <em>Leea</em> spp. <br/> <br/>The species is inherently at risk because over 70% of its population occurs at a single site, Kaziranga National Park. This area, is subject to poaching and tensions with the surrounding high human population due to human-wildlife conflicts (including conflicts with rhinos). The level of poaching in Kaziranga has generally not been at a level to prevent the ongoing increase in the population, but constant vigilance is required. At least 12 rhinos were lost in the July 2019 monsoon floods, and numerous calves were rescued. Any severe catastrophic event in Kaziranga (such as disease, civil disorder, poaching, habitat loss, etc.) would have a devastating impact on the species.<br/><br/>During surveys carried out in February 2019, Jaldapara and Gorumara reported figures of 231 and 52 rhinos respectively - the highest numbers recorded during the last 100 years. There are suggestions that the two protected areas have reached their carrying capacities and suitable areas need to be found for the West Bengal populations. A male:female:unknown sex ratio of 3.8.1 has been reported in the Gorumara population based on dung DNA analysis (Borkathur, <em>et al</em>. 2016). As a result, fights among bulls are very common and these animals often stray out of the National Park, leading to human-wildlife conflicts (S. S. Bist, pers. comm).<br/><br/>There are suggestions that the small population of rhinos in Jaldapara and Gorumara may be prone to inbreeding depression (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There have been proposals to dam the Bramaphutra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen in future things could very negatively affect the habitat quality and rhino carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods). In Jaldapara National Park, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in Jaldapara National Park is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools used by rhinos are slowly drying up (S.S. Bist, pers. comm).","The total population estimate in August 2018 was estimated to be 3,588 individuals, with estimates of 649 animals in Nepal and 2,939 in India (B. Talukdar pers. comm.). The greater one-horned rhino, with strict protection from Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, has recovered from very low numbers in the early 1900s. Only 12 rhinos remained in Kaziranga National Park in 1905; it is unknown how many animals existed in the combined India-Nepal populations at that time. Although some populations have declined in recent years, overall the species has continued to increase for almost 100 years.<br/><br/><strong>India</strong><br/>The species exists in several protected areas in India: Dudhwa National Park, Manas National Park, Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park, Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary, Jaldapara National Park, and Gorumara National Park. Kaziranga National Park, which was established as a reserve for the last 12 Indian rhinos in Assam in 1905, is home to more than 70% of the global population. A population has been re-established in Manas National Park under the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 program (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2015), where greater one-horned rhinos had extirpated in the late 1990s/early 2000s during a civil conflict. <br/><br/>Poaching rendered the species extinct in Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary by the mid-1990s (Foose and van Strien 1997). Stray animals are occasionally seen in Laokhowa and Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuaries. There also were record from Valmiki Reserve in Bihar, which has habitat contiguity with Chitwan National Park (A.U. Choudhury, pers. comm.). The population in Katerniaghat is best described as transient (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Nepal</strong><strong><br/></strong>In the late 1960s, an estimated 65 Indian rhinos survived in Nepal, but due to increased conservation efforts, the total population grew to 649 in 2018. During a period of insurgency from 2000-2003, at least 91 animals were poached (Martin 2004) but poaching rates have significantly decreased within the last decade. In Royal Chitwan National Park, the population declined from 544 individuals in 2000 to 372 individuals in 2005 (IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007), but has since rebounded to 592 in 2018. In Royal Bardia National Park (where rhinos were re-introduced) there were approximately 40 individuals in 1997 (Foose and van Strien, 1997) and 37 animals in 2007 (IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007). The population reached a low of 17 animals in the early 2000s, but by 2018 has&#160;grown to roughly 30 individuals, including five animals&#160;translocated&#160;from Royal Chitwan National Park in 2016-2017. In Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (where the species was also re-introduced), the population was only six individuals (Martin 2004, IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007) but by August 2018 had grown to 17, including two rhinos translocated in 2016-2017 from Royal Chitwan National Park. There is a tiny population in Parsa.",Increasing,"Historically, the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros once existed across the entire northern part of the Indian subcontinent, along the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra River basins, from Pakistan to the Indian-Burmese border, including parts of Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan (Foose and van Strien 1997). It may also have existed in Myanmar, southern China, and Indochina, although this is uncertain. The species was common in northwestern India and Pakistan until around 1600, but disappeared from this region shortly after this time (Rookmaker 1984). The species declined sharply in the rest of its range from 1600-1900, until it was on the brink of extinction at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Currently, the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros is found in eight protected areas in India&#160;(Kaziranga, Pabitora, Manas, Orang, Jaldapara, Gorumara, Dudhwa, Katerniaghat)&#160;and in four protected areas in Nepal (Chitwan, Bardia, Suklaphanta, Parsa) (Foose and van Strien 1997, Ellis, <em>et al.</em> 2015, Emslie <em>et al. </em>2016). In India, rhinoceros from Gorumara National Park frequently visit adjoining forests; Nepali rhinos frequently visit adjoining areas in India.",This species is harvested illegally for its horn and other products used in Traditional Asian Medicine and as a status symbol in Vietnam and China. Myanmar has become the transit route for horn coming from India and Nepal.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The species has been included on CITES Appendix I since 1975. The Indian and Nepalese governments have taken major steps towards Greater One-horned Rhinoceros conservation, often with assistance from non-governmental organizations.<br/><br/>Greater One-horned Rhino populations occur almost exclusively within and around Protected Areas. In India, the species occurs in Kaziranga National Park (World Heritage Site), Manas National Park (World Heritage Site), Dudhwa National Park (re-introduced population), Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Orang National Park, Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary, Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, and Gorumara National Park. In Nepal, the species occurs in Royal Chitwan National Park, Royal Bardia National Park (re-introduced population), and Royal Suklaphanta Wildife Reserve (a small re-introduced population). Stray rhinos are recorded in Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary, and Valmiki Tiger Reserve (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm).<br/><br/>Strict anti-poaching measures are needed to maintain all of these populations. It is also important to reduce human-wildlife conflicts around these areas, and this might involve fencing. Many of the areas also require targeted programmes to control invasive plants, to prevent the spread of woodland, to safeguard wetlands through appropriate water management, and to limit the extent of grazing by domestic livestock. In Pabitora, specific recommendations have been made to increase the quality of feeding habitat of rhino within the sanctuary through meticulous manipulation and checking livestock grazing (Sarma <em>et al</em>., 2009). Water holding mechanisms within the sanctuary during winter are crucial in terms of keeping moist grassland available in winter seasons, thereby reducing the number of rhinos straying out of the sanctuary and thus exposing themselves to poaching (Sarma <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The Indian Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has embarked on a project to create DNA profiles of all the country's rhinos in collaboration with WWF-India and the Wildlife Institute of India (S.S. Bist pers. comm).<br/><br/>The area of Kaziranga National Park has officially been extended, although animals had access to this area previously as the original park area was not fenced. In West Bengal (Jaldapara and Gorumara), there is a programme of habitat improvement in old teak areas, weed control is being carried out in 50-60 ha annually.<br/><br/>Grasslands in India are being improved through controlled burning and planting of fodder species. Artificial wallow and water conservation structure have been created. Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary had was upgraded to a National Park in 2012. The government of West Bengal has been developing an 21-km<sup>2</sup> site in Coochbehar District to accommodate surplus animals from Jaldapara and Gorumara National Parks, and other sites are being considered (S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>With the support of the IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group, Indian Rhino Vision 2020 and a Nepal Rhino Action Plan (Government of Nepal 2006) have been developed. These cover a number of important and specific conservation measures, including translocating rhinos to bolster struggling populations and to start new populations (e.g., Manas National Park); improving security around rhino populations and reducing poaching; assessing habitat status and management needs; expanding available habitat through active management; improving protected area infrastructure; training staff in specific rhino conservation techniques; reducing human-wildlife conflicts; involving local people in rhino conservation; and implementing education and awareness programmes. Overall, there is a need for further reintroductions, thereby reducing the concentration of more than 70% of the individuals in one large population.<br/><br/>To further strengthen rhino protection in Assam, the government amended the Wildlife Protection Act - 1972 in 2009 with increased sentences and fines for poaching rhinos.

Its distribution is fragmented in parts of its range. The distribution of the species appears to be strongly limited by temperature, and effects of temperature on moisture availability in its high-elevation rainforest habitat. Models suggest that its range will decline in the near future due to climate change (Williams <em>et al.&#160;</em>2003). For these reasons, the species is considered close to qualifying for Vulnerable under criterion B1ab(ii,iii,v).","It is a nocturnal, arboreal species that prefers cool, wet, primary rainforest, typically in the core rather than on the margins of suitable habitat. It rests in tree hollows, and feeds on the foliage of trees, often high in the canopy (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). This species appears to be very sensitive to the effects of fragmentation and disappears from isolated rainforest patches of 40-80 ha or less (Winter <em>et al.</em> 2008). It does not use narrow forest corridors.","There are no major threats to the species at present.

The decline is observed from monitoring in Australia and inferred from  the impacts of exploitation, deforestation and habitat degradation in  Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Indonesia.<br/><br/>Generation length in the wild population has been estimated as 7-8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014). In Australia, monthly population estimates from May 2004 to May  2019 (&lt;3 generations) show a strong and consistent decline in the  order of 75% (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2018). In PNG and Indonesia, where  population-wide estimates have not been made, the species is understood  to be seriously impacted by hunting and increasing rates of  deforestation and degradation of lowland forest from logging and  conversion to oil palm plantations (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Stibig <em>et al.</em> 2014, S. Hamilton, T. Leary and B. Roberts pers. comm.).","Most of the detailed information on roosting and feeding habitat is  based on studies from the Wet Tropics region of Australia. Further  research is required in the northern areas of the range extending into  PNG and Indonesia.<br/><br/><em>Pteropus conspicillatus</em> is found in a range of  habitats including Melaleuca swamp forest, wet and dry sclerophyll  forests and woodlands, mangrove, tropical savannah and tropical moist  forests (Duncan <em>et al.</em> 1999). It has been recorded in primary and  disturbed native vegetation, and in agricultural and urban areas. The  species roosts in colonies ranging in size from hundreds to thousands of  individuals (Bonaccorso 1998, DERM 2010, T. Leary pers. comm.). Roost  sizes in Australia are typically larger than in PNG and Indonesia.  Recent telemetry studies in the Wet Tropics have shown a low level of  solitary roosting (Westcott and McKeown 2014). There is evidence that  the proportion of animals in urban roost sites is increasing (Tait <em>et al.</em>  2014), although the overall population is in decline. <em>P. conspicillatus</em>  usually forms single-species colonies, although it occasionally  co-roosts with <em>P. scapulatus </em>and small numbers of <em>P. hypomelanus</em> and<em> P.  alecto</em> at a limited number of sites (Bonaccorso 1998, Parsons <em>et al.</em>  2010). In both Australia and PNG roosts can have a long history, &gt;80  years for some e.g., Tolga and &gt;20 years for many others (e.g.,  Gordonvale in Australia and Lae and Madang in PNG). This species  disperses widely and will occupy new, often temporary, roost sites,  particularly following cyclones (Shilton <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>The  diet is comprised primarily of floral and fruit resources obtained in a  broad variety of habitats, with nectar and pollen from myrtaceous  plants and fruit from Moraceae (e.g., <em>Ficus</em>) being the dominant taxa  (Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2006, DERM 2010).<br/><br/>Reproduction is seasonal and synchronous throughout the Australian range (Shilton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Females give birth to a single young between October and December and mating occurs between March and May (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1996, Hall and Richards 2000, Shilton <em>et al.</em>  2008). The timing of reproduction outside of Australia has not been  systematically examined, but is believed to be similar (Flannery  1995a,b). Although some births have been observed during July and early  August in Madang, PNG (Bonaccorso 1998).<br/><br/>Results from population  monitoring, genetic and telemetry studies in the Wet Tropics indicate  frequent movement by individuals between roosts both daily and  seasonally (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2001, Parsons 2005, Fox 2006, Shilton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015). Telemetry studies suggest that individual <em>P. conspicillatus  </em>likely range over much of the Wet Tropics during their life time and  individuals are known to fly up to 50 km from their roost in a single  night to feed, with longer distance movements between roosts recorded  over one and several nights (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2015). Movements between PNG and Australia have not been shown, but could possibly occur.","A range of threats have been identified for <em>P. conspicillatus</em>. Key  threats (also see table below) include habitat loss, exploitation,  harassment at roosts, electrocution, shooting in orchards, and tick  paralysis (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2001, DERM 2010, Dennis 2012, Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Decline  of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> in Australia has been associated with habitat  loss, and persecution such as electrocution and shooting at orchards  (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 1999, DERM 2010). The impact of lethal crop  protection is believed to have decreased in recent years with  prohibition of high voltage electricity grids and with the wide-spread  adoption of canopy netting on orchards. However, permits to shoot  flying-foxes for commercial crop protection were re-instated by the  Queensland government in 2012 after a four-year ban. Rates of clearing  of rainforest in the coastal and upland areas in the majority of the Wet  Tropics Bioregion have been reduced and are no longer significant  (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D. Westcott pers. comm.). However, there has  been an intensification of agriculture on the dry western margins of  the range and an increase in clearing of sclerophyll vegetation types  important for the species in these areas (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D.  Westcott pers. comm). Habitat loss for human development impacts coastal  areas and plateaus. Recent escalation in rates of transition of  sclerophyll vegetation types to closed rainforest has been documented  and attributed to changed fire management regimes (Stanton <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Conflict  between humans and <em>P. conspicillatus</em> in built up areas appears to be  growing as the proportion of the population using roosts in urban areas  increases (Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014). Methods for ameliorating conflict  typically include modification or removal of roosting vegetation and the  use of noise and other disturbances to disperse animals away from human  occupied areas. The long-term impact of dispersals on <em>P. conspicillatus</em>  is unknown. However, conflict at roosts hinders conservation measures.<br/><br/>More recently, tick paralysis has been identified as an increasing threat to the species (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2008, Fox 2011, Buettner <em>et al.</em> 2013). Buettner <em>et al.</em> (2013) found that mortality varied between years, with more adult females affected than males.<br/><br/><em>Pteropus  conspicillatus</em> are also threatened by mortality from entanglement in  backyard drape netting, collision and entanglement in barbed-wire  fences, electrocution on power lines, cleft palate and other birth  deformities (Richards <em>et al.</em> 2008, Shilton <em>et al.</em> 2008, DERM 2010, J. Maclean pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The  impact of climate change is unclear but is likely to increase the  severity of cyclones and other extreme weather (i.e., heat events) that  can kill large numbers and impact the feeding and roosting habitat of  the species (DERM 2010). The recent invasion of myrtle rust and tramp  ants (electric and yellow crazy ants) into the Wet Tropics region is  also a concern for the future status of Wet Tropics species (Metcalfe <em>et al.</em>  2014). In PNG and Indonesia, the range of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> is  typically confined to coastal lowlands and islands. These areas are most  densely populated by people and subject to the most rapid land use  change as documented by remote sensing (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Stibig <em>et al.</em>  2014). Increasing rates of habitat loss or modification through  residential expansion and the clearing of large tracts of forests for  expanding oil palm production continue to be a major threat to the  species (T. Leary pers. comm.). Logging operations are also expanding in  the range of <em>P. conspicillatus</em>, particularly in the West Papua province  of Indonesia and the Madang and Morobe provinces of PNG (Stibig <em>et al.</em>  2014). Hunting is another significant threat as flying-foxes are an  important food source for many communities and sold as food at local  markets (Mack and West 2005, S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm., B.  Roberts pers. obs). In both Madang and Lae, <em>P. conspicillatus</em> are hunted  and disturbed on an almost daily basis (T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts  pers. obs.). <br/><br/>The impacts of these threats combined with the species’s low reproductive output (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2008) and the population’s low estimated average exponential rate of increase (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2018) highlight the likelihood of continual decline into the projected future.","Two subspecies are recognised: <em>Pteropus conspicillatus conspicillatus</em> (Australia and  northern and eastern PNG) and <em>P. c. chrysauchen</em> (Irian and Moluccan  populations, Indonesia) (Flannery 1995b, Bonaccorso 1998).<br/><br/>Population size in Australia in November 2004 was estimated at approximately 250,000 and declined to 75,000 in 2016 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2018). Additional monitoring in November 2018 showed further declines  and a population estimate of 44,000. There has been no systematic  monitoring of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> in PNG and Indonesia, and little is  known about total population size in this region. In PNG, the largest  known roosts of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> are in the built-up areas of Madang  and Lae. The numbers of animals at these two sites have been relatively  stable over the last few decades, with a combined population of  &lt;10,000 and roost estimates of 5,000-7,000 at Madang and 2,000-7,000  in Lae (Bonaccorso 1998, S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts  pers. obs). Roosts in other locations are small, ranging from a few  hundred to several hundred animals (S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers.  comm.). Anecdotal information indicates that the species is likely under  a high degree of pressure from hunting and habitat modification (S.  Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts pers. obs).",Decreasing,"This species has been recorded from the Moluccan Archipelago of  Indonesia (including the islands of Halmahera, Bacan, Obi, Misool, and  Gebe), it is present on Salawati Island (Indonesia), Waigeo Island, Biak  and Yapen islands (Indonesia), coastal areas of the island of New  Guinea (Irian Jaya, Indonesia and PNG), the D’Entrecasteaux Islands  (PNG), and the Louisade Archipelago (PNG). In Australia it ranges  patchily from Cape York (Iron and McIllwraith Ranges), to the Wet  Tropics Bioregion and through to coastal central Queensland between  Mackay and Rockhampton (Flannery 1995a,b; Bonaccorso 1998; Wiantoro  2011), with the main Australian population in the Wet Tropics (Shilton <em>et al.</em>  2008, Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management  (DERM) 2010). Records in PNG and Indonesia are from coastal lowland  habitats (&lt;200 m) except for one feeding observation at 1,000 m asl  (Flannery 1995b, Bonaccorso 1998, Wiantoro 2011). In Australia it roosts  and feeds at low to mid altitudes (generally &lt;750 m) and has been  found feeding as high as 1,100 m (D. Westcott and A. McKeown pers.  comm.).<br/><br/>Approximately 64 roost sites have been identified in the  Wet Tropics of Australia, but on average only 10 are occupied in any  month of the year (Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014, Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2018). In the Iron and McIllwrath Ranges of Northern Australia very  small numbers (&lt;1000) have been recorded irregularly, with no  identified permanent roosts (Fox 2011, D. Westcott and S. Fox pers.  comm.). In the Torres Strait there is one report of a juvenile <em>P.  conspicillatus</em> skull from Nepean Island (Anderson 1912), however recent  reviews of the literature and surveys have failed to confirm any  additional records of this species through the area (Lavery <em>et al.</em>  2012). In Indonesia and PNG less is known about the distribution and  occurrence of species, but the species appears to roost in small numbers  in coastal lowlands (Bonaccorso 1998, Wiantoro 2011). A continuously  occupied roost of several thousand<em> P. conspicillatus</em> occurs in the  township of Madang PNG (B. Roberts pers. obs).","Traditional hunting for food is rare in Australia, but common in PNG and Indonesia.&#160;In Lae (PNG) markets a single animal cost approximately $5 AUS in 2014.",Terrestrial,"A range of threats have been identified for<em> P. conspicillatus</em>. Key  threats include habitat loss, exploitation, harassment at roosts,  electrocution, shooting in orchards, and tick paralysis (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2001, DERM 2010, Dennis 2012, Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Decline  of <em>P. conspicillatus</em> in Australia has been associated with habitat  loss, and persecution such as electrocution and shooting at orchards  (Garnett <em>et al.</em> 1999, DERM 2010). The impact of lethal crop  protection is believed to have decreased in recent years with  prohibition of high voltage electricity grids and with the wide-spread  adoption of canopy netting on orchards. However, permits to shoot  flying-foxes for commercial crop protection were re-instated by the  Queensland government in 2012 after a four-year ban. Rates of clearing  of rainforest in the coastal and upland areas in the majority of the Wet  Tropics Bioregion have been reduced and are no longer significant  (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D. Westcott pers. comm.). However, there has  been an intensification of agriculture on the dry western margins of  the range and an increase in clearing of sclerophyll vegetation types  important for the species in these areas (Queensland Herbarium 2014, D.  Westcott pers. comm). Habitat loss for human development impacts coastal  areas and plateaus. Recent escalation in rates of transition of  sclerophyll vegetation types to closed rainforest has been documented  and attributed to changed fire management regimes (Stanton <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Conflict  between humans and <em>P. conspicillatus </em>in built up areas appears to be  growing as the proportion of the population using roosts in urban areas  increases (Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014). Methods for ameliorating conflict  typically include modification or removal of roosting vegetation and the  use of noise and other disturbances to disperse animals away from human  occupied areas. The long-term impact of dispersals on <em>P. conspicillatus</em>  is unknown. However, conflict at roosts hinders conservation measures.<br/><br/>More recently, tick paralysis has been identified as an increasing threat to the species (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2008, Fox 2011, Buettner <em>et al.</em> 2013). Buettner <em>et al.</em> (2013) found that mortality varied between years, with more adult females affected than males.<br/><br/><em>Pteropus  conspicillatus</em> are also threatened by mortality from entanglement in  backyard drape netting, collision and entanglement in barbed-wire  fences, electrocution on power lines, cleft palate and other birth  deformities (Richards <em>et al.</em> 2008, Shilton <em>et al.</em> 2008, DERM 2010, J. Maclean pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The  impact of climate change is unclear but is likely to increase the  severity of cyclones and other extreme weather (i.e., heat events) that  can kill large numbers and impact the feeding and roosting habitat of  the species (DERM 2010). The recent invasion of myrtle rust and tramp  ants (electric and yellow crazy ants) into the Wet Tropics region is  also a concern for the future status of Wet Tropics species (Metcalfe <em>et al.</em>  2014). In PNG and Indonesia, the range of <em>P. conspicillatus </em>is  typically confined to coastal lowlands and islands. These areas are most  densely populated by people and subject to the most rapid land use  change as documented by remote sensing (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Stibig <em>et al.</em>  2014). Increasing rates of habitat loss or modification through  residential expansion and the clearing of large tracts of forests for  expanding oil palm production continue to be a major threat to the  species (T. Leary pers. comm.). Logging operations are also expanding in  the range of <em>P. conspicillatus</em>, particularly in the West Papua province  of Indonesia and the Madang and Morobe provinces of PNG (Stibig <em>et al.</em>  2014). Hunting is another significant threat as flying-foxes are an  important food source for many communities and sold as food at local  markets (Mack and West 2005, S. Hamilton and T. Leary pers. comm., B.  Roberts pers. obs). In both Madang and Lae, <em>P. conspicillatus</em> are hunted  and disturbed on an almost daily basis (T. Leary pers. comm, B. Roberts  pers. obs.). <br/>The impacts of these threats combined with the species’s low reproductive output (Fox <em>et al.</em> 2008) and the population’s low estimated average exponential rate of increase (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2018) highlight the likelihood of continual decline into the projected future.",Australasian,,false,false,Global
22082634,18740,Pteropus melanotus,Vulnerable,C1,2021,2021-08-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Pteropus melanotus </em>is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion C1. There  is an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 mature individuals in the population and the population size (number of mature individuals) is projected to undergo a continuing decline  of at least 10% over the next three generations (16.5 to 24 years, GL =  5.5 to 8 years; Todd 2020). The species has a highly fragmented  distribution and there is a continuing decline in the quality of the  habitat due to habitat loss, hunting pressure and introduced species. <em> Pteropus melanotis </em>is recognized as a species (Simmons and Cirranello  2020), but its taxonomy remains poorly understood and requires further  assessment. Initial data suggests that it represents a species complex  and that some or all subspecies may represent distinct species,  requiring immediate reassessments.","<em>Pteropus melanotus melanotus</em>:<br/><strong>Habitat</strong>.—On both the Andaman and  Nicobar Islands <em>P. m. melanotus </em>roosts are located throughout the  primary forests and among the settlements. Large colonies of up to 2,000  individuals have been reported among the primary forests, compared to  &lt; 200 individuals among the settlements. On the Andaman Islands large  colonies have been primarily roosting in the mangrove trees of the  islands’ interior and in <em>Ficus </em>spp. within Evergreen forest habitats  (Aul 2007). On the Nicobar Islands, large colonies primarily occur among  wetland habitats in both mangrove trees and <em>Nypa fruticans </em>(Aul 2007).  Many of the roost sites throughout the Nicobar Islands were destroyed  following a tsunami in 2004, while the Andaman Islands were only  minimally affected (Aul 2007, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). In January 2005 only a small colony (10 -15 individuals) was observed roosting on  Casurina sp. in the littoral forest of Kamorta Island (Aul 2007). On  Great Nicobar and Tillangchong Islands, colonies moved to inland forest  areas. In April 2006 a colony (&gt; 500 individuals) re-established  following the recovery of <em>Nypa fruticans</em> (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Ecology</strong>.—On  islands throughout the Andaman and Nicobar Archipelagos, where multiple  fruit eating bat species are present, competition for forage resources  has resulted in niche separation among the species (Aul 2007). <em>Pteropus  melanotus melanotus</em> is reported to forage on fruits of 21 species and  the pollen/nectar of one species (Aul 2007). Although there is some  overlap in foraging habitats and in the plant species consumed among the  bat species, <em>P. m. melanotus</em> forages later in the evening than other  bat species, starting at 2,300 h with a peak in foraging activity around 0200 h (Aul 2007). <em>Pteropus melanotus melanotus</em> prefers to forage in the  primary inland forest as compared to the agro forests preferred by  other species and will exploit foraging resources among the tree  canopies at heights &gt; 20 meters (Aul 2007).<br/><br/>Information on the  life-histories of <em>P. m. melanotus </em>is limited to the timing of birth and  mating, Females give birth to pups between the months of December and  April (Aul 2007). The mating season for <em>P. m. melanotus</em> is suggested to  occur in the months of May and June at the onset of the Monsoon (Aul  2007).<br/><br/><em>Pteropus melanotus natalis:</em><em><br/></em><strong>Habitat</strong>.—On Christmas Island,  <em>P. m. natalis</em> aggregates seasonally in response to reproduction (i.e.,  mating and birth), available food resources and weather (i.e., changes  in wind direction). In general, colonial roosts are primarily occupied  during the dry season for the purpose of mating, with regular movements  of juvenile, sub-adult and competing adult male bats between roosts  (Tidemann 1985, C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein pers. comm.). During the  wet season a large portion of the population abandons the main colonial  sites, roosting singularly or in small groups across the island  (Tidemann 1985, C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein pers. comm.). However,  during any time of the year small groups or single individuals can be  found scattered across the island (C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein pers.  comm.). Some colonies have been used repeatedly for over 30 years and  are suggested to date back to 1908, before human settlement, while  others are abandoned for unknown reasons. In 1984, the first surveys  identified the location of five colonies. Three colonies were located  along the east coast of the island, one colony was located to the west  on the northwest point of the island, and one colony was located in the  middle of the southern coast. A sixth colony was later located along the  east coast in 1988 (Tidemann 1985). Several surveys conducted between  1997 and 2006 were only able to confirm the continued use of three  historical colony locations (Corbett <em>et al.</em> 2003, James <em>et al.</em>  2007). Recent surveys conducted between 2015 and 2020 confirm the  continued use of the two historical colony sites identified in 1984 as  well as an additional five new colony sites. All colonies were located  on the coastal terrace or close to the first inland cliff in  semi-deciduous forest with varying structural features. One common  feature among these locations is their proximity to the coast, which is  suggested to be advantageous as it allows <em>P. m. natalis</em> to take  advantage of on-shore winds, facilitating take-off (Tidemann 1985). The  average number of individuals occupying these established colonies in a  given month fluctuates between 119 and 762 individuals (C. M. Todd and  A. Dorrestein unpub.). Site fidelity at the colony fluctuates greatly  over the year, with a peak in adult roost fidelity during mating season  (A. Dorrestein unpub.). Generally, low roost fidelity coincides with  observations of multiple roosts, comprised of a single or few  individuals, scattered across the island. Eighteen plant species have  been identified as roost trees used by <em>P. m. natalis </em>(Tidemann 1985,  James <em>et al.</em> 2007, C. M. Todd pers. obs.). To date there does not  seem to be any information regarding the relevance of these particular  roost tree species.<br/><br/><strong>Ecology</strong>.—On Christmas Island, there is no  competition for foraging resources as <em>P. m. natalis</em> is the only bat  species present and the largest of two species that function as both a  pollinator and seed disperser, the other being the Christmas Island  white-eye (<em>Zosterops natalis</em>) weighing 12 g. <em>Pteropus melanotus natalis</em>  is relatively diurnal, emerging from camps as early as 1,300h to forage,  although the bulk of the population will emerge from the roost at dusk  between and 1,500 and 1,830 h (Tidemann 1985, C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein  pers. obs.). <em>Pteropus melanotus natalis</em> forages on the fruits of 33  plants, the flowers of 33 plant species, the leaves of four plant  species and the stem of one plant species, representing a total of 56  plant species from 34 families (C. M. Todd unpub). The mean foraging  range for <em>P. m. natalis</em> was 237 ± 115 ha with some individuals traveling  up to 14 km between their roost and foraging sites (C. M. Todd unpub.).  These foraging movements by <em>P. m.natalis </em>indicate that they are capable  of foraging across the entirety of the island but prefer to forage in  perennial wetland, Evergreen and Semi-deciduous forest habitats (C. M.  Todd and A. Dorrestein pers. coms.).<br/>Recent studies on the  life-history of <em>P. m. natalis</em> have examined rates of growth, maturation  and the timing of reproduction events. Females give birth to pups  between the months of December and April (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018). The  peak of the birthing period occurs in the months of February and March,  with newborn pups reaching volancy between the months of June and  November (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018). The mating season for <em>P. m. natalis </em>occurs between the months of June and August (Todd <em>et al.</em>  2018), prior to the monsoon season in November. Although a majority of  the <em>P. m. natalis </em>population follows an annual cycle of reproduction,  mating, parturition, and volancy were not limited to the peak periods  and occurred with appreciable frequencies throughout much of the year  (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018). Using estimates of growth and maturation  rates, juvenile males begin to mature at 15 months after birth and reach  maturity at 27 months, while females reach maturity at 24 months after  birth (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018). However, adult male <em>P. m. natalis</em> reach  sexual majority at lower average body mass than a fully mature adult.  Mating success is suggested to be constrained until their fourth year  when males attain adequate body mass and are able to defend mating  territories (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/><em>Pteropus melanotus modiglianii</em>: <br/><strong>Habitat</strong>.—Suggested  to be similar to other subspecies, however no information is available  for either sub population the Mentawai Islands or Enggano.<br/><br/><strong>Ecology</strong>.—Suggested  to be similar to other subspecies, however no information is available  for either sub population the Mentawai Islands or Enggano.","<em>Pteropus melanotus melanotus.</em>—In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <em>P. m.  melanotus</em> is primarily threatened by hunting and habitat loss. Hunting  for sport appears to be the prime threat to the two species of fruit  bats on the Nicobar and Andaman Islands (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Aul and Vijayakumar 2003, Aul 2007, Aul <em>et al.</em>  2014). Hunting seasonally occurs at foraging sites coinciding with the  Ceiba pentandra blossums and at roosts close to human settlements (Aul  and Vijayakumar 2003, Aul 2007, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is an  increasing trend of using air-guns and catapults to hunt which allows  for a quicker and more effective way to hunt bats (Aul 2007). Hunters  are known to shoot adult bats and adopt the orphaned babies.  Additionally, it is thought that bats, particularly the bones, have  medicinal properties and can be used to cure asthma (Aul 2007). No  hunting is carried out by the Onge’s who inhabit Little Andaman or  Tillangchong which is considered a sacred island (Aul 2007). Habitat  loss resulting from urbanization, in particular tourism related  commercial development programs, and conversion of land for agricultural  purposes is the second most common threat to <em>P. m. melanotus</em> on the  Nicobar and Andaman Islands (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Aul 2007).  Anti-encroachment drives successfully stopped extensive logging  activities on the Andaman Islands, however logging still occurs on  Nicobar Island and has resulted in significant habitat loss across the  island (Aul 2007). In December 2004 a tsunami hit the Nicobar Islands  resulting in the destruction of major <em>Pteropus</em> mangrove habitat (Aul <em>et al.</em>  2014), however, further research is needed to confirm that the species  has declined because of this event. The tsunami also resulted in  clearing of forest land which has been made available for settlements.  Invasive species including spotted deer (<em>Axis axis</em>), African giant snail  (<em>Achatina fulica</em>) and elephants (<em>Elaphas maximus</em>) have also been  introduced to Interview Island and North Andaman but the threat to the  population remains unknown (Aul 2007). While threats to the species on  Nias are not known, they presumably include general habitat loss.<br/><br/><em>Pteropus  melanotus natalis.</em>—Threats to <em>P. m. natalis </em>have proven difficult to  identify, and are likely a combination of factors (Orchard 2006). James <em>et al.</em>  (2007), provide a detailed account of possible threats to the species  including, predation or disturbance by both, or either, introduced and  native species, predation and/or persecution by humans (mostly  formerly), storm events, loss of habitat, accidental poisoning or  intoxication from heavy metals, and disease and parasites. James <em>et al.</em>  (2007), also give a 'threat assessment matrix' indicating the  likelihood of each potential threat. <em>P. m. natalis</em> is preyed on by feral  cats on Christmas Island (Tidemann <em>et al.</em> 1994), and there has  also been some hunting, including large numbers (up to 200) in the past  (D. J. James pers. comm.). However, there is no recent evidence of  hunting in this part of the species range (C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein  pers. comm.). Additionally, the introduced Yellow Crazy Ant (<em>Anoplolepis  gracilipes</em>) has caused general ecological breakdown on Christmas Island  since the late 1990s (O'Dowd <em>et al.</em> 2003), and is shown to disturb the species’ roosting behaviour (Dorrestein <em>et al.</em> 2019). Corbett <em>et al.</em>  (2003) hypothesized that a severe cyclone in 1988 initiated the decline  in the Christmas Island population. However, other anecdotal evidence  indicates that the decline began in the mid 1990s (Orchard 2006). Loss  of habitat and health related threats have also been suggested as  threatening processes to the population. Christmas Island houses the  second largest phosphate mine in Australia and approximately 25% (3,375  ha) of the island has been cleared for mining and settlement. A portion  of clear land (325 ha) has been revegetated with introduced/domesticated  plant species which might impact the diet of <em>P. m. natalis</em>. Nutritional  analysis of native and introduced plant species commonly consumed by <em>P.  m. natalis</em> found that alien fruits had significantly lower essential  mineral concentrations compared to native fruits (Pulscher <em>et al.</em>  2021). Therefore, preferential foraging, even seasonally, on alien food  plants could result in nutritional imbalances in <em>P. m. natalis</em>, however  further studies are required to understand the electivity of alien food  plants in the diet of <em>P. m. natalis </em>(Pulscher <em>et al.</em> 2021a).  Intoxication with the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) has also been suggested  as a threatening process in <em>P. m. natalis</em>. Increased cadmium  concentrations have been reported in fur, tissues, and urine of <em>P. m.  natalis</em> (Pulscher <em>et al.</em> 2021b). Furthermore, a small subset of  <em>P. m. natalis </em>individuals assessed had glucosuria and proteinuria that  were suggestive of renal dysfunction and bone lesions were reported in  one <em>P. m. natalis</em> individual suggesting that <em>P. m. natalis</em> is  chronically exposed to cadmium and this may be impacting the health of  the population (Pulscher <em>et al.</em> 2021). Disease (speculative) may  be a factor but little is known about infectious pathogens or parasites  in the population apart from two reports on baseline health parameters  and the identification of an unknown paramyxovirus (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2011, Hall <em>et al.</em> 2014, Vidgen <em>et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/><em>Pteropus melanotus modiglianii.</em>—No information is available on the threats to this subspecies.","While data are limited within much of the species’ range, the number of  mature individuals is estimated to range from 5,00 to 7,000 bats. The  overall population and number of mature individuals has experienced a  decline in the past and there is a projected decline of at least 10%  over the next three generations (16.5 to 24 years, GL = 5.5 to 8 yrs,  Todd 2020).<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>P. m. melatonus</em> may consist of two  subpopulations, one subpopulation in the Andaman Island group and a  second subpopulation in the Nicobar Island group, as these island groups  with known populations are separated by 250 km. Surveys of <em>P. m.  melanotus</em> within each island group identify the presence of <em>P. m.  melanotus</em> on a number of islands within each island group but do not  provide estimates of population size for <em>P. m. melanotus</em> on each of the  islands in which it was present. No estimates of population size are  provided for the subpopulation of the subspecies <em>P. m. modiglianii</em> on the  island of Nias and the current status for the subpopulation of <em>P. m.  modiglianii </em>is believed to be extinct, however this requires  confirmation. Currently, detailed estimates of population size only  exist for the subspecies <em>P. m. natalis </em>on Christmas Island.<br/><br/>Surveys  of <em>P. m. melanotus </em>conducted between 2003 and 2006 identified colonies  ranging between 200 to &gt;1,500 individuals on the islands of North  Reef, Point, Paget and Landfall within in the North Andaman Island  Group, Interview in the Middle Andaman Island Group, and Havelock,  Outram, and Little Andaman Island in the South Andaman Island Group (Aul  <em>et al.</em> 2014). Throughout the Nicobar Islands two colonies were  observed, one containing 50 to &lt;600 individuals on Tillangchong  Island in the Central Nicobar Island Group, and one with 50 to &lt;200  individuals on Great Nicobar Island (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). In  addition to these colonies, individuals (population size unknown) were  observed on the islands of Kwagtung and West in the North Andaman Island  Group, Baratang and Long in the Middle Andaman Island Group, Neil,  Boat, and Rutland in the South Andaman Island Group, Tressa, Bompuka,  Katchal, Nancowrie, and Kamorta in the Central Nicobar Island group, and  Little Nicobar in the Southern Nicobar Island Group (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>On  Christmas Island, the first surveys of <em>P. m. natalis</em> were conducted in  1984 which estimated a population size of 6,000 individuals (Tidemann  1985). This estimate was based on approximately 3,500 bats occupying the  five roosts, and 2,500 bats roosting singly or in small groups  throughout the island (Tidemann 1985). Tidemann (1985) also reported a  male to female ratio of 1:3 indicating a female biased sex ratio in the  population. In 2003 surveys indicated a dramatic decline in the  population, estimated between 500 – 1,000 individuals (Corbett <em>et al.</em>  2003). However, whether sufficient effort was invested during this  survey is questionable as the estimate is based on 17 sightings totalling  30 individuals, and it is not evident if counts were made at roosts  (James <em>et al.</em> 2007). In September 2006, the population size  was estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000, but closer to 1,500. This  estimate was based on a count of 1,381 individuals (James <em>et al.</em>  2007). Density sampling methods conducted in 2012 reported a 39% decline  in the incidence measures between 2006 and 2012 and estimated a  population size between 900 – 1,300 individuals (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2012, Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014). Subsequent results from surveys conducted in 2013 (1,735 ± 602),  2014 (1,512 ± 503), 2015 (1,369 ± 534), and 2016 (2,100 ± 563) indicate  that the population has remained relatively stable (Parks 2016). In  September 2018 capture-mark-recapture/resight surveys estimated a  population of 3,846 individuals (Todd 2020). Surveys conducted between  2015 and 2018 indicate a juvenile to adult age class ratio of 1.43:1 and  a male to female sex ratio of 1.6:1 (Todd 2020). Density sampling also  indicated a 15% increase in the incidence measure between 2012 and 2019  (Parks 2019). Although recent estimates indicate a more recent increase  in the population size from 2012, there has been a relative decline of  36% in the population size from 1984 to 2018 (Todd 2020) and a decrease  of 28% in the incidence measure from 2006 to 2019 (Parks 2019), <em>P. m.  natalis</em> is projected to experience a 41% over the next 20 years (Geyle <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>There  is no information available on the current population size for the  subpopulation of the subspecies <em>P. m. modiglianii</em> in the Mentawi  Islands. The current status of the subpopulation of <em>P. m. modiglianii</em> on  Enggano is suggested to be extinct.",Decreasing,"Currently there are three subspecies recognized within the <em>Pteropus  melanotus</em> group. <em>Pteropus melanotus melanotus </em>(synm: <em>Pteropus melanotus  tytleri</em>) may consist of two subpopulations with one subpopulation  limited to the islands of Kwagtung, Landfall, North Reef, Smith, West,  Interview, Baratang, Long, Outram, Neil, Havelock, Boat, Rutland, Little  Andaman, Paget, East Twin, Port Blair and South Sentinel Islands in the  Andaman Island group (Hill 1967, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014, Srinivasulu <em>et al.</em>  2017). The other subpopulation of the subspecies <em>Pteropus melanotus  melanotus</em> is limited to the islands of Tressa, Bompuka, Tilangchong,  Katchal, Nancowrie, Kamorta, Little Nicobar, Great Nicobar (including  Campbell Bay), Car Nicobar, and Trinket Islands in the Nicobar Island  group (Saha 1980, Aul and Vijayakumar 2003, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). The  subspecies <em>Pteropus melanotus natalis</em> is limited to Christmas Island of  Australia. In the Mentawi Islands of Indonesia, the subspecies <em>Pteropus  melanotus modiglianii</em> has been reported to occur on Nias Island (Hill  1971, Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002), although the current status is unknown.  The subpopulation of <em>Pteropus melanotus modiglianii</em> on Enggano Island,  Indonesia was previously reported as extirpated following a severe  typhoon, however this requires verification. The species occurs from sea  level to 1,000 m asl.",,Terrestrial,"<p>Currently <em>P. m. melanotus</em> is categorized as vermin under the Indian  Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, and special hunting rights are given to  the indigenous tribes in the Nicobar Islands. This, together with an  unsustainable use of the forest and wildlife are the greatest threats to  <em>P. m. melanotus</em>. Whilst, several protected areas, encompassing many  islands, have been created throughout the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,  in the Nicobar Archipelago, only four islands (Battimalv, Tillangchong,  Megapode and Great Nicobar) are protected (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014).  However, no protection is provided to the species that inhabit these  areas. Furthermore, a number of islands which are home to endemic birds  and a variety of other fauna are currently not in the protected area  network. It is essential that a network of protected areas are  established on each island across the Andman and Nicobar islands to  ensure protected corridors enabling the safe movement of fauna across  the islands (Aul 2007).<br/><br/>On Kamorta, strides have been made  educating hunters and village leaders. Education and awareness programs  conducted in 2002 -2003 were successful in creating a network of bat  observers and roost protectors, dramatically reducing hunting in five  villages on the Nicobar Island of Kamorta (Aul 2007).<br/><br/>On  Christmas Island, National Park covers 63% of the island. A detailed  assessment of conservation status and threats is provided for the P. m.  natalis by James <em>et al.</em> (2007).<br/><br/>More extensive  field surveys across all of the Indonesian and Indian archipelagos are  needed to obtain a better understanding of the species’ distribution.  Currently estimates of population size are only available for <em>P. m.  natalis</em>. Further population assessments and monitoring are needed.  Genetic studies are urgently needed to better understand and clarify the  taxonomy of this species group. All future survey efforts should strive  to obtain necessary information (i.e., estimates of population size,  genetic samples, morphometrics) whenever possible in order to help to  facilitate proper monitoring of the populations.<br/><br/></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22085511,18751,Pteropus poliocephalus,Vulnerable,A2ace+4ac,2021,2021-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Grey-headed Flying Fox is assessed as Vulnerable under criteria A2ace and A4ac because, although the  population is relatively large (exceeding 10,000  mature individuals) and it has a large extent of occurrence (&gt;  20,000 km²), a continuing population decline is inferred to be  more than 30–35% over the last three generations (21 years, GL = 7  years; Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). A decline is also expected to  exceed 30% over the period encompassing the past 1 and at least two future generations (2014–2035).<br/><br/>The decline in population is inferred from  substantial loss and degradation of foraging habitat due to fire and  clearing, mass mortalities associated with extreme heat and food  shortages, and mortality from electrocution on power lines, and  entanglement in barbed wire and fruit tree netting. In particular,  extreme weather conditions in 2019-20 saw tens of thousands of  individuals die from food shortages and extreme heat events, and  unprecedented megafires affected 33.7% of the species’ total habitat  whereby 41.7% of the species' critical ‘winter’ foraging resources were  lost to high severity fires.<br/>The rate of decline is expected to  increase over at least the future two generations due to the increasing  frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events such as  heat events, droughts, floods and fires, along with changes in the  production of nectar, pollen and fleshy fruits in native vegetation,  largely unregulated land clearing associated with urban expansion,  agriculture intensification and human population growth, and increased  exposure of the species to anthropogenic threats in urban environments.  The capacity of the species to recover from increased mortality caused  by frequent or persistent threats is hampered by their low reproductive  rate, and low population growth rate even under optimal conditions.","The Grey-Headed Flying Fox is found in subtropical moist forest, open  forest, closed and open woodlands, Melaleuca swamps, Banksia woodlands,  mangroves, commercial fruit plantations (Hall and Richards 2000), and  increasingly in urban landscapes (e.g., Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021, Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  diet consists of nectar, pollen and fruits of a wide range of species,  most commonly native trees in the families Myrtaceae, Moraceae,  Proteaceae and a small number of species from other families. (Eby 1998,  Hall and Richards 2000, Eby and Law 2008, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em>  2009). The primary native food sources are the nectar and pollen of  <em>Eucalyptus</em>, <em>Corymbia</em>, <em>Angophora</em>, <em>Banksia</em>, <em>Melaleuca</em> species, and fleshy  rainforest fruits (Eby and Law 2008, Eby 1991); and they are known to  consume leaves, bark, and invertebrates (Clulow and Blundell 2011, Smith  <em>et al.</em> 2020, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em> 2009). They also forage  in agricultural areas, including orchards, and in introduced vegetation  in urban areas (McDonald-Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  majority of native diet plants have regular seasonal flowering  phenologies, but do not flower every year (Eby and Law 2008).  Grey-headed flying foxes experience seasonal food bottlenecks during  winter and spring when few diet plants are productive and the  distribution of native foraging habitat is limited (Eby and Law 2008).  Vegetation communities that contain plants that flower in winter and  early spring are of particular importance to the species during critical  periods in the reproductive cycle and have been identified as habitat  critical to survival (Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999, Eby and Law 2008, DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox lacks biological adaptations such as torpor to  withstand food shortages, instead individuals are thought to move in  response to changes in local food abundance (DAWE 2021). It is a highly  mobile species with individuals estimated to travel up to  2,500 km annually within a network of roosts located across southeastern  Australia (Eby 1991, Tidemann and Nelson 2004, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). On a nightly basis, individual bats may forage as far as 50 km  from their roost. However, mean foraging distances are between 6 and 11  km, with foraging distances shorter in urban than in non-urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021). There are few areas within the range where  nectar and other food sources are available continuously, except perhaps  in urban areas. While many flying-foxes feed in urban areas and urban  roosts may be permanently occupied, a proportion of the individuals  within these roosts move regularly between urban and other more natural  settings (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>It roosts by day colonially in  canopy vegetation and many roosts have a long history of use (Lunney and  Moon 1997). Individuals move nomadically throughout the species' range  within a network of roosts, and change roosts frequently (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Some roosts may temporarily contain &gt;100,000 individuals,  often coinciding with periodic flowering of preferred tree species (Eby  1991, Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;regularly  cohabits roosts with the black flying fox (<em>P. alecto</em>) and Little Red Flying Fox (<em>P. scapulatus</em>) with which it is partially sympatric (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021), and rarely with the Spectacled Flying Fox (<em>P. conspicillatus</em>) in the north of its range (Parsons <em>et al.</em>  2010). Of the 310 known camps in regular use, almost 75% are shared  with other species and only 25% are occupied exclusively by the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Timmiss <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The majority of camps (58.7%) are located in urban areas (Timmiss <em>et al.</em>  2021). From 1998 to 2019, the number of active roost sites increased by  approximately 120% and average population size at camps declined, with  94% of new roosts formed in urban areas (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  The pattern of increase in roost numbers has been stepped rather than  continuous, in association with periods of food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em>  submitted). The drivers of increasing urbanisation of the species are  unclear. Increased temporal stability (Markus and Hall 2004,  McDonald‐Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Parry‐Jones and Augee 2001, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006) and availability (Markus and Hall 2004, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em>  2006) of food resources from urban plantings may be responsible for the  recently observed increased presence of flying-foxes of urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021), however, broadscale reductions in feeding  opportunities in native habitats may also play a role (Parry-Jones and  Augee 2001, van der Ree <em>et al.</em> 2006, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014, P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  the roosts, males establish ‘mating territories’ that are actively  maintained by aggression, which is especially evident during the mating  season (March-May, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993; Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995; Eby 1995; Nelson 1965; Welbergen 2010, 2011). Males mate repeatedly  with the same female during a mating session and can have multiple  mating sessions with the same female over the course of several days  (Welbergen 2005). Males, but not females, accumulate body mass prior to  establishing their territories and can lose more than 20 percent of  their mass during the mating season (Welbergen 2011).&#160;&#160; <br/>The most likely time of conception is April (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995). Pregnancy in <em>P. poliocephalus</em> is seasonal, lasts for approximately 27 weeks (Martin <em>et al.</em>  1987) and the majority of females give birth to a single young annually  between late September and early November, although small numbers of  females give birth outside this time (Justin Welbergen pers. comm.).  Lactation lasts approximately 5–6 months (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1996), with the majority of young being weaned by the start of the mating season in March (Welbergen 2011).<br/><br/>Twins  are rare and there are no observations of twins surviving to weaning  (Peggy Eby pers. comm.). Sexual maturity is reached in the second year  (females) or third year (males) after birth (Welbergen 2010), and  generation length is estimated to be between 6 and 8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Divljan pers. comm).","Grey-Headed Flying Foxes are exposed to significant threats from  increasingly rapid human-induced environmental change, particularly loss  of foraging habitat and climate change impacts (DAWE 2021). They are  also impacted by increasing levels of conflict with humans at urban  roosts (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021). Key threats often act concurrently  and their impacts on population size are exacerbated by the species’ low  reproductive output, limiting its capacity to recover from impacts  (McIlwee and Martin 2002). Threats are predicted to increase in  frequency and severity in coming decades and, as a result, rates of  decline are expected to increase (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The  species is dependent on continuous access to flowering and fruiting food  plants sourced from widespread areas of native vegetation. Reduction in  food availability from loss and degradation of native habitat and  impacts of climate change, particularly drought and fires, is a key  threat (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, DAWE 2021). Incremental clearing  of critical winter/spring foraging habitat for urban expansion and  agriculture intensification is largely unregulated and is ongoing in  many regions. For example, loss of critical winter habitat was  associated with a collapse in winter influxes of nomadic animals into  far southeast Queensland from 1996 to 2018 (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>Climate-driven  food shortages affect the species throughout its range and are  associated with population-wide increases in mortality (assessed from  rates of intake by wildlife rehabilitation organizations) and reductions  in pre-weaning reproductive success (DAWE 2021, Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted, Mo <em>et al.</em>  2021). Food shortages were recorded every 3 years on average from 1998  to 2020 (range 1-4 years) and were associated with absence or very low  intensity of flowering in native forests (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  Food shortage impacts are generally global across the range of the  species and pre-weaning reproductive success assessed over 23 years  (1998 to 2021) and averaged across roosts in New South Wales was 56% in  food shortage years relative to 89% in non-food shortage years (P. Eby  unpublished data). This represents only a partial assessment of impact,  as adult female mortality was not considered in the denominators. Roosts  affected by the impact of extreme heat were not included in the data.  Repeated reductions in reproduction may reduce the capacity of the  species to recover from decline.<br/><br/>Extreme heat events, whereby  ambient temperatures exceed 42°, are known to cause mass mortality of  flying-foxes at landscape scales, and this has become a prominent  conservation management issue in Australia. Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  (2008) reported that between 1994 and 2008, &gt;30,000 Australian  flying-foxes, of which 24,500 were <em>P. poliocephalus</em>, had died during 19  separate extreme heat events. Between 2008 and 2019 a further 131.00  flying foxes died in several such events, including &gt;40,000 <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals (Welbergen 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  unpublished). During the 2019-20 summer, 72,000 flying foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events, with <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals comprising the majority of the mortality  estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The recorded deaths are likely  substantial underestimates of the true mortality as many roosts are not  inspected following events and where inspected mortality is often  underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.). Adult  females and dependent young are disproportionately susceptible to  hyperthermia, which negatively affects recruitment and the effective  breeding population limiting the species’ capacity for recovery  (Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Wildfires have also recently gained  significance as threats to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox. During the  extreme Austral 2019–20 summer, unprecedented bushfires affected an  estimated 5.8 Mha of temperate broadleaf forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning 33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7%  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires  (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021). It is likely that significant impacts  of the 2019-2020 bushfires on the species will be associated with both  the short-term effective loss of foraging habitat and the longer-term  reduction in nectar production, particularly in areas affected by  high-severity fire. At present, there are insufficient data available to  estimate the impact on the <em>P. poliocephalus </em>population or predict its  trajectory of post-fire recovery.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic changes in extreme  heat events and associated droughts and wildfires are already readily  observable in southeastern Australia and are expected to continue to  escalate in frequency and intensity in the coming decades (IPCC 2021,  Herold <em>et al.</em> 2021). As such, the already substantial die-offs  from food shortages and extreme heat, and habitat loss from wildfires  are anticipated to continue to gain significance as threats to the  species.<br/><br/>The recent urbanisation of roosts exposes the species to  several threats. Conflict between people and Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;is  an ongoing problem that may cause loss or degradation of roosting  habitat and reduce community support for conservation initiatives (DAWE  2021). Flying-foxes are commonly perceived to be an annoyance, or  disease risk due to the noise and smell they emit and camps close to  human settlements are regularly subject to attempts to exclude the bats,  or clear vegetation in or around roosts to manipulate fine-scale  roosting positions (DAWE 2021, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Other threats include entanglement in fruit tree netting or  barbed wire fencing, electrocution on power lines, and vehicle  collisions. In a study of 532 Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;admitted to  emergency care in Victoria, Scheelings and Frith (2015) found  anthropogenic factors caused the majority (63.7%) of admissions, with  entanglement in fruit tree netting the most common cause (36.8%)  followed by entanglement in barbed wire fencing (12.4%). Roosts once  isolated from humans have become embedded in urban areas due to  increasing urban expansion in coastal New South Wales and Queensland  (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Grey-Headed Flying Foxes may cause damage to fruit  crops in both commercial and backyard orchards, and lethal control  methods were commonly used in the past, including electrocution and  shooting (DAWE 2021). Historically culling was a major cause of  mortality (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, there have been  efforts to reduce the number of flying-foxes killed by orchardists  through Government subsidised netting programs, and overall, the impact  of this threat has declined. Queensland still issues permits to cull up  to 1,280 individuals per year (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Interspecific competition  with the black flying fox (<em>Pteropus alecto</em>) may also be a threat to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b). Although there is no evidence of interspecific competition, the  black flying fox has been expanding both in range and abundance in the  northern parts of the Grey-Headed Flying Fox’s range (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a).<br/>Apart from culling by orchardists, all other threats are likely to continue or increase in severity and impact into the future.","This species forms a single, extremely mobile, interbreeding population distributed over a vast area (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;was considered abundant and estimated to number  in the many millions in the early 20th century (Ratcliffe 1931).  However, distribution-wide autumn population counts, based on counts of  individuals at known camps across the species range, varied between  320,000 and 674,000 (mean of 450,714) between 1989 and 2005 (Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014). Subsequently a national program of largely synchronous quarterly  population estimates was established in November 2012 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015), and its autumn population counts varied between 522,000 and  663,000 (mean 570.900) over the period 2013-2019 (NFFMP, 2021). However,  counts from the periods 1989-2005 and 2013-2019 are not directly  comparable because of the differences in the methods used and  uncertainty about the survey coverage of the extent of the population  (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition, distribution-wide counts  lack precision due to the unknown proportion of individuals at unsampled  camps, and inconsistencies in sampling effort and counting methods used  among individual roost sites (DAWE 2021, Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015). Due to limited precision, the time taken to reach 80%  statistical power in detecting trends in the recent distribution-wide  counts has been modelled to be ~13.5 years, or until 2027 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2012). However, recent work suggests that the main method used for  counting individuals in roosts is much less precise than was assumed in  the modelling (McCarty <em>et al.</em> submitted). While efforts are currently underway to improve the reliability of count estimates (McCarthy <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, McCarthy <em>et al.</em>  submitted), until precision of the distribution-wide counts is improved  and better defined, it is not possible to establish meaningful trends  using current timeframes of population monitoring.<br/><br/>During the austral  spring and summer of 2019–2020, <em>P. poliocephalus </em>was exposed to a  sequence of circumstances associated with prolonged drought and extreme  heat, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021), near reproductive failure and the burning of over a third of its habitat (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/> <br/>At  this time, the species experienced an extended and intense food  shortage across a broad area of northern New South Wales and  southeastern Queensland, resulting in a large but unquantified number of  flying-fox deaths, possibly in the tens of thousands based on anecdotal  reports from wildlife carers (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). Pre-weaning reproduction at that time fell to 6% from a 21-year average of 74% (P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  addition, in the summer of 2019–2020, 72,000 flying-foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events throughout  eastern and southeastern Australia, with <em>P. poliocephalus</em> comprising the  majority of the mortality estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The  recorded deaths are likely substantial underestimates of the true  mortality as many roosts are not inspected following events and where  inspected mortality is often underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Furthermore,  in the summer of 2019–20, unprecedented bushfires affected an estimated  5.8 million hectares of forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning  33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7% of the species'  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires (Baranowski  <em>et al.</em> 2021). It is likely that significant impacts of the  2019–2020 bushfires on the species will be associated with both the  short-term effective loss of foraging habitat and the longer-term  reduction in nectar production, particularly in areas affected by  high-severity fire.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic changes in extreme heat events and  associated droughts and wildfires are already readily observable in  southeastern Australia and are expected to continue to escalate in  frequency and intensity in the coming decades (IPCC 2021, Herold <em>et al.</em>  2021). In conjunction with other ongoing causes of decline that  contributed to the species’ previous listing as Vulnerable under  criteria A2ace, these extreme events are anticipated to amount to a  decline in mature individuals exceeding 30% over the period <em>ca</em> 2014–2035, equivalent to the previous one and future two generations under criteria  A4.",Decreasing,"The geographic range of the species has altered in the past 20 years as documented by range-wide monitoring (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2012), satellite telemetry studies (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020), a systematic search of field records (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b) and public reporting. While latitudinal range boundaries have remained generally stable (Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b), there has been a distinct inland expansion. As of 2021 the  range spans the coastal lowlands, tablelands, and slopes of eastern  Australia, from Finch Hatton near Mackay (Queensland) in the north to  Melbourne, Geelong (Victoria) in the south (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b, Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014) and inland to Port Augusta in South Australia, Cooma in the Snowy  Mountains of New South Wales (New South Wales), and areas of central  and southern New South Wales and Victoria including Dubbo, Wagga Wagga  and Albury (New South Wales), Numurkah and Bendigo (Victoria). There  have also been vagrant sightings outside of this range, including  occasional sightings in Tasmania and Bass Strait islands (Atlas of  Living Australia 2021, DAWE 2021). Sightings in Tasmania and islands in  Bass Strait are associated with periods of acute food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  great majority of observations and camps of this species are from the  coastal lowlands and slopes of south eastern Australia below altitudes  of about 200 m (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data).  However, known roosts vary in elevation from sea level to 800 m (Cooma),  and occasionally vagrant individuals have been reported from altitudes  up to 1,600 m in the New South Wales and Victorian high country (M.  Pennay pers. comm., Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data). Along the  southern periphery of its range, the species has increased in abundance  in urban areas including Canberra (Australian Capital Territory),  Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo (Victoria), and Adelaide (South  Australia) (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The species is typically  found from sea level to 800 m asl, with vagrants being documented up to  1,600 m asl.","The species is not known to be hunted, used, or traded.",Terrestrial,"This species is known to use a broad range of areas reserved for  conservation, which make up 12.6% of the area surrounding known camps,  however, only 5.2% of the camps occur within conservation areas (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Given the species' reliance on dispersed food  resources, conservation areas are unlikely to protect sufficient habitat  for the species.<br/><br/>A range of management actions and research to  assist conservation of <em>P. poliocephalus</em> into the future has been  identified in the National Recovery Plan for the species (DAWE 2021).  They include: identify, protect and increase roosting habitat and native  foraging habitat that is critical to survival, define and improve  precision in current population monitoring to determine reliable trends  in population size, build community capacity to coexist with flying  foxes and improve management of conflict at roosts in urban areas,  reduce the impact of electrocution on power lines, and entanglement in  netting and on barbed wire, significantly reduce levels of harm in  commercial fruit crops, support research that will improve conservation  and management, develop and apply ameliorative care procedures to  minimise deaths during extreme heat days, and management of fire (DAWE  2021).<br/><br/>In recent years, governments have funded and administered a  number of programs of subsidies to improve conservation outcomes for <em>P.  poliocephalus</em>. Plans of Management for several roosts have been  developed by land managers in consultation with affected stakeholders  (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012). The plans set out programs for managing  contentious roosts under various conditions, and can serve as effective  mechanisms for both reducing conflict and educating the public about the  conservation and management challenges that face <em>P. poliocephalus</em>.  Government subsidies in New South Wales have enabled commercial  orchardists to install full exclusion netting to protect their crops  from flying fox damage in advance of a halt to licenced culling on  crops. The New South Wales government has also initiated a program that  funds restoration of both roosting and foraging habitat.",Australasian,,false,false,Global
22089205,18768,Pteropus voeltzkowi,Vulnerable,D2,2016,2014-01-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Vulnerable because it is restricted to Pemba Island and, although the ongoing conservation activities have significantly reduced the declines of this species, hunting has been reduced but not stopped, human disturbance at roost sites and conflict with local fruit growers are plausible threats increasing that could drive the species to a higher threatened status.","Roost sites are widely distributed across Pemba, with a concentration in the west of the island (Seehausen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1992), and a proportion of the population is found on the small islands off the west and east coast of Pemba (Robinson 2008.) This species has been recorded from primary forest, secondary forest, undisturbed traditional grave yards and mangroves, but appear to mostly rely on primary and secondary moist forest in the dry season (Seehausen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1992). Will roost in several different species of trees, including large examples of non-native trees (such as mango (<em>Mangifera indica</em>) and kapok (<em>Ceiba pentandra</em>), Entwistle and Corp 1997a), the favorite roost tree has been described as <em>Erythrophloeum suaveolens </em>(Robinson 2008). Use of traditional roost sites has been described, with some roosts having been reported as being used for over 50 years (Robinson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Roost sites were widely distributed throughout the island including on small offshore islands up to 5.9 km from Pemba's coast (Robinson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010). Seehausen (1990) concluded from interviews with inhabitants of Pemba that the species used to occur in the western parts of the island, which was once covered with rain forest, and not in the eastern, drier part. Dietary analysis showed that mango was the main component of the diet, but the the species also ate other cultivated and native fruits (including breadfruit (<em>Artocarpus altilis</em>) and figs (<em>Ficus </em>spp.)), flowers and leaves (Entwistle and Corp 1997b).","Much of the natural forest habitat of this bat has been cleared or severely fragmented. The species has been hunted for food with the use of shotguns replacing traditional methods, resulting in an unsustainable use (Seehausen 1991, Entwistle and Corp 1997a). As of 2005, hunting had been reduced but not stopped on Pemba (Trewhella <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). In addition human disturbance at roost sites appears to have a significant impact on colony sizes (Robinson <em>et al.</em> 2010). A potential emerging threat may include increasing conflict with local fruit growers, given the species’ growing population and tendency to eat cultivated fruit (Robinson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).","In the early 1990s there was evidence that the population of this species had been reduced to a few hundred animals (Seehausen 1991, Mickleburgh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1991), with an estimate of 2,800 to 3,600 individuals in 1992, the majority being found at just two roost sites (Seehausen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1992). In 1995 Entwistle and Corp (1997a) estimated a population of of 4,600 to 5,500 individuals, with 94% of bats found at 10 roosts (of 41 in total). Over the subsequent years surveys conducted by local teams on the island reported increasing population counts (Entwistle 2001, Trewhella <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Carter 2005, Juma 2007). A full survey in 2008 provided a population estimate between 18,200 and 22,100 individuals (Robinson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010) distributed across 44 active roost sites, with up to 87% of the population found at just four roost sites. Roosts ranged from solitary individuals to colonies of up to 5,040 bats. An unpublished report indicates a more recent population count of over 28,700 in 2011, with evidence of year-on-year increases over the intervening period (DCCFF 2013).",Increasing,"This species is endemic to the island of Pemba in Tanzania, where it occurs at elevations from sea level to 45 m asl.","For information on use and trade, see under Threats.",Terrestrial,"Ongoing awareness raising on the importance and uniqueness of the endemic fruit bat, and the need for hunting controls and prevention of roost site disturbance, has been undertaken through environmental education programmes (Seehausen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992, Entwistle and Corp 1997a, Trewhella <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Juma 2007). Communities are directly leading active conservation programmes for their local roosts, and three of the four largest roosts were associated with community protection schemes (Robinson <em>et al.</em> 2010).The local community has been supported to develop bat related ecotourism activities (Juma 2007).

This species is listed Vulnerable under A3cde because a population reduction of 30% is suspected for the next three generations (15 years), and there is no perspective of cessation of the impacts that are causing this reduction. This suspected decline is caused by edge effects in the small forest remnants occupied by the species, poaching, predation by domestic dogs, agrochemicals and diseases acquired from domestic ungulates.","Recent and historical data suggest that <em>Mazama nana</em> is associated to the Araucaria moist forests (Mixed Ombrophilous Forest) and its ecotones with the adjacent ecoregions: Paraná-Paraíba interior forests (Semideciduous Seasonal Forests); Serra do Mar coastal forests (Ombrophilous Dense Forest) and Cerrado (Abril <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Some authors mention its preference for mountainous habitats (Cabrera and Yepes 1960, Duarte 1996, Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008), but presence in plain and soft hilly landforms is common throughout its distribution.<br/><br/>Brazilian Dwarf Brocket is sympatric with other <em>Mazama </em>species, at least along its ecotonal areas. In Paraguay, Argentina and the western parts of Brazil, this species appears to be partially segregated of <em>M. americana</em> by using habitats with dense lower strata, abundant bamboo understory and secondary growth forests (Chebez and Varela 2001, Vogliotti 2008).<br/><br/>There is no specific information about its spatial, behavioural or feeding ecology, which are probably similar to the general pattern of <em>Mazama</em>, including: nocturnal, solitary, territorial and sedentary habits on small home ranges (Abril <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Small subpopulations still persists in forest remnants among agricultural landscapes where they are subject to population decline, extinction and recolonization processes. Non-invasive studies using faecal DNA markers are in course to access initial information on population ecology of <em>M. nana</em> in protected or fragmented areas in Brazil.","In spite of all the uncertainties in ecological and biological aspects, it is the most threatened deer of Brazil and possibly of the Neotropical region. The subpopulation isolation caused by habitat loss in the past must be the main threat to the maintenance of the remaining subpopulations at the present time. The fragmentation tends to increase pressures, such as hunting, predation by dogs, exposure to the diseases of domestic species, and the progressive degradation of small forest fragments (edge effects; Galindo- Leal and De Gusmão Câmara 2003). Cytogenetic analysis of this species found extensive intraspecific chromosome polymorphism that could affect the reproductive efficiency and population sustainability (Abril and Duarte&#160;2008). In Paraguay, the subpopulations are also threatened due to loss of habitat (J.L. Cartes pers. comm.). One of the major conservation problems is hunting, mainly in the provincial parks and private forests. Moreover, the construction of roads has increased the number of road-kills and this could be affecting the subpopulations.","There is no precise information on the population size in any of the areas where it has been observed nor on the degree of connectivity between them, but it is likely that its subpopulations are decreasing due to the decline of the moist lowland forests within its range. Although it seems to be tolerant to fragmented and secondary forest formations, it is likely that its subpopulations are declining or will be declining due to issues including feral dogs, hunting and ruminant diseases that are boosted by the fragmentation process.",Unknown,"Known from a small sample of specimens in museums, this species was formerly included within the Little Dwarf Brocket,<em> Mazama rufina</em> (Redford and Eisenberg 1992). For Redford and Eisenberg (1992) and Eisenberg and Redford (1999) this species occurs in southeast Paraguay, north of Misiones Province in Argentina, and in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais (extreme south), São Paulo (except Serra do Mar), Mato Grosso do Sul (south and southeast), Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (north). However, this distribution is not consistent with the origin of scarce material in the Brazilian scientific collections that restrict its distribution to the southwest of Sao Paulo (to the south of Paranapanema River), Parana, Santa Catarina and north of Rio Grande do Sul (Rossi 2000).<br/><br/>The loss of preferential habitats could have caused the occupation of forest formations less preferred by the species. This would explain the recent records in the east of Parana and Santa Catarina (Montane Forest and Submontane Ombrophilous Dense Forest; Margarido and Braga 2004, J.M.B. Duarte pers. comm.) and the absence of historical records in these regions (Rossi 2000).<br/><br/>The National Museum of Natural History of Paraguay has records of <em>M. nana</em> in San Rafael National Park region (Gamarra de Fox and Martin 1996) and in Argentina, this species may be found in almost all the remaining natural forests of Misiones Province (D.M. Varella pers. comm.).",This species is used locally for food.,Terrestrial,"In Brazil with respect to protected areas, this species is mentioned in some national parks (Iguaçu, Araucárias, Serra do Itajaí), state parks (Lauraceas, Pau Oco, Boguaçu, Vila do Espírito Santo, São Camilo), private reserves of the natural patrimony (Federal das Araucárias, Monte Alegre Farm) and Mata Preta Ecological Station (J.M.B. Duarte and M.L. Oliveira pers. comm.). In Misiones, Argentina, many conservation units shelter important subpopulations of this species, such as the Iguaçu National Park and the State Parks of Urugua-í, Foerster, Piñalito, Cruce Caballero, Esmeralda, Moconá and Cuña Pirú (D.M.

In Paraguay, the majority of the Atlantic Forest habitats are extinct, what remains is in protected areas such as Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayú and the Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant Reserve.

22158407,136708,Mazama nemorivaga,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is considered to be Least Concern in light of its wide distribution and occurrence in many protected areas. <em>Mazama nemorivaga</em> has a large geographic distribution mostly associated to the Amazon basin forests. Although this species is threatened by loss of habitat and local hunting (mainly for subsistence), it occurs in several protected areas throughout its range. Besides, several studies have shown that over hunting is not a real threat to this deer (at least in Suriname and northeastern Peru), due to its ability of dispersal, difficulty of capture, and fast rates of reproduction. Despite the Least Concern status of this species, taxonomic studies must be encouraged in order to evaluate the taxonomic status of the northernmost populations, for which several nominal taxa are available and morphological differences related to southern populations have been reported.","Most of the localities with records of <em>M. nemorivaga</em> are inside the tropical and subtropical broadleaf moist forests biome of Olson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2001), and are related to the Amazon region. From a total of 114 records, 10 are inside the tropical and subtropical broadleaf dry forest biome, and 7 are inside the desert and xeric scrubland biome. The majority of the localities associated with dry or xeric habitats are those referred to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. gouzoubira</span> cita by Bisbal (1991). The taxonomic status of <em>Mazama cita </em>Osgood, 1912 still needs to be thoroughly evaluated.<br/><br/>According to the absence or presence of flooding, the Amazonian rain forests are broadly classified into respectively non-flooded (tierra/terra firme) and seasonally flooded (várzea) forests. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mazama nemorivaga</span> inhabits the non-flooded forests and is rare or absent in the seasonally flooded forests. For example, it does not occur in the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve in Peru, which covers an area of over 2 million hectares of seasonally flooded várzea forests. However, it is found in the adjacent inter-fluvial upland forests of the Yavari valley (Bodmer 2003).<br/><br/>Reproduction biology of the Amazonian Brown Brocket deer has been studied by Hurtado-Gonzales (2000) in the northeast Peruvian Amazon. Breeding appeared to be year round, and occurred from January to March, July to October, and December. Births occurred in January, March, April, and from July through October. No twinning was observed and the pregnancy rate was 0.50 pregnant females/total numbers of females. Most of the pregnant females were adults between 1 and 2 years old. In northeast Bolívar, Venezuela, Bisbal (1994) found pregnant females in December, January, and April. Births occurred in July, August, and November, apparently associated with the rainy season.","Habitat destruction is certainly the main type of threat to this species, at least in Brazil where the deforestation in Amazonia started by the early decade of 1970 and reached 16.2% (forest loss) of the original forest in 2003 (Fearnside 2005). This threat is particularly strong across the “deforestation arch” in the southern Brazilian Amazon, a region that extends from the state of Acre eastward to the southern states of Pará and Maranhão.<br/><br/>Although the Amazon forest has been destroyed for many reasons, the main cause of deforestation is cattle raising, responsible for 70% of forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon (Fearnside 2005). Besides the destruction of forest, the cattle itself may negatively affect deer populations through a variety of parasitic, bacterial or viral diseases that can contaminate them. Indeed, Pinder and Leeuwenberg (1997) mentioned that there are reports of high mortality rates of deer previously in contact with ill cattle in the Brazilian Pantanal region and the states of Maranhão and Minas Gerais. The extent to which the cattle affect populations of <em>M. nemorivaga</em> is unknown.<br/><br/>Fortunately, overhunting appears not to be a threat to <em>Mazama nemorivaga</em>. This species is usually less abundant than the sympatric red brocket deer (<em>M. americana</em>), but also has lower hunting pressure. Branan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (1985) reported the harvest of 5 individuals of the former species against 57 individuals of the latter by Surinamese hunters in 1980 and 1981. Similarly, Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer (2004) found a rate of 0.06 individuals hunted/km² for <em>M. nemorivaga</em> in contrast to 0.17 individuals hunted/km² for <em>M. americana</em> in a heavy hunted site in northeastern Peru. In addition to the low hunting pressure, most studies on the sustainability of hunting by Peruvian rural and indigenous people reported that the harvest of <em>Mazama nemorivaga</em> is within sustainable limits (Ascorra 1997, Bodmer 1995, Bodmer <em>et al</em>. 1997, Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer 2004, Mena <em>et al</em>. 2000). There are two likely reasons for that. First, brockets (including <em>M. americana</em> and <em>M. nemorivaga</em>) can be categorized as less vulnerable to overhunting because of their fast rates of reproduction and intrinsic rates of population increase, allied to the ability of dispersal and difficulty of capture (see Bodmer <em>et al</em>. 1997, and Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer 2004). Second, slightly or unhunted areas adjacent to persistently hunted ones may have been acting as sources of game, as claimed by Novaro <em>et al</em>. (2000). According to them, 47 to 87% of unhunted area close to the catchment site is required to prevent a population decline of Amazonian Brown Brocket in the Peruvian Amazon.","Through the studies of Bodmer (1994), Bodmer <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (1997) and Hurtado-Gonzales and Bodmer (2004) we have known of Mazama nemorivaga populations that inhabit the margins of Yavari Miri and Tahuayo rivers, northeastern Peru. Apparently, these populations are not isolated from each other, as stated by Novaro <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2000).<br/>In this region, the Amazonian Brown Brocket has considerably lower population densities than the Red Brocket. The density of the former is around 0.43-0.55 individuals per km² and its biomass estimates range from 6.5-8.2 kg/km². In contrast, Red Brocket deer usually have densities around 1.0 individuals per km² and a biomass of around 33 kg/km² (Salovaara <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Populations of Amazonian Brown Brocket were also reported in Suriname (Branan <em>et al</em>. 1985), in  the Reserva Florestal Imataca, northeast of the state of Bolívar, Venezuela (Bisbal 1994), and in  French Guiana (Gayot <em>et al</em>. 2004). Other populations of this deer are certainly present in many reserves or even private areas with well preserved forests. But the extant to which they are isolated from each other is unknown, due to the lack of knowledge on how this species responds to altered and fragmented habitats.",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mazama nemorivaga</span> occurs in Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, Isla San José (Panamá), Ecuador, Peru, and probably in Bolivia.

It is probably present everywhere in the territory of French Guiana, Suriname, and Guyana, but in Venezuela it has a disjunct distribution that includes the evergreen and semidecidual forests south of Río Orinoco in the states of Amazonas and Bolívar, plus the decidual forests and xeric shrublands of the coastal region in the states of Aragua, Carabobo, Falcón, Lara, and Zulia (Bisbal 1991). In Colombia, Alberico <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2000) reported the occurrence of the Amazonian Brown Brocket deer in the Amazon and Caribbean regions in the states of Amazonas, Caquetá, Bolívar, Cesar, and Cundinamarca, from 0 to 500 meters high. Additional information gathered from the literature points the presence of this species also in the states of Antioquia, La Guajira, Magdalena, and Meta (Allen 1904, Barriga-Bonilla 1966, Lydekker 1915, Medellín <em>et al</em>. 1998, Osgood 1912). <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. nemorivaga</span> does not reach Central America except for the Isla San José in the Archipiélago de las Perlas, Golfo de Panamá, Panamá (Kellogg 1946, Medellín <em>et al</em>. 1998).

22160916,2828,Blastocerus dichotomus,Vulnerable,A4cde,2016,2016-01-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is confirmed to be Vulnerable due to an ongoing decline suspected in the past and in the future based on direct and indirect threats. Based on rates of current decline, and considering a time period of three generations (15 years), including both past (10 years) and future (five years), this species have declined by more than 30%. Despite the lack of evidence of decline in the Pantanal population (Mourão <em>et al</em>. 2000, Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2005), the species may be considered to be declining throughout its geographic distribution. Although no data on demography are available for other populations, it is realistic to expect an overall decline due to poaching, habitat loss and disease. Habitat loss due to hydroelectric dams has been documented, but wetland drainage for agricultural purposes is also important in the floodplains of many rivers (Andriolo <em>et al.</em> 2013). Flooding by large reservoirs completely eliminates the best Marsh Deer habitats and isolates populations. Additionally, the retention of water by these dams causes deep changes in the flooding regime of wetlands downstream, which may cause disruption in the aquatic-plant communities, consequently reducing the carrying capacity of these habitats for Marsh Deer (Tomas <em>et al</em>. 1997, Tomas and Salis 2000). Drainage of the wetlands and its conversion into agricultural landscapes, also reduces its carrying capacity for the species. The main direct effects of habitat loss have been the fragmentation and isolation of Marsh Deer populations (Tomas <em>et al</em>. 1997), which may lead to demographic and genetic consequences. In Uruguay the species is thought to be extinct: the last record from this country was in 1958 (Ximenez <em>et al</em>. 1972).","This species is found in the marshy habitats south of the Amazon River into northern Argentina (Pinder and Grosse 1991), with water depth as much as 0.0 m (Tomas <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). Diet is generally grasses, reeds and aquatic plants, but may include shrubs and vines during prolonged flooding (Nowak and Paradiso 1983). The marsh deer is generally solitary or found in small groups of 2–3. Aggregations of up to six animals have been reported on islands during floods (Schaller and Vasconcelos 1978). The Marsh Deer is the largest cervid species of South America. Male animals can reach up to 150 kg and the females up to 100 kg (Duarte and Merino 1997).","The species is declining throughout its range due to excessive hunting and wetland conversion for agriculture, tree plantations, and dams. In Brazil and Argentina, hydroelectric projects have eliminated floodplain habitat along many large rivers, including the Tiete, Paraná, and Rio Grande (DSG 1991), and cattle ranching has severely reduced and fragmented habitats. Competition with domestic livestock may be a major threat (Schaller and Vasconcelos 1978) and pollution of waterways associated with gold mining is a serious threat in the Pantanal. Accidental introduction of bovine diseases may account for large losses reported in Bolivia during the 1970s when reproductive failure was reportedly common (Mann and Schuerholz 1977). Beccaceci (1994) also mentioned disease, hunting, and competition with livestock as possible limiting factors in the Ibera Natural Reserve, Argentina. In the Paraná River Delta, the conversion of marshes for exotic tree plantation and hunting threaten the population in Argentina (Varela 2003). In Brazil, tick infestation was one of the most important causes of death after habitat loss in the Parana River basin (Szabo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003).","The species is declining throughout much of its range (Nowak and Paradiso 1983) although recent surveys in Brazil have revealed higher populations than had been previously recorded (Mauro 1995). Information gathered at a PHVA workshop indicates that approximately 41,000 Marsh Deer still survive in Brazil (Pinder 1996). In Argentina, population estimates are around 2,000 animals in Iberá marshes, other important populations are known from Formosa and the Paraná River Delta (Varela <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001). In Bolivia, several populations are known from the  Beni savannas and Noel Kempff National Park, and a recent population survey in Pampas Heath estimates 700 deer in the north of Madidi National Park (Gomez and Ríos-Uzeda 2004).<br/><br/>The principal population in Paraguay is in the Yacyretá region where density is low. Most populations in Paraguay were reported to be declining in the 1970s (Jungius 1974, 1976).  In Peru the species occurred in small numbers in Pampas del Heath (Hofmann <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1976, Montanbault 2002, Escamilo pers. comm.). The last record of the species in Uruguay dates back to 1958 (Ximenez <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1972, González 1994).",Decreasing,"The Marsh Deer, <em>Blastocerus dichotomus</em>, is the largest South American deer. Originally much more widely distributed throughout present range (Nowak and Paradiso 1983), it now occurs in east-central and northeastern Argentina, west-central and southern Brazil, Paraguay, southeastern Peru, and eastern Bolivia. The species has been extirpated from Uruguay.","Marsh Deer is strongly threatened by poaching (populations of Paraná and Pantanal River Basin) and by subsistence hunting (population of the Araguaia River basin). Hunting is difficult to perform because of the difficult access to the species' environment. Hunting is the third most important threat to the species after habitat loss (due to hydroelectric dams and wetland drainage for agricultural purposes) and diseases of domestic ruminants (Piovezan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Andriolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).

Most of the reduction has continued over the last ten years as a  result of severe deforestation and agricultural development, at least in  Colombia. Additionally, a projected continuing decline of the extent of  occurrence based on continuing deforestation together with a low  percentage of protected areas (two National Parks) may result in more  than 30% reduction of the population. For this reason the species is listed Vulnerable due to an ongoing population decline, suspected to be greater than 30%, over a period of three generations (21 years) considering both the past (10 years) and future (11 years) suspected from loss of primary habitat.","Originally found in montane forests and paramos at altitudes between 1,000 and 3,500 m asl in  mountain chains and massifs crossing over Venezuela (Zulia, Tachira, Apure, Merida, and Trujillo) and Colombia (La Guajira, Cesar, Norte de Santander, Santander, Boyaca). Linares (1998) reports <em>M. bricenii</em> as present on the eastern flank of Perija massive based on animal body parts that he collected at 3,100 m in Cerro Viruela near Pico Tetari. Thus, it is highly probable that the species also occupies paramos on the Colombian side of Perija.  <br/><br/>The main habitat of <em>M. bricenii</em> is paramos and tropical montane cloud forests above 1,500 m. The paramos are high altitude grasslands (Boom <em>et al.</em> 2001), which are dominated by <em>Calamagrostis </em>spp. and gigantic Andean rosette plants from the genus Espeletia (Luteyn 1992). The tropical montane cloud forest is a type of vegetation that has special climatic conditions causing cloud and mist to be regularly in contact with the forest vegetation (Bruijnzeel and Veneklaas 1998). These forests support ecosystems of distinctive floristic and structural forms with lower canopy and thicker understory than lowland forests (Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1963). Details on <em>M. bricenii</em> ecology are unknown, although it seems to be solitary, active at day as well as at night, and expected to be a browser/frugivore in the forest understory. They are shy and secretive animals, rarely seen because of their nocturnal habits. They live either alone or in pairs and normally within a small territory. They usually defecate in latrines probably located at boundaries of territories. Further research is required.","Habitat destruction occurs due to small-scale cattle ranching and agriculture practised by local communities through forest cutting and burning of montane grasslands and shrub lands. Illegal plantations of opium and Coca may be the main cause of habitat destruction in some areas of Colombia (Alvarez 2007). Mining, road construction and colonization expand habitat loss. Climate change might also result in a reduction of available habitat for the species in the future, since cloud forests and paramos are broadly affected by atmospheric temperature rise (Foster 2001). Hunting occurs as a source of meat and medicinal products at the local level but needs assessment. They are preyed on by a small number of South American predators, such as puma and feral dogs.",A decreasing population trend is suspected based on habitat destruction.,Decreasing,"This species is patchily distributed in the high Andes in northern Colombia and western Venezuela. According to present forest distribution, the largest populations of <em>M. bricenii</em> should be located in the following Venezuelan national parks: El Tama National Park, between Táchira and Apure states; Páramos del Batallón National Park between Mérida and Táchira states; Sierra Nevada National Park between Barinas and Mérida states; Sierra de la Culata National Park in Mérida and Trujillo states; Guaramacal National Park also known as ""General Cruz Carrillo"" in the state of Trujillo, with a small portion located in the state of Portuguesa (Utrera 1999); and Dinira National Park located in Sierra de Barbacoas, in watersheds of Tocuyo river between Lara, Portuguesa and Trujillo states. Dinira and Guaramacal probably form the eastern most location of the species within Venezuela. Some populations might be expected outside protected areas in the hinterlands between Sierra Nevada and Páramos del Batallon national parks, an area known as Pueblos del Sur de Mérida, and between Guaramacal and Sierra Nevada national parks, known as Ramal de Calderas.  In Colombia it is found in Tama national park in Norte de Santander state and possibly in Cocuy national park between Boyaca, Arauca and Casanare states.

The paramos are high altitude grasslands (Boom <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001), which are dominated by <em>Calamagrostis </em>spp. and gigantic Andean rosette plants from the genus Espeletia (Luteyn 1992). The tropical montane cloud forest is a type of vegetation that has special climatic conditions causing cloud and mist to be regularly in contact with the forest vegetation (Bruijnzeel and Veneklaas 1998). These forests support ecosystems of distinctive floristic and structural forms with lower canopy and thicker understory than lowland forests (Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1963). <br/><br/>Along its distribution, <em>M. rufina</em> shares the same habitat with the northern pudu (<em>Pudu mephistophiles</em>) (Hershkovitz 1982); the mountain tapir (<em>Tapirus pinchaque</em>) (Lizcano <em>et al</em>. 2002); and the Andean bear (<em>Tremarctos ornatus</em>) (Peyton 1999). Details of its ecology are unknown, although it seems to be solitary, active by day as well as at night, and expected to be a browser/frugivore in the forest understorey. They are shy and secretive animals, rarely seen because of their nocturnal habits. They live either alone or in pairs and normally within a small territory. They usually defecate in latrines probably located at the boundaries of their territories. <br/><br/>The Brocket deer is a frequent visitor of salt licks (Lizcano and Cavelier 2004). In the Central Andes of Colombia its diet is composed of 40 species of plants mainly herbs, from which it prefers plants of <em>Solanum</em> spp. and <em>Begonia umbellata</em> (Lizcano 2006). They rely on their small size and knowledge of the habitat in which they live to escape predators, diving into thick vegetation when detected. Occasionally they present freezing behaviour before escaping. Nothing is known of reproduction or life in captivity. <em>Oxalis </em>sp. has been identified among plant species eaten by <em>Mazama rufina.</em> No research has been conducted to study the home range.","Habitat destruction occurs due to small scale cattle ranching and agriculture practised by local communities through forest cutting and burning of montane grasslands and shrublands. Illegal plantations of opium and Coca may be the main cause of habitat destruction in some areas of Colombia (Alvarez 2007). Mining, road construction and colonization expand habitat loss. Climate change might also result in area or quality decrease of available habitat for the species in the future, since cloud forests and paramos are broadly affected by atmospheric temperature increase (Foster 2001). Hunting occurs as a source of meat and medicinal products at the local level but needs assessment. They are preyed on by a small number of South American predators, such as puma and feral dogs.","Its density is low ranging from 0.06 (individuals/km²) in mature forest to 0.3 (individuals/km²) in ecotone paramo-montane forest. Its preferred habitats are paramo and forest-paramo ecotone over secondary and mature forest (Lizcano 2006). Collection sites in Colombia may be grouped into 3 to 5 locations distributed in the National Park Los Nevados, Las Hermosas, Nevado del Huila, and Doña Ana, and potentially in Pichachos, Macarena, Sumapaz, and Chingaza. Collection sites of Ecuador correspond to locations at Sangay and Podocarpus National Parks. In Peru collection sites are in and around Tabaconas – Namballe (Maravi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). Current distribution and abundance need to be further assessed. A decreasing population trend is suspected from habitat destruction.",Decreasing,"Following (Czernay 1987) <em>M. rufina</em> is restricted to the Andes. It was originally found in montane forest and paramos at altitudes between 1500-3500 m.a.s.l. (Eisenberg and Redford 1999), from the Central Andes in Colombia to Huancabamba valley in northern Peru. It is currently restricted to remnant forest patches and paramos in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In Colombia it occurs in the states of Nariño, Huila, Cauca, Valle del Cauca, Tolima, Risaralda, Quindío, Caldas, and Boyacá (Alberico <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). <em>M. rufina</em> has not been recorded for the Oriental Andes of Colombia (Cuervo <em>et al</em>. 1986, Alberico <em>et al</em>. 2000). Although <em>M. rufina </em>is not included in the list of mammals of Antioquia state (Cuartas-Calle and Muñoz-Arango 2003), photographic evidence of its presence and of its being hunted was recorded at the “Páramo de Belmira” in the Central Andes of Antioquia (Delgado-V. pers. obs. 2003), which is the northern most record for this species. In Ecuador it was recorded in the western and eastern Andes along the Chimborazo region axis (Tirira 2001). In Peru it is distributed on the eastern flank of the Andes in the watersheds of the Amazon river.<br/><br/>The southern limit of <em>M. rufina</em> is the Huacabamba valley which also acts as a biogeographical barrier for other mammal species (Hershkovitz 1959, 1982, Eisenberg and Redford 1999).

The species occupies areas of sparse vegetative cover and well-drained soils and slope generally less than 9% (Williams and Kilburn 1991) (sometimes up to 22%; USFWS 1998), often in areas that are heavily grazed by cattle and sheep (Williams and Kilburn 1991). They prefer semi-arid slopes at the head of draws in barren shrubless areas, with loose, easily diggable, sandy loam soils. Found in underground burrows when inactive. They are absent from areas continuously in dry-land cultivation and from irrigated fields but may recolonize fallow dry-land grain fields if there are colonies on uncultivated land nearby (Williams and Kilburn 1991). Habitats listed in order of decreasing favorability: 1) annual grassland association in areas with less than five to six inches annual rain, and level to gently sloping ground, 2) alkali desert scrub association in areas with less than five to six inches annual rain, sandy loam soils, and level to gently sloping ground, 3) friable soils of sand, loam, clay loam or gravelly in areas with the above characteristics, and 4) slopes of 10-15 degrees with the above characteristics and located near colonies in more favorable habitats (D. Williams pers. comm).<br/><br/>Home range is about 60-350 m². This species is basically solitary and territorial, with strict intrasexual avoidance indicated. In spring, areas around occupied burrows have a more lush growth of herbaceous vegetation than do areas between burrow systems; this growth is eventually removed by grazing by livestock and/or kangaroo rats (Williams and Kilburn 1991). Digging and feeding activity promote the establishment of exotic weeds, which in turn are a favoured food source (Schiffman 1994). Giant Kangaroo Rats feed on seeds, especially those of <em>Lepidium nitidum, oenothera, Bromus rubens,</em> and <em>Erodium cicutarium</em>. They also eat some green herbaceous vegetation and occasionally insects. In some localities. They gather dry grass into ""haystacks"" to cure, later removing seeds for storage in underground burrows. They also temporarily bury seeds in the ground before storing in burrows. Giant Kangaroo Rats emerge to forage soon after sunset in spring. They spend a little less than two hours per night above ground actively foraging in spring-summer (Braun 1985).<br/><br/>Limited data indicate that the reproductive season may extend from January through May (Williams and Kilburn 1991) (February to June or perhaps later according to Biosystems Analysis 1989). Gestation lasts about one month. Litter size is three to six (Biosystems Analysis 1989); average litter size is probably four (Williams and Kilburn 1991). Young are weaned at four weeks (Matthews and Moseley 1990).","The decline is largely a result of conversion of habitat to agricultural uses, combined with additional loss of habitat to industrial uses (e.g., petroleum exploration and extraction) and urbanization, and population reductions and extirpations from rodenticide use (aimed at California ground squirrel and historically at kangaroo rats) (Williams 1992, USFWS 1998). Possibly excessive livestock grazing may have contributed to the decline in some areas (livestock may crush near-surface burrows and compete for food with kangaroo rats) (see USFWS 1998). Between 1972 and 1980 most of the remaining habitat was converted from native vegetation to cultivated agricultural crops due in part to an abundance of irrigation water supplied by recently completed water delivery systems.<br/><br/>More recently, the conversion of habitat to agricultural uses has slowed substantially, but urban and industrial developments, petroleum and mineral exploration and extraction, new energy and water conveyance facilities, and construction of communication and transportation infrastructures continue to destroy habitat and increase the threats to the species by reducing and further fragmenting populations (USFWS 1998). Habitat degradation due to lack of appropriate habitat management on conservation lands, especially lack of grazing or fire to control density of vegetation (including shrubs) may be a threat (Williams and Germano 1993).","The huge colonies of this species described in historical literature no longer exist. Extant habitat comprises only about 1.8 percent of the historical habitat (Williams 1992, USFWS 1998).The extant distribution includes more than 100 more or less distinct populations, but most of these represent fragments of a formerly more continuous distribution. There are six major geographic units, each of which could be regarded as a single occurrence or subpopulation. Total adult population size is unknown but probably exceeds 100,000 during average conditions. Adult population size varies substantially with drought and plant productivity (USFWS 1998); density ranges from one to 110 individuals per hectare (see USFWS 1998).<br/><br/>Within the area of currently occupied habitat, populations have expanded and declined with changing weather patterns since 1979; at their peak in 1992 to 1993, there probably were about six to 10 times more individuals than at their low point in spring of 1991, when a majority of the 11,145 hectares probably was uninhabited and most of the rest was inhabited by less than 10 percent of peak numbers (see USFWS 1998 for sources). Population density is five to 50 per hectare (18-69/ha in the larger and denser colonies; Williams and Kilburn 1991). Extant population sizes are small; from fewer than 10 to several hundred individuals (Braun 1985).",Decreasing,"The species is endemic to California in the United States where it is confined to a narrow strip along the southwestern border of the San Joaquin Valley and a few nearby valleys to the west, including the Carrizo and Elkhorn plains and upper Cuyama Valley, with scattered colonies in the Ciervo, Kettleman, Panoche, and Turney Hills, and the Panoche Valley (Grinnell 1922, Hall 1981, Williams and Kilburn 1991, Williams <em>et al.</em>&#160;1993).

45176206,2963,Brachylagus idahoensis,Least Concern,,2016,2016-07-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The population status of <em>Brachylagus idahoensis </em>is extremely varied across its discontinuous range, and its dependence on big sagebrush makes it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss from rangeland conversion and fire, and the resulting fragmentation often leads to decreased genetic diversity within populations (Dobler and Dixon 1990). The extirpated Columbia Basin population is being re-introduced. However, there are several robust populations in less disturbed areas, and suitable habitat still exists in many areas.","<strong>General</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> mainly occupies big sagebrush (<em>Artemisia tridentata</em>), especially where the vegetation is very dense. It forms burrows in soft, deep soils, in areas such as alluvial fans, often burrowing into a slope or rise in land elevation (Dobler and Dixon 1990).<br/><br/>As observed in captivity, free-ranging females construct natal burrows that are separate from residential burrow systems. The natal burrows have a single entrance leading to a nest chamber. Entrances to natal burrows are backfilled with soil and often are located at the base of shrubs (Rachlow <em>et al.</em> in prep). Preliminary observations based on radio-telemetry in the Lemhi Valley, Idaho, suggest that <em>B. idahoensis</em> moves longer distances than previously documented (more than 7 km for adults, and more than 6 km for juvenile rabbits) (Rachlow <em>et al</em>. in prep).<br/><br/><em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is preyed upon by coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), badgers (<em>Taxidea taxus</em>), weasels (<em>Mustela frenata</em>), bobcats (<em>Lynx rufus</em>), great horned owls (<em>Bubo virginianus</em>), long-eared owls (<em>Asio otus</em>), northern harriers (<em>Circus cyaneus</em>) (Dobler and Dixon 1990) and red foxes (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) (Green and Flinders 1980).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: In Wyoming, <em>B. idahoensis</em> appears to follow the general accepted patterns of habitat use: an affinity for tall and dense sagebrush growing on friable soils. A few documented observations are from areas with only short and sparse sagebrush; there is some speculation (and only speculation) that <em>B. idahoensis</em> can occupy this type of habitat when wind is persistent enough to keep even short sagebrush exposed in the winter (i.e. the true habitat requirement is sagebrush exposed in winter, which in most areas is tall sagebrush, but in a few windy sites may be otherwise). Alternatively, these observations may represent juveniles dispersing through non-typical environments. In landscapes where short and sparse sagebrush is the matrix surrounding island patches of tall and dense sagebrush, <em>B. idahoensis</em> can be reliably found in the islands. Several field workers in south-west Wyoming have independently remarked that <em>B. idahoensis</em> tends to be most frequently found in an elevation band from approximately 6,500-7,500 ft (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> in Nevada seems to have similar habitat preferences as rabbits found in other states. They require loamy soils with big sagebrush. They can be located throughout entire valleys, but when not, they generally tend to be found in the largest, most dense clumps of sagebrush on appropriate soils. They have been located in areas with practically no understory (example: Reese Valley) as well as in areas with a heavy understory of forbs and bunch grasses (Sheldon Preserve). There may be competition between <em>B. idahoensis</em> and cottontail rabbits. Areas with high understory often have both rabbit types while areas with moderate understory only have cottontails. These cottontails have been found to be living in burrows that may have originally been made by <em>B. idahoensis</em>. In areas with practically no understory, <em>B. idahoensis</em> has been found with no cottontails (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>California</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> in California has similar habitat requirements to those in Nevada. However, the rabbits around Mono Lake are found in soils that have a higher sand content than populations found in Nevada. They are often found in ""loamier"" inclusions in stabilized sand dunes. Also, the rabbits in the Bodie area live at very high elevations (8,400+ ft). These rabbits are found in loamy soils in relatively low sagebrush (about 2-3 ft). They are still more likely to be found in the largest and densest sagebrush in the area (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: Habitat use by <em>B. idahoensis</em> as inferred from burrow placement and distribution of pellets indicates preferential use of the densest patches of sagebrush available on the landscape. Use of sagebrush species (<em>Artemisia tridentata tridentata, A. t.vaseyana, A. t. wyomingensis</em>, and <em>Artemisia arbuscula</em>) and heights (30-60 cm) varies considerably with elevation and latitude. It should also be noted that numerous sites considered by range specialists to be ""overgrazed"" (maintains its sagebrush over story, but exhibits substantial loss of grass and forb understory) contained large numbers of <em>B. idahoensis</em>. This, combined with their use of roadsides and disturbed edge, indicated that rabbits in Utah seem relatively flexible in their use of habitat, given sagebrush maintains proper canopy cover. Extensive snow tracking has been conducted in populations of the Wyoming Basin (Rich County). Initial analysis of non-dispersal movements indicated regular movements of 0.5-1.0 km within the first six hours after a fresh snowfall (Kozlowski 2004).","<strong>General</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is dependent on big sagebrush (<em>Artemisia tridentata</em>), it is particularly sensitive to habitat loss. Fires that are more frequent due to the increase of invasive cheatgrass, conversion to cropland and rangeland are contributors to loss of sagebrush habitat. Isolation of populations due to fragmentation of suitable habitat cause bottlenecks that threaten subpopulations. Dispersal is limited in fragmented populations, because <em>B. idahoensis</em> will not cross large open areas (Dobler and Dixon 1990).<br/><br/><strong>Washington</strong>: In Washington, <em>B. idahoensis</em> is threatened by loss of deep soil shrub-steppe habitat, increase in fire frequencies due to cheatgrass invasion. Fires have the potential to remove sagebrush from vast areas. A recent fire in Washington State burned 66,000 hectares just outside the historic range of <em>B. idahoensis</em>. There are 417,000 hectares within the historic range of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Washington with soil types where rabbits have been located. Of that amount, 27,000 acres remain in shrub-steppe today, and much of that has been degraded through fire and agricultural practices. Change in abundance and foraging of native predators due to habitat change are potential threats range wide that are largely unstudied (Hays 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: Although cheatgrass is not yet a major problem in southwest Wyoming, it is thought to be only a matter of time before it begins to dominate here as it has in states to the west. Also petroleum exploration and development is expected to increase markedly here, with consequent increase in sagebrush removal, alteration of fire cycles, increased road density, and increased potential for cheatgrass and other noxious weed establishment. Habitat managers appear to support more prescribed burning of tall and dense sagebrush, primarily to increase forage for big game and improve habitat for sage grouse. There is only occasional attention being paid to how this might harm <em>B. idahoensis</em>, as well as other vertebrates with similar habitat affinities (e.g. sage thrashers, sage sparrows). Heavy livestock grazing has the potential to reduce habitat quality for <em>B. idahoensis</em>, but it is important to recognize that southwest Wyoming was historically grazed by bison and white-tailed prairie dogs (<em>Cynomys leucurus</em>) with the latter species persisting into the present. Grazing by domestic sheep, cattle, horses, and feral horses occurs today, but was probably more intense and pervasive in the early 20th century and <em>B. idahoensis</em> are presumed to have persisted through that period. Disturbance of habitat in the vicinity of Bear Lake (ID) may reduce the already tentative connectivity between Wyoming populations and those to the west (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada </strong>and <strong>California</strong>: The main threat to <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Nevada and California is fragmentation due to vast fires. (These fires have extirpated populations from entire valleys and without leaving any cover behind may not allow rabbits to repopulate the area.) This is a severe problem that will most likely become greater with increasing cheatgrass invasion across Nevada. Agricultural fields are also a threat. Not only are they usually placed on the same loamy soils  the rabbits prefer, but they also create a potentially impassable barrier and may increase the habitat suitability for cottontails. Road systems may also be a larger barrier to dispersal that we may think. In night-time road transect surveys in areas with known ratios of jackrabbits/cottontails/<em>B. idahoensis</em>, <em>B. idahoensis</em> was consistently significantly under-represented. This may be due to their reluctance to cross open areas (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Oregon</strong>: Threats to <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Oregon include fire (natural and managed), flooding, conversion to agriculture, exotic plants, decadence and overgrazing. The accumulative effects of the threats have contributed to habitat fragmentation and the isolation of populations (Carey <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: The primary threat to <em>B. idahoensis</em> at this time is habitat loss. Loss occurs as a result of human development (historic losses: Wasatch Front north of Salt Lake; current losses: southwestern portion of the state in the vicinity of Cedar City), conversion to cultivated agriculture (northwestern portion of the Great Basin), degradation of plant communities due to overgrazing (widespread), increased fire frequency due to invasive weed understory (Great Basin), and large scale range improvement projects favouring the creation of large openings in mature sagebrush (Wyoming Basin, Lower Wasatch Range). As populations get smaller and more isolated, predators and disease may play more prominent roles as threats (Kozlowski 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Idaho</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is threatened in Idaho by loss and/or modification of habitat including agricultural and urban development, invasive weeds, and changes in fire frequencies (Rachlow 2004b).<br/><br/><strong>Montana</strong>: Rauscher (1997) mentions fragmentation of <em>B. idahoensis</em> habitat resulting from projects to improve rangeland for cattle as a threat (sagebrush is removed). He qualified that by stating that the rabbit is somewhat resilient and has the ability to use sites that were previously disturbed.","<strong>Washington</strong>: The Columbia Basin population of <em>B. idahoensis</em> was extirpated as of 2004 (Sayler <em>et al</em>. 2007), and is federally listed as endangered. A captive population exists with 21 Columbia Basin specimens of <em>B. idahoensis</em> and 26 rabbits crossed and backcrossed with <em>B. idahoensis</em> from Idaho (Hays 2004). Specimens taken to establish founding population for reintroduction had low reproductivity and high disease susceptibility, probably as a result of inbreeding depression. Intercrossing with <em>B. idahoensis</em> from Idaho was successful in restoring genetic diversity and increasing reproductive levels (Sayler <em>et al</em>. 2007). In March 2007, 20 rabbits were released as part of a reintroduction program in Douglas County, Washington (Oregon Zoo 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: The Wyoming Natural Diversity Database (WYNDD; University of Wyoming) has on file 93 records of <em>B. idahoensis</em> observations documented in Wyoming. Very few populations have been studied enough to draw reliable conclusions as to size or trend. The population at Fossil Butte National Monument as been studied at various times in the past, and appears to be rather abundant and persistent. In general, field biologists with good knowledge of <em>B. idahoensis</em> habitat can find individuals with relative ease within the known range of the species in Wyoming. In 2003, WYNDD biologists surveyed two areas outside of known range in the state; <em>B. idahoensis</em> was documented at one of these sites (Sweetwater River watershed, described above). Appropriate habitat is rather abundant and contiguous in southwest Wyoming; cheatgrass has not impacted this area to any great degree (yet) (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada </strong>and <strong>California</strong>: Sizes of populations and abundances of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in an area vary. Certain populations in Nevada are composed of vast expanses of burrows. Other populations may include only one burrow system with only about two rabbits photographed at the site. However, we do not know how far these rabbits can disperse and so do not know what constitutes a single population. Once an area is found to contain <em>B. idahoensis</em>, they are often located throughout the valley in reasonable numbers. Fragmentation of populations is largely unknown since we do not know much about dispersal potential. Juvenile rabbits have been photographed in areas with no burrows, a long way from any known burrow sites. These rabbits may potentially be able to travel farther than we think as long as cover is provided. Fragmentation is a serious issue when fires or agricultural fields remove cover from vast areas (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Oregon</strong>: In 2000, a survey was conducted at 17 historical sites active in 1995 in southeast Oregon and only three sites contained evidence of current use by <em>B. idahoensis</em>. A 2001-2002 survey of 38 historical sites found evidence of recent use at only one location. However, recent surveys at new sites with habitat attributes preferred by <em>B. idahoensis</em> found evidence of rabbit use. On the Burns BLM district, 54 sites were surveyed and 12 sites showed signs of occupied rabbit use and undetermined use at eight sites (Carey <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: The more surveys that are conducted, the more rabbits are found. Populations of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in the Wyoming Basin, Great Basin, Colorado Basin, and Wasatch Mountains all appear to sustain habitat with robust numbers. It should be noted that to date, little to no attention has been paid to analyzing the density, genetic isolation, or trends of these populations (although surveys to increase our knowledge of these three issues are currently underway). It appears that the habitat that has remained intact since the last statewide examination of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in the 1940s also continues to maintain populations. Although it is clear that significant populations of <em>B. idahoensis</em> (both in terms of area and numbers) still inhabit Utah, overall loss of habitat has occurred since the 1950s, rendering large portions of their historical range unsuitable (Eastern Box Elder County, Central Great Basin, Southwestern Utah) (Kozlowski 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Montana</strong>: Rauscher (1997) includes Horse Prairie, Big Sheep Creek, Sage Creek, Centennial Valley, the Sweetwater Basin, The Blacktail Wildlife Management Area, Antelope Flats, and the White Rocks as <em>B. idahoensis</em> range.<br/><br/><strong>Idaho</strong>: In Idaho, known populations of <em>B. idahoensis</em> are highly fragmented, with the exception of the east-central valley region (Rachlow 2004b).",Unknown,"<strong>General</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> occurs throughout the Great Basin and neighbouring intermountain areas, in sagebrush habitat from southwestern Montana and western Wyoming in the east to southwestern Utah in the southeast and an isolated population, which is being reintroduced, in central Washington. The range also includes central Nevada to the north in eastern Oregon and southern Idaho (Dobler and Dixon 1990). Within this wide range, it occurs in patches correlating positively to the density of sagebrush (Dobler and Dixon 1990).<br/><br/><strong>Washington</strong>: historically,  <em>B. idahoensis</em> occurred in many areas of the Columbia Basin, but the sagebrush habitat has been heavily overgrazed and cleared completely for agriculture in many places.  The population in Washington is now isolated from other populations (Dobler and Dixon 1990).<br/><br/><strong>Idaho</strong>: Known populations of <em>B. idahoensis</em> are patchy but locally abundant in some areas within the valleys of the east-central region (Lemhi, Birch Creek, Big and Little Lost, and Pahsimeroi Valleys). Recently, isolated populations have been located in Owyhee County in the southwest of the state. Isolated populations also have been documented in the south-central region on the Camas Prairie (Rachlow 2004a).<br/><br/>An understanding of the current status and distribution of populations is limited by sampling effort; intensive surveys for populations have not been conducted in most areas. Within Idaho, agricultural and urban development of the Snake River Plains likely represents a significant barrier dividing populations north and south of the Snake River. Some populations north of the Snake River connect to those in southwestern Montana (including populations on the Continental Divide). South of the Snake River, populations likely connect to those in neighbouring states (Oregon, Nevada, and Wyoming). The Idaho Conservation Data Center (IDCDC) has approximately 180 records of the species in the program's geospatial database, comprising both recent and historical records of occurrence. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) recommends that the area of occupancy be computed by overlaying the distribution of known occurrences with a uniform grid and tallying the area of occupied grid cells. Using a 2-km grid, we calculated the area of occupancy to be 748 km² using IDCDC records. Two important sites are the Idaho National Environmental and Engineering Laboratory (INEEL) and the Lemhi Valley, BLM lands south of Salmon, Idaho. Both areas have received significant research currently or in the past, and both support large populations of pygmy rabbits (Dixon and Bosworth 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> in Wyoming appears to be widespread throughout the sagebrush-dominated portions of the Bear and Green River Basins.  In the Bear River, <em>B. idahoensis</em> is consistently found in good numbers at Fossil Butte National Monument. In the Green River, <em>B. idahoensis</em> is consistently found to the south and west of the towns of Pinedale and Boulder. The species appears to be widespread in the western quarter of the Great Divide Basin as well. The Jack Morrow Hills are known to support several occurrences. There is a single occurrence in the Sweetwater River Basin, just across the divide from the Great Divide Basin, documented in 2003; this signals the need for more sampling in the Sweetwater to determine the actual distribution there. This is the only known occurrence of the species on the east side of the Continental Divide in Wyoming (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Oregon</strong>: The range of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Oregon has not been determined. Recent surveys have found rabbits in Lake, Harney, Malheur, and Deschutes counties. Known areas include Foster Flat, Warner Valley, and north of Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) (Carey <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: Occurrences of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Utah listed in Oliver (2004) have been augmented since the document's printing. Initial survey efforts have focused on the determining of presence or absence, but systematic searches in suitable habitat over large geographic ranges have given us a measure of relative densities. The top three most populous areas include the Western Box Elder County, Northern Rich County, and the Piute/North-western Garfield County. Within these areas, <em>B. idahoensis</em> is considered relatively common. The most notable absence of rabbits occurs throughout the central portion of Utah's Great Basin, which was included in historical estimates of the rabbit's statewide range (Kozlowski 2004).<br/><br/><strong>California</strong>:  They occur in Mono County California and are abundant from the Bodie Hills to south of Mono Lake.  No pygmy rabbits have been relocated to northern California but surveys are on going (Sequin 2004).  A recent survey found <em>B. idahoensis</em> present throughout the southern portion of its historic range in California, but did not find active sites in Modoc and Lassen counties in northern California (Larrucea and Brussard 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada</strong>: <em>B. idahoensis</em> is found from the state border in the north to the northern end of Nye and Lincoln Counties in the south and from the state border in the east to Vya, Nevada in the west.  The pygmy rabbit is still found in most of the higher intermountain regions in the Great Basin Desert of Nevada (Sequin 2004).  A recent survey found <em>B. idahoensis</em> present throughout the entire extent of its historic range in Nevada (Larrucea and Brussard 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Montana</strong>: They are known from the extreme southwest corner of Montana: Dillon south to Idaho border (Hays 2004).","<strong>Washington</strong>: No take of&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;is occurring (no known wild animals); no take is legal (Hays 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: It is reasonable to assume that a few pygmy rabbits are killed each year by hunters who mistake them for cottontails. Although estimates have not been made, this is not suspected to be a large source of mortality (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada </strong>and <strong>California</strong>: Officially&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;is listed as a game species in both CA and NV. However it is not often hunted (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/>Oregon: There is no significant utilization of&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;except for some incidental hunting (Carey&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Utah: Utilization of the&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;in Utah is low. Some incidental take may occur during the legal harvesting of cottontail species. Articles addressing this issue have been included in the state's Small Game Proclamation both to help mitigate direct mortality, but also facilitate the communication of additional distribution information (Kozlowski 2004).&#160;<br/><br/>Idaho: Although previously classified as an upland game species, hunting was banned for&#160;<em>B. idahoensis</em>&#160;in Idaho in 2002. There may be incidental take of the species by hunters pursuing other lagomorphs (Rachlow 2004b).<br/><br/>Montana: No hunting season (Rauscher 1997).",Terrestrial,"<strong>General</strong>: Greater sage-grouse range overlaps with <em>B. idahoensis</em> range. Conservation of sage-grouse is a big issue and a federal listing may occur. Conservation of sage-grouse will likely benefit <em>B. idahoensis</em> to a significant degree. However, fire is being used to restore shrub-steppe and sage-grouse range in places, and although agencies are starting to include <em>B. idahoensis</em> in planning, it does not always happen (Hays 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Washington</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> from the Columbia Basin are federally listed as endangered. A recovery plan is being prepared, a captive breeding program is in place, habitat acquisition is proceeding, habitat management has changed, surveys have proceeded, reintroduction sites have been selected, and reintroduction techniques have been developed (Hays 2004). The reintroduction plan involves intercross breeding of <em>B. idahoensis</em> from the Columbia Basin with intraspecific rabbits from Idaho because of the bottleneck of genetic diversity caused by an extremely small population size (Sayler <em>et al.</em> 2007). The plan outlines reintroductions in 2007, followed by monitoring through the year for survival, dispersal, and reproductive success, and then a second reintroduction in early 2008 to augment the established population (Sayler <em>et al</em>. 2007). In March 2007, the first reintroduction of 20 rabbits bred by the Oregon Zoo were released in Douglas county, Washington, eight of which will be tracked by radio collar (Oregon Zoo 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Wyoming</strong>: In Wyoming, <em>B. idahoensis</em> occurs on Fossil Butte National Monument; small population segments may extend onto Seedskadee and Bear River Meadows National Wildlife Refuges. These are all rather small and isolated protected areas. The vast majority of <em>B. idahoensis</em> populations in Wyoming occur on surfaces managed for multiple uses by the USDI Bureau of Land Management (BLM). A lesser amount of state and private land within the BLM matrix also supports rabbits. The USDA Forest Service may manage some small population segments at the high-elevation periphery of the species distribution. B. idahoensis is on the Sensitive Species list of the Wyoming State Office of the BLM, which requires that agency to consider the effects of management actions on <em>B. idahoensis</em> (Beauvais 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Nevada</strong>: There is increased awareness but otherwise no conservation actions for <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Nevada. <em>B. idahoensis </em>populations are located in the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge, as well as in the Great Basin National Park (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>California</strong>: <em>B. idahoensis</em> is located at Mono Lake and Bodie State Historic Park and receive protection in these areas (Sequin 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Oregon</strong>: Surveys are being conducted throughout the historic range of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in Oregon and additional surveys are planned for fall 2004 and 2005. A Master's student is studying habitat at Sheldon NWR. Also, a small telemetry project is underway. The BLM and Hart Mountain National Wildlife Refuge are now surveying for <em>B. idahoensis</em> prior to management activities such as road work and controlled burns (Carey <em>et al</em>. 2004). The Oregon Zoo has provided a source population for reintroductions of <em>B. idahoensis</em> in the Columbia Basin, Washington (Oregon Zoo 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Utah</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is listed in Utah as a Species of Special Concern, and has been the focus of three ambitious grants designed to assess the effects of current land treatment practices on <em>B. idahoensis</em>, to examine historical trends in habitat loss, and to develop a statewide habitat model to increase management efficiency of the species (Kozlowski 2004).<br/><br/><strong>Idaho</strong>: Current actions include increased survey efforts to document the occurrence of <em>B. idahoensis</em> within its range, and research into its ecology and habitat requirements. Captive breeding has been established for the Columbian Basin DPS and experimental reintroductions have been initiated for the species. Loss and/or modification of habitat include agricultural and urban development, invasive weeds, and changes in fire frequencies (Rachlow 2004). In 2004, 42 captive-bred rabbits were released into the wild at the Idaho National Laboratory for a study intended to evaluate techniques to be used for future Columbia Basin, Washington population reintroductions. Less than half survived more than 18 days, but survival may have been more successful if release pens were more protected from predators and if the rabbits had been released farther apart (Sayler <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Montana</strong>: <em>Brachylagus idahoensis</em> is listed as a species of special concern by Montana Natural Heritage Program (Rauscher 1997).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
45180356,19742,Romerolagus diazi,Endangered,"B1ab(i,ii,iii,v)+2ab(i,ii,iii,v)",2019,2018-08-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Volcano Rabbit is endemic to a small region along the Transverse  Neovolcanic Belt in central Mexico where it occupies a restricted and  specialized habitat on five mountain massifs (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino  2018). This range is becoming increasingly fragmented and the area of  available suitable habitat is decreasing (Velazquez 1994, Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2016, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018, Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em>  2018). This rabbit is being threatened by competition with grazing  livestock, increasing frequency of fire, intrusion by humans  (settlements, roads, etc.), and climate change. Models extrapolating its  persistence in a metapopulation context under climate change indicate  that it is likely to be severely impacted (Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2009).  Its current EOO is 2,469 km², and an overestimate of the AOO is &lt;444  km² (based on the sum of 19 relatively large habitat polygons, in which  the species is further fragmented). The high level of current  fragmentation and the multitude of ongoing threats are likely to lead to  further decreases in area occupied. Thus, the Volcano Rabbit qualifies  for Endangered status (EN B1ab(i,ii,iii,v) + B2ab(i,ii,iii,v)).<br/><br/>Reports  that the Volcano Rabbit has gone extinct in the vicinity of the Nevado  de Toluca (Mexico Daily News 2018) are false. Native populations of the  Volcano Rabbit have never been in the Nevado de Toluca. A colony was  introduced in the 1970s and sometime later a single individual was  captured and taken into captivity, since then there have been no  verified records of the species in this area. The Nevado de Toluca is  not included in the current distribution map for the species.","The Volcano Rabbit is a habitat specialist (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993, Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em>  2018, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). It is found at its highest  density in a subalpine habitat containing bunchgrass (“zacaton”) and  pine communities (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993, Hunter and Cresswell 2015, Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>  2015). The largest remaining area of preferred habitat resides in the  Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park, between 3,400 and 4,200 m  (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). A study conducted on the Iztaccihuatl  volcano found that preference was shown for areas that had low  occurrence of “closed forest, long grass, cattle grazing, hunting, bare  ground and incline” (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). Contrary to previous  findings, the study suggested that an increase of recent fire activity  resulted in increased abundance of the rabbit, resulting from improved  habitat quality from reduced competition to bunchgrass (Hunter and  Cresswell 2015). However, regular use of fire to benefit cattle grazing  is not recommended given that cattle grazing proved to be more  detrimental to the Volcano Rabbit than the benefit of improved habitat  quality (Hunter and Cresswell 2015). Further, prevalence of fire led to a  decrease in population persistence (VORTEX modeling, Portales <em>et al.</em>  1997). A second study in the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountain Range found  that, in addition to the previously mentioned factors, proximity to  highways and population centers had a negative impact on abundance,  although this study did not find a correlation with regard to slope (the  effect of fire was not examined) (Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Until  today, habitat fragmentation has not resulted in the loss of genetic  variability, nor has it affected the genetic structure of Volcano Rabbit  populations. The values of genetic diversity are similar in populations  that live in a connected landscape and those that live in an  unconnected one. In addition, gene flow has been detected even in  isolated populations (Montes-Carreto <em>et al.</em>, in press).<br/><br/>The  diet of the Volcano Rabbit is diverse. It is known to consume more than  70 plant species, although the rabbits consume with greater frequency  zacatonales of the genera Muhlenbergia, Festuca, and Jarava (Cervantes  and Martínez 1992, Martínez-García <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mancines-Arellano  2017). In areas where bunchgrass is less abundant, they give birth in  cracks and abandoned burrows (Velazquez <em>et al.</em> 1993). It is  unlikely that the Volcano Rabbit constructs burrows of its own (Fa and  Bell 1990). Gestation time for this species is 38-40 days (Cervantes <em>et al.</em>  1990). It may be reproductively active year-round with a peak breeding  season occurring ""during the warm, rainy summer"" (Cervantes <em>et al.</em>  1990). Litter size is one to three (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).  Adults in a captive breeding program weighed 400-600 g, with birth  weights for females 25-27 g and males 32 g (Matsuzaki <em>et al.</em>  1982). Total length of newborns ranges from 8.3-10.6 cm (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990). Mean total length of adults range between 26.8-32.0 (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990). Most activity occurs in the morning and late afternoon (Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>A  study conducted in the Itxa-Popo National Park found that the Volcano  Rabbit makes up 12.5% and 5.5% of the prey base for the Bobcat (<em>Lynx  rufus</em>) and Coyote (<em>Canis latrans</em>), respectively (Garcia <em>et al.</em>  2014). Additional predators include the Long-tailed Weasel (<em>Mustela  frenata</em>), Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>), and rattlesnakes  (<em>Crotalus </em>spp.) (Cervantes-Reza 1981, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).","The Volcano Rabbit is threatened by habitat destruction, caused by  livestock grazing, agriculture and property development encroachment,  logging, harvest of the “zacaton” grasses, and fires (98% of which are  started by humans attempting to encourage new pasture growth) (Fa and  Bell 1990). Its range is within 45 minutes of one of the world’s largest  cities (Mexico City) and urban expansion has resulted in habitat loss  (Fa and Bell 1990), which is ongoing. Today, suitable habitat for the  Volcano Rabbit in the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountains covers 7,544 ha,  equivalent to only 13.68% of the landscape, including 957 patches: 293  have a minimum area of 0.25 ha and only two are larger than 1,000 ha  (Uriostegui-Velarde et al 2018). Though hunting is illegal, it continues  because of lack of local knowledge of its protected status, and lack of  enforcement (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1990, Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>Reduction  of habitat quality associated to the presence of pasture lands, crops,  and roads may have a stressful effect on the rabbits, as mean cortisol  metabolites levels measured in its faeces were more than two times  higher in highly degraded habitat compared to the low degraded habitat  (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>Climate change is likely to have severe consequences for this species. Anderson <em>et al.</em>  (2009) predicted that the lower elevation range limit of the Volcano  Rabbit may shift upslope by approximately 700 m during the next 100  years, which will reduce the area occupied by the species, as the  mountain peaks currently lack suitable habitat.","An early estimate of the population of the Volcano Rabbit was 7,085  rabbits; 1,811 individuals in Pelado, 1,816 in Tlaloc, 3,458 in  Izta-Popo and approximately 3,056 for the surrounding areas (Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997). Due to a variety of continuous and ongoing threats, its population is likely to be lower at the present time.<br/><br/>Population  densities estimated by line transects are variable between regions.  Studies conducted on the Pelado Volcano indicated that densities ranged  from 0.11 to 1.2 rabbits/ha according to habitat characteristics  (Velázquez 1994); in the Biological Corredor Chichinautzin the density  was estimated to be 4.2 individuals/ha (Rizo-Aguilar <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). Other studies have shown the relative abundance based on fecal  pellet counts is also highly variable throughout its distribution,  ranging from 0.1 to 3.1 latrines/m² in habitat on the Volcano Pelado  (Velázquez 1994, Velázquez and Heil 1996), and 0.02 to 0.12 latrines/m²  in Sierra Chichinautzin (Rizo-Aguilar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>The  only study that has monitored trends in population was conducted in a  core population in the Sierra Chichinautzin based on density estimates  using pellet counts (Guerrero <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press). This study  indicated that Volcano Rabbit density declined from 4.2 individuals/ha  in 2011 to &lt;1 individual/ha in 2017.<br/><br/>Initial studies indicated  that the Volcano Rabbit occupied fragmented habitat, and that there  were 16 discrete occupied habitat fragments (Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em>  1997); the current number of isolated habitat polygons is 19. More  recent evaluation of the degree of fragmentation within occupied habitat  polygons was able to discern significantly more fine-scale Volcano  Rabbit habitat fragmentation (Uriostegui-Velarde <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).  At the landscape level 957 patches of available habitat covering 75.44  km² were identified along the Ajusco-Chichinautzin Mountain Range (thus  encompassing Tlaloc Volcano, Pelado Volcano, and Coajomulco forests),  most (N = 293) of which had a minimum area of 2,500 m². Only two patches  were larger than 1,000 ha. 144 plots were sampled intensively, and of  these 50 contained no evidence of Volcano Rabbit presence (no latrines  were located); on only five plots were there more than 100 latrines,  indicating the presence of a highly viable population  (Uriostegui-Velarde <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018).",Decreasing,"The Volcano Rabbit is endemic to Mexico, restricted to the Transverse  Neovolcanic Belt, mainly in discontinuous patches on four volcanoes  (Popocatepetl, Iztaccihuatl, El Pelado, Tlaloc) and the Sierra  Chichinautzin (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>2016, Velázquez and  Gopar-Merino 2018). An initial estimate of area of occupancy (AOO) was approximately 386 km²  based on occupancy on the four volcanoes (Velazquez 1994), although  this area has subsequently been reduced to 335 km². Recent observations,  based on latrine records and sightings in the Biological Corridor  Chichinautzin, have added 109 km² to this distribution (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em>  2016). A recent survey in the Parque Ecoturístico Piedra Canteada,  along the Tlaxcala/Puebla border, north of Iztaccihuatl, yielded a  recent siting of Volcano Rabbits, but the extent is unknown  (Ramírez-Albores <em>et al.</em>2014). As a result of the over 15 years  continuous volcanic activity of the Popocatepetl Volcano, the  distribution range has shifted and expanded, locally. Currently, the  discontinuous EOO is 2,469 km². The whole range, however, is becoming  increasingly fragmented as a result of human-induced and natural causes  (Uriostegui-Velarde <em>et al.</em> 2018, Velazquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>The Volcano Rabbit occurs between 2,900 m and 4,250 m in elevation (Rizo-Aguilar <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016), but its highest density is found between 3,150 m and 3,400 m (Velazquez 1994).","In some areas, this species is hunted for food.",Terrestrial,"The Volcano Rabbit is listed under Appendix I of CITES (1973), although  the species has never been involved in international trade and this  listing is apparently an historical artifact. Hunting is illegal  according to Mexican law, but poorly enforced (Fa and Bell 1990,  Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). It is listed as endangered in the  Mexican Official Norm NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (SEMARNAT 2010). It occurs  within the protected areas Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks, but  hunting, grazing, and grass burning persist within the park boundaries  (Cervantes <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1993, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018).<br/><br/>Captive  breeding programs have been established with some success, but infant  mortality in captivity is very high (Fa and Bell 1990).<br/><br/>It is  recommended that conservation measures focus on habitat management,  particularly the control of burning and overgrazing of the bunchgrass  “zacaton” habitat, and enforcement of the existing laws prohibiting  hunting and trade of the Volcano Rabbit (Fa and Bell 1990, Hunter and  Cresswell 2015, Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). Management of the  protected areas should be improved and education plans at local,  national, and international levels should be implemented (Fa and Bell  1990, Portales <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Hunter and Cresswell 2015,  Velázquez and Gopar-Merino 2018). Captive colonies, especially those in  the zoos of Mexico City should be used to educate the public about the  protected status of the Volcano Rabbit (Fa and Bell 1990, Velázquez and  Gopar-Merino 2018).",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
45181534,21212,Sylvilagus transitionalis,Vulnerable,A2ce,2019,2018-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species once had a widespread distribution across New England, USA.  Suitable habitat for the New England Cottontail has declined by an  estimated 86% since 1960, and the available habitat has become  increasingly fragmented (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008, Fenderson <em>et al.</em>  2014). It is confirmed as Vulnerable because a population size reduction has occurred  since 1994 and in the last ten years it is suspected to be greater than  30%. The decline is continuing due to further habitat  destruction/modification and fragmentation resulting from urbanization  and suburbanization, and competition with the expansion of the range of  the New England Cottontail. Currently New England Cottontails occupy  less than 15% of their historic range, and they are considered  Endangered and are protected (no hunting) in Maine and New Hampshire.  They are considered a game animal in the remainder of their range. There  is a substantial effort underway to increase abundance of habitat in a  large portion of the historic range of NEC. However, much of this effort  will require years for managed lands to develop into suitable habitat,  and a substantial portion will never be suitable given site  characteristics. Likewise, introductions of captive-bred rabbits have  had some modest successes and also failures. These have not offset  continued losses. As a result, most populations continue to decline in  the occupied range. The USFWS (2015) denied a petition to list the New  England Cottontail as an endangered or threatened species and to  designate critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  This decision is controversial based on available data of population  estimates, the misrepresentation of the historical range of the species,  and failure to acknowledge that ongoing attempts to conserve the  species have been over-stated.","The New England Cottontail occupies areas of open woods and shrubs  (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998), often with sandy soils. This species is a  habitat specialist. It historically occupied early successional forests  that became abundant when farmlands were abandoned, and the maturation  of these forests into closed-canopy stands caused decline of this  species beginning in the 1960s (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is  typically found close to streams, swamps, ponds, or lakes in dense cover  with a shrub dominated understory (generally &gt;20,000 stems/ha), and  will rarely venture more than 5 m from escape cover (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2018). Radio-tracking suggests New England Cottontails are using the  invasive Japanese Barberry (<em>Berberis thunbergii</em>) as an important cover  type, particularly when Eastern Cottontail populations are present  (Cheeseman 2017).<br/><br/>Minimum patch sizes of 2.5 ha have been  suggested for New England Cottontail populations, based on foraging  efficiency in winter settings (Barbour and Litvaitis 1993). However,  because summer home range size is greater, this may be too conservative  of a target (Cheeseman 2017).<br/><br/>The diet of New England Cottontails  includes a variety of herbaceous plants, fruits, and seeds, and in the  winter it consumes woody species (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).<br/><br/>Outside  of the breeding season New England Cottontails are often solitary. They  have an average litter size of 4.2 young/litter, the average female  produces 2.5 litters during the mid-March through August breeding season  (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2018). Adults range in size from 38.6–43.0 cm (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2018).","The New England Cottontail is most threatened by habitat destruction (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2008). Urban-suburban sprawl and industrial development expand into and  fragment the habitat of this species. These areas are better suited to  the Eastern Cottontail (<em>S. floridanus</em>). Recent genetic studies suggest  this population isolation is leading to moderate-to-strong genetic drift  in many portions of the range (Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Cheeseman 2017).<br/><br/>New  England Cottontails have historically declined due to maturation of  second-growth forests and fragmentation of suitable habitat (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2008). The conversion of native shrublands to other land uses,  confusion with Eastern Cottontails by sportsmen, and lack of education  on existence, biology, and habitat requirements of this species cause  problems for the conservation of this species.<br/><br/>Competition with Eastern Cottontails may also place pressure on New England Cottontail populations (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  2008). Decline in the New England Cottontail coincides with growth in  Eastern Cottontail populations. Captive trials suggest that the species  may not be exerting much competition (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008),  however, telemetry estimates indicate that habitat usage for the New  England Cottontail shifts where the two species overlap in distribution  (Cheeseman 2017).","The New England Cottontail is rare to scarce in many portions of its  range. Recent census efforts suggest that around 17,000 New England Cottontails exist in the wild, with the majority of these found in  Connecticut and Massachusetts (10,000 and 4,600 individuals,  respectively, USFWS 2015). Population estimates are smaller in New York  (1,600 individuals) and Maine (700 individuals), and are extremely  limited in New Hampshire (&lt;180 individuals) and Rhode Island (&lt;100  individuals) (USFWS 2015). However, these estimates may be overstated,  as they assume rabbits occupy all known available habitat within focal  areas, which is contravened by most field studies. Many rabbits in  Maine, New Hampshire, western Massachusetts, southeast New York, and  western Connecticut are found on small habitat patches (&lt;3 ha), which  probably only support 3-4 individuals per patch (Barbour and Litvaitis  1993, Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008). As patches of less than 2.5 ha are  likely population sinks (Barbour and Litvaitis 1993) many of these  patches are unlikely to contribute to New England Cottontail population  recruitment.<br/><br/>Recent survey efforts have also suggested population  decline since the early 2000s in the Merrimack River Valley of New  Hampshire, northward from Manchester to Concord, and in northern Rhode  Island (USFWS 2015). Historical estimates suggest that the New England  cottontail peaked in abundance and distribution in the 1960s (Litvaitis <em>et al.</em> 2008), benefiting from succession that occurred on land cleared in the mid-19<sup>th </sup>and early 20<sup>th </sup>centuries (Foster <em>et al.</em>  2002). Across much of their range, including areas of eastern New York,  genetic evidence suggests highly restricted gene flow, strong  population fragmentation and genetic drift (Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2011, Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Cheeseman 2017).",Decreasing,"New England Cottontails historically occurred throughout  southern Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, eastern New York,  Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Whitaker and Hamilton (1998) include a  small region of southern Quebec. A study by Litvaitis <em>et al.</em>  (2008) estimated that the current area of occupancy (AOO) in its historic  range is 12,180 km², approximately 86% less than the occupied range in  1960. This study showed small patches of populations existing in coastal  southeastern Maine, coastal and Merrimack River valley region of  southern New Hampshire, southeastern New York, western and some of  eastern Connecticut (east of Connecticut River), western Massachusetts,  parts of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Estimates suggest  ongoing range contraction, with 2% of the range of New England  Cottontails lost per year (Fenderson <em>et al.</em> 2014, USFWS 2015).","Overall, numbers of cottontails harvested have not declined, but  the percent of New England Cottontails in the harvest has. The species  is hunted for sport, for food, and for ornamental/decorative goods.  Cottontail hunting has been prohibited in Maine since 2004 and New  Hampshire prohibits take of any cottontails in areas where the New  England Cottontail occurs (USFWS 2015).",Terrestrial,"The New England Cottontail was recommended by Chapman and  Stauffer in 1979 to be listed by the IUCN as a species of special  concern due to the significant differences between it and the Eastern  Cottontail, which is now sympatric in much of its range (Chapman and  Ceballos 1990). In 2004 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service  began consideration of this species to be listed as a threatened or  endangered species (Litvaitis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Protection  under the Endangered Species Act was declined based on known scattered  occurrences across its range as well as presence within protected areas  (Department of the Interior - Fish and Wildlife Service 2004). In 2006, a  subsequent review found sufficient evidence to designate the species as  a candidate and begin a warranted-but-precluded 12 month findings on  the New England Cottontail (Department of the Interior - Fish and  Wildlife Service 2006). In 2015 a decision not to list the New England  Cottontail was made based on the assumption that populations had been  artificially high due to age of succession in New England habitats and  were subsequently declining as habitats aged (USFWS 2015). <br/><br/>Very  little good habitat for the New England Cottontail is protected, and  tracts of scrub oak barrens should be purchased and protected.  Conservation of critical habitat and establishment and management of  “Important Mammal Areas” containing known populations, with appropriate  publicity and public education programs have been implemented.<br/><br/>The  New England Cottontail is in need of more research, including surveying  and population monitoring, research on nest sites, dispersal, habitat,  use of corridors, response to climatic change and stochastic events,  effects of sport hunting, competition with other lagomorphs, and  response to invasive vegetative species (especially how invasive plants  affect spread of parasites and disease).<br/><br/>Captive breeding and  reintroductions have been ongoing through work at the Roger Williams  Park Zoo in Providence, Rhode Island.

As such it does not  qualify for threatened status under current criteria and it is confirmed Least Concern. However, a recent  survey of long-term harvest information based on data from all western  United States state game and fish agencies indicated a consistent  downward trend in the numbers of most western United States (primarily  Black-tailed and White-tailed Jackrabbits)—these species are not  separated in agency databases, but the Black-tailed Jackrabbit is a  major component of these databases (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). This  downward trend is thought to be attributable to long term drought,  habitat changes and the cessation of predator control activities.  Numbers of this species are not prone to cycles as has been previously  reported (Simes <em>et al.</em> 2015).","The Black-tailed Jackrabbit is capable of inhabiting many types of habitat (Flinders and Chapman 2003, Beever <em>et al.</em>  2018). This species is positively associated, in terms of abundance and  distribution, with grazing by domestic livestock (Flinders and Chapman  2003s, Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). Diet is also variable for this  species, dependent upon vegetation availability and location (Flinders  and Chapman 2003, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2018). Generally, grasses and  forbs are selected during the summer, while shrubs are chosen during  winter months (Flinders and Chapman 2003). Variability in home range  size is due to multiple factors like cover, predators, and competition  (Flinders and Chapman 2003). Black-tailed Jackrabbits exhibit a  crepuscular feeding behavior (Flinders and Chapman 2003, Beever <em>et al.</em>  2018). The breeding season is variable, contingent on latitude and  environmental factors (Flinders and Chapman 2003). In Idaho the season  is restricted to February to May (French <em>et al.</em> 1965). Where  distribution occurs at lower latitudes the breeding season extends, in  the southwestern USA it may last from early January to September  (Griffing and Davis 1976).  <br/><br/>The Magdalena Island Black-tailed  Jackrabbit (<em>L. c. magdalenae</em>) is restricted to Margarita and Magdalena  islands where its habitat consists of xeric scrubland, halophyte  vegetation, mainly in the coastal dune areas and some smaller areas  covered by mangroves. The predominant plant species recorded in the  habitat of this subspecies are the Desert Limberbush (<em>Jatropha cuneata</em>),  Adam’s Tree (<em>Fouquieria diguetii</em>), Yellow Daisy (<em>Euphorbia margaritae</em>),  Goatnut (<em>Simmondsia chinensis</em>), Red Sand Verbina (<em>Abronia maritima</em>),  Pincushion (<em>Cochemiea halei</em>), Strawberry Hedgehog (<em>Echinocereus  brandegeei</em>), Ragweed (<em>Ambrosia magdalenae</em>), California Threeawn  (<em>Aristida californica</em>), Sweet Mangrove (<em>Maytenus phillanthoides</em>), and  Satin Milkvetch (<em>Astragalus magdalenae var. magdalenae</em>) as well as some  herbaceous plants in the families Poaceae and Asteraceae (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em>  2014, 2018). <em>Lepus c. magdalenae</em> shares its habitat with several  endemic rodents such as <em>Chaetodipus arenarius albulus</em>, <em>C. spinatus  magdalenae</em>, <em>Peromyscus eva</em>, <em>Peromyscus maniculatus magdalenae</em>,<em> Neotoma  bryanti bryanti</em> and <em>Thomomys nigricans anitae</em> and some birds such as the  Northern Crested Caracara (<em>Caracara cheriway</em>) and reptiles such as the  rattlesnake (<em>Crotalus</em> spp., Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2018).<br/><br/>The predominant vegetation of the Carmen Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (<em>L. c. sheldoni</em>) habitat is xeric scrubland, with some areas covered by halophyte vegetation in coastal sand dunes and mangrove, interspersed with semi-open areas, plains, and rocky soil. Within the predominant plant species in the habitat are Velvet Mesquite (Prosopis articulata), Adam’s Tree (<em>Fouquieria diguetii</em>), Elephant Tree (<em>Bursera microphylla</em>), Ironwood (<em>Olneya tesota</em>), <em>Euphorbia magdalenae</em>, Glasswort (<em>Arthrocnemum subterminale</em>) and Desert Limberbush (<em>Jatropha cuneata</em>) (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2018).<br/>The  Carmen Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (L. c. sheldoni) shares its range  with other terrestrial mammals as Bryant's Woodrat (Neotoma bryanti  bryanti), Eva's Desert Mouse (<em>Peromyscus eva carmeni</em>), and the Spiny  Pocket Mouse (<em>Chaetodipus spinatus occultus</em>), as well as the endemic  Monserrat Chuckwalla (<em>Sauromalus slevini</em>), Cnemidophorus carmensis, and  Western Blind Snake (<em>Leptotyphlops humilis lindsayi</em>) and the Baja  California Rattlesnake (<em>Crotalus enyo enyo</em>) (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2018).","Black-tailed Jackrabbits are not at risk from hunting for sport and  local subsistence, but the effects of human perturbation and exotic  predation are unknown. In some places competition with livestock,  habitat fragmentation and human-induced fire represent important threats  to populations. Declining habitat quality and climate change may also  be affecting populations. Decreasing control of Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>),  Bobcats (<em>Lynx rufus</em>), and other predators has led to an increase in  predation on this species.<br/><br/>The Magdalena Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (<em>L. c. magdalenae</em>) shares its habitat with predators such as Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans peninsulae</em>) with an average population density estimated of 0.73 individuals/km² and a number estimated of 230 individuals on the island, which may be negatively affecting the endemic populations of this subspecies. On the Margarita Island, Goats (<em>Capra aegagrus</em>) and several Feral Cats and their traces (footprints and excreta, <em>Felis sylvestris</em>) were obsered in the habitat of <em>L. c. magdalenae</em>, as well as also nests of Osprey (<em>Pandion haliaetus</em>). The high density of Feral Cats represents competing exotic fauna that can affect the endemic populations of the jackrabbits on the island (Lorenzo <em>et al. </em>2014, 2018).<br/>The  Carmen Island Black-tailed Jackrabbit (<em>L. c. sheldoni</em>) also shares its  range with a high density of Feral Cats, which may be affecting the  population of the island's endemic subspecies (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014,  2018).","Population density can vary widely from 0.1-1.2 animals/ha in natural  habitats, to 1.5-208/ha on adjacent agricultural land (Beever <em>et al.</em> 2018). In 2009 and 2010 the population density of <em>L. c.  magdalenae</em> on Magdalena Island was estimated to be 15.3 individuals/km²  and the total number of individuals was estimated at 4,804 in an area of  314 km². For the same subspecies on Margarita Island, the population  density estimated in 2010 was 1.05 individuals/km² and the number of  individuals was estimated to be 250 in an area of 238.5 km². In 2009 and  2011 the population density of <em>L. c. sheldoni</em> was estimated to be 9.8  individuals/km² with and estimated population of 926 in an area of 94.6  km² (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2018). Populations have also been noted  to vary significantly over time. For example, the reported harvest of  jackrabbits in California in 1964 was over 3,000,000 – a value that has  declined to less than 100,000/year since 1997 (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018). These trend data are mirrored in several western states in the USA (Brown <em>et al.</em> 2018).",Decreasing,"The Black-tailed Jackrabbit is widely distributed across Mexico and the USA (Flinders and Chapman 2003, Beever <em>et al.</em> 2018).

It was listed on the IUCN Red  List of Threatened Species as NT – Near Threatened in 2008 (Barry and  Lazell 2008). The most robust populations are in West Virginia, where  habitat is decreasing due to enchroachment of exotic plants and habitat  conversion, out of the 21 localities known in the state only nine have had  documented sightings in the last 20 years (West Virginia Division of  Natural Resources). Across the southern poritions of the range (Alabama  and Georgia) the species is considered to be critically imperiled due to  loss of habitat and is known from fewer than five localities in either  state (Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. 2015,  Georgia Biodiversity Portal). Across the range the Appalachian  Cottontail thought to be declining, but because of the lack of data  regarding the status of populations of this species it is difficult to  assess how severe that decline is, but at least a 25-30% in the last ten  years is suspected. In light of this uncertainty, a change of status  from Near Threatened to Vulnerable A2ce is not justified at this time,  and new surveys on the status of this species are necessary (Barry  2018).","The Appalachian Cottontail is found at high elevations with conifers and  ericaceous species in the central to southern Appalachian Mountains,  mixed oak forests and early successional (recent clearcut) habitats with  dense, ericaceous vegetation (Bunch <em>et al.</em> 1997, Chapman  1999) or blackberry thickets (Bunch <em>et al.</em> 1997).

45197564,6635,Diplogale hosei,Vulnerable,C1,2015,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Hose's Civet is listed as Vulnerable because its population is likely to be lower than 10,000 mature individuals, based on an area of occupancy (AOO) estimated as 28,000 km²; the assumption of a very patchy distribution even within this area; an indicative population density of one individual per km² (based on studies of similar-sized, largely ground-dwelling civets such as Malay Civet <em>Viverra tangalunga</em> in Borneo; e.g., Colón 2002) in areas considered highly ‘suitable’ for the species; and the very low detection rates in other areas suggesting overall density to be much below this. It is also estimated that there will be an ongoing population&#160;decline&#160;of at least 10% over the next three generations (taken as 15 years). This decline is expected because of increased pressure on higher-elevation forests as a result of expansion of logging activities and monoculture plantations to higher elevations, coupled with increase in shifting agriculture and indiscriminate hunting practices using nets and snares as a result of human displacement caused by mega hydro-electric dam projects in the centre of Borneo. The combination of such human-induced activities poses the threat of a highly fragmented landscape through which habitat specialists such as Hose’s Civet may be less able to disperse than at present, leading to increasingly isolated populations. Although there are no figures to support this ongoing decline in population size, it is precautionary to acknowledge that these threats will probably take place within the next 15 years, and so to classify the species as Vulnerable.","The few records of Hose’s Civet and the paucity of research on the species render its habitat preference and ecology difficult to characterise. The full elevational range of existing records extends from 325 m (Samejima and Semiadi 2012) to 1,700 m a.s.l. (Dinets 2003) though whether this upper limit of 1,700 m is a real guideline occurrence limit or simply an artefact of search effort patterns remains to be ascertained. Current records suggest that a large proportion of the species may occur at elevations above 800 m. However, Samejima and Semiadi (2012) suggest that in some parts of the species’s&#160;range, such as the Schwaner Mountains in Central Kalimantan, areas below 450 m may be part of its main habitat. Hose’s Civet appears to exhibit little habitat plasticity with records mainly in natural forest (e.g., Yasuma 2004; Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005; Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010a,b; Brodie and Giordano 2010; Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2011) and rarely in logged-over forest (Samejima and Semiadi 2012, J. Mathai pers. comm. 2014). In a logging concession in the Upper Baram, Sarawak, for example, the species has been detected in logged forest (less than 10 years previously) where reduced-impact-logging techniques have been applied; frequency of detection is, however, much lower than in primary forest in the same logging concession (J. Mathai pers. comm. 2014). The species’s use of recently abandoned or current shifting agriculture and monoculture plantations remains unknown, given the low survey effort in them. The species is strictly nocturnal and thought to be primarily solitary and ground-dwelling. Its partly webbed feet and hair between its footpads have been speculated to be adaptations towards foraging among mossy streams and boulders (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1985); recent studies appear to corroborate this with the species's&#160;presence being positively correlated with presence of moss and number of boulders (J. Mathai pers. comm. 2014). Yasuma (2004) speculated that the species dens in holes between rocks and/or tree roots.&#160;It is not known what the species eats in the wild. Payne <em>et al</em>. (1985) suggested it forages for small mammals whereas Davis (1958) speculated that it primarily consumes arthropods. Based on captive observations of the single individual ever caught alive, Yasuma (2004) suggested that the species forages on small fish, shrimps, crabs, and frogs near streams, or catches insects and other animals on mossy ground.","Because of the few records of Hose’s Civet and the paucity of research on the species, it is difficult to characterise even the current major threats, let alone minor and future ones. Based on the GIS exercise as part of this assessment (see sections on 'Range description' and 'Population' for details of this GIS exercise), it was predicted that between 2000 and 2010, only around 3-7% of forests in potentially suitable land-cover classes&#160;were lost. This indicates that deforestation rates within the Bornean central highlands have been low. Although this may be the case, it is projected that higher-elevation forests will come under increasing pressure from the logging industry because much of the lowland forest has already been logged, and also from the expansion of oil palm plantations to higher elevations facilitated by climatic warming and improved cultivars (Brodie in review). Moreover, the construction of several massive hydro-electric dams in central Borneo will cause the displacement of several thousand indigenous people; this, in turn, is predicted to increase levels of unsustainable and indiscriminate hunting practices such as the use of nets and snares to which many largely ground-dwelling species, plausibly including&#160;Hose’s Civet, are highly susceptible. Human displacement caused by hydroelectric dams is also projected to increase shifting agriculture at higher elevations and this, coupled with habitat loss through infrastructure development linked to the dams, logging and oil palm expansion, poses the threat of a fragmented landscape through which habitat specialists such as Hose’s Civet might be less able to disperse than at present, leading to increasingly isolated populations. Based on a combination of such threats, a decline of more than 10% in the Hose’s Civet population is very likely over the next 15 years (approximately three generations).","There is almost no information on population estimates and breeding status of Hose’s Civet. It has rarely been detected; with the increasing number of studies in Borneo using camera-traps, encounter rates remain very low. The paucity of research on the species prevents reliable quantitative estimates. The wide altitudinal spread of records suggest that the species ought to be common in collections; the fact that it is not suggests very strongly that something renders it very localised, very low density, or both. Moreover, the large survey effort by capable researchers using appropriate techniques in areas that seemingly ought to hold the species (forest within the documented altitudinal and geographic range), still yield low encounter rates (if at all), further corroborating the hypothesis of a highly patchy distribution and low density. Unlike other civets, this species is apparently seldom encountered by native hunters. Again, this gives credence to the hypothesis of patchy distribution and low density, although other explanations are possible such as, until recently, local hunters not venturing far from their villages or high into the mountains when hunting.<br/><br/>As part of this assessment, a GIS exercise applying data from the Borneo Carnivore Symposium (June 2011), for which a habitat suitability analysis (incorporating a MaxEnt analysis and a respondent opinion assessment) was conducted (Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep.), estimated about 28,000 km² of broadly suitable habitat for Hose’s Civet, restricted to the higher-elevation forests of interior Borneo. Assuming that about two-thirds of the population are mature individuals, this would give a total of roughly 19,000 mature individuals if the population density is taken at 1 individual per km². For a ground-dwelling small carnivore with very low encounter rates, this density is likely to be much at the higher end (see Colón 2002 for a study on the much more frequently encountered Malay Civet <em>Viverra tangalunga</em> in Borneo). Hence, it is likely that the overall density in this 28,000 km² area is 0.5 individuals per km² (or less), giving a population size of less than 10,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The cryptic and elusive Hose's Civet is endemic to Borneo. It has been found in Brunei Darussalam, Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo – one record only; photographically validated; Samejima and Semiadi 2012) and Sabah and Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo). Records suggest it has a highly restricted and patchy distribution within the higher-elevation forests of interior Borneo, with occasional records at lower altitudes (Jennings <em>et al</em>. 2013, Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep.). It appears to exhibit little habitat plasticity with records mainly in natural forest (e.g., Yasuma 2004; Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005; Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010a,b; Brodie and Giordano 2010; Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2011) and rarely in logged-over forest (Samejima and Semiadi 2012, J. Mathai pers. comm. 2014); the species' use of recently abandoned or current shifting agriculture and monoculture plantations remains unknown, given the low survey effort in them. The full elevational range of existing records extends from 325 m (Samejima and Semiadi 2012) to 1,700 m a.s.l. (Dinets 2003). Most of the population may occur above 800 m a.s.l., based on the paucity of lower records despite high relevant survey effort there.<br/><br/>In Brunei, the species has been recorded in Ulu Temburung National Park at 450 m and 1,500 m a.s.l. (Francis 2002, Yasuma 2004). This, the largest protected area in the country, comprises lowland, upland and montane forest and is the site of the only live capture anywhere in its world range by 2014 (Yasuma 2004). Brunei remains poorly surveyed and Hose’s Civet should not at present be assumed to be restricted in the country to Ulu Temburung National Park.&#160;As of mid-2014, the only record from Indonesian Borneo has been from a recently logged (8 years previously) secondary forest in the Schwaner Mountains, Central Kalimantan (Samejima and Semiadi 2012), in 2011 at 325 m a.s.l. which is, as of late 2014, the lowest elevation recorded&#160;for&#160;the species.<br/><br/>The species has been recorded from a few localities in Sarawak, mainly in the interior north. The holotype is from Mount Dulit in north-eastern Sarawak, collected in 1891 at 1,200 m a.s.l. (Van Rompaey and Azlan 2004). The largest series of collected specimens - four - was from the Kelabit Highlands in northern Sarawak (Davis 1958). A logging concession in the nearby Upper Baram is one of the few places where the species has been among the most commonly camera-trapped small carnivores (Mathai <em>et al</em>. 2010a,b, in prep.) although many of these detections were from pockets of natural forest within the logging concession. The species has also recently been camera-trapped in Pulong Tau National Park and the proposed protected area of Hose Mountains (Brodie <em>et al</em>. in prep).<br/><br/>In Sabah, the species has been recorded from&#160;several&#160;protected areas: Kinabalu Park (Dinets 2003, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005); Crocker Range National Park (A.J. Hearn pers. comm. 2014); Tawau Hills National Park (A.J. Hearn pers. comm. 2014); and the Maliau Basin-Imbak Canyon Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2010, Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2011). It has also recently been camera-trapped in the Ulu Padas Forest Reserve (Brodie <em>et al</em>. in prep.). Most of these records are from primary forests at elevations between 500 and 1,500 m a.s.l.<br/><br/>As part of this assessment, a GIS exercise applied data from the Borneo Carnivore Symposium (June 2011) for which a habitat suitability analysis (incorporating a MaxEnt analysis and a respondent opinion assessment) was conducted (Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep.). This analysis estimated about 28,000 km² of broadly suitable habitat for Hose’s Civet, restricted to the higher-elevation forests of interior Borneo. To estimate the potential habitat loss, the Miettinen (2011) dataset of land-cover change for the years 2000-2010 was used. This analysis estimated that there had been&#160;a loss in suitable land-cover classes of 3-7% (1,100 km² to 8,300 km²) during this period.",Hose's&#160;Civet is taken as part of general mammal hunting for food across its range. There is no evidence of specific targeting by hunters.,Terrestrial,"Hose’s Civet is not a CITES-listed species (CITES 2014), presumably because it is unlikely to feature in international trade owing to its rarity and rather plain pelage (Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep). The species was listed as ‘threatened’ in the <em>I</em><em>UCN Action Plan for the Conservation of Mustelids and Viverrids</em> as it was (then) known from only 15 specimens worldwide and there were, at that point, no direct sighting records of a live, wild individual (Schreiber <em>et al</em>. 1989). It is found in some protected areas within its range such as Pulong Tau National Park in Sarawak (Brodie <em>et al</em>. in prep.), Ulu Temburong National Park in Brunei (Yasuma 2004), Kinabalu Park (Dinets 2003, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005), Crocker Range National Park (A.J. Hearn pers. comm. 2014), Tawau Hills National Park (A.J. Hearn pers. comm. 2014), and the Maliau Basin-Imbak Canyon Conservation Area (Brodie and Giordano 2010, Matsubayashi <em>et al</em>. 2011) in Sabah. However, it is not known how large any of these populations may be or whether any of them are viable populations. Possible strongholds where conservation efforts should arguably be concentrated have been identified (Mathai <em>et al</em>. in prep.) although more research is required to ascertain population&#160;status&#160;in these areas to verify this. In Malaysian Borneo, the species is listed as ‘Protected’ under the Sarawak Wild Life Protection Ordinance (1998) and the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment (1997), implying limited protection. However, the species is not listed as a protected animal in Brunei under the Brunei Wild Life Protection Act (1978) nor Indonesian Borneo under the Appendix of the Government of Republic of Indonesia Regulation No. 7 (1999).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Although there is no direct data available regarding recent declining population rates, the above-mentioned rate of decline seems reasonable based on the high levels of harvesting. It should also be noted that the species has a relatively restricted range, and so its population is unlikely to be large.","This species inhabits high alpine environments, with Groves <em>et al</em>.

It is poorly known, but its natural history is likely to be similar to that of <em>M. chrysogaster</em>. <em>M. chrysogaster</em> is found on barren plateaus at high altitudes, where it occupies meadows, fell-fields, shrublands or fir forests. It feeds mainly on grasses, shrubs, leaves, moss, lichens, shoots, and twigs (Green 1987). It is generally solitary and crepuscular (Harris and Cai 1993).","There is a high trade in Muskdeer parts, particularly pods, into China and elsewhere in north-east Asia (see accounts for other <em>Moschus</em> species). Many relatively high-volume illicit wildlife trade links pass through <em>M. leucogaster</em>’s range, so it is certain to be under some level of threat from trade. The unstable taxonomy hampers abilities to assess threat levels directly to species, especially as parts like pods are not readily identifiable to species anyway.&#160;Besides hunting for meat, which is considered a delicacy locally, hunting of the Muskdeer is primarily for trade of musk glands. The musk produced by this genus of primitive deer is highly valued for its cosmetic and alleged pharmaceutical properties, and can fetch U.S.$45,000 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) on the international market. Although this musk, produced in a gland of the males, can be extracted from live animals, most ""musk-gatherers"" kill the animals to remove the entire sac, which yields only about 25 grams (1/40 of a kilogram) of the brown waxy substance.

86159618,41618,Herpestes urva,Least Concern,,2015,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Crab-eating Mongoose is listed as Least Concern because it is found in a wide variety of habitats including degraded and fragmented areas, up to relatively high altitudes (over 1,500 m asl) and is evidently resilient to the heavy hunting occurring in large parts of its range. Although it is presumably declining in proportion to deforestation, rates of outright conversion in the hill evergreen areas of northern Southeast Asia remain low; although lowland plains populations are doubtless in steep decline in some areas, the averaged global decline is unlikely to approach rates appropriate for categorisation&#160;even&#160;as Near Threatened over the most recent or forthcoming three generations (taken as 19 years). Even though hunting-induced declines in&#160;Lao PDR and Viet Nam&#160;might warrant a regionally-specific&#160;listing of at least&#160;Near Threatened, they are offset by the status of this species in areas&#160;such as Northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia, where hunting threats are somewhat to considerably lower. Although some increase in hunting in the next three generations is likely in Myanmar and particularly Cambodia, because (i) these constitute less than a third of the range and (ii) even in&#160;Lao PDR and&#160;Viet Nam the species persists in extremely heavily hunted areas and is still recorded widely, it is unlikely that future decline rates from both hunting and habitat loss averaged across the world range would be steep enough to warrant categorisation even as Near Threatened.&#160;No other threats have been identified that could be leading to a significant decline in the species.","Crab-eating Mongoose occurs across a wide range of habitats, often near water, in evergreen and deciduous forest, scrubby areas, plantations, agricultural fields and near human settlements (Pham-Chong-Ahn 1980, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1997, Van Rompaey 2001, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Thapa 2013). It also occurs in tall savanna grassland in areas such as Kaziranga and Manas National Parks in Assam (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014). It has been recorded up to&#160;at least&#160;1,800 m asl (Jennings and Veron 2011). It is  diurnal, despite earlier statements that it was nocturnal.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, this species is found in evergreen forest (including degraded areas), mainly near water; most of the recent records are from hill and mountainous areas (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Thailand, Cambodia and southern Viet Nam this species is found in&#160;similar habitats and&#160;also in deciduous forest and down to the plains (Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). In India it occurs&#160;in lowland wet evergreen forest, secondary forest and areas around industrial areas (e.g., oil refineries). In&#160;some countries, there are records from rice fields and other agricultural areas, and even near human settlements (Pham-Chong-Ahn 1980, Thapa 2013). Little is known about its breeding, although the gestation period is thought to be about nine weeks; probably meaning that this species reproduces more slowly than does <em>Herpestes javanicus </em>(sensu lato; Lekagul and McNeely 1977). It feeds on fish, frogs, crabs, molluscs, insects and crayfish (Van Rompaey 2001). <br/><br/>In some areas it is readily approached by people because of&#160;its apparent near-sightedness (Van Rompaey 2001) and fearlessness (Pocock 1941), but in areas where hunting with projectiles and/or dogs is common it is shy and not approachable, e.g. Lao PDR (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2014). It has lived up to 13 years and four months in captivity (Jones 1982). Wang and Fuller (2001) studied its&#160;ecology in a rural agricultural area of southeastern China (near the village&#160;of&#160;Taohong in northern Jiangxi province), from April 1993 to November 1994. Wang and Fuller (2003) studied its food habits in this area&#160;between June 1992 and November 1994, by analysing its faeces; it ate mammals, reptiles, insects and crustaceans. In Taiwan, Chuang and Lee (1997) found that it ate mainly crustaceans, insects, amphibians and reptiles. It remains little studied elsewhere.","In northern Southeast Asia (Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, southeast China and perhaps Myanmar), hunting is probably the main potential threat to Crab-eating Mongoose. This is widespread and intense, particularly in Lao PDR and Viet Nam but, even there, this species persists widely, including in areas with heavy human use. As a ground-dwelling animal, potentially suffering from widespread market-driven trapping in this region (where many other species have declined steeply), this suggests a strong resilience. However, it is evidently absent from, or at least very rare in, the plains of Lao PDR. These are more accessible&#160;than are the hills&#160;and, in general, hunting of mammals has been even more damaging in them. The rarity or absence there of&#160;Crab-eating Mongoose&#160;might reflect hunting-led extirpation (R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); this is probably more likely than a natural absence from such areas, given the species' occurrence in lowland plains parts of Cambodia and Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). There is no demand for its meat in restaurants in Viet Nam (S. Roberton pers. comm. 2008) and no evidence of directed hunting of the species. Retaliatory killing for raiding poultry on farms occurs, but is not a&#160;population-level&#160;threat.&#160;There are no records from wholly agricultural or otherwise anthropogenic landscapes, indicating a degree of dependence on forest. Many recent records are, however, from highly fragmented and/or degraded forest. In Nepal and, formerly, in Viet Nam there are records from agricultural land (Pham-Chong-Anh 1980, Thapa 2013); nowadays, in its core range of northern Southeast Asia,&#160;such areas are mostly&#160;heavily hunted and are unlikely to support resident populations. It is possible that the species is widely excluded from farmland by hunting. In sum, with the exclusion of outright deforestation, the threats to this species from habitat change (degradation and fragmentation) are mainly indirect, through the increased hunting and trading that occurs in accompaniment over most of Southeast Asia.","Crab-eating Mongoose is common in Northeast India, Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand (Choudhury 1997ab,&#160;Duckworth 1997,&#160;Choudhury&#160;1999, Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014, D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).  However, in some parts of the periphery of its range, it is believed to be uncommon, e.g. Jalpaiguiri District, Bengal, India (Inglis <em>et al</em>. 1919), Bangladesh (Khan 1982), Nepal (Thapa 2013) and Malaysia (Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013). This species is one of the most frequently detected small carnivores during both camera-trapping and direct-observation surveys (the majority of data unpublished) in Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, in quite a sharp contrast to another ground-dwelling species of similar habitat use, Large Indian Civet <em>Viverra zibetha</em>; this is highly suggestive of much greater resiliency to the current levels of hunting pressure (R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014).",Decreasing,"Crab-eating Mongoose is found in southeast China including Taiwan, Nepal, Bhutan,&#160;Bangladesh,&#160;Northeast India and all countries of mainland Southeast Asia (e.g., Duckworth 1997, Van Rompaey 2001, Wang and Fuller 2001,&#160;Wang and Fuller&#160;2003, Duckworth and Robichaud 2005, Datta <em>et al</em>. 2008, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Jennings and Veron 2011, Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2011, Choudhury 2013, Thapa 2013). In Malaysia, it has been recorded south only to Terengganu (Hedges&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;It is altitudinally wide-ranging. Although there are apparently few records from high mountains (Van Rompaey 2001), it has been collected at 1,650 m asl (Kurseong, Bengal, India; Pocock 1941), with records from up to at least 1,800 m asl (Jennings and Veron 2011). Its range extends down to sea level in at least Hong Kong.","In northern Southeast Asia Crab-eating Mongoose is subject to widespread heavy hunting as part of the general take from non-selective trapping methods. There is no evidence of directed harvest. General hunting levels are lower to the south and west of its range, although there is some evidence of targeted hunting of mongoose species in India where the hairs are used to make traditional paint brushes.",Terrestrial,"This species is protected in China, Thailand, Myanmar and Peninsular Malaysia.

The population trend is estimated to be increasing therefore it does not approach the thresholds under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory, although isolated breeding populations east and south of the Black Sea may be resident or only undertake local movements (Snow and Perrins 1998). It usually migrates on a narrow front, utilising two major migration routes (south-west, and south to south-east passages across Europe) and uses regular staging areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). Family groups and non-breeding birds begin to migrate in July, but the majority of the species migrate in early September, arriving in African wintering grounds during October. The species returns to its breeding areas in March (Vegvari 2002), where breeding begins in late April or early May, occasionally up to three weeks earlier in southern areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is gregarious for much of the year, migrating in flocks of between 10-50 to 400 birds (Africa) and congregating in groups of few to 1,000 birds in the non-breeding season (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), exceptionally it gathers in flocks of up to 4,000 during the moulting period (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Whilst breeding, pairs are solitary with large nesting territories, although immature and unmated birds may remain in groups of 6-10 individuals (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Every two years adults undergo a complete moulting period, after breeding but before leaving for wintering grounds, throughout which they are flightless for around six weeks (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). This species is diurnal, feeding during the day and roosting during the night on the ground or in water in large numbers (the same roost is often used every night, and sometimes every year) (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season this species utilises a wide variety of shallow wetlands, including high altitude, treeless moors or bogs (where the main vegetation is <em>Sphagnum</em> moss or Ericaceae) usually with some standing water, and swampy forest clearings, reedy marshes and rice paddies (Cramp and Simmons 1980). The species requires inaccessible ground nesting-sites, so is commonly associated with quaking bogs and other impassible mires, especially in the vicinity of <em>Alnus</em> carr woodland or seasonally flooded riverine forest (Cramp and Simmons 1980). In Central Asia the species may use drier forested areas (such as pine or mixed birch/pine woodland) if water is readily available (Cramp and Simmons 1980), but it generally avoids heavily wooded areas (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). The species moults in its breeding habitat after breeding, specifically requiring shallow waters or high reed cover for concealment during this vulnerable flightless period (Cramp and Simmons 1980). <em>Non-breeding</em> The non-breeding wintering and migration habitats of the species include floodland, swampy meadows, shallow sheltered bays, rice paddies (Cramp and Simmons 1980), pastures and savannah-like areas (such as open holm oak woodlands in the Iberian Peninsula) (Meine and Archibald 1996). The species may also be found roosting on mudflats or sandbanks along rivers, lakes and reservoirs during this season (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Meine and Archibald 1996) and undertake flights of up to 20 km (Cramp and Simmons 1980) to forage in agricultural fields (Meine and Archibald 1996, Vegvari 2002) (due to human encroachment and destruction of its preferred habitats) (Cramp and Simmons 1980). <strong>Diet</strong> The species is omnivorous in both breeding and non-breeding seasons, the plant component of its diet consisting of grass roots and shoots, rhizomes, tubers (e.g. potatoes), the leaves of crops and wild herbs (e.g. brassicas, clover, nettle, chickweed), pondweed, the berries of <em>Empetrum</em> and <em>Vaccinium</em>, cereal grain (e.g. wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize, rice), peas, olives, acorns, cedarnuts, groundnuts <em>Arachis</em>, and the pods of <em>Cajanus</em> (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). Animal matter in this species' diet includes adult (beetles, flies) and larval (Lepidoptera) insects, snails, earthworms, millipedes, spiders, woodlice, frogs, slow-worms, lizards, snakes, small mammals (rodents and shrews), fish and occasionally the eggs and young of small birds (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a mound of wetland vegetation (which may be re-used from year to year), generally placed in or near water in inaccessible undisturbed bog, heath, marsh, mire (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), or sedge meadow (Malik and Prange 1995). <strong>Management information</strong> The removal of willow bushes, reeds and bog grass from areas in the Kremmener Luch nature reserve, central Germany, has been successful in providing suitable roosting sites with wide panoramic views which have attracted the species to the area (Malik and Prange 1995). The vegetation was removed during the winter months: willow bushes being cut off and poisoned with arboricid, bog grass being burnt down and reeds being mechanically cut (Malik and Prange 1995). Other management efforts in western Europe include the burial or relocation of utility lines, and programs to encourage the planting of lure crops and the use of waste grain for diversionary feeding (away from agricultural crops) (Meine and Archibald 1996).<strong></strong>","In both its breeding and non-breeding ranges this species is principally threatened by habitat loss and degradation through dam construction, urbanisation and agricultural expansion (including changes in land-use, intensification, expanded irrigation systems and conversion of traditional holm oak pastures) (Meine and Archibald 1996). <em>Breeding</em> In parts of its breeding range that are heavily developed the species is threatened by nest disturbance from tourism and recreation which reduces its breeding success by increasing the incidence of successful nest predation by corvids, wild boar and foxes (Meine and Archibald 1996). Egg collecting is also a threat to the breeding population in Turkey (Meine and Archibald 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> Along its migrational routes and in its wintering grounds the Common Crane is particularly threatened by habitat fragmentation and the loss of many smaller traditional feeding and roosting sites, leading to increasing concentrations of large flocks in smaller areas, and therefore increased competition (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Alonso <em>et al.</em> 1994, Meine and Archibald 1996). Pesticide poisoning may also be affecting cranes along migration routes and in some wintering areas, especially where they depend primarily on grain from agricultural fields (Meine and Archibald 1996). Collisions with utility lines are frequent in highly developed areas along migration routes and in winter ranges (collisions being the leading cause of adult mortality at wintering areas in Spain) (Meine and Archibald 1996). Hunting is a significant threat to this species on migration (e.g. through Afghanistan and Pakistan) (Meine and Archibald 1996, Nawaz <em>et al.</em> 2006) and illegal shooting has been identified as a problem in other areas (including Portugal, southeast Europe, Egypt and Sudan) (Meine and Archibald 1996).","The global   population is estimated to number c.491,000-503,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015). The European population is estimated at 113,000-185,000 pairs, which equates to 225,000-370,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). The population is therefore placed in the band 490,000-504,999 individuals.",Increasing,,,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Bern Convention  Appendix II.

The following information refers to the species's European range only: The species is  legally protected across all of its European range, although stronger  enforcement is needed in many areas. The European Crane Working Group  (ECWG) has coordinated conservation activities including research,  monitoring, colour banding, habitat protection, education, and  recommended changes in agricultural policy, since the mid-1980s. Some  breeding areas are within protected areas in Russia, Ukraine, Poland,  Hungary, Spain and Germany. Intensive habitat management in western  Europe, including  the creation and restoration of wetlands, agreements  with private land owners to protect key resting and wintering habitats,  clearing of dense vegetation from roosting areas, development of habitat  management plans for protected areas, burial or relocation of utility  lines, programs to encourage planting of lure crops and use of waste  grain for diversionary feeding; and compensation programs for farmers  suffering crop damage have resulted in breeding pairs resettling former  breeding habitats. Breeding populations have been most closely monitored  in Scandinavia, the Baltic nations, Poland, and Germany and in recent  years, surveys have been conducted regularly at key staging and  wintering areas in Russia, Spain, Germany, France, Portugal, Hungary,  Sweden and Estonia. Intensive research in Europe has focused on  demographics, life history, feeding and wintering behaviour, and habitat  and conservation needs (Meine and Archibald 1996).

It feeds on invertebrates, small vertebrates and green shoots, and typically lays 2-4 eggs in a scrape on the ground. Eggs and young are susceptible to ground predators. North African populations may be sedentary or partially migratory, moving relatively short distances to find recent plant growth (Snow and Perrins 1998).<br/><br/>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1996).  <br/><p></p>","The principal threat is from hunting, which has worsened with the increased use of firearms, off-road vehicles and other technology (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005, Michler 2009). This threat is compounded by pressures on the species's habitats, from agricultural expansion, over-grazing of livestock, road construction, other infrastructure development and tourism developments (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005). Eggs are susceptible to trampling by livestock and collection by humans. Disturbance can be caused by oil exploration activities, along with disturbance associated with other threats. Locust control programmes can lead to direct and indirect poisoning of birds and a reduction in food supply. Floods and droughts cause additional pressures (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>Subspecies <em>fuertaventurae</em> is considered threatened by collisions with powerlines (Lowen 2007, C.

The habitats throughout its range have experienced ≥30% loss and degradation, and human population size in the range countries increased by 120% during the same period. The species, however, still has a wide distribution, is adaptable and can persist in some degraded habitats such as farmbush as long as hunting pressure is low or non-existent. The predicted future trajectory for populations of <em>Cercopithecus campbelli</em> is an accelerated rate of decline as larger-bodied primates are being depleted from their shared forests</p><p></p>","<p>Campbell’s Monkey is found in a wide variety of habitats, including lowland forest, gallery forest, mangroves, woodland, woody savanna and farrow lands (Oates 2011, Campbell 2013). It also occurs in secondary forest, in areas of subsistence agriculture, and in farmbush. The highest elevation area where this species occurs is the lower latitudinal locations (up to 600 m) in the Guinea Highlands. The estimated home range size for two groups in Taï NP was 52 ha and 67 ha (Buzzard and Eckardt 2007). <em>C. campbelli</em> mainly feeds on fruits and insects. In Taï NP, the diet of this species was found to be 46% fruits, 33% animal matter and 8% leaves (Buzzard 2006). Foraging for insects often involved unrolling curled-up leaves.<br/><br/>The typical group structure is a one-male group, but the species is sometimes found in multi-male groups, and all-male groups outside heterosexual groups have been observed (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985, Buzzard 2006). In Taï NP in 1976, mean group size was 11.4 individuals (5–33, N=8) (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985), but had decreased to 9.3 (N=3) in 2001 (Buzzard and Eckardt 2007). Group size in Guinea-Bissau ranged from 1–20 (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003). On Tiwai Island, mean group size recorded in 1982–1984 was 14 (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990).<br/><br/>This species is preyed upon by Leopards (<em>Panthera pardus</em>), Western Chimpanzees (<em>Pan</em> <em>troglodytes verus</em>), and Crowned Hawk-eagles (<em>Stephanoaetus coronatus</em>) (Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002).</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Cercopithecus</em> <em>campbelli</em> has been impacted by, first and foremost, bushmeat hunting, and secondly, habitat loss. <br/><br/>Due to its relatively small body size, it was not a prime target for hunters until quite recently, but because the larger-bodied primates such as the Upper Guinea Red Colobus (<em>Piliocolobus badius</em>) and the King Colobus (<em>Colobus polykomos</em>) have been decimated or even extirpated from many areas due to unregulated hunting, even this small-bodied guenon (adult male ~4.5 kg) has now become a target for hunters. In Mount Nimba, Liberia, Bené <em>et al</em>. (2013) monitored hunters’ activities in 2009–2011 and found a high rate (0.7 per km) of encountering hunters carrying the carcasses of this species. In Konobo District in Liberia on the border with Côte d’Ivoire, an unsustainable level of hunting is taking place (Covey and McGraw 2014). During Tweh <em>et al</em>.’s (2015) primate surveys, conducted across Liberia in August-December 2010, hunting signs (empty cartridges, gunshots, poachers’ camps, and snares) were the most frequently observed anthropogenic signs. Due to unregulated hunting, logging and mining operations, the Lagoas de Cufada NP in Guinea-Bissau is becoming an “empty forest” (Starin 2010). Minhós <em>et al</em>.’s (2013) study using a DNA bar-coding method estimated that 1,550 individual primates, which included<em> C. campbelli</em>, sold in two markets in Guinea-Bissau, were consumed by the inhabitants during the 2010 dry season. Hunting pressure has been exacerbated by an increase of 120% in human population size in the habitat countries during the last three decades (World Bank 2019).<br/><br/>Habitat loss through deforestation and forest fragmentation is due to creation of road networks, agriculture and mining (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003, Starin 2010, Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013, Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). This species once thrived in disturbed habitats and farmbush, but many of these habitats have been converted to plantations of non-native species.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Cercopithecus</em> <em>campbelli</em> is still common in some areas, although its total geographic range has been reduced by deforestation, forest fragmentation and forest conversion. In Senegal, other than the fact that this species is present in the Parc National de Basse Casamance and several forest reserves, information on this species is scarce (P.I. Ndiaye pers. comm. 2019). In Guinea-Bissau, the species is still widespread except in the highest latitudinal areas in the northeast (Limoges 1989 cited in Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003, Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013), but Bersacola <em>et al</em>.’s (2018) survey in 2015 at Dulombi and Paiai in Dulombi National Park found low encounter rates of 0.38 and 0.18 groups per km, respectively. This species is widespread and still common also in many parts of Guinea, even though hunting pressure is increasing, while many forests are fragmented and degraded (Campbell 2013, WCF 2015a).<br/><br/>In Sierra Leone,<em> C. campbelli</em> occurs at Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary (hereafter Tiwai), the Gola Forest National Park, Loma Mountains Forest Reserve (FR), Bumbuna in northern Sierra Leone, where the hydroelectric dam is being upgraded, and several other protected areas. Encounter rates vary between 0.02 to 0.54 groups per km (Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2015, Ganas-Swaray <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the early 1980s, population density at Tiwai was 39-44 per km² (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990). In Gola Forest NP, surveys made before and after the 1991–2001 civil war obtained various group sighting data (Davies 1987, Klop <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lindsell <em>et al</em>. 2011). For example, Klop <em>et al</em>. (2008) reported an average encounter rate of 0.34 groups per km for their surveys conducted between October 2005 and June 2007, but the use of different survey methods and the manner in which auditory and visual sighting data were presented in different reports make it impossible to gauge with precision any changes in population numbers of this species. Nevertheless, Lindsell <em>et al</em>. (2011) concluded that primates “continue to have healthy populations in the forest… and showed little or no sign of reduced abundance"". For this reason, the data are still insufficient to assess the current status of this species across the rest of Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>In Liberia, this species occurs in a number of protected areas including North Lorma National Park, Gola National Park, Grebo-Krahn National Park, Krahn-Bassa National Forest, and Sapo National Park. Group encounter rates obtained in the early 2000s in all of these forests were in the range of 0.10–0.33 (Waitkuwait 2003, Barrie <em>et al</em>. 2007, Vogt 2011, WCF 2015b).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire,<em> C. campbelli</em> occurs in several protected areas including Goulaleu and Krozialé Forêt Classées (FC or Classified Forests), Taï National Park, Goin-Débé FC, Cavally FC (Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002, Normand 2010, Kramoko <em>et al</em>. 2017) and community forests. However, Campbell’s Monkey appears to have been extirpated from Monogaga FC, Rapide Grah FC, Mont Péko NP, Kani-Bandaman Rouge FC, Séguéla FC and Koba FC, as all were converted into cocoa plantations (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015). The most important population is found in Taï NP, where a density of 24.4 individuals per km² was reported more than 15 years ago (Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002). More recent surveys conducted in Goin-Débé FC found that encounter rates had declined from 1.65 groups per km in 2007 to 1.31 in 2009–2010, and from 3.08 to 1.93 in Cavally FC (Normand 2010). Outside the protected areas in Côte d’Ivoire, this species persists even in areas where hunting occurs regularly (Soiret <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Campbell’s Monkey ranges from the Gambia and Senegal, just north of the Casamance River in the west, through Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to the Cavally River on the Côte d’Ivoire-Liberia border in the east (Oates 2011). Between the Cavally and Sassandra-Nzo Rivers in western Côte d’Ivoire is a region where individuals of this species and of <em>Cercopithecus</em> lowei occur, as well as individuals with intermediate features (Oates 1988, 2011). This species also occurs on the island of Caravela in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Gippoliti and Dell'Omo 2003).</p>","<p>Campbell’s Monkey is hunted for bushmeat in all its range countries (see Threats). It costs 2,000 CFA (equivalent of US$ 3.6 as of 2019) to purchase four or five pieces of monkey meat at a market in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau (Starin 2010), while a small individual of this species is sold for about 3,000 CFA (US$ 5.3), and an adult male for 5,000 CFA (US$ 8.8) in markets in southwestern Côte d’Ivoire (S.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<B>Behaviour </B>This species makes irregular local movements within Africa, the periodic appearance of huge numbers in some areas suggesting that it is highly mobile and apt to undertake long-distance movements in search of suitable habitat (Scott and Rose 1996). Populations in Madagascar appear to be sedentary, but it is known to be locally migratory in East and West Africa, distributions in these areas varying highly between years according to the water regime (in Cameroon the presence of the species is related to flooding) (Scott and Rose 1996). The timing of the breeding season is largely determined by water availability (del Hoyo <I>et al. </I>1992): populations north of the Zambezi River breed during months of low rainfall, while those in the south breed in the wet season (Scott and Rose 1996). This species breeds in single pairs or loose groups and remains in dispersed pairs or small groups whilst undergoing the post-breeding moult (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982). During the non-breeding season congregations of 20-30, several hundreds or even thousands may occur in feeding areas (del Hoyo <I>et al. </I>1992, Hockey <I>et al.</I> 2005). The species is active both diurnally and nocturnally (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982), foraging mainly during the first two hours after dawn and last two hours before sunset (Hockey <I>et al.</I> 2005). <B>Habitat </B>This species inhabits shallow freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall grass (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982). Such habitats include freshwater lakes, seasonal freshwater pools, slow-flowing streams, marshy areas, swamps in open flat terrain and flooded grasslands (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982, Kear 2005a). It also very frequently occurs in areas of wet rice cultivation (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982, Kear 2005a), and seeks the cover of densely vegetated wetlands while it is vulnerable and flightless during its moulting period (Kear 2005a). <B>Diet </B>The species is predominantly vegetarian, feeding on aquatic seeds and fruits, bulbs, leaf shoots, buds and the structural parts of aquatic plants such as grasses and rushes, although it does occasionally take small aquatic insects (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982, Hockey <I>et al.</I> 2005). It is also shows a preference for cultivated rice grains (Hohman <I>et al.</I> 1996). <B>Breeding site </B>The nests of this species are predominantly mounds of plant material, often floating on water and well concealed amidst vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982). In India however, the species is primarily tree-nesting, utilising hollow trees and even disused stick nests of large birds such as kites or crows (Madge and Burn 1988). <B>","This species is persecuted through hunting in many rice growing areas (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and there has been a marked decline in numbers due to shooting anf trapping at Lake Alaotra in Madagascar (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992, Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also often exposed to pesticides used on rice crops, is suceptible to lead poisoning, and suffers mortality through collision with powerlines (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The damming of the Senegal river has markedly decreased the habitat quality in that area, which may be having a negative impact on the population in that area (Triplett and Yesou 2000). Wetland habitat degradation on the east coast of India due to siltation, proliferation of invasive freshwater plant species (such as water hyacinth <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>), increased aquaculture activities and eutrophication may threaten the small proportion of the species that utilises the area (Nayak 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian botulism, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (van Heerden 1974). <strong>Utilisation</strong> The species is hunted for local consumption and trade from Lake Chilwa, Malawi (Bhima 2006).

There is a high probability that such threats and subsequent declines will continue into the future, and as such this qualifies as Vulnerable. In addition, the species' life history strategy (long-lived, slow-breeding) puts the species under greater possible threat of declines. More accurate trend data may become available in the near future and so further reassessment may be required in the future. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>It lives in groups of 2-9 members, rarely 12, and is a co-operative breeder, with the dominant pair assisted by adult, mostly male, and immature helpers to defend a territory and provision a nest (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). The breeding pairs have previously been assumed to be monogamous, but molecular techniques have revealed that extra-pair copulations do occur (Theron <em>et al. </em>2013). Groups occupy year-round home ranges of 50-100km<sup>2</sup>, determined primarily by the availability of suitable nest sites and food availability during the dry season (Kemp 2005; Wilson and Hockey 2013). Laying occurs in large cavities in trees, cliffs or earth banks (L. Kemp <em>in litt.</em> 2016), mainly from September to December, with a clutch of 1-3 (usually 2) eggs, although only one survives to fledging (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001; Chiweshe, Kemp and Webster <em>in litt.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. One study in South Africa showed that a family group produced on average only one fledgling every nine years, although birds in the Okavango Delta appear to breed more frequently (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001; S. Tyler <em>in litt. </em>2010). Juvenile mortality is reported to be high in a large protected area, and this is likely to be even higher in unprotected areas where anthropogenic threats are present (Kemp 1990). <strong>Habitat </strong>It inhabits woodland and savanna, also frequenting grassland adjoining patches of forest up to 3,000 m in parts of its range in eastern Africa. The species fares well in protected areas where human threats are excluded and rural areas where cattle assist in maintaining their preferred short grass habitat. If cultural protection is still practiced, the species is productive, but in areas where there is no cultural protection or it has diminished due to the appropriation of Western culture, the species is highly fragmented (L. Kemp <em>in litt.</em> 2016). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet is mainly made up of arthropods, and, especially during the wet season, snails, frogs and toads, and sometimes larger prey such as snakes, lizards, rats, hares, squirrels or tortoises. It will on occasion feed on carrion, taking scraps and associated insects. Fruits and seeds are also recorded in its diet, although infrequently (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.  <p></p>","A major threat to the species is loss of nesting habitat due to clearance for small-scale use, agriculture, and because of fires and violent storms (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). It can become heat stressed and exhibits heat avoidance behaviour in temperatures above 26<sup>o</sup>C, and increasing temperatures with climate change could pose a threat (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). Widespread livestock grazing has also lead to the erosion of suitable grassland in Kenya, with perhaps only 10% of suitable habitat remaining in the country (S. Thomsett <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Although cultural beliefs offered some protection in the past in Kenya, recent generations tend not to hold such values, and the species may be directly persecuted as a result (S. Thomsett <em>in litt. </em>2010). Persecution may occur directly because the species breaks window panes by attacking its own reflection in glass (incurring costs and creating human-wildlife conflict), indirectly by consuming poisoned bait meant for other species, and it is sometimes killed for traditional rituals against drought (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001; K. Morrison and Y. Friedmann <em>in litt.</em> 2005; L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. In South Africa and Zimbabwe, where these beliefs are upheld, there is actually a significant protection given to this species because it has high cultural importance, and these beliefs outweigh any offtake for traditional use (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). Collisions with powerlines may also be a threat in South Africa (K. Morrison and Y. Friedmann <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, although only one such mortality has been recorded and more mortalities may occur from electrocution by standing on step-down transformer boxes - especially if an insect nest has been built on or near the box which could act as an attractant for the species (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016; R. Little <em>in litt. </em>2016). Such threats are exacerbated by the slow reproductive rate and maturation, longevity and social structure of the species (S. Thomsett <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. This species can be susceptible to Newcastle's Disease Virus (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016), and may be under threat from stepping on land mines in areas of conflict (L. Kemp <em>in litt.</em> 2016).<br/><p></p>","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be widespread and common but sparse. However, there are fears that Allee effects may occur as a result of fragmentation and unnatural mortalities creating a lag in declines being noticed (L Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016).

The timing of breeding varies in relation to the rains, with the breeding of East African populations peaking during dry periods, but with the breeding of populations in the drier parts of southern Africa peaking during wet periods (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. The species nests in solitary territorial pairs (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong> but often flocks together (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong> and roosts communally at night (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong> in groups of up to 20-200 individuals (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong> during dry periods in the drier part of its range (e.g. Namibia and South Africa) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. The abundance and distribution of food and suitable nesting sites are the key ecological factors determining the size of the home range of this species and the extent of local and seasonal population movements (Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong>. <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits wetlands such as marshes, pans and dams with tall emergent vegetation (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, riverbanks (Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong>, open riverine woodland, shallowly flooded plains (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong> and temporary pools (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong> with adjacent grasslands, open savannas, croplands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong>, pastures, fallow fields and irrigated areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>.

In India, the species is increasingly forced to use suboptimal rice paddies as breeding habitat because of the deterioration and destruction of its natural wetland habitat (Meine and Archibald 1996, Sundar 2009). In Australia, cattle pastures and maize stubble are important foraging habitats in the non-breeding season (J. Grant<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It prefers a mixture of flooded, partially flooded and dry ground for foraging, roosting and nesting. It is omnivorous, feeding on a variety of roots and tubers as well as invertebrates and amphibians. In some locations in the Indian subcontinent and in Australia, birds disperse seasonally in response to available water. Breeding in India may take place virtually year-round if conditions are suitable, but there is a major peak in July-October, with egg laying in August-September, and a much smaller peak in February-March (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It breeds during respective wet seasons in South-East Asia and Australia, migrating to key non-breeding sites during the dry season where birds form sizeable aggregations (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In India and Nepal, breeding pairs maintain discrete territories, year-round in areas with an adequate water supply throughout the year, while non-breeding birds are generally found in flocks that use larger wetlands to roost (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Successful breeding pairs generally raise one or two chicks, with three chicks being extremely rare. Flock sizes in India are a function of wetland availability with the largest flocks seen in summers when wetlands are much reduced (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;<p></p>","The main threats are a combination of loss and degradation of wetlands, as a result of drainage and conversion to agriculture (for example wet rice paddy into dry sugarcane or soya bean [Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003]<strong><sup></sup></strong>), ingestion of pesticides (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, and the hunting of adults and collection of eggs and chicks (particularly in Indo-China but increasingly in India and Pakistan) for trade, food, medicinal purposes and, in some areas, to help prevent damage to crops (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000, Khacher 2006, K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. These factors may be the cause of low recruitment in India, and can rapidly extirpate localised populations (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Vietnam and Cambodia, large areas of the Mekong Delta, which supported key dry season habitat, have been reclaimed for agriculture in recent decades (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. From 2001 to 2006, much of the seasonally inundated floodplains of the Ha Tien Plain, were lost, mostly due to the expansion of shrimp farms (Tran 2006a)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The mechanisation of farming practices may threaten birds breeding on agricultural land (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Collision with powerlines may be a significant threat in parts of its range, with observations from India suggesting that 2.5-20 % of cranes are affected (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000, Sundar and Choudhury 2001)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, mostly non-breeding birds, equating to almost 1% of the total population (Sundar and Choudhury 2005)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. High human usage of wetlands results in a high rate of disturbance to cranes and considerably limits breeding success (Sundar and Choudhury 2003)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Anecdotal observations suggest that chick predation by dogs and egg predation by corvids is increasing as their populations increase following the decline of vultures on the Indian subcontinent (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The vast majority of the Australian population breed and winter in non-protected areas (J. Grant<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In the Gulf of Carpentaria region of northern Australia, proposals to increase cropping would entail conversion of land currently grazed by cattle, which is breeding habitat for the species, and would also involve impoundment of water currently available in wetland habitats (J. Grant<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. At Lake Tinaroo, Australia, grazing is forbidden in some areas in the interests of water quality, and such sites have now become overgrown with dense vegetation and abandoned by the species (E. Scambler<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is also threatened by the increasing subdivision of the shoreline grazing land at Lake Tinaroo for residential development, which is accompanied by increasing disturbance, e.g. from the use of speedboats (E. Scambler<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Each year there are one or two reports of individuals killed by powerlines on the Atherton Tableland, although this threat has not been investigated or quantified (E. Scambler<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.  <p></p>","There are thought to be 8,000-10,000 individuals in India, Nepal and Pakistan; 800-1,000 in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, 500-800 in Myanmar (unpublished information supplied by Wetlands International Specialist Groups 2006), and about 10,000 breeding adults in Australia (Garnett and Crowley 2000, R. Jaensch&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2005 to Wetlands International 2006).

Its range has contracted towards the north and west of the Subcontinent (Sundar <em>et al</em>. 2000)<strong></strong> and its population is considered to be in decline (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. The north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh remains the species's stronghold, with a population estimated at over 6,000 individuals (Sundar 2008). Subspecies <em>sharpii</em> occurs in South-East Asia where its range has declined dramatically, now being confined to <strong>Cambodia</strong>, extreme southern<strong> Laos</strong>, south <strong>Vietnam</strong> (c.800-1,000 birds between these three countries [Wetlands International 2006]<strong></strong>), and <strong>Myanmar</strong> (c.500-800 birds [Wetlands International 2006]<strong></strong>). Despite past declines, recent counts have shown some increase in the South-East Asian population, however Population Viability Analysis of cranes in Tram Chin shows the population is highly unstable and prone to extinction if current rates of habitat degradation continue (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Since 2001, a coordinated census has been held each year in Cambodia and Vietnam in the late dry season. In 2009, 455 individuals were counted at six sites, around 30% fewer than in the previous year. Early dry season counts (562 individuals), however, were higher than in 2008 (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The Australian population (<em>gilliae</em>) is confined to the north and east of the country. It was estimated at fewer than 10,000 breeding adults in 2000 (Garnett and Crowley 2000, R. Jaensch <em>in litt.</em> 2005 to Wetlands International 2006)<strong></strong>, and has been put as low as 5,000 individuals (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. The highest number recorded in surveys in north Queensland was in October 2000, when an estimated minimum of 3,000 individuals was present on Atherton Tablelands (E.

Scambler<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;During recent years, fluctuations in recruitment and numbers visiting the&#160;Atherton Tablelands&#160;have been noted, and are thought to be related to variation in annual rainfall in the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape Regions (J.

It occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range, importantly Ang Trapeang Thmor, Cambodia, and Tram Chim National Park, Vietnam, which seasonally support the majority of the Indochinese population. A proposed 238,374-ha conservation reserve for the species in the Kampong Trach IBA, Cambodia, was demarcated in 2006, awaiting a ministerial decree (Anon. 2006b)<strong></strong>. Patrols have since been carried out, and environmental education is ongoing in the area (Anon. 2006b)<strong></strong>. Following the discovery of a major non-breeding population in the Basaac river floodplain of the Mekong Delta, in Borei Chulsar and Koh Andeth districts, Takeo province, during surveys in 2001-2002, a workshop was organised and a 9,275-ha protected area was proposed and subsequently went for approval (Anon. 2002)<strong></strong>. In 2003, protection was proposed for Hon Chong grassland (Anon 2003)<strong></strong>. Conservation awareness campaigns have been initiated in India, Nepal, Laos and Cambodia. Nest protection schemes in India have proven successful (Sundar and Choudhury 2003)<strong></strong>. In 2004–2005 protection of 22 nests by volunteer in the Kota district, Rajasthan resulted in the successful fledging of 19 chicks (Kaur <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). National surveys have recently been conducted in India and Cambodia, and detailed studies on species requirements are ongoing in India and Nepal (K. S. G. Sundar<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In Myanmar, Buddhist monks have increased local respect for cranes and many nests are protected when they would otherwise be destroyed to prevent damage to rice paddies (Archibald <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Since 1997, annual roost counts have been conducted on the Atherton Tableland in the far north of Queensland during the non-breeding season (E. Scambler<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In 2008 the Atherton Tablelands Important Bird Area was established based on population distribution data from the annual counts, and continuing counts from 2009 monitor the IBA and surrounding sites. Authorities have flagged particular sections of powerline after Sarus Crane deaths or injuries were reported by concerned observers in the IBA. The Australian Crane Network (website http://ozcranes.net/) established in 2005, remains a contact point for crane researchers, landowners and interested individuals, including international networks; and provides updates on ongoing and completed research and conservation issues (E.

Proponents of development proposals must therefore address potential impacts and conservation groups are approved parties to submit objections at both state and federal levels&#160;&#160;In Thailand, a captive breeding programme is underway at Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo with the intention of establishing a wild population in the country (Siri-Arunrat 2009).<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct further surveys in northern Cambodia, southern Laos and southern Vietnam to identify key sites.

Urgent action is a priority to halt declines in Australia.<p></p> <p></p>,"It has fairly specific habitat preferences, preferring shallow, vegetated freshwater or brackish swamps where there is a mixture of short and tall emergent sedges and rushes (Garnett 1992). It has been recorded in rice paddies in the Murray Darling basin, but it is not thought to use such habitats for breeding (G. Dutson<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2008). It usually lays four eggs. It feeds, mostly at night, on fish, eels, frogs, freshwater crayfish and aquatic insects (Heather and Robertson 1997). The population seems to increase rapidly in good years and decline rapidly in poor ones (S. Garnett<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2003). The species appears to disperse widely, including to coastal wetlands during periods of drought and to ephemeral wetlands during and after periods of rainfall (Garnett<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2011).<br/><p></p>","In Australia and New Zealand, the main threats are wetland drainage for agriculture, as well as changes brought about by high levels of grazing and salinisation of swamps (Garnett 1992, B. D. Bell <em>in litt.</em> 1994, Garnett and Crowley 2000)<strong></strong>. In Australia, the species appears able to adapt to the availability of ephemeral wetlands, but is likely to be particularly sensitive to the destruction of drought refugia. Loss of these habitats may explain its decline in Western and South Australia (Garnett and Crowley 2000)<strong></strong>. The Murray-Darling basin, a former stronghold of the species, has suffered consecutive droughts in recent years and over-extraction of water is an on-going problem (H. Ford <em>in litt</em>. 2008, R. Loyn <em>in litt</em>. 2008)<strong></strong>. In Australia, introduced red foxes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Vulpes vulpes</span> are thought to take eggs and juveniles (Smith <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1995). Overgrazing and inappropriate fire regimes can also reduce habitat suitability (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Nests have been reported to be abandoned following visits by people, implying that the species is sensitive to disturbance (O’Donnell 2011). Shooting and flying into powerlines are additional contributory causes (B. D. Bell <em>in litt.</em> 1994)<strong></strong>, but hunting pressure is very low (N. Barré <em>in litt.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","In New Zealand, the estimated population was between 580-725 individuals in 1980.

Birds Australia (now BirdLife Australia) estimated the number of adult birds in 2009-2010 to be 3-16 in Queensland, 82-162 in New South Wales, 86-248 in Victoria, 12-100 in Tasmania, 26–116 in South Australia and 38-154 in West Australia (Birds Australia<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2011). Consecutive atlas censuses in Australia have shown a marked decrease in reporting rate; the species was recorded in 260 10-minute grid squares in 1977-1981, 142 grid squares in 1998-2003, and just 61 in 2003-2008 (J. O'Connor <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2008). The declining reporting rate was particularly pronounced in the Riverina (63%), Tasmania (&gt;90%), and south-west Australia (&gt;90%). This decline in reporting rate is thought to represent a genuine population decline over the period. In Australia, most birds are in the Murray-Darling basin and adjacent coastal areas. In Western Australia, the population was estimated to contain up to 100 pairs in 1980 (Marchant and Higgins 1990), but it is now much reduced, with the largest concentration in the Albany and Lake Muir wetlands. There have been no confirmed records from the Swan Coastal Plain since 1992 and surveys conducted in 2007 and 2008 found that half the wetlands that supported the species in 1980 now retained no suitable habitat (Pickering and Gole 2008). There are now only occasional records from Queensland (Garnett and Crowley 2000) and there appears to have been no great influx to remnant wetlands after the recent drought, as might have been expected if they were more common inland. In South Australia, breeding is confined to the south-east, however, loss of suitable habitat at Bool Lagoon, arguably the key site in Australia for this species, and other wetlands in the area owing to changes in regional drainage, has probably had a large impact in the last 10-20 years (R. Jaenesch <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2003). It is now known from just one site, Hirds Swamp, in Victoria (G. Dutson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2008). In Tasmania, the species is now recorded from only a handful of sites and several of the major lakes that it once occupied have been dry for some years. In New Zealand, the estimated population was between 580 and 725 individuals in 1980 (Heather and Robertson 1997); numbers may be greater, given the lack of targeted survey work, and the large size of suitable swamps (G.

It<strong> </strong>occasionally uses mangroves and coastal habitats (Santiapillai <em>et al. </em>1997, Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sharma 2007)<strong>, </strong>such as estuaries and<strong> </strong>brackish lagoons (Santiapillai <em>et al. </em>1997,<span lang=""EN-AU"">&#160;Clancy pers. obs).

Although it shows a preference for natural wetlands throughout the year, it uses similar artificial habitats like rice paddies for a short period of time, particularly during and after the monsoon season, when natural wetlands may become too deep for foraging (Sundar 2004)<strong></strong>. It will also forage in wet or dry wheat fields and flooded fallow fields, the latter especially in summer when the extent of natural wetlands is reduced (Sundar 2004)<strong></strong>. In Uttar Pradesh, north-central India the species is common in agricultural landscapes, foraging in flooded rice paddies, irrigation canals and roadside ditches (Sundar 2011b). It is carnivorous (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong> and has high food requirements (Rahmani 1987, Maheswaran and Rahmani 2002, Maheswaran 2003b)<strong></strong>, tending to be largely territorial, being recorded in flocks very occasionally (Sundar <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, and becoming more aggressive as food is depleted (Maheswaran and Rahmani 2001)<strong></strong>. It feeds in shallow water up to 0.5m deep (Garnett and Crowley 2000)&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">but mostly 0.05&#160; to 0.3 m in New South Wales (Clancy 2011),&#160;and takes fish (Garnett and Crowley 2000, Maheswaran and Rahmani 2001, Maheswaran and Rahmani 2002,&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">Clancy 2011)<strong></strong>, reptiles and frogs (Garnett and Crowley 2000,&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">Clancy 2011)<strong></strong>, some waterfowl (Verma 2003, Clancy 2011)<strong></strong>, turtle eggs (Chauhan and Andrews 2006), crabs, molluscs, insects and other arthropods (Ishtiaq <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, Sundar 2011b, Clancy 2011)<strong></strong>. It has also been observed feeding on its own dead chicks in Dudwa, N.P. India (Maheswaran &amp; Rahmani 2005). It has been observed using tactile feeding methods (Maheswaran and Rahmani 2001, Maheswaran and Rahmani 2002)<strong></strong>, although more recent research in New South Wales found visual methods to be most commonly used (Clancy 2011)<strong></strong>. Foraging occurred most commonly in the morning and late afternoon, with loafing during the middle of the day (Clancy 2011). Prey-handling time increased as prey size increased and fishes of 4-6cm were more frequently taken by adult storks (Maheswaran and Rahmani 2008).&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">&#160;It is a territorial breeder (Rahmani 1987, Santiapillai <em>et al. </em>1997, Sundar 2004, Maheswaran and Rahmani 2005,&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">Clancy &amp; Ford 2013), and pairs stay together during successive seasons, some even after breeding is over (Sundar 2003, Maheswaran 2003b,&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">Clancy pers. obs). Nests are built in old trees (Rahmani 1987)&#160;and occasionally on shrubs in wetlands<span lang=""EN-AU""> (<span lang=""EN-AU"">Clancy &amp; Ford 2011).&#160;In India, it starts to nest from August onwards (Bhatt 2006)<strong></strong>, with earlier breeders in northern India timing their egg laying in September and October to coincide with the end of the monsoon season (Maheswaran 2003a, Sundar 2003)<strong></strong>.&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">Consequently, breeding success is influenced positively by both the north-east and south-west monsoons (Sundar 2011a).&#160;In New South Wales, Australia, eggs are laid from May to August, with fledging occurring between October and January (Sundar <em>et al.</em> 2006,&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">Clancy &amp; Ford 2013</span>). Breeding pairs generally raise one or two chicks and three is not uncommon (Maheswaran and Rahmani 2005), although four and five is rare (Sundar 2003, 2011a, Sundar <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Chicks generally stay in natal territories until the subsequent breeding season, although they stay longer if adult birds do not breed in the subsequent year (Sundar 2003)<span lang=""EN-AU"">, although early dispersal of young was found in New South Wales, Australia, with some birds dispersing within a few months of fledging but others persisting in the territory until at least the next breeding season (Clancy &amp; Ford 2013). &#160;Although the process of laying and raising chicks to independence takes up to 12 months, ten out of 25 pairs that bred successfully in one year, were also successful in the subsequent year (Clancy and Ford 2013).<p></p></span></span></span></span></span>","It is threatened by a variety of factors across its range, including drainage of wetlands, felling of nest trees, development, encroachment of agriculture or aquaculture, overfishing, overgrazing, hunting and excessive capture for zoos. Consecutive years of drought can cause declines in the population (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> Family CICONIIDAE 1992),&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">though one population in western Uttar Pradesh is resilient to dry years as long as these are interspersed with years of normal and above-normal rainfall (Sundar 2011a). In India, the freshwater wetlands that this species relies upon are under great pressure from expanding human populations (Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004). The most frequent threat to the species in this country is fishing (Santiapillai<em> et al. </em>1997, Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004), which is so intensive in places that even 5-10 cm fishes are taken (Rahmani 1987), followed by the affects of sedimentation on wetland quality (Maheswaran <em>et al. </em>2004).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">Illegal conversions of erstwhile community-use wetlands to private fish ponds has severe and large-scale impacts on populations (Sundar <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;However, deterioration of foraging habitat through the conversion of wetlands into agricultural fields is also a major threat in India (Rahmani 1987, Maheswaran 2003a, Sundar 2004, Sundar&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">2011a). In the face of wetland conversions, flooded rice paddies have become important and may be promoting the dispersal of young birds and preventing the fragmentation of sub-populations (Sundar 2004). Eggs are taken in at least some parts of India (Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004). Disturbance during the nesting season is a major threat (Rahmani 1987), &#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">but at least one population in Uttar Pradesh has very high breeding success despite being in a human-dominated agricultural landscape (Sundar 2011a). Traditional mechanisms of conservation of trees (nesting habitat) and wetlands (foraging habitat) combined with legal provisions, and cultivation using low levels of mechanisation in rural India can provide suitable conditions for this species (Sundar 2011a).&#160;Deaths due to collision with electricity wires are occasional in India (Sundar 2005),&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">but are the main cause (c.50%) of deaths of birds of all ages in Australia.&#160;&#160; Death from apparent natural causes and unknown causes were the next equal highest category.&#160; There were only 4 deaths known from collision with wire fences in Australia (Clancy&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016). Additional threats in Sri Lanka include possible inbreeding in small populations, pesticide poisoning of wetlands and loss of mangroves to increasing salinity levels (Santiapillai <em>et al.</em> 1997). In Australia, the species is thought to be threatened by disturbance and habitat loss, but has not been greatly affected by the intensification of land-use in eastern Australia (Garnett and Crowley 2000,&#160;<span lang=""EN-AU"">Clancy &amp; Kingsford 2015). Sea-level rise is projected to have a negative impact upon coastal habitats. The frequent formation of mostly female-biased trios in Australia may indicate that the sex ratio of the species is skewed (Sundar <em>et al. </em>2006).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">Large remnant trees are being replaced by plantations, particularly in the New South Wales region, and could lead to declines in prime nesting habitat (Clancy and Ford 2011).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN"">Agro-industry farming is an ongoing threat with very rapid declines suspected for the minority of populations. This has however now been seen to be untrue for at least one population that has over 30 breeding pairs (G. Sundar <em>in litt. </em>2016). Drought due to climate change may be a threat, but modelling shows that as long as there are years of normal and above-normal rainfall interspersed with drought years, populations will do well (Sundar 2011a). Improper management of some man-made protected areas in India (for example, Keoladeo National Parin in Rajasthan) has failed to provide adequate environment for this species (G. Maheswaran <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p></span></span></span></span>","There are thought to be 1,000 <em>asiaticus </em>(G.

In light of the uncertainty surrounding this figure, a conservative range estimate of 15,000-35,000 individuals is preferred.",Decreasing,"<em>Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus </em>occurs in South Asia, South-East Asia and Oceania. In South Asia it is found in <strong>Pakistan</strong> (previously frequent in lower Sind, breeding in the Indus delta until the 1970s, now a straggler), <strong>Nepal</strong> (rare resident and winter visitor to the <em>terai</em>), <strong>India</strong> (a widespread resident, but now generally rare and local, and may now be absent in many areas in the south [G.

However, a population of c.29 pairs studied in Uttar Pradesh (India) had high productivity and low mortality and has been judged to be at least stable, if not a source for neighbouring populations (Sundar 2003, 2011a). The districts of south-western Uttar Pradesh are the species stronghold in India (K.S.G. Sundar<em> in litt. </em>2007). Between 1996 and 2003, the species was judged to be in decline at 32 (54%) of the 59 sites in India where it was recorded (Maheswaran <em>et al. </em>2004).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">In Dudwa N.P. the population remains the same even after 20 years when Maheswaran visited the wetlands situated inside Dudwa as recently as May, 2016.

A recent estimate places the Australian population at up to 20,000 breeding individuals and secure, although it has been contested that this is unduly optimistic and that the figure may not exceed 10,000. These estimates have been used to extrapolate a global total of c.31,000 individuals (Maheswaran <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>.

In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012). The Manatee population in Africa is reported to be reduced, but their present range appears to be comparable to historic reports (Husar 1978, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major rivers from north to south including lakes within these river systems: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansoa, Geba, Grande de Bulba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavally, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoe, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Pie, Katsena Ala, Deb, Okigb, Issa, Bani, Akwayafe, del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logoné, Mitémélé, Gabon, Ogooué, Nyanga, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Loémé, Congo, Loge, Dande, Bengo, Cuanza, and Longa.<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lakes: Lake Guiers (Senegal); Lake Volta (Ghana); Inland Niger delta (Mali); Lake Léré and Lake de Tréné (Chad); Lake Togo (Togo); Lake Aheme (Benin); Lake Onangue, Lake Ezanga, Lake Mandje (Cachimba) (Gabon).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lagoons: Digboué Lagoon, Tadia Lagoon, Ebrié Lagoon, Fresco Lagoon, Bandama Lagoon, Comoe Lagoon, (Ivory Coast); Sakumono Lagoon, Lake Songaw Lagoon, Keta Lagoon (Ghana), Grand Popo Lagoon, Lake Nokoue (Benin); Badagry Lagoon, Yewa Lagoon, Lagos Lagoon, Lekki Lagoon (Nigeria); Nkomi (Fernan Vaz) Lagoon, N’gowe (Iguela) Lagoon, N’dogo Lagoon, Banio Lagoon (Gabon); Conkouati Lagoon (Republic of the Congo); Massabi Lagoon (Cabinda).","<span lang=""EN-US"">Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly  everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass  is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

Its area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be 366 km²<span class=""A10"">, and the extent of occupancy is 2,128 km². The species is known to exist at no more than four locations. The area and quality of its available habitat is declining due to agricultural intensification. This decline is predicted to continue into the future.","<p>The species is an inhabitant of steppe and forest-steppe grasslands. It is typically found in areas of closed steppe on loess (Natura 2000 code: 6240*) and uncharacteristic dry grasslands (mostly degraded or secondary dry grasslands), <span lang=""EN-US"">and loess in mesic grasslands. Also present in perennial intensive arable fields (such as alfalfa), and the mosaics above (Sugár 2012). <span lang=""EN-US"">The species seems to prefer slopes over valleys, although avoids very steep slopes (Sugár 2012). Most of its habitats are used as pastureland, however it seems to avoid overgrazed pastures. It may occasionally enter some small-plot arable lands, especially alfalfa, for foraging. Strictly subterranean, and more agile and aggressive compared to <em>Nannospalax </em>(superspecies <em>leucodon</em>). Blind mole rats are a food resource for several threatened species of birds of prey, the survival, reproductive success, and population size of these species may partly depend on the density of the rodents (Németh <em>et al</em></span>. 2016).</p>","<p>The most important threatening factors are the different processes leading to habitat loss. In the past, the expansion of agriculture was the most prominent cause for the loss of the best habitats for blind mole rats. The most fertile loess soils were the first to undergo changes in land use which has pushed blind mole-rat populations to less favourable areas. The widespread use of deep tillage was the single most important direct effect that drastically reduced blind mole-rat population sizes and distribution. Firstly, repeated ploughing does not allow the formation of the vegetation type necessary for the survival of blind mole-rats; secondly, deep ploughing destroys their underground burrow systems as well as the animals themselves. Small plot farming with mosaics of fallow land has often given way to intensive crop production in large monocultures. Nowadays, the most common reason causing tillage is not so much the cultivation itself but the fulfilment of the requirements to apply for funding from the European Community. Blind mole rats often colonise abandoned land if that is close to their habitat. When the owner decides to start cultivating again, these subpopulations can be destroyed.<br/><br/>Urbanisation, site development and road constructions are threats to this species<em>. </em>Most of the land in these cases is the property of the municipality and impending industrial investments can mean complete eradication. Road construction can also annihilate populations. This mainly concerns non-protected areas.<br/><br/>Overgrazing<strong> </strong>greatly reduces species diversity, and causes a significant decrease in the food resources of blind mole-rats. Sheep populations within the species’ range are generally very high, and grazing is currently not controlled by any effective legal means, which has led to a decline or local extinction of several plant and animal species dependent on dry grasslands (e.g. meadow viper <em>Vipera ursinii rakosiensis</em>).<br/><br/>Limited habitat sizes and low population sizes threaten the long-term viability of populations with inbreeding and other genetic problems.<br/><br/>Hadid <em>et al</em>. (2012) analysed the phylogeny of the subfamily Spalacinae calibrated by fossil records. Revealed evolutionary events show a remarkable synchronization with the cycles of solar orbital fluctuations (eccentricity and precession) driving the ice ages. This makes it plausible that global climate changes following the ice ages played an important role in the formation of the unusually high genetic diversity of blind mole-rats.<br/><br/>We can also be sure that the present changes in global climate will significantly impact blind mole-rats, but the direction and the extent of this impact cannot be predicted. In the past, such processes resulted in new taxa of blind mole-rats, but current changes are heavily distorted by human influence. There is a whole host of evidence (Nevo <em>et al </em>1994a,b, 1995; 2000a,b; Reyes <em>et al</em>. 2003; Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004) that genetically and geographically distinct taxa adapted to the specific climate of their own range during their speciation. However, blind mole-rat habitats have shrunk to small, isolated fragments that are few and far between, within a matrix impenetrable for blind mole-rats. Isolation is further abetted by their severely limited dispersal capacities. Thus, there is a high likelihood that ongoing climatic changes would rather wipe out blind mole-rat species than give rise to new ones.<br/><br/>Even though Méhely’s blind mole rat is a protected species in Romania, there are still cases of intentional destruction. It is extremely hard to measure this kind of activity. Conflicts arise from some individuals living and foraging close to human settlements, damaging ornamental plants and vegetables. Another anthropogenic threat is the disturbance and destruction caused by pets (dogs as well as cats). Stray dogs and herding dogs are known to have killed individuals.</p>    <p><br/></p>","<p>Population is fragmented, and habitat fragmentation is ongoing. Densities of 2.7–3.7 individuals/hectare have been recorded (Sugár 2009, 2012). <strong></strong></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This is an endemic species of the Carpathian Basin (Csorba <em>et al.</em> 2015).

100193958,4632,Chiloglanis bifurcus,Critically Endangered,A2ace,2017,2016-11-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Incomati Suckermouth (<em>Chiloglanis bifurcus</em>) is endemic to the Upper Crocodile River and Elands River of the Inkomati River System, South Africa (Jubb &amp; Le Roux 1969; Gaigher 1969; Kleynhans 1982, 1984, 1986; Skelton 1987; Kleynhans <em>et al</em>. 1992) and in the Upper Mlumati River in Swaziland (Monadjem <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bills <em>et al</em>. 2004). The population has declined since 1984 with the construction of the Kwena Dam (formerly Braam Raubenheimer Dam) in the Crocodile River for irrigation purposes. Flow regulation is particularly relevant in this regard and is thought to be the main driver of the elimination of the subpopulation in the Crocodile River below this dam. The chemical spill from the SAPPI Paper Mill at Ngodwana (23 September 1989) into the Elands River, further accelerated the decline of this species. More recently, deteriorating water quality from Machadodorp has impacted on this species. These declines have been exacerbated by the introduction of invasive alien fish species (Roux and Selepe 2013). These declines have been observed, through continuous biomonitoring of the species and the determination of the Ecostatus of the Inkomati Catchment by nature conservation officials (MTPA – Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency). Based on the trends of the catch per unit effort (CPUE) and relative abundance of this species a 90% population reduction has been observed over the past 10 years (estimated generation length of 3-5 years) (Kleynhans 1984, 1989; Roux &amp; Selepe 2013; Roux <em>et al</em>. 2016). There has also been a decline in the area of occupancy (AOO), extent of occurrence (EOO) and a loss of habitat quality. It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered under criteria A2ace.","This is a instream species with adults ranging from 4.1 cm to 6.7 cm and occurs in rocky habitats in fast flowing streams and rivers, but typically inhabits deeper runs rather than rapids. The average flow velocity in the Crocodile River where this species occurs range from 0.35 m sec<sup>-1</sup> to 1.16 m sec<sup>-1</sup> with a depth ranging from 0.3 – 1.5 m and the river width ranging between 5 to 8 m (Kleynhans 1984). This species inhabit the interstitial spaces of lose rocks with a diameter ranging from 0.1 m to 0.5 m. They occur in relative low population densities together with several other fish species which include Common Mountain Catfish (<em>Amphilius uranoscopus</em>), Rosefin Barb (<em>Enteromius argenteus</em>) and Shortspine Suckermouth (<em>Chiloglanis Pretoriae</em>)&#160;(Kleynhans 1984). This species breeds in the summer from October to February and is classified as a partial spawner with total fecundity of between 250 and 300 ova. The precise spawning habitat has not been identified.","In the Inkomati River System, the Crocodile River below the Kwena Dam, the population has gone extinct from its type locality. This is probably due to continuous flow regulation from the Kwena Dam. In the Elands River additional impacts within the region are deteriorating water quality from Machadodorp (Ferrochrome smelter, Machado waste water treatment plant and informal settlements). Further downstream it is impacted by sedimentation from forestry and agricultural activities, water extraction resulting in reduced or no flows, as well as introduced alien fishes (Brown Trout (<em>Salmo trutta</em>), Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) and Largemouth Bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>)). The SAPPI Ngodwana Paper Mill and related activities is a present form of pollution and according to Griffin <em>et al.</em> (2014) the Elands River is one of the most impacted rivers in the catchment. The assessment of water quality changes with time show a clear temporal quality decrease and a distinct cumulative impact with distance downstream. In the other Elands River tributaries (Ngodwana, Gladdespruit, Stadspruit and Houtbosloop) forestry related practices with high road network densities and stream crossings resulted in excessive sedimentation and the loss of habitat availability to this species, resulting in the disappearance of this species in most of these streams. Large forestry fires in 2010 furthermore attributed to sedimentation of instream fish habitats. In the upper Mlumati River, Swaziland, similar conditions relating to unregulated forestry threatens this species.","This mainstem species is naturally found at relatively low population densities and based on comprehensive population studies by Kleynhans (1984) its historic relative abundance in relation to other fish species sampled from appropriate habitat was 2.8% and catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 0.18 fish/minute electrofishing. O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2014) assessed the different CPUE trends dating back to 1989 (Kleynhans 1992, James 1992) and also conducted seven fish surveys from March 2002 to August 2006. The CPUE rates during these surveys the for Incomati Suckermouth ranged between 0.04 and 1.73 fish/minute electrofishing,&#160;In 2013 the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Authority (MTPA) conducted a comprehensive study on the Ecostatus of the Crocodile River Catchment during which 56 biomonitoring sites were sampled (Roux and Selepe 2013). <em>Chiloglanis bifurcus</em> were only sampled from three of the 56 sampling sites, two in the Elands River and one in the Crocodile River, close to its confluence with the Elands River. In conjunction with a small number of sites from which this fish was sampled, the CPUE 0.06 fish/minute electrofishing was indicative of a drastic decline in the population. Particularly relevant was that no Incomati Suckermouth were recorded at the type locality in the Crocodile River downstream of the 50 m high Kwena Dam (formerly Braam Raubenheimer Dam). It would appear that stream regulation from the dam has had a detrimental effect on the downstream population of this species. During this study the species was also not recorded in the Houtbosloop tributary as intensive forest fires in 2010 resulted in excessive siltation and sedimentation altering and reducing its available habitat.In September 2013 and April 2014 high flow and low flow surveys were conducted to determine stream flow conditions in the Elands River relating to the impact of the Sappi Paper Mill at Ngodwana (Diedericks and Roux 2014). During the low flow period survey no Incomati Suckermouth were sampled despite the collection of 477 individuals of other fish species during an electrofishing sampling effort of 97 minutes. During the high flow period surveys only four adults were recorded, resulting in a CPUE of 0.04 fish/minute electrofishing and a relative contribution to the fish community of 1.23%. Thus for both the high and low flow surveys the average combined CPUE value was 0.02 and a population density of 0.49%. In comparison to the historical CPUE of 0.18 fish/minute electrofishing the 2013/14 survey indicated a decline in the population density of Incomati Suckermouth (Kleynhans 1986). In 2016 an intensive study was conducted to determine the overall status of the Incomati Suckermouth population across its extent of occurrence. In the Ngodwana River, described as a sanctuary area (James 1992), three adult individuals were collected from two sites that were surveyed with a combined sampling effort of 138 minutes resulting in a CPUE value of 0.02 individuals/minute electrofishing (relative abundance= 0.24%). This observed reduction can possibly be related to the presence of the invasive alien species such as Rainbow Trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>). For the other seven biomonitoring sites on the Elands River and tributaries only ten adults were sampled with a CPUE value of 0.03 (relative abundance = 0.36%). These recent surveys indicate that the population in the Elands River catchment and tributaries has suffered a &gt;90% reduction in distribution and a decline in AOO as well as a loss of habitat quality. Further, the subpopulation in the Crocodile River reach below the Kwena Dam is likely to be extinct and the population recorded in the Ngodwana River is now fragmented and threatened by alien fishes. For the subpopulation recorded in the Upper Mlumati River, Swaziland, very little information is available. However, due to unregulated forestry activities, most of these streams in Swaziland are severely sedimented and it is suspected that this subpopulation is also at risk.",Decreasing,"This species has a restricted distribution and is endemic to the Inkomati River System and within this system it is restricted to altitudes between 900 m.a.s.l to 1200 m.a.s.l. It historically occurred in the Crocodile and Elands River and in some of its sub-tributaries (Elands, Ngodwana, Gladdespruit and Stadspruit) (Kleynhans 1984). Recently only sampled from a small section of the Elands River and Crocodile River as well as in a few tributaries of the Mlumati River in South Africa and Swaziland.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters),The distribution range of Incomati Suckermouth&#160;is entirely within privately owned land without any formal conservation protection. The two remaining subpopulations need to be given priority for conservation efforts. Land and water use practices need to be carefully managed and stocking of alien organisms need to be stopped. The most effective way might be through conservancy agreements with riparian land owners and the Mpumalanga Parks Board. The Elands River and its tributaries have been identified as priority freshwater environments for fish conservation and are listed as a fish sanctuary in the National Freshwater Ecosystem Priority Areas (NFEPA) (Driver <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).,Afrotropical,,false,false,"Global, Pan-Africa & S.

Even in extensive patches of <em>A. drepanolobium</em> the population density was low: c.3-7 pairs km<sup>-2</sup> (Shaw and Mungaya 2006)<strong></strong>. Suitable habitat usually occurs in riverine areas, along seasonal watercourses and in seasonally inundated land. The species's distribution and abundance in Serengeti National Park has increased since the early 1990s, perhaps owing to vegetation changes associated with high grazing pressure, following an increase in wildebeest numbers in the 1970s (reducing the volume of combustible dry grass, thus limiting the damage caused by 'hot burns'), and reduced browsing pressure on <em>Acacia </em>seedlings, following a decline in the elephant population since the 1980s (Shaw 2007)<strong></strong>. The species forages in small family parties, with juveniles accounting for 18% of birds encountered in the Wembere Steppe in July (Shaw and Mungaya 2006)<strong></strong>. It occasionally forages in mixed-species flocks (D. C. Moyer <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>, searching for food mainly at a height of 1.5-2.5 m in <em>A. drepanolobium</em> trees over 2 m high (Shaw <em>et al.</em> 2004, Shaw and Mungaya 2006)<strong></strong>. It forages for invertebrate prey by gleaning and sally-gleaning from pseudo-galls, spines and leaves (Shaw <em>et al.</em> 2004, Shaw and Mungaya 2006)<strong></strong>. Its feeding and breeding ecology are largely unknown. So far it has been observed within an altitudinal range of 1,050-1,580 m (P. Shaw <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","In Tanzania, it is at risk from habitat loss linked to an expanding human population, and because much of its restricted range lies outside protected areas. The area between the Serengeti ecosystem and the Wembere Steppe is now under great pressure from pastoralists and farmers, and is thought to have retained little suitable habitat, inhibiting exchange between the two areas. In the Wembere Steppe, <em>A. drepanolobium</em> is cleared for cultivation, cut and pruned for firewood and hedging material, browsed by goats and trampled by cattle, all of which limits regeneration, as does incidental burning from grass fires set to improve grazing quality (Shaw <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. These pressures are predicted to intensify as human and livestock populations increase (Shaw <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The human population in districts encompassing the Wembere Steppe increased by 2.2-3.7% per year between 1978 and 2002, and in Igunga District, where bulk of the species's Wembere population resides, the human population increased by 4.3% per year between 1988 and 2002 (Shaw <em>et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Increasing cultivation and livestock farming may also be threatening the species in Uganda (H. J. Rainey verbally 1999)<strong></strong>. In 1996, it was noted that large amounts of cultivation and wood-cutting were threatening to reduce potential habitat for the species in the Mt Kadam region, and evidence of the over-grazing of trees and bushes was observed at Napianyenya (Rainey undated)<strong></strong>. Although the species appears to have benefited from changes in ungulate populations in the Serengeti, which have influenced burning intensity and hence tree regeneration, its range now appears to be declining following a recent reduction in the density and annual survival of <em>A. drepanolobium</em> in the northern Serengeti (Shaw 2009).&#160;Infrastructure development (oil pipeline from Uganda to the coast through Tanzania, and other major transport links such as roads in northern Tanzania) in the region may also pose a threat, and should be reviewed to understand how much of a threat it may pose to this species (H. Rainey&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).<p></p>","Surveys of the Wembere Steppe and Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania suggest a total population in the range 300-1,500 birds (P. Shaw <em>in litt.</em> 2007). No estimates are available for the Ugandan population. The preliminary estimate of 10,000-19,999 individuals is retained pending further information.

In 2015 there was a sighting of one bird c.25km north of Mbale (the habitat is quite extensive and so they may be more common than this single sighting [D. Pomeroy <em>in litt.</em> to P.

During the 1960s the subspecies <em>stronachi</em><strong> </strong>(Stuart and Collar 1986) was known from at least four sites in Tanzania, all of them in, or near to, the Wembere Steppe: at Ngongoro, Itumba, Ndala, and between Nzega and Igunga. A survey in 2003 showed that the species's range in and adjacent to the Wembere Steppe was less extensive than had been assumed, with records spanning an area of 102 km north-south by 53 km east-west (Shaw and Mungaya 2006)<strong></strong>.

Some populations in its Iberian stronghold have been suggested to have stabilised and possibly increased, although there is now some evidence for at least local declines in some areas in this region. Additionally, hunting in Central and East Asia results in high rates of adult mortality, and land-use changes in eastern Europe, Russia, Central Asia and Morocco may have a significant impact on this species's population and the extent of its remaining habitat, such that it is likely to decline at a rapid rate over the next three generations.

The eastern subspecies nests in agricultural mosaics, open steppe, and adjacent to forest edge (Kessler 2015). It exhibits highly variable migratory behaviour across populations, including obligate winter migrants (Asia, Russia), facultative migrants (central European populations) and partial winter and summer migrants with differential migratory pattern by sex (Iberian populations) (Morales <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2000, Alonso <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2000, 2001, Palacín <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2009, 2011).<br/><strong></strong> <p></p>","Key threats are increased habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss due to agricultural intensification, land-use changes and infrastructure development  which has the potential to increase following land privatisation in eastern Europe (S.

Habitat loss and fragmentation continues as a result of ploughing of grasslands, intensive grazing, afforestation and increasing development of irrigation schemes, roads, power-lines, fencing and ditches.

121229971,41688,Ursus arctos,Least Concern,,2017,2016-02-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The range of the Brown Bear has historically declined in North America, Europe, and Asia, and the species has been extirpated in North Africa. However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the world’s most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 km²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 km²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5‒15 bears per 1,000 km²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, Frković <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130–220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 km² and 2,200 km² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21‒29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of Gärdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (≈1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
121745669,712,Ailuropoda melanoleuca,Vulnerable,C2a(i); D1,2016,2016-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) produced an estimated range-wide population of 1,864 Giant Pandas, excluding dependent young &lt;1.5 years of age (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although no formal demographic analysis is available, there are demographic data available to enable estimation of age-related population composition (Sichuan Forestry Department 2015): if the population consists of 9.6% cubs, then the total population of Pandas is approximately 2,060. Mature adults are estimated to compose 50.5% of the total population, yielding an estimate of 1,040. Although this estimate does not contain confidence intervals, clearly the lower confidence interval would fall below 1,000 mature individuals, which meets the small population size criteria (D1) for Vulnerable.<br/><br/>Additionally, the species falls under criteria C2. The Panda population is fragmented into subpopulations, each of which contains &lt;1,000 adults (given that the total population is &lt;1,000 adults); however, the size of the largest population is unknown given uncertainty in how much connectivity remains. It appears that at least one distinct populations in the Minshan mountains contains &gt;400 mature individuals (State Forestry Administration 2015), so the species does not meet the criteria for Endangered (EN). The most tentative part of listing under C2 is a continued population decline.<br/><br/>Evidence from a series of range-wide national surveys indicate that the previous population decline has been arrested, and the population has started to increase (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although inconsistencies in data collection methods, analysis, and sampling area make direct comparisons from survey results difficult, population estimates have consistently increased across survey since the Second National Survey conducted during 1985-1988. Initial uncertainties regarding whether modest population increases observed in the Third National Survey (2000-2004) were real warranted maintaining the Endangered status for the Giant Panda in the previous Red List assessment. Recent data from the Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) remove this uncertainty (State Forestry Administration 2015), and it is widely believed that the population has stabilized and has begun to increase in many parts of the range.<br/><br/>An increase in available habitat and an expanding occupied range provide further support for the contention that Panda numbers are increasing. Forest protection and reforestation measures have increased forest cover in China (FAO 2010), and have supported an 11.8% increase in occupied habitat and 6.3% increase in unoccupied but suitable habitat between the Third and Fourth National Surveys (State Forestry Administration 2015). A survey of expert opinion among Giant Panda experts in the IUCN Bear Specialist Group was consistent with the results of the national survey: all believed that the Panda population was stable or increasing and that available habitat was increasing.<br/><br/>Although the population is currently increasing, climate change is predicted to eliminate &gt;35% of the Panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years, and thus the Panda population is projected to decline (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Under this scenario, the species fits the criteria for VU under C2a(i).<br/><br/>Whereas the decision to downlist the Giant Panda to Vulnerable is a positive sign confirming that the Chinese government's efforts to conserve this species are effective, it is critically important that these protective measures are continued and that emerging threats are addressed. The threat of declining bamboo availability due to climate change could, in the near future, reverse the gains made during the last two decades. The Giant Panda will remain a conservation-dependent species for the foreseeable future. The Chinese government's plan to expand existing conservation policy for the species (State Forestry Administration 2015) should receive strong support to ensure its implementation.","A member of the order Carnivora, Giant Pandas have evolved to specialize on a diet of bamboo (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Bamboo is a poor food source, low in protein and high in lignin and cellulose, and wild Giant Pandas can only digest an average of 17% of dry matter and about 27% of hemi-cellulose (Dierenfeld <em>et al.</em> 1982, Schaller <em>et al</em>. 1985). Thus, to meet their daily energy requirement, Giant Pandas must consume a large amount of bamboo, up to 12.5 kg per day, and defecate more than 100 times daily (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Pandas have large, muscular jaws with skeletal features to accommodate the musculature and its famous “pseudothumb” used to hold and manipulate bamboo for processing. However, compared with other herbivores, the Panda has very low digestive efficiency because its digestive tract still resembles that of its carnivorous ancestors. The Panda’s feeding strategy emphasizes volume, requiring it to allocate much of its time to foraging (approximately 14 hours daily).<br/><br/>While morphological and behavioural adaptations provide some compensation for poor digestive efficiency, the Panda’s ability to survive on such a low-quality food source remained mysterious for decades. Even whole-genome sequencing found no specific genes responsible for the digestion of cellulose and hemi-cellulose (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010). An explanation was uncovered in a recent metagenomics study that found the Panda’s gut microbes play an important role in digesting bamboo fibers (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011a). Additional adaptations to poor quality diet are found in the Panda’s extreme strategy of energy conservation, with daily energy expenditure comparable to that of a sloth or reptile (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Pandas demonstrate a suite of adaptations to reduce energy expenditure. The thick pelage conserves energy lost through body heat, and it has long been known that pandas are conservative in movement and physical activity. Smaller than expected organs also are indicative of energy-conservation adaptation, and down-regulation of resting metabolic rate has been achieved through a mutation in the synthesis pathway for thyroid hormones.<br/><br/>Giant Pandas also compensate for digestive inefficiency by selecting the most nutritious parts of bamboo plants and by altering diet selection seasonally commensurate with changes in nutritional profiles of bamboo species (Schaller<em> et al.</em> 1985, Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015b). They demonstrate strong preference for seasonally available new bamboo shoots, rich in nutrition and energy and low in fibre. Outside the late spring bamboo shoot season, Pandas favour leaves, although more stems are incorporated into their diet during the winter months when leaf quality and quantity diminishes. This convergence of foraging strategies across variations in climate, bamboo species, and topographic profile indicates an adaptive strategy that serves the species well. Still, as an energy-limited species that spends more than 50% of its time foraging, Panda numbers may be limited by the availability of high quality bamboo and the time required to process bamboo in the digestive system.<br/><br/>Early coarse-scale radio tracking using VHF transmitters provided foundational data on home range size and documented the solitary nature of the Panda’s existence (Schaller<em> et al</em>. 1985, Yong <em>et al. </em>1994, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). Although Panda home ranges overlap generously, direct encounters between individuals are rare. Seasonal elevational migration has been documented in the Qionglai (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985) and Qinling mountains (Yong <em>et al.</em> 1994, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2002, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). At both sites, the seasonal movements track changes in resources, providing access to bamboo species that provide greater nutritional value. Research integrating behavioural, nutritional, and movement data provide new insights into these seasonal migration patterns, demonstrating that these movements facilitate consumption of higher concentrations and/or a more balanced intake of key nutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Calcium (Ca) (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014). Female-biased dispersal has been demonstrated with genetic data in the Minshan and Liangshan Mountains (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007, Hu <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Fine-scale documentation of |Panda movement behaviour had to await the advent of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Published accounts using high-resolution GPS telemetry revised and added to previous findings (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Hull <em>et al. </em>2015). VHF-based radio tracking inevitably leads to large amounts of missing data when animals at more distant locations are not detected, thus it is unsurprising that GPS tracking substantively revised home range size upwards, and that core area overlap and opportunity for social interactions is now understood to be greater than previously believed. Other interesting phenomena were also detected, such as the documentation of female-biased dispersal (confirmed with genetic data; Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007), and sudden, large movements that temporarily took a female far outside of her home range during the mating season. Fine-scale movement data showed that Pandas exhibited individualistic and multiphasic movement paths within seasonal core habitats and large-scale movements between habitats. Tortuous movement paths indicated when pandas searched for and found foraging resources. Pandas frequently return to the same foraging patches, indicating that they likely have well-developed spatial memory.<br/><br/>Using various measures of habitat suitability, efforts to map Panda habitat have proven valuable for guiding the establishment of the Panda reserve system (Shen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Feng <em>et al.</em> 2009, Qi <em>et al.</em> 2012). Giant Pandas typically occupy temperate montane forests at altitudes of 1,500–3,000 m (Hu and Wei 2004). Range-wide analysis of ecological covariates associated with Panda presence suggested that Giant Pandas are associated with old growth forests, a finding previously unrecognised in studies implemented on smaller spatial scales (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). As an obligate bamboo specialist, the Giant Panda’s reliance on this resource is clear, yet it has usually been ignored in habitat suitability models because mapping bamboo understory using remote sensing techniques is difficult (Linderman<em> et al. </em>2005). Including understory bamboo in habitat models dramatically decreases estimates of available habitat and increases measures of fragmentation. Advances in remote sensing techniques, such as Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), combined with new analytical techniques, such as artificial neural network analysis, have helped remove obstacles to including bamboo understory in maps of habitat suitability (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2009; Viña <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). Enhanced understanding of Panda habitat requirements and improvements in mapping technologies provide managers and policy makers with better tools for conservation decision-making (Loucks <em>et al.</em> 2003, Xu <em>et al.</em> 2006, Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Qi <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>Giant Pandas are a solitary and seasonal-breeding mammal, only coming together during the breeding season, from March to May, for reproductive purposes (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Male Pandas occupy large home ranges overlapping several females and are known to congregate around oestrous females. Male Pandas are able to locate females across large areas, and demonstrate fierce and injurious aggression in competition for access to females. Early in these encounters escalated aggression is common, but, in a possible strategy to conserve energy and minimize risk of injury, once dominance is established, contact aggression is largely replaced with non-contact aggression. Individual males are able to locate and mate with multiple females sequentially, so the mating system might be considered scramble competition polygyny.<br/><br/>Because Pandas live a solitary existence, they must rely heavily on chemosignals to communicate with one another without necessitating face-to-face encounters. Giant Pandas make use of a system of traditional communal scent mark stations that provide them with reliable locations they can visit to deposit signals and investigate signals left by other Pandas (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985). Studies documenting habitat characteristics of preferred marking sites, including tree species and microhabitat (Nie <em>et al. </em>2012a), extend our understanding of habitat requirements for the species. If habitat that promotes communication is not maintained, then poor communication may hinder breeding in the wild, as has been shown for captive Pandas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Denning ecology is an important field of study among ursids, and other species giving birth in dens, because access to adequate dens can be important for offspring survival. Forest management practices that affect the availability of suitable dens can either significantly harm or enhance cub survival (White<em> et al. </em>2001). Ursid young, being extremely altricial, are particularly vulnerable. The Giant Panda lies at the extreme end of this continuum, with the mother weighing nearly 1,000 times the cub’s weight at birth (Gittleman 1994). Den quality may therefore be critical for Pandas. Giant Pandas do not hibernate, but females use rock caves or tree cavities to rear offspring that are produced every 2–3 years (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Zhu <em>et al. </em>2001). Preferred dens are characterized by a small opening to buffer against the elements and provide a warmer and drier environment for rearing offspring (Zhang<em> et al. </em>2007). Dens tend to be located close to water, presumably so the mother can leave the vulnerable cub (almost always a single cub) unattended for a shorter period of time while she drinks. It has also been proposed that tree dens, once more numerous in primary forests before logging converted many forests in Panda habitat to second growth, are a limiting resource for Giant Pandas (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). The importance of this resource may explain why national survey data indicate that pandas are more often found in primary than secondary forest.<br/><br/>It was once believed, and sometimes still mis-stated, that Pandas’ biological deficiencies were responsible for their own decline. Because of early problems with captive breeding, Pandas gained a reputation for having notoriously low levels of interest in mating; however, Pandas in the wild experience no mating problems and have high reproductive rates (Wei and Hu 1994, Pan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Once a better understanding of the biology and behaviour of the species was incorporated into husbandry practices, captive Pandas began to mate naturally and experienced exponential population growth (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2006, Zhang and Wei 2006, Martin-Wintle <em>et al.</em> 2016). Moreover, its well-known specialization on bamboo is not (as once thought) an evolutionary cul de sac, as it opens up a foraging niche with plentiful resources and few competitors (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014). Dietary specialization is often seen as an extinction risk factor, but this may not be the case for the Panda, which specializes on widespread and abundant bamboo. Thus, pandas are well-adapted to their environment and have reproductive rates sufficiently high to explain the recovery of populations once bans on poaching and habitat restoration efforts commenced (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014).","The primary threat facing Giant Panda populations is the continuing effects of previous habitat loss, resulting in highly fragmented habitat and, in many cases small, isolated populations. According to the Fourth National Survey (State Forestry Administration 2015), the Panda population is composed of as many as 33 subpopulations, 18 of which contain fewer than 10 individuals. The extent to which these are demographically separate populations remains uncertain, but this fragmentation certainly increases vulnerability to extinction through environmental and demographic stochasticity and loss of genetic diversity.<br/><br/>Although microsatellite analysis (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Shan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and genomics (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013) have now determined that the Giant Panda has substantial genetic variability, without increased migration and connectivity, many of these smaller populations will have rapidly eroding evolutionary potential. Three genetic clusters have been recognized: the Qinling Mountains population (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007) which diverged ~0.3 million years ago; the Mishan mountains, which diverged ~2,800 years ago into the Mishan and Qionglai populations (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013); and the other four combined populations, including Qionglai, Daxiangling, Xiaoziangling, and Liangshan (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, in this larger cluster, further sub-structuring is manifest (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011b). Population divergence is the product of several operating factors, including climate change, natural barriers, and anthropogenic habitat loss.<br/><br/>Threats associated with edge effects, human disturbance, and small population size are most severe in these small, isolated populations. Increased fragmentation from roads, hydroelectric dams, mining, and other infrastructure projects further threaten Panda populations (State Forestry Administration 2015), but these trends are partially counterbalanced through the successful implementation of ecocompensation programs that curtail some activities such as fuel wood collection (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007) and efforts to increase habitat connectivity between some populations (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Tourism is increasing in some areas and if not managed properly, could negatively impact Panda populations (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2012). Pathogens and parasites may be an emerging problem compromising Giant Panda health and survival, particularly in areas where dogs, livestock, and other domesticated animals may introduce novel pathogens (Qin <em>et al.</em> 2010; Zhang, L. <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2015). Air- or water-borne environmental contaminants may also exert negative impacts on Panda populations, but little is known about their prevalence. Livestock grazing, inside and outside of protected areas, represents another, potentially growing threat (Hull <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wang <em>et al.</em> 2015). It should also be noted that protected status of nature reserves does not always confer protection, and some threats have continued even after Panda reserves were gazetted (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2001). These continuing human activities may have cumulative effects that further degrade Panda habitat.<br/><br/>Pandas' reliance on bamboo as a primary food source puts them at risk during this plant's characteristic mass synchronous flowering and die-off events, which occur at intervals of 15 to 100 years (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1989). Before human expansion confined Pandas to high elevations, Pandas had access to more species of bamboo adapted to different elevation zones. When one bamboo species experienced a die-off, Pandas could easily migrate up or down slope to access a different species that was not affected. Confined to its more limited elevation range today, Pandas are sometimes put at risk of starvation, especially when more than one bamboo species flowers at the same time. Although past bamboo die-off events were alarming and caused starvation and mortalities in Pandas, populations recovered (Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and these population bottlenecks did not compromise genetic diversity (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>These primary threats associated with habitat fragmentation and degradation may be exacerbated by climate change-mediated effects on Panda habitat in the future. Several models indicate significant losses to Giant Panda habitat, with estimates of loss of bamboo habitat ranging from 37% to 100% by the end of the century (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although these models are simplifying and may not adequately account for distributional shifts of bamboo species adapted to lower elevations and southern latitudes to replace current habitat that might be lost (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a), managers should be concerned about large-scale environmental changes facing Panda populations in the future. In addition, climate change may alter the agricultural value of current Giant Panda habitat and bring about intensified human pressure for cultivation. For example, some models indicate that much of Panda habitat will become suitable for viticulture, a high-value crop (Hannah <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Although poaching impacted Pandas in the past (Li <em>et al.</em> 2003), its impact declined rapidly since the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act, which bans poaching and carries severe punishments. However, Pandas may sometimes be caught in snares set for musk deer or other species.","The Giant Panda is the subject of one of the largest, most intensive efforts to estimate population size for an entire species. The Chinese government has carried out four national surveys, approximately every 10 years since 1974. The most recent, the Fourth National Survey conducted from 2011 to 2014, mobilized more than 2,000 people who spent more than 60,000 person-days surveying 4.36 million ha. The population estimates derived from these surveys should be considered rough estimates due to difficulty associated with extrapolating sign survey data to determine the number of individuals. Idiosyncratic feeding styles among individual pandas produce bamboo fragments that vary somewhat distinctively in size (“bite-size”) between individuals and thus provide some information that helps distinguish faeces from different individuals, especially when combined with information about home range size. However, as a population census tool, this method has never been fully validated (Pan<em> et al. </em>2014). Evidence suggests that sign survey data may have under-estimated population size in one reserve (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Wei <em>et al. </em>2012), but it is not known to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other reserves. Although DNA has been extracted from faeces collected during the Fourth National Survey, these data have not yet yielded a population estimate because most of the faeces collected were not sufficiently fresh to provide adequate DNA. Thus, the best available population estimate for the species relies on bite-size analysis.<br/><br/>Another limitation of the national survey data is that the methods have been altered and improved since they commenced in 1974, and the range and effort of the survey have been inconsistent. The same methods were used for the third and fourth national surveys; although survey effort increased in the fourth survey, most of this increase can be attributed to the larger area covered to capture the expanding range that Pandas now occupy. Thus, comparisons between surveys may not be completely valid, but they are still informative. The first survey (1974–1977) produced an estimate of 2,459 pandas, which decreased dramatically in the second survey (1985–1988) to 1,216 individuals. This approximately 50% drop in population size provided the impetus for the 1988 Wildlife Protection act, which banned Panda poaching, and China’s <em>National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat</em>, which established a reserve system for Pandas (Reid and Gong 1999). By the time of the third survey (2000–2004), the population estimate increased to 1,596, indicating that these protective measures may have been successful. However, uncertainties remained due to the inconsistencies in the methods by which the surveys were implemented (as well as a lack of confidence limits on the point estimates). Although these same limitations still apply, the recent fourth survey showed the Panda population increased further to 1,864, removing most remaining uncertainties regarding population trend. Additionally, Pandas have been documented in many areas outside their known range, including an animal shot in 2015 in Yunnan Province, where they have not been recorded for centuries. An increasing population was not surprising, given that available and occupied habitats have increased. <br/><br/>The optimism engendered by these positive trends is dampened by evidence indicating that some Panda populations are decreasing, particularly those found in the smallest and most degraded habitat patches such as Liangshan, Xiangling and Niuweihe. Approximately 223 pandas occupying 23 isolated habitat patches are considered at high risk of local extinction, and will require increased protection and management (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011b; State Forestry Administration 2015).",Increasing,"Once widespread throughout southern China, and as far north as Beijing and south into Southeast Asia, the Panda’s distribution is now confined to its previous western extremity in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Pleistocene range shifts were associated with the disappearance of the Panda’s principal source of food, bamboo, due to warming climate; whereas rapid range contraction in the past several hundred years is attributed to the conversion of bamboo forests to agricultural cultivation and rapid expansion of human populations (Li <em>et al.</em> 2015). The largest populations are currently found in the Minshan, Qinling, Qionglai mountain ranges, and smaller, more isolated populations remain in the Liangshan, Daxiangling, and Xiaoxiangling mountain ranges (State Forestry Administration 2015).<br/><br/>The Giant Panda’s range is highly fragmented, resulting from centuries of human encroachment and loss of forested habitat at lower elevations. Rapidly expanding industrialization, beginning in the early 1900s and accelerating since 1949, is associated with severe contraction of the Panda’s range (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li<em> et al. </em>2015). While they once occupied forests below 1,000 m in elevation, current populations are restricted to mountain ranges, separated by valleys and flatter landscapes that have been altered by human activities. China lost more than 30% of its forests between 1950 and 2004, coinciding with a precipitous drop in Panda populations, but forest cover has increased in the past two decades (FAO 2010).","Although historically the Giant Panda was sometimes hunted for its pelt, law enforcement mechanisms appear to have eliminated this trade.",Terrestrial,"The Giant Panda has been the focus of one of the most intensive, high profile efforts to recover an endangered species. In 1981, China joined the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which made trade of Panda skins illegal. Enactment of the 1988 Wildlife Protection Law banned poaching and conferred protected status to the Giant Panda (listed as Category I, the highest level of protection). The National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat of 1992 laid out a masterplan for Panda conservation and established a Panda reserve system, which today has grown to 67 reserves. Enlarged by more than 50% since the Third National Survey, this reserve system currently protects 67% of the Panda population and nearly 1.4 million hectares of Panda habitat (State Forestry Administration 2015). The biological diversity of these reserves is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems (Mackinnon 2008), thus making the Panda an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on many other sympatric species (Noss 1990).<br/><br/>These efforts to end poaching and protect Panda habitat played a significant role in Panda recovery. The Chinese government also invested in infrastructure and capacity building for reserve staff, established anti-poaching patrol, curtailed human activities inside reserves, and in some cases relocated human settlements from inside to outside of reserves. Other measures directed at broader conservation problems also benefited the Panda. The Natural Forest Conservation Program was implemented in 1997 to reduce the devastating impacts of flooding on human communities due to deforestation and erosion. The program banned logging in most forests in Panda habitat, slowing habitat degradation. Additionally, the Grain-to-Green Program incentivized farmers to plant trees on steep slopes to slow erosion. The result of these policies was the addition of 3 million hectares of forest cover in China annually, an increase of 1.6% per year from 2000 to 2010 (FAO 2010). As a consequence, Panda habitat is recovering and the total occupied habitat has increased by 11.8% between the Third and the Fourth National Surveys; an additional 6.3% increase in suitable but unoccupied habitat was also observed. In the Wolong Nature Reserve, implementation of the Grain-to-Green Program brought about measurable increases in connectivity of Panda habitat (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007). Thus, these habitat conservation policies are associated with increasing Panda population size, increasing range, and better habitat connectivity. Efforts have also commenced to restore habitat corridors (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a) and to reintroduce captive-born pandas to increase genetic diversity in small, isolated populations.<br/><br/>Ecocompensation has been proposed as an important component of a conservation strategy for pandas (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015; Liu <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2015; Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2015). Approximately 15% of the remaining unprotected habitat occurs in collectively-owned forests. Payment for ecosystem services, which has already been shown to benefit Panda conservation under the Grain-to-Green Program, could extend conservation measures into these unprotected areas.<br/><br/>Finally, the Giant Panda has been the beneficiary of a massive scientific effort conducted in partnerships between the Chinese government and institutions and international conservation NGOs and zoos (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2010, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a, State Forestry Administration 2015). Once poorly understood, there has been an explosion of scientific studies across many disciplines, and this knowledge has increasingly been applied management and policy decisions. Future directions would benefit from even better coordination between science and policy, and the application of adaptive management principles in which experiments are conducted to evaluate management actions that may increase carrying capacity inside protected areas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a).<br/><br/>China's State Forestry Administration, while rightfully proud of its accomplishments, fully realizes that more work needs to be done to further Panda conservation and to avoid losing ground so painstakingly gained. They plant to continue investing in habitat protection, population monitoring, and protection patrols, and to further develop capacity of reserve staff (State Forestry Administration 2015). They recognize the challenges the future holds, and in particular will seek to address problems of habitat connectivity and population fragmentation.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

123791436,15953,Panthera onca,Near Threatened,A2cd,2017,2016-08-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Classify as Near Threatened, due to a suspected 20-25% decline over the past three generations (21 years) in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and habitat quality, along with actual or potential levels of exploitation. Given the inherent difficulty of assessing this species, the normally low density with which it occupies the landscape and the effects that small population and habitat degradations can have on the species, our minimum assessment of population decrease could be a significant underestimate.<br/><br/>Since the previous Red List assessment in 2008, the threats to Jaguars have continued or intensified. The first expert mapping of Jaguar range took place in 2002 (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002), and the resulting map was used for the 2008 Red List assessment. Today, more is known about Jaguar distribution and abundance, allowing us to retrospectively classify areas as Jaguar range in 2015 that were previously identified as non-range or gaps in knowledge (Supplementary Material Figure 1). The 2015 mapping exercise also reflects updates to range recommended by Jaguar experts, with sufficient evidence (i.e., tracks, camera-trap photos, sightings of live or dead animals) to warrant inclusion/exclusion of range. The updated range indicates increasing fragmentation of Jaguar populations, particularly in eastern and southeastern Brazil, northern Venezuela and the Maya Forest (Selva Maya) of Mexico and Guatemala. Comparing 2015 Jaguar range to the extent of “known” range from the 2002 exercise, thereby controlling for the difference in knowledge extent, there is a 20.0% decline in Jaguar range over the past fourteen years (2002-2015), from 8.77 million km² to 7.02 million km² (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). With a more robust range map from which to begin the next assessment, the species will likely qualify for VU in the near future.<br/><br/>With a generation length of 6.84 years, we suspect at least a 20-25% loss in mature individuals over the past 21 years (three generations) because there are documented population declines together with habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Paviolo <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Jedrzejewski <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales (de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2017a, Olsoy <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","The Jaguar has a stocky, heavy body with short massive limbs associated with reduced cursorial behaviour and dense forest habitat, and robust canines and large head allowing a more powerful bite than other large cats (Seymour 1989, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Mean body weight varies by up to 100% across their range, those living further from the equator tend to be larger (Iriarte <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1990). This extreme variation in size may reflect variation in the availability of large prey in different habitats: the largest Jaguars occur in open flood plains areas, the Llanos in Venezuela and the Pantanal in Brazil, and take the largest prey, and the smallest Jaguars inhabit the dense forest areas of Central America and Amazonia and take smaller prey (Hoogesteijn and Mondolfi 1996, Oliveira 2002).<br/><strong><br/><u>Habitat</u></strong><br/>Jaguar habitat is typically characterized by dense forest cover (mainly primary and secondary forest), the presence of water bodies and a sufficient prey base (Swank and Teer 1989, Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). However, they are found in range of habitats from rainforest to seasonally flooded swamp areas, pampas grassland, thorn scrub woodland, and dry deciduous forest (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars mainly inhabit tropical lowland forest, followed by dry tropical forest, xeric habitats and finally arable lowland pastures (Sanderson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Although Jaguars have been reported from elevations as high as 3000 m (Brown and Lopez Gonzalez 2001), they typically avoid montane forest, and have not been found in the high plateau of central Mexico or above 2700 m in the Andes (Ceballos <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>, 2011). The species is more strongly associated with water in comparison to any of the other Panthera cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), indicated by their higher densities within tropical moist forests than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest (Maffei <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Even within drier areas they are only found around the main water courses. This characteristic quickly brings them into conflict with expansion of high intensity agriculture, having the same requirements of nearby water sources for irrigation.<br/><br/><u><strong>Home range</strong></u><br/>Jaguar home ranges vary in size across their geographic range, often according to the season and availability of resources (e.g. Crawshaw and Quigley 1991, Núñez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). Generally males range further than females.<br/><br/>In the dry tropical deciduous forest of Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, female home range size ranged from 25 km² (dry season) to 60 km² (wet season) (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Nunez et al 2002). In the semi-deciduous and seasonally flooded forest of Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, Mexico, male home range size ranged from 33 to 41 km² for males and 32 to 59 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Ceballos <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>In the tropical broadleaf moist lowland secondary forest of Belize, male home range size ranged from 28 to 40 km² (radio telemetry; Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). In the mosaic landscape (secondary broadleaf forest, savannah and agriculture) of Central Belize, male home ranges ranged from 103 to 194 km² in the dry season and 179 to 386 in the wet season, and from 86 to 99 km² for a single female in the dry and wet seasons respectively (95% MCP, GPS collars, Figueroa 2013).<br/><br/>In the llanos of Venezuela, home range size ranged from 93 to 100 km² (males, dry season) and ranged from 51 to 80 km² for females in the wet season and dry season respectively (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Scognamillo <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>There are numerous studies of home ranges from the seasonally inundated landscape of the Brazilian Pantanal: females 25 to 38 km² (radio telemetry; Schaller and Crawshaw 1980), females 5km² and males 20 km² for males in the wet season, and 70 and 79km², respectively, in the dry season (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw and Quigley 1991), female 38km² and male 67km² (95% fixed kernel, radio telemetry; Azevedo and Murray 2007), 57 to 176 km² (95% MCP, GPS collars; Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006), and females 34 to 101 km² in the wet season, and 42 to 89 km² in the dry season, and males 79 to 149 km² in the wet season, and 58 to 263 km² in the dry season (90% adaptive kernel estimator, GPS collars, Cavalcanti and Gese (2009).<br/><br/>In the semi-deciduous rainforest of the Brazilian Atlantic forests, male home range size ranged from 87 to 139 km², and from 44 to 133 km² for females (95% MCP, radio telemetry; Crawshaw <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2004, Cullen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). It can be seen in the above review that the more recent studies using GPS technology show considerably larger range sizes compared to older VHF studies, this is especially indicative for recent GPS studies from areas where previously VHF studies were carried out. The differences are ranging from ~4-6 times larger. It is therefore reasonable to assume that these older ranges are considerably underrepresenting Jaguar home ranges. Densities based on these ranges are therefore equally overestimated.<br/><strong><br/><u>Diet</u></strong><br/>Jaguars are opportunistic hunters. Over 85 prey species (wild and livestock/domestic), including mammals, reptiles and birds, have been recorded in their diet across their geographic range (Seymour 1989).<br/><br/>Jaguars take a wide variety of prey species but large-sized ungulates are preferred when available (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The intake of large prey likely helps Jaguars save energy, since it is estimated that 50% of kills are larger prey on which they will feed for up to 4 days (Schaller and Crawshaw 1980, Nunez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Scognamillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Nevertheless, Jaguar diet is highly variable, depending on prey availability, ease of capture, and a variety of additional factors (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Seymour 1989). In some areas cattle (<em>Bos</em> sp.) comprise an important item in their diet (Polisar <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Palmeira <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Cavalcanti and Gese 2010). The decline of wild prey below a minimum threshold increases livestock depredation by big cats (Khorozyan <em>et al</em>. 2015), which in turn may lead to retaliatory killings of felids by livestock owners. High frequency of smaller prey species is frequently reported in Jaguar diet, e.g. armadillo (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986, Novack <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Foster <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b). The species has therefore gained a reputation of being able to persist in relatively disturbed areas with incomplete prey assemblages (Rabinowitz and Nottingham 1986). However, most diet studies rely on scat analysis. Palomares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) showed that the high majority of these scats are from males. Diet studies are therefore highly biased towards male diets. As males do not contribute anything to the rearing of young, as single individuals, they are able to sustain themselves better at a varied diet of small species. Mothers with cubs will likely require the larger ungulates but this important component of the populations is extremely poorly represented in diet studies of scats.<br/><br/><u><strong>Reproduction</strong></u><br/>There are few studies on the reproductive ecology of Jaguars in the wild. Males and females may come together for breeding opportunities at any time of the year (e.g. Cavalcanti and Gese 2009). The female is in oestrus 6-17 day period, and gestation lasts 91-101 days (in captivity), after which the female gives birth to up to four cubs, usually two, which will stay with her for up to 24 months (Mondolfi and Hoogesijn 1982, Seymour 1989, Kitchener 1991, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cubs are fully dependent on their mother’s milk for the first 10-11 weeks, and continue to suckle until 5-6 months old (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Cycling could resume 2-3 weeks following lactational anestrus (Soares <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). However, inter-birth intervals documented in the wild are approximately two years (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Carrillo <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). By 15-18 months, Jaguars travel and hunt independently within their mother’s range, although they may still come together at kill sites (Quigley and Crawshaw 2002, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Jaguars are usually independent by the age of 24 months, however the age of dispersal or the social circumstances associated with it are poorly known (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Dispersal does not appear to be linked with the onset of sexual maturity, estimated at 24-30 months for females and 36-48 months for males (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Few data are available on dispersal distances however telemetry studies in the Brazilian Pantanal suggest that males disperse further than females (Quigley and Crawshaw 1992, Quigley and Crawshaw 2002). Dispersal through human-dominated landscapes may increase the likelihood of conflict with humans, particularly in areas where the habitat is highly fragmented (e.g. Sáenz and Carrillo 2002). The maximum age of last reproduction of a female recorded in the wild is 13 years (Brown and Lopez-Gonzalez 2001).<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013). Values for age at first reproduction and longevity were agreed to by experts at the 2012 National Action Plan workshop for Jaguars in Brazil, and can be used for generation length calculations as:<br/><br/>GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR<br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs<br/>R<sub>span</sub> = 15 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 11.5 yrs<br/><br/>Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013)<br/>Thus, GL = 11.5*0.29 +3.5 = 6.84 yrs for Jaguars.","Jaguar populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010a, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press, Nijhawan <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press), killing for trophies/illegal trade in body parts, pro-active or retaliatory killings associated with livestock depredation (Zimmermann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2008, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015), and competition for wild meat with human hunters (Jorgenson and Redford 1993, Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Deforestation rates in Latin America are the highest in the world together with tropical Africa (FAO forest update, D’Annunzio <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Industrial agriculture, along with subsistence agriculture, is the most significant driver of deforestation in tropical and subtropical countries, accounting for 80% of deforestation from 2000-2010. The current contribution of agriculture to deforestation varies by region, with industrial agriculture being responsible for 30% of deforestation in Africa and Asia, but close to 70% in Latin America. The most significant agricultural drivers of deforestation include soy, palm oil, and cattle ranching, all highly prevalent throughout Latin America (http://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture). The produce is mainly used for export as raw products for developing countries, not to feed local populations. Fragmentation and displacement frequently leads to lowering of densities of Jaguars and prey in leftover forest patches due to easier access and Jaguars feeding on the replaced livestock. Jaguar-livestock conflict is a serious threat to Jaguar survival and reported throughout their range (Hoogesteijn and Hoogesteijn 2011, Quigley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Latin America is characterized by relatively low population densities with high population growth (http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/). This means that the increased agricultural expansion will likely not be used to feed the expanding population of Latin America. Increased pressure on wildlife as a food source will increase. Even in low population countries like Belize, 75% of the yearly wildlife offtake can be attributed to humans, while Jaguars only account for 25% (Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Increases in human population within these thinly populated countries means, increased fragmentation for agriculture, industry and urbanization necessary for sustaining the increased number of people, making the wildlife easier accessible for hunting. The greater need for food and potential increase in wealth for a proportion of the population means increased commercialization and increased prizes for wildlife game species, which are all Jaguar prey species.<br/><br/>Habitat loss is reducing and isolating Jaguar populations range wide (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Paviolo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de la Torre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2017). Jaguars have lost about 49% of their historic geographic range (Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em>et al.</em> 2016; current assessment). The white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) an important Jaguar prey (e.g. Foster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010b), has been extirpated from 21% of its historical range during the past century and changed from NT to VU under the latest IUCN assessment (Altrichter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Keuroghlian <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Jaguars have become extinct in El Salvador, Uruguay, and the United States (where there are still periodic individuals present as presumed dispersers from Mexico) (TSJRT 2012, Campbell 2015). There are documented population declines and habitat loss for most of the range countries (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Costa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013b, Wallace <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Espinosa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, García-Anleu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, González-Maya <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Hoogesteijn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Maffei <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Mora <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moreno <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Olsoy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, de Azevedo <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Díaz-Santos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Connectivity among Jaguar populations is being lost at local and regional scales. For example, the connectivity of Jaguar habitat between Honduras and Guatemala is almost gone; similar losses have been documented across the Chaco, Iguazu and Atlantic Forest, and between Tamaulipas and Veracruz (Haag <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Isolated populations have fewer individuals and are more prone to local extinctions (Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press). Many Jaguar populations require connectivity between core sites to survive in the long term and these connectivity corridors are most of the time outside protected areas, and therefore vulnerable to human impacts (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010, Bernal-Escobar <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Even in nominally protected areas, Jaguars often suffer from human impacts such as illegal hunting (Quigley and Crawshaw Jr 1992, Medellín <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Sollmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Ceballos <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011, Payán <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013a, Petracca <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>The vulnerability of the Jaguar to persecution is demonstrated by its disappearance by the mid-1800 from Uruguay (Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016), El Salvador and by the mid-1900's from the south-western US (Johnson and Van Pelt 2016). Disappearance from these countries catches the current trends in a nutshell. These countries were the first areas to show rapid population increase with large scale land conversion. Retaliatory killing of the remaining exposed Jaguars led to their extinction. These processes are now taking place on a continental scale and therefore there are few areas within Jaguar range that can be considered safe. With limited technological expansion in the region, the main source of income will be industrial agriculture. With every (local) economic crisis, it means that the last Jaguar strongholds will be eroded further. Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, there is still demand for Jaguar paws, teeth and other products, especially in local markets where canines are still considered interesting jewellery. On top of this, Jaguars are starting to be considered a replacement for tiger bone for traditional medicine purposes by the increasing Asian community in Latin America.","<u><strong>Historic assessment of Jaguar viability </strong></u><br/><strong>High chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that populations in 70% of the Jaguar range (over 6 million km²) had a high probability for survival. Most of that area consists of the Amazon Basin rainforest, and adjoining areas of the Pantanal and Gran Chaco (Torres <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Other areas considered by Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) to have a high probability for long-term Jaguar persistence included tropical moist lowland forest in Mesoamerica (the Selva Maya of Guatemala, Mexico and Belize) and a narrow strip of the Choco-Darien of Panama and Colombia to northern Honduras.<br/><br/><strong>Medium chance of survival: </strong>Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) estimated that Jaguar populations in 18% of the Jaguar range (1.6 million km²) had a medium probability of long-term survival. These areas are generally adjacent to the areas considered to have a high-probability probability of survival and include a large portion of the northern Cerrado, most of the Venezuelan and Colombian llanos, and the northern part of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. In Central America and Mexico, they include the highlands of Costa Rica and Panama, southern Mexico, and the two eastern mountain ranges of Mexico, Sierra de Taumalipas and the Sierra Madre Oriental.<br/><br/><strong>Low chance of survival:</strong> Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2002) classified the remainder of Jaguar range (12%) as having a low probability for Jaguar survival, and of most urgent conservation concern. These areas include the Atlantic Tropical Forest and Cerrado of Brazil; parts of the Chaco in northern Argentina; the Gran Sabana of northern Brazil, Venezuela and Guyana; parts of the coastal dry forest in Venezuela; and the remaining range in Central America and Mexico.<br/><br/><strong><u>Current assessment of Jaguar populations</u></strong><br/><strong>Mexico</strong>: Jaguar densities in Mexico have been estimated from 0.75 to 6 adults per 100 km² (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Chávez <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2016). The Jaguar population in the Selva Maya in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico was estimated in 2000 individuals (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Rodriguez-Soto <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). In the Greater Lacadona Ecosystem in southern Mexico, Jaguar density was estimated at 1.7-4.6/100 km², with an estimated population of 62 to 168 Jaguars within the protected areas of this region (de la Torre and Medellín 2011). Overall, Mexico’s national Jaguar census estimated at 4,000-5,000 individuals in 2011 (Ceballos <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press). The northern and central areas of Mexico are however becoming increasingly isolated with Jaguars disappearing where they were previously still detected (Grigione <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Rosas-Rosas and Bender 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Central America</strong>: Estimates of Jaguar density from Mesoamerica from 27 studies conducted from 2000 to 2010 range from 0.74 to 11.2 /100 km², however most of the studies did not cover the minimum area to ensure unbiased density estimates (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Nevertheless, across these sites density estimates were higher in tropical moist forest than in tropical montane forest or deciduous forest, and higher in national parks compared to those from other multiple use areas (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Densities in the Belizean Selva Maya rainforest were estimated at 7.5-8.8/100 km² (Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). Jaguar density estimates in the protected lowland moist tropical forest of the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize range from 3.5 (+/- SE = 0.7) to 11.0 (+/- 3.1)/100 km² (Harmsen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Jaguar density was found to decline across the human-influenced landscape, a mosaic of unprotected forest, savannah, agriculture and settlements with distance from the protected forest (Foster 2008). The Talamanca Mountains of Costa Rica and Panama support a Jaguar population, but the probability of long-term persistence is medium to low (Gonzalez-Maya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007). Similarly the Jaguar populations located in protected areas in Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua are under a great pressure from deforestation and hunting (Petracca <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>South America</strong>: Jaguar density in the Brazilian Pantanal has been estimated as 6.6-6.7 /100 km², or 10.3-11.7/100 km² depending on the method used (telemetry versus camera traps, respectively, Soislao and Cavalcanti (2006). In the Bolivian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 2.8/100 km² (Madidi National Park Silver <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004), and in the Colombian Amazon, Jaguar density was estimated at 4.5/100 km² and 2.5/100 km² (Amacayacu National Park and unprotected areas respectively; Payan 2008). Estimates of Jaguar density are 2/100 km² in the savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado, 3.5/100 km² in the semiarid scrub of the Caatinga, and 2.2/100 km² in the Atlantic Forest (Silveira 2004), and 2.2-5 per 100 km² in the Bolivian Gran Chaco (Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004). The Atlantic Forest subpopulation in Brazil has been estimated at 200+/- 80 adults (Leite <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002). Jaguar populations in the Chaco region of northern Argentina and Brazil, and the Brazilian Caatinga, are low-density and highly threatened by livestock ranching and persecution (Altrichter <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006, T. de Oliveira pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/><u><strong>Historic methodological biases</strong></u><br/>Unfortunately, many of these reported density estimates have inadequate sample sizes of area or capture and recaptures. Careful reviews have shown that these estimates tend to be biased positively rather than negatively (Foster and Harmsen 2012, Maffei <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011, Tobler and Powell 2013). This means that many of the older publications from before 2010 tended to overestimate densities at an unknown quantity. It also means that previous assessments have been overly optimistic about Jaguar status throughout their range.<br/><br/><u><strong>Subpopulation status</strong></u><br/>De la Torre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2017) identified 34 Jaguar subpopulations where there is little likelihood of demographic or genetic exchange, and assessed each against Red List criteria. Overall, 97% met the criteria for Critically Endangered (25 subpopulations) or Endangered (eight subpopulations) (see Figure 3a-e in the Supplementary Material). The large Amazonia subpopulation, estimated to hold 89% of the total species population (57,000 out of 64,000), was assessed as Least Concern.",Decreasing,"The Jaguar is the largest cat of the Americas, and the only living representative of the genus <em>Panthera </em>in the New World (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Historically it ranged from the southwestern US (where there are still some vagrants close to the Mexican border) through the Amazon basin to the Rio Negro in Argentina (McCain and Childs 2008, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Its extent of occurrence (EOO) (updated with the collaboration of 44 experts—see the lists of Assessors and Contributors and the Assessment Rationale section for a thorough description) is estimated at 9.02 million km², with its stronghold the rainforest of the Amazon basin, which comprises 57% of its total EOO. The Jaguar has been virtually eliminated from much of the drier northern parts of its range—Arizona and New Mexico in the United States, and extreme northern Sonora state in Mexico—( Johnson and Van Pelt 2016), as well as northern Brazil, the pampas scrub grasslands of Argentina and throughout Uruguay (de Azevedo <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Di Bitetti <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, Pereira-Garbero and Sappa 2016). In 2002, Jaguars were estimated to occupy only about 46% of its historic range (Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). With our improved knowledge of Jaguar range (see the Assessment Rationale and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material), this percentage is set at 51% currently.<br/><br/>Sanderson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2002) defined the most important areas for conservation of viable Jaguar populations (Jaguar Conservation Units or JCUs). These 51 areas cover 44.49 million km², or 49% of Jaguar range according to present calculations.","Commercial hunting and trapping of Jaguars for their pelts has declined drastically since the mid-1970s, when anti-fur campaigns and CITES controls progressively shut down international markets (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, there is still demand for Jaguar paws, teeth and other products, especially in local markets where canines are still considered interesting jewellery. On top of this, Jaguars are starting to be considered a replacement for tiger bone for traditional medicine purposes by the increasing Asian community in Latin America.",Terrestrial,"Included on CITES Appendix I. The Jaguar is fully protected at the national level across most of its range, with hunting prohibited in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, United States, and Venezuela, and hunting restrictions in place in Guatemala and Peru (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Specific conservation plans for the species have been developed in Mexico, Panama, Honduras, and Brazil. <br/><br/>With habitat fragmentation a major threat, and taxonomic research suggesting little significant differences among Jaguar populations, an ambitious program has been launched to conserve a continuous north to south habitat corridor through the species range (Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010).<br/><br/>Addressing livestock management and animals that prey on livestock is a high priority for conservation efforts in many Jaguar range countries due to the impact of retaliatory killing of Jaguars and other predators.<br/><br/><strong><u>Jaguar Conservation Actions</u><br/></strong>The following is a list of actions that a variety of Jaguar range countries have put in place to enhance Jaguar conservation. <br/><ol><li>Respond to reports of livestock depredation, and provide advice and assistance to improve livestock management practices, thereby reducing depredation and associated retaliatory killings of Jaguars; </li><li>Understand and address the hunting of Jaguar prey for sport, commercial and subsistence uses, and raise awareness about the laws governing the hunting of wildlife and the need for adopting sustainable hunting practices;</li><li>Monitor and safe-guarding Jaguar core populations, Jaguar Conservation Units, or JCUs (see Rabinowitz and Zeller 2010);</li><li>Maintain national and regional population connectivity through the identification of corridors for Jaguar movement between JCUs and applying conservation actions in those corridors through the engagement of corridor stakeholders as in the development of a Conservation Action Plan for the Central Belize Corridor (Kay <em>et al.</em> 2015);</li><li>Develop national, regional and local monitoring programs for Jaguars and their prey.</li></ol>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Swe (2004) observed a mean clutch size of 4.4 eggs, and females deposited one to six clutches each season (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018).

Juveniles are in especially high demand in the pet trade, whilst larger adults enter food and medicinal markets. Although harvesting has declined dramatically recently, due to the extirpation of wild populations, continued commercial demand poses a serious impediment to reintroduction into the wild (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2011).

An attempt in 2007 to reintroduce <em>G. platynota</em> into Minsontaung was unsuccessful, with all tortoises poached, or disappearing within six months (Platt<em> et al</em>. 2011). A licensed commercial captive breeding operation exists in Bagan, however, there are no exports currently from this facility following the CITES Appendix I listing.<br/><br/>Captive breeding of the species has been greatly successful. From 2008–2016 three assurance colonies in Myanmar increased at an annual rate of 37% (Platt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;In mid-October 2016, the total captive population of&#160;<em>G. platynota&#160;</em>in Myanmar was 7,150 individuals with an additional &gt;1,000 eggs incubating (Platt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).

Recent satellite telemetry and stable isotope data support earlier work (Allan 1994) that shows Ludwig’s Bustard to be nomadic and a partial migrant (Shaw 2013, Shaw &amp; Ryan 2015), moving to the western winter-rainfall part of its range in winter.  The breeding season spans from August-December, with the species nesting on bare ground with a clutch of 2-3 eggs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Jenkins and Smallie 2009)<strong></strong>. Chick-rearing is conducted solely by females (Jenkins and Smallie 2009)<strong></strong>. The diet includes invertebrates, some small vertebrates and vegetable matter, including the berries of <em>Lycium oxycladum</em>. There is strong evidence that the species undergoes movement with rains in pursuit of Orthoptera hatchlings, though vegetation remains important (Allan 1994). Flocks of up to 70 individuals have been recorded (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","The primary threat to the species is collisions with overhead power lines, with potentially thousands of individuals involved in such collisions each year (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Anderson 2002, Jenkins and Smallie 2009, Jenkins 2009, Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011, Shaw 2013)<strong></strong>. Bustards have limited frontal vision so may not see power lines, even if they are marked (Martin and Shaw 2010). Collision rates on high voltage transmission lines in the De Aar area of the Karoo may exceed one Ludwig's Bustard per kilometre per year (Anderson 2002, Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>, and there is evidence for this level of mortality on transmission lines across the Karoo, indicating that the problem is widespread (Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011, Shaw 2013)<strong></strong>. Given that the extent of power lines in the Karoo is vast and expanding (Jenkins and Smallie 2009, J. Smallie <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>, with already over 17,000 km in place, it is estimated that such collisions alone are already enough to cause a rapid decline which may intensify in the future (Jenkins <em>et al. </em><em></em>2011). Recent surveys on the more prolific low voltage lines have also revealed substantial levels of mortality (Shaw 2013), and in addition to power lines wind farms are currently establishing in many parts of the Karoo.

A recent repeat of this census (2010-2012) in the South African part of the range estimated the current South African population at 114,000 birds (95% CI 87,000-148,000) (Shaw <em>et al.</em> 2015), and so the total population is inferred to fall within the range of 100,000-499,999 individuals. While there is therefore no clear evidence that the population has declined as projected (Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2011), there is not enough information with which to understand the trend; Allan’s (1994) estimate was probably a significant underestimate, and the confidence intervals of the current estimate are very wide.

The most southerly populations often breed a little earlier in July-August <strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). During the non-breeding season the species is fairly congregatory, occurring regularly in flocks of 10-50 individuals (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>, and there are reports of flocks of up to 1,000 in the Okavango Delta in April-May (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <strong>Habitat </strong>In South Africa this species was found to occupy large home ranges of approximately 16 km<sup>2</sup>, which consist largely (75%) of grassland with a small core of essential wetland breeding habitat <strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>McCann and Benn 2006).<strong> </strong><em>Breeding </em>It nests in shallow sedge-dominated wetlands, often above 2,000 m altitude (<strong></strong>del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>.

It frequents dambos (depressions), permanently isolated wetlands (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006) and vleis<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>) as well as using grasslands, pastures, and occasionally cultivated fields for foraging (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Dams and pans are used as roosting sites during the non-breeding season (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Ethiopian population is less dependent on wetlands during this season, generally moving to drier, lower elevation habitats including ploughed fields<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996).

It will also take animals including small aquatic snails, fish and frogs<strong> </strong>(Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Chicks are reported to eat insects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>).<strong> Breeding site </strong>Preferred nesting sites are where grass and sedge marshes are bordered by drier, flat to sloping grassland meadows, with medium height vegetation and water up to 1 m in depth (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

Nest destruction through trampling by livestock is believed to be a problem<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The population is threatened by the illegal removal of eggs and chicks for international trade<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). Adults are also taken for trade and are hunted<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The level of exports from Tanzania is believed to exceed known legal exports<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The destruction of vegetation by fires probably leaves adults more susceptible to predation and hunting, and flood levels in turn influence the extent and intensity of fires (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Recent potential threats that could extensively affect a large portion of the Okavango Delta include the proposed hydroelectric scheme at Popa Falls in Namibia, papyrus cutting, channel modification, and the extensive aerial spraying of pesticide to eradicate the tsetse fly<strong> </strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The extent of suitable breeding habitat in the Zambezi Delta (Mozambique) and Kafue Flats (Zambia) and the suitability of remaining habitat for feeding is believed to have declined as a result of the interruption of the natural flooding regime by the Cahora Bassa (Tete province), Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe), and Itezhi-tezhi (Zambia) dams upstream, and hunting is also a threat in this country<strong> </strong>(Parker 2005, Bento <em>et al</em>. 2007). Breeding success appears to be low in the species<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b).<strong> </strong>A pre-fledging chick:adult ratio of 5.8% on the Okavango Delta in January 2003 indicates a low chick survival rate<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock 2003). However, each pair of this long-lived species needs to raise only two chicks that survive to adulthood over the course of their lifetimes for the population to remain stable<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The species is highly sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon home ranges which are impacted by adjacent land-use (Morrison and Bothma 1998).   <br/><p></p>","Its present world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals (Pittman 2007) or fewer (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), fewer than 8,000 individuals (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100, placed in the range 9,000-10,000. This increase though may not be a true increase in the population and further research to better understand the movements between the key flood plains in south-central Africa and the seasonal movements whereby cranes come together in large flocks in the drier season needs to be explored further (Morrison in press). This estimate roughly equates to 6,000-6,300 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Bugeranus carunculatus</em> is found in <strong>Ethiopia, </strong>(c.200 [Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2003, 2007]), <strong>Tanzania</strong> (c.200 [Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003]), <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong> (probably around 500 [Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007]), <strong>Zambia</strong> (c.4,500 [Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007]), <strong>Angola</strong> (c.500, perhaps declining<strong><sup> </sup></strong>[W.

The total population appeared stable from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996), however when estimates from the 1980s are compared with those from 2006, it is judged to have declined significantly<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), perhaps indicating declines in the last 10 years. The key Zambian population at the Kafue Flats reportedly fell in the mid-1990s (Archibald and Meine 1996, Burke 1996) and was estimated at c.1,000 individuals in 2002<strong> </strong>(Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002), but may now be as high as around 2,900 individuals (Shunangu <em>et al. </em>2015). Significant populations elsewhere in Zambia include the Liuwa Plains (1,900 individuals [Viljoen 2015]) and the Bangweulu Swamps (African Parks Foundation pers. comm.<em> </em>to K. Morrison 2016). The Okavango Delta in Botswana also holds a significant population, of between 1,200 and 1,300 birds (Hancock 2008). The comparison of 2002 estimates with those from 1993 suggests marked declines in Mozambique, Zambia and possibly Botswana (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The substantial reduction in numbers since 1993 apparently reflects real declines at individual sites and regions, although the 2002 estimate may be influenced by an improvement in accuracy relative to previous estimates (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007) or fewer<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), not more than 8,000 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals<strong> </strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100 (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). It exists in three disjunct populations, the large south-central population and small Ethiopian and South African populations<strong> </strong>(Jones <em>et al.</em> 2006, Pittman 2007), which may be relicts from its former range<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. Protected areas (including Ramsar Sites) have been established in several key wetlands, notably in Zambia, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996; T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000; T. Fakarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). A major environmental flows initiative is underway for the Zambezi River basin, addressing the restoration of natural flooding patterns, conservation of basin wetlands, and control of invasive species in the Zambezi River basin (Beilfuss and Brown 2010).&#160; Key wetlands targeted by the program include the Kafue Flats, Zambezi Delta, Liuwa Plain, Busanga Swamps, and others, covering about 40% of the global Wattled Crane population. The initiative is a partnership between Zambezi basin dam operators and water authories, NGOs (World Wide Fund for Nature, International Crane Foundation), universities in the basin countries, and other stakeholders. In South Africa, and some other countries, action has included legal protection, marking and relocation of powerlines, awareness programmes, and encouragement of habitat protection, security and management by private landowners (Archibald and Meine 1996, Barnes 2000<strong>,</strong> Burke 1996). In the Kafue Flats, more than 800 ha of invasive <em>Mimosa pigra</em> was eradicated through aerial spraying and community-involvement in manual cutting (Shanungu 2009), although much of this has regrown due to a lack of follow up action (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). A conservation group conducted aerial surveys, field research and a community awareness programme in the Kafue Flats (Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002). Aerial surveys, nest monitoring<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Motsumi and Hancock 2004a, Nkape 2004) and monitoring of adult:juvenile ratios<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b) took place annually on the Okavango Delta in the early 2000s. Surveys and monitoring occur in several countries in south-central Africa (Zambia [International Crane Foundation (ICF) / Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) Partnership, in partnership with the Zambian Department of National Parks and Wildlife; African Parks Foundation], Zimbabwe [BirdLife Zimbabwe], Namibia [Namibia Crane Working Group], South Africa [ICF/EWT Partnership; Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, in partnership with the Endangered Wildlife Trust; KwaZulu-Natal Crane Foundation]), and also aim to drive more awareness amongst local communities (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 1993, an action plan was developed for the species at the African Crane and Wetland Training Workshop (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 1996). A continent-wide programme for the species was launched in 2001 to monitor the species's status and threats, and help develop effective conservation programmes for the management of wetland systems<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). National conservation plans have been developed for Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Following a workshop in July 2000, the Wattled Crane Recovery Programme was initiated for the South African population<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Pittman 2007). There are currently five partners in this South African programme, one aim of which is to establish a viable captive population and supplement the wild population (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2012). The Johannesburg Zoo has also built a dedicated chick-rearing facility, and several captive management facilities throughout South Africa now participate in the breeding programme<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). In 2005, it was announced that a veterinary fence would be constructed to the east of the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park in Botswana, effectively extending the park boundary and protecting grasslands used by the species from the high density of livestock in the area<strong> </strong>(BirdLife Botswana 2006).

Improve protection of birds outside of protected areas such as the Jao/Boro rivers of Botswana<strong> </strong>(Gibson <em>et al</em>. 2002). Increase educational campaigns (A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998), targeting landowners with breeding cranes,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>as well policy makers (Burke 1996, T. Fokarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). Employ satellite tracking to study the species's movements across its range (BirdLife Botswana Crane Working Group 2004, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). In South Africa, work with farming communities to conserve natural grasslands that surround wetlands<strong> (</strong>McCann and Benn 2006).

Proposed large-scale soda ash extraction at Lake Natron, the most important breeding colony, although currently on hold, would be disastrous for this species and, were this to happen, the species may qualify for uplisting to a higher threat category. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is itinerant and makes extensive movements in response to environmental conditions (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Borello <em>et al.</em> 1998, L.

The species breeds in huge colonies of many thousands of pairs, often mixed with Greater Flamingo <em>Phoenicopterus roseus<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span></em>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<em></em><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>. The timing of breeding is irregular and varies geographically, depending on the timing of the rains, with individual adults often not breeding annually (Brown <em>et al</em>. 1982), but it has been suggested that breeding failures (possibly over 10 or more years) may have no effect on the overall population dynamics (Parasharya <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The species is an obligate filter feeder and feeds during the night and early morning when the surface of the water is calm, primarily by swimming and filtering the algae near the surface with a specialised bill that contains up to 10,000 microscopic lamellae<strong> </strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). When necessary, the species forms large dense feeding flocks that create calm water for feeding near the centre of the flock<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat </strong>The species breeds on large undisturbed alkaline and saline lakes, salt pans or coastal lagoons, usually far out from the shore, after seasonal rains have provided the flooding necessary to isolate remote breeding sites from terrestrial predators and the soft muddy material for nest building<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Brown and Root 1971, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, McCulloch and Irvine 2004)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/></strong><strong>Diet </strong>It has a highly specialised diet consisting almost entirely of microscopic blue-green algae (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Spirulina</span> spp., <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Oscillatoria</span> spp. and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lyngbya</span> spp.) and benthic diatoms (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Navicula</span> spp., Bacillariophyceae) found only in alkaline lakes, salt pans and saline lagoons and estuaries<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992).

Proposed soda-ash mining and hydroelectric power schemes affecting the main breeding site, Lake Natron in Tanzania, although currently put on hold, could cause rapid overall population declines owing to disturbance and the introduction of an alien brine shrimp to clean the soda of algae (the species's food)<strong> </strong>(L. Bennun <em>in litt.</em> 1999). In 2008, these proposals were still on hold, but had not been withdrawn (Anderson 2008). Other threats include land-claim, water pollution, and collisions with electric wires (NamPower/ Namibia Nature Foundation Strategic Partnership 2010, Tere and Parasharya 2011). There are fears that the population at Lake Bogoria is suffering from malnutrition (R. E. Simmons <em>in litt.</em> 1998, S. J. Tyler <em>in litt.</em> 1999, <strong></strong>D.

Recent increases in the east of its range are so far unquantified and require further study.<br/><p></p>","This species inhabits dry grassland and, in Europe, it also occurs in areas of low-intensity arable cultivation and pastoral land, selecting areas with a high diversity of ground cover such as mosaics of pasture, stubble fields, long-rotation fallow land, legume and cereal crops (Morales <em>et al</em>. 2013, Santos <em>et al. </em>2016). It prefers large fields in areas with high plant species richness providing high arthropod abundance, which is important for male displaying and female breeding sites (Silva <em>et al. </em>2010, Faria <em>et al. </em>2012, Silva<em> et al. </em>2014). Males display at lek sites, and females may breed close to the lek sites (Tarjuelo <em>et al. </em>2013). In Spain, early-laid clutches have a greater chance of success, possibly associated with different ranging patterns, which depend on arthropod availability (Lapiedra <em>et al. </em>2011).

Wintering birds in Azerbaijan prefer semi-desert and steppe areas under winter pasturing, and avoid areas of intensive agriculture (Gauger 2007)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","The primary cause of its decline has been conversion of dry grassland and low-intensity cultivation to intensive arable agriculture, especially where this has included the planting of monocultures or perennial crops, irrigation or afforestation.

Whilst it remains widespread and numerous, in some parts of its range it has declined dramatically since the 19th century, leading to extinctions in at least 11 European countries, Algeria, Tunisia and probably as a breeding bird in Azerbaijan.

It shows high resilience to heavy deforestation and degradation in some areas (F. Dowsett-Lemaire<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2012), although such changes are assumed to cause local declines in population density. The use of exotic invasive trees (especially <em>Eucalyptus</em> and <em>Pinus</em> spp.) for nesting permits persistence in degraded and mosaic landscapes (McPherson <em>et al. </em>2016a). In South Africa there may have been a 14% decline in range over the past c.25 years, using data from the Southern African Bird Atlas Projects (Cooper 2015). It shows dietary plasticity and can feed on a diversity of prey (although maybe almost entirely mammals [Swatridge <em>et al. </em>2014]) according to habitat type, which may allow it to persist in certain areas; and mesopredator release in some modified habitats may provide extra prey for this species allowing it to occur at higher densities than expected (see Swartridge <em>et al. </em>2014, Symes and Antonites 2014, McPherson <em>et al. </em>2016b, C. Symes <em>in litt. </em>2016).","Although the species is welcomed by foresters in some areas, it is subjected to a number of significant threats throughout much of its range, including deforestation (carried out for timber extraction, charcoal production, the encroachment of agriculture and plantations, shifting cultivation and mining), collisions with anthropogenic structures (wires, fences, vehicles, glass buildings, wind turbines) and electrocution on utility networks (S. McPherson <em>in litt. </em>2016, B. Reeves <em>in litt. </em>2016), competition from humans for prey species (with apparently unsustainable levels of exploitation for bushmeat in some areas), direct persecution in an estimated 90% of its range (e.g. for food, arrow-fletching, witchcraft, ornaments and its pest status and threat to humans) and human disturbance (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005, Thomsett 2011, McPherson 2015). Conflict with humans can arise because this species will take small amounts of livestock and pets (McPherson <em>et al. </em>2016b). In Ghana, it is threatened by deforestation and hunting, including of its main prey (F. Dowsett-Lemaire <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Some once-occupied areas in Ghana have now been almost totally deforested, whilst others, such as Bosomoa Forest Reserve, have been converted to teak plantations (F. Dowsett-Lemaire <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The species may have altered its diet to partly accommodate declines in primate abundance in parts of Ghana, but its population is unlikely not to have been affected by such a dramatic decline in its prey base (which has probably worsened further since the mid-1990s) (B. Phalan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012).  Although the species appears to be doing well at Udzungwa, Tanzania, it  may be absent as a breeding species from several areas (e.g. Uzungwa  scarp, Kising’a-Rugaro, New Dabaga), owing to prey depletion by humans  (T. Jones <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). In Nigeria, it seems likely that the population has been impacted by widespread forest clearance in the south of the country (P. Hall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). In South Africa, wind turbines are becoming more of a threat to this species, with several reported casualties (B. Reeves <em>in litt.</em> 2016).","Ferguson-Lees and Christie (2001) estimate that total the population could number in the upper thousands, although given its range this is perhaps likely to be an underestimate and they also state that, for this reason, an estimate of tens of thousands might be expected. On this basis, the population is estimated at 5,000-50,000 mature individuals until better information becomes available.",Decreasing,"<em>Stephanoaetus coronatus</em> is a widespread resident of sub-Saharan Africa, occurring in easternmost <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sudan</span> and<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> South Sudan</span>, western <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ethiopia</span>, southernmost <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Senegal</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Guinea-Bissau</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Guinea</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Liberia</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">C</span>ô<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">te d'Ivoire</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ghana</span> and southern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Togo</span>, southern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nigeria</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cameroon</span>, through <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Gabon</span>, into <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Congo</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Democratic Republic of Congo</span>, south to north-western <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Angola</span>, east to <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uganda</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Kenya</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tanzania</span>, south-east through <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Zambia</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Malawi</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mozambique</span>, to northern and eastern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Zimbabwe</span>, north-eastern, eastern and south-eastern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">South Africa</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Swaziland</span> (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species's range in Malawi is regarded as certainly decreasing, and habitat clearance there is expected to be impacting the species (Dowsett-Lemaire and Dowsett 2006). It has also declined in southern Mozambique owing to forest destruction along the coast (Parker 1999). The negative effects of habitat loss in South Africa are regarded as being partly offset by the establishment of exotic plantations (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005 and references therein), and afforestation of urban greenspace in affluent city suburbs (McPherson <em>et al. </em>2016a).

It therefore qualifies as Critically Endangered.  <p></p> <p></p>","It inhabits lowland dry, or seasonally inundated, natural and semi-natural grasslands, often interspersed with scattered scrub or patchy open forest. Some Indian populations appear to be resident, but the species may make short distance movements away from breeding areas with the arrival of the monsoon as vegetation becomes too dense for it (R. Jha <em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). These movements may take the species into areas of low human density with short-grazed grasslands and low-intensity agriculture (A. Rahmani and R. Jha <em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). In Cambodia, the species is known to make relatively local seasonal movements in response to the flooding regime of the Tonle Sap lake: in the dry season, the species breeds in grasslands in the inundation zone of the lake and then moves to nearby agricultural and degraded deciduous dipterocarp forest during the wet season (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016). During the breeding season, males preferentially select habitats related to low-intensity human activity, chiefly burned grassland, whereas females primarily select unburned grassland, but also use unburned, uncultivated grassland in dry-season rice head-ponds (Gray<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2009), although anecdotal evidence suggests that eggs are laid in small pockets of medium to tall grass in recently burnt areas (R. van Zalinge <em>pers. obs.</em>).<br/><p></p>","In South Asia, most populations are small, isolated and vulnerable to local extirpation. The key threats are the extensive loss and modification of grasslands through drainage, conversion to agriculture and plantations, overgrazing, inappropriate cutting, burning and ploughing regimes, heavy flooding, invasion of alien species, scrub expansion, dam construction and inappropriate and illegal development (Brahma and Lahkar 2009, Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Ibbett <em>et al. </em>2017). In particular, the spread of dry season rice cultivation in Cambodia is rapidly converting existing grassland habitat (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). An increase in the area of scrub vegetation between 1995/1996 and 2005 was responsible for 65% of grassland loss in Cambodia (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2013). Land sales and concessions are often pushed through despite resistance from local villagers (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Excessive hunting for sport and food may have triggered the species's decline, but owing to advocacy and law enforcement this is no longer a serious threat, at least in Cambodia. Other threats may include human disturbance and trampling of nests by livestock. Detailed research into the species's ecology in Cambodia demonstrated that the effects of human disturbance are weak and annual burning is important for maintaining suitable habitat, supporting the idea that community-based grassland management that maintains traditional agricultural practices will benefit the species. This has implications for management in South Asia, where remaining (and declining) populations are largely confined to strictly protected areas in which such practices may not be occurring (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Further study has revealed that, whilst burned grassland is selected by males during the breeding season, unburned grassland and other habitats providing cover are selected by females, demonstrating the need for management that provides a variety of habitats (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009b). Proposed development of powerlines in Cambodia could prove to be a significant emerging threat to the species there (Mahood <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><p></p>","The population in Cambodia was estimated at 294 displaying males or c. 600 individuals in 2009 (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2009a), but recently an extensive survey has reported a total of only 432 individuals (95% CI 312-550) (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). 75-96 individuals remain in Nepal (Baral<em> et al. </em>2013). No recent total population estimates are known from India, but &gt;100 males were recorded in the country in recent surveys, with the population in D'Ering Wildlife Sanctuary potentially holding 50-60 territorial males (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). Given these estimates, the total global population for this species is tentatively placed in the range 250-999 mature individuals. This equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species&#160;has two disjunct populations, one in the Indian Subcontinent, the other in South-East Asia (BirdLife International 2001). The former occurs from Uttar Pradesh, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>, through the terai of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nepal</span>, to Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, India, and historically to <strong>Bangladesh</strong>. It has declined dramatically and only survives in small, highly fragmented populations; although modelling work suggests that there are large areas of suitable habitat that could contain larger populations, especially in areas around the Brahmaputra River (Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). Declines have apparently continued even inside protected areas e.g. Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, Dudhwa and&#160;Pilibhit parks, India&#160;(Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, R. Jha&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016). Surveys and interviews with staff at four protected areas in the North Bank area of Assam suggest that the species has been largely absent from three of them since 2000 (Brahma and Lahkar 2009).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Recent surveys in Assam, India (2014-2016), found 33 adult territorial males in Manas Tiger Reserve, 32 adult males in Kaziranga National Park, 10 territorial males in Orang National Park, and 4-6 birds in Laokhawa-Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). Additionally, island surveys of the Brahmaputra River in 2015 revealed the presense of 5-6 birds in as many river islands, while 12-15 adult male birds were found on the Sadia plains and river islands (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Arunachal Pradesh, 5-7 male floricans were seen in a private grassland in Nizambhat, and a new population with up to 29 territorial males was found in April-June survey in 2016 in D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary in East Siang District (Rahmani 2016). It is estimated that 60-70 territorial males could be present in D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary, making it one of the most important areas for <span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">floricans in India (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Uttar Pradesh, India, the numbers appears to have declined, as only 8 territorial males were seen in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, down from 24 seen in 2001, while a small population of 5-6 males was found in Pilibhet Tiger Reserve. As females are extremely difficult to see, their number was not recorded as part of these surveys.&#160;An estimate from 2007 put the Nepalese population at just 28-36 mature individuals (restricted to a few widespread sites) (Poudyal 2007), down from 32-60 individuals in 2001. Recent intensive survey effort in Nepal has recorded 47 individuals in and around Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, including 14 birds outside any protected area and an estimate of 60 individuals in total (Baral <em>et al. </em>2013). This is almost double the numbers from a survey of the area in 2012 when around 12 pairs were estimated (Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012), but this is due to a more rigorous survey methodology (Baral <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;This is the largest population in Nepal (Baral <em>et al. </em>2013) and, if numbers from the 2007 survey are still accurate, this would put the total number of mature individuals in Nepal at 75-96.&#160;<br/>The South-East Asian population occurs in <strong>Cambodia</strong> and may be extant in southern <strong>Vietnam</strong>. The population in the Tonle Sap region, which supports the vast majority of the population of Cambodia, was estimated at between 312 and 550 based on surveys in 2012, with only 216 displaying males recorded (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013, Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). This represents a 44% decrease from the previous survey in 2005, and a minimum of 294 displaying males had been recorded in 2007 (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009a). If the population continues to decline at the current rate, it may become extinct in Cambodia within 10 years (Packman <em>et al</em>. 2014). More than 80% of the Cambodian population occurs on seasonally inundated grasslands within Kompong Thom province (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016). This estimate, based on the extent of available habitat in 2005 and known habitat loss between 2005 and 2007, represents a rapid decline owing to habitat loss, from a projected 3,000 individuals in 1997 (T. Gray, T. Evans and H. Chamnan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2006). Given accelerating post-2005 grassland loss of 28% within 10 grassland blocks holding 75% of the estimated population (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a), and a further 11% of habitat lost in four protected areas in 2008 (Evans <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009), projected rates of decline will equate to over 80% during a three generation period (T. Gray, T. Evans and H. Chamnan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2006). Recent assessment of habitat loss indicates that it has indeed been widespread and extensive between 2005 and 2012, and a number of sites identified as having blocks of grassland in excess of 10 square kilometers now contain little or no grassland (C. Packman <em>in litt.</em> 2013). Stoung-Chikreang BFCA and unprotected grasslands at Sankor support the highest populations (45 and 69 displaying males respectively in 2014), but estimates vary from year to year and population of the two sites is probably 100-150 displaying males (S. Mahood <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Annual monitoring of Bengal Florican populations in Bengal Florican Conservation Areas (BFCAs) and adjacent areas in Cambodia during March-April 2008-2016 indicates that whilst populations in some protected areas are stable, in other locations population declines are ongoing. Outside of protected areas there is very little suitable grassland habitat remaining (Mahood<em> et al.</em> 2012). <br/><p></p></span>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. Several populations occur within protected areas, the most important being the Bengal Florican Conservation Area (BFCA) network in Cambodia (see Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012), Chitwan National Park, Royal Bardia National Park and Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, Nepal, Kaziranga, D'Ering, Dibru-Saikhowa and Dudwa National Parks, India. Tiny, perhaps unsustainable populations may still remain at Ang Trapeang Thmor Sarus Crane Reserve, Cambodia, and within the Mekong Delta at Boeung Prek Lapouv Sarus Crane Reserve, Cambodia, and Tram Chim National Park, Vietnam. A research project investigating movements and habitat requirements in the non-breeding season began in 2007, where individuals were fitted with satellite or radio transmitters; the data from which have revealed previously unknown non-breeding sites (see Packman 2009). The Wildlife Conservation Society, BirdLife International and their government partners are engaged in a programme of conservation activities in the Tonle Sap floodplain of Cambodia, aimed at reducing habitat loss and hunting pressure on the species (A. W. Tordoff <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007). Achievements so far include the designation of 173 km<sup>2</sup> of breeding and 138 km<sup>2</sup> of non-breeding habitat as Bengal Florican Conservation Areas (BFCAs). Populations in the BFCAs and in adjacent areas have been monitored annually since 2008 using a survey which employs a randomised sampling design to measure occupancy of 1 km<sup>2</sup> squares by displaying males, which allows results to be extrapolated within and across sites to obtain accurate population and trend data. These data indicate that the population is probably stable at some BFCAs and possibly declining in others and in adjacent areas (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009, 2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Suitable habitat in BFCAs continues to be lost to various threats, including the expansion of dry season rice cultivation and dam construction (van Zalinge<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2010), although overall habitat loss outside BFCAs has been much greater. <br/><br/>Work is on-going to maintain effective management structures for these areas and build constituencies of support for their conservation among local stakeholders. Official patrol teams are now operating in Kampong Thom and Siem Reap, and in both provinces the Forestry Administration, working through provincial commissions, has already halted several proposed developments which would otherwise have destroyed vital breeding habitat (Eames 2007, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, 2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012). Changes in land use in the Tonle Sap floodplain and in the BFCAs in particular are also monitored with the aid of aerial and/or satellite images (Gray <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009a, van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). When land encroachment in the BFCAs is detected through patrols or satellite-monitoring, WCS facilitates meetings between the parties concerned to resolve disputes and reverse encroachment. An in-depth socio-economic study has been conducted by the Centre d'Etude et de Développement Agricole Cambodgien. The report highlights the economic benefits local communities derive through the traditional use of grasslands and is used to build support among key decision makers and local communities. An awareness programme covering 71 villages and over 3,200 people was conducted in 2008/2009, and outreach activities in schools and villages are ongoing. Training in selected villages was conducted to improve agricultural systems and reduce the immediate pressure on grasslands from people wanting to convert grasslands into agriculture (BirdLife International 2009). Villagers receive financial rewards for reporting nests which they incidentally find as a deterrent against collecting and eating the eggs; finders receive an additional financial reward if the nest fledges successfully, although nest-finders are discouraged from protecting the nests directly to reduce accidental disturbance to birds (van Zalinge <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009,<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>2010, Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). <br/><br/>At the four breeding season BFCAs, community management committees have been established to act as intermediaries between WCS, government partners and the communities, they assist in awareness raising, patrolling and reporting illegal activities in the BFCAs. At one of the BFCAs rice is purchased at a premium from local farmers abiding by conservation agreements under a wildlife-friendly rice initiative and community members gain an additional income from acting as guides to birdwatchers visiting the site through the Sam Veasna Centre. These activities appear to be having some early success in arresting the rapid decline of the species in Cambodia, but their long-term outcome remains to be seen.<br/><br/>In 2012, a Darwin Initiative project was initiated to look at the species's distribution and habitat requirements in India and Nepal (Barber 2013). In Nepal, two male birds were satellite-tagged in April 2013 (Barber 2013), followed by two females and a male in 2014 and three males in India in 2014 (Barber 2014), and a further two males have been tagged in Nepal and one male in India (R. Jha&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016, Jha <em>et al. </em>2018). As a result of the tagging work, conservationists will be able to identify important areas for the species and propose suitable management regimes. Trial habitat plots have also been established to understand habitat preferences.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue annual monitoring of the population in the BFCAs, Cambodia, and replicate the monitoring protocol in key sites in India and Nepal. Conduct research on breeding productivity and habitat utilisation in breeding and non-breeding BFCAs. Introduce a protected area management regime, including appropriate rotational burning, grazing and cutting based on research findings; and promote appropriate land-management actions in non-protected areas, e.g. low intensity agricultural areas that are used in the non-breeding season (see Jha <em>et al.&#160;</em>&#160;2018).

Most populations appear to have stabilized or increased since 1995, but the effects of drought and the increasing demand for both fossil fuel and renewable energy development (including wind and biofuels) continue to place remaining habitats at risk. Therefore, the species is precautionarily retained as Vulnerable, because of potential future declines, although if these do not materialise the species will warrant downlisting to a lower threat category.<p></p>","It originally inhabited mid-grass prairie with or without interspersed Shinnery Oak <em>Quercus havardii</em> or Sand Sagebrush <em>Artemisia filifolia</em><strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hagen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. It is now most common in dwarf shrub-mixed grass vegetation, sometimes interspersed with short grass and, optimally, with some portion (&lt;25%) of the landscape in row grains as supplemental winter forage. Successful nests tend to be in areas with greater shrub cover and visual obstructions (Davis 2009), and habitat occupancy increases with native land cover (Hagen <em>et al. </em>2016). Leks are usually on elevated areas with short vegetation (Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Breeding occurs from mid-March to late May (Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Food comprises foliage, seeds, grain, insects in the warmer months and acorns in the south of the range (Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Birds flock in late autumn and early winter, when they feed in croplands (Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Croplands have expanded since the late 19th century and complete conversion is now the principal threat (Hagen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>, as areas with more than 37% cultivated land are probably unsustainable (Hagen <em>et al</em>. 2002)<strong></strong>. Intensive grazing reduces food and cover, and herbicides reduce shrub cover and acorn production (Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Market hunting greatly reduced populations in the early 20th century (Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Conversion of prairies to woodlands from the lack of fire is one of the primary threats facing the species, yet this threat can be reversed through proactive land management that includes the use of prescribed fire at biologically appropriate intervals (Hagen and Elmore 2016). Yet fire could also threaten the species in the short-term at the local level, as 780,000 acres of habitat was destroyed by fire in 2017, and populations in these areas were concurrently impacted (Belinda <em>et al. </em>2017). However, populations will likely be improved in the future as a result of this (Belinda <em>et al. </em>2017). Numbers declined more severely in the dust bowl of the late 1930s<strong></strong>, and significantly with droughts in the 1950s and early 1990s (Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Recent droughts have also impacted the species (North American Grouse Partnership <em>in litt. </em>2018, R. Rodgers <em>in litt. </em>2018), decreasing chick and juvenile survival (Ross <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/>Today, recreational hunting is limited to Kansas and the conservative seasons produce an annual harvest of fewer than 1,000 birds (Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007, Van Pelt <em>et al. </em>2013)<strong></strong>. In Oklahoma, 39.5% of the prairie-chicken mortality recorded was due to fence collisions, while in New Mexico, this figure was 26.5%. The species has also been found to avoid power lines, and so it is likely that the erection of other tall structures (including wind turbines) will lead to increased habitat fragmentation and reduced home range sizes (Pruett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009) as well as reduced reproductive success (Pitman <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. Wind-energy facilities are increasing in the Great Plains, particularly in states with Lesser Prairie-chickens, as these have the highest potential for wind energy development. If climate change should lead to increased temperatures within the species's range, this could also impact the species as it has been found that nest survival decreases 10% for every half-hour when temperature exceed 34°C (Grisham <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/><p></p>","The global population is estimated to number 22,000-41,000 individuals (McDonald <em>et al. </em>2015).",Decreasing,"<em>Tympanuchus pallidicinctus</em> occurs in west-central and south-west Kansas, south-east Colorado, the Oklahoma panhandle, Texas (Permian Basin) and eastern New Mexico,<strong> </strong>(<strong>U.S.A.</strong>), and historically perhaps in southern Nebraska (Wolfe <em>et al</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is legally protected in all range states.

In Russia, spring fires threaten breeding sites and kill nest trees. Reclamation of wetlands, particularly in the Yangtze basin, has reduced the area of habitat for wintering birds and caused disturbance.

Radar surveys show that the species is declining rapidly on at least one of the other islands where it breeds (Kaua'i), and declines are probable on other islands too. Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>","On Maui, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, nesting takes place mainly between 2,000 and 3,000 m, in lava cavities with little vegetation nearby (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Elsewhere, for example West Maui (J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007) and Kaua'i (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007), it nests at lower elevations, amongst dense shrubs and ferns or in native grasslands with bracken (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998, P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2007). On Haleakalā, Maui, birds nest in rock crevices and tunnels that are over 0.5 m deep, often exceeding two metres (Simons and Hodges 1998, J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Pairs nest in cavities in the volcanic terrain, in burrows beneath rocks or at the base of clay cliffs (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007). At lower altitudes, they excavate burrows or nest in cavities often at the base of trees (Simons and Hodges 1998, P. Baker <em>in litt.</em> 1999, N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007), although many burrows on Lana'i are not at the base of trees (J. Penniman<em> in litt.</em> 2007). On Lana'i, birds breed in dense uluhe fern habitat (<em>Dicranopteris linearis</em> and <em>Diplopterygium pinnatum</em>) and start breeding in March, whereas in Haleakalā, Maui, birds begin breeding in mid-February (Penniman <em>et al</em>. 2008). On Kaua'i, birds breed in montane wet forests, where burrows are located along ridgelines in predominantly native forest, often at the base of large trees. On average, birds take five to six years to reach maturity but begin visiting colonies to establish pair bonds and prospect nesting sites at 2-3 years (Hess and Banko 2006). Most eggs are laid in May and June, with most young fledging by December (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005). Birds nesting at higher elevations appear to finish provisioning chicks earlier, with most birds having departed the colony at Haleakalā by the end of October. The diet comprises mostly fish and squid, with squid constituting c.50-75% of the food ingested (Simons and Hodges 1998). It has been found that at least some birds nesting on Lana'i feed in waters around the Aleutian Islands, as shown through the use of tracking devices on several breeding individuals (P. Baicich&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2007).<em> P. sandwichensis</em> regularly is observed foraging in mixed species flocks in association with predatory fish species (Mitchell <em>et al. </em>2005).&#160;<p></p>","<p>Historically the species suffered declines through harvesting by early Polynesians and during the period of Hawaiian settlement beginning c.1,800 years ago (Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species may have been restricted to its current breeding range since the arrival of Europeans (Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003). The most serious current threat is predation by introduced vertebrates including Indian mongoose <em>Herpestes javanicus,&#160;</em>feral cats, Common Barn-owls <em>Tyto</em> <em>alba</em>, rats, dogs, and pigs. Although not yet established on Kaua'i and Lana'i islands, mongooses represent an ongoing major threat to nestling and adult birds at breeding colonies on the other islands within the Hawaiian Petrel’s range. Feral cat and rat depredation, where unmanaged on other islands, continues to limit recovery capacity. Considerable efforts are ongoing to reduce the impact of cat predation on the species with cat-proof fences erected on Maui and Mauna Loa. Adults and nestlings are very susceptible to predation, as nests are on the ground, and they are naïve to predators.</p>  <p>A significantly lower percentage of birds come ashore to nest during El Niño years (c.40% compared to c.65% normally) (C.N. Hodges <em>per</em> Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003), suggesting that the species is sensitive to such disturbances in environmental conditions (Carlile <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>  <p>Each autumn during the fledging season, some of the fledgling birds become grounded as a result of light attraction and disorientation. Occassionally, birds collide with sources of light, and mortality sometimes occurs as a result of collisions with fences and power-lines mostly on Kaua'i and Maui (Simons 1985, Cooper and Day 1998, Simons and Hodges 1998). Once on the ground, fledglings are unable to fly and are killed by cars, cats and dogs, die from environmental exposure or injuries, or are recovered by the public. The siting of the Kaheawa wind farm on Lana'i also appears to be causing ongoing mortality at a potentially significant rate.</p>  Some areas of nesting habitat have been lost to the pressures of modern urbanisation and degraded by feral goats and pigs and weeds. Nest burrows are trampled by feral goats, mouflon sheep and Chital Deer&#160;<em>Axis axis&#160;</em>(Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, H. T. Harvey and Associates 2015) however, these are now excluded from the largest colony and deer&#160;are not present at the majority of sites. On Lana'i, habitat degradation caused by the invasive tree, Strawberry Guava <em>Psidium</em> <em>cattleianum</em>, is considered to be the biggest threat to the long term survival of the colony (J. Penniman <em>in litt</em>. 2007). In the past, considerable amounts of the Hawaiian Petrel’s habitat were converted for livestock, however as the majority of colonies are now protected, this represents a much reduced threat.<p></p>","Spear <em>et al.</em> (1995) give a best estimate of 3,750-4,500 breeding pairs based on at-sea surveys. This roughly equates to 7,500-9,000 mature individuals, and 11,250-13,500 individuals in total. The discovery of possibly several thousand birds breeding on Lana'i during terrestrial surveys in 2006-2007 and two small colonies on West Maui (J. Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007), probably in the tens or low hundreds of birds (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007), may bring the estimated breeding population close to the upper estimate of 6,500-8,300 pairs calculated by Spear <em>et al.</em> (1995). However,&#160;the rapid decline in at least the population on Kaua'i would suggest that the population size may now in fact be smaller than this. Given uncertainty regarding overall trends, the upper and lower bounds from Spear <em>et al.</em> (1995) are used here, i.e. 3,750-8,300 pairs, or 7,500-16,600 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<p></p><em>Pterodroma sandwichensis </em>ranges in the central Pacific and breeds on the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>). There are approximately 2,547 known burrows within Haleakalā National Park (Haleakalā National Park 2015 <em>unpubl. data</em>). Two small colonies are present in the West Maui Mountains, but they are so far unquantified (Cooper and Day 2003, J. Penniman <em>in litt</em>. 2007), with numbers perhaps in the tens or low hundreds (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007). On Hawai'i, small numbers breed on Mauna Kea and 40-50 pairs were present on Mauna Loa prior to 1995 (Ainley <em>et al</em>. 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998). On Kaua'i, 1,600 pairs are indicated by observations of birds at a rafting site (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997). On Moloka'i, 5-10 birds were heard calling in 1980, suggesting small numbers (Simons and Hodges 1998), but there has not been a concerted effort to estimate numbers on this island (D. Ainley <em>in litt.</em> 2007). Surveys in 2006-2007 located a colony in the cloud forests of Lana'ihale on the north side of Lana'i (P. Baicich <em>in litt</em>. 2007, A. Wilson <em>in litt</em>. 2007). This population probably numbers several thousand birds, based on the volume of calling during night time listening surveys in April and May along the Lana'ihale ridge at the highest point in the uplands, although only 14 burrows had been found by October 2007 (J. Penniman <em>in litt</em>. 2007). Surveys have so far been hampered by weather conditions and the risk of habitat disturbance (J. Penniman <em>in litt</em>. 2007).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CMS Appendix I. On Maui, there is a long-term monitoring programme in the Haleakala National Park (Simons and Hodges 1998)<strong></strong> and efforts are made to control introduced mammals. In 1976, a perimeter fence was put up around the main colony to exclude feral goats and pigs from the habitat (Carlile <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. The predator exclosures placed around the national park may have facilitated an increase in the number of birds in eastern Maui (Cooper and Day 2003)<strong></strong>. The trapping of rats started in 1968, and since 1997 rodenticides have been used (Carlile <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>.

Penniman <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In 2006, a fence was completed to encircle a large portion of the breeding habitat on Lana'i; the purpose was to exclude ungulates that damage the vegetation thus impacting the island's water supply (D. Ainley<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Simultaneously, a limited cat-trapping programme has been initiated in the fenced area (D. Ainley<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. On Maui, Lana'i, and Kaua'i, grounded fledglings are collected and released, although the benefit of doing this has yet to be confirmed as very few banded individuals have subsequently been encountered (D. Ainley<em> in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Fencing erected for forest conservation has been modified to reduce collisions (Simons and Hodges 1998)<strong></strong>. On Kaua'i, auditory surveys to detect colonies are ongoing, and have included documenting the first known nesting sites on Kaua'i in the Upper Limahuli Preserve (N. Holmes <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Also on Kaua'i, street lighting is shielded in critical areas and lighting on some buildings has been modified to reduce collisions (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998)<strong></strong>. A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006, under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, has enforced a campaign running since 2005, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua'i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. The island's electricity company is helping by darkening all of its 3,000 street lights, and shielding or turning some of them off. The company has also fitted large balls to power lines in an effort to reduce the number of birds that collide with the cables (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. Significant improvements have beem made in reducing light attraction and collision, although there is still a considerable amount of new and existing infrastructure that requires modification (N.

It has already been extirpated from some sites, and declines are likely to continue as a result of habitat loss and degradation, hunting and invasive predators.<p></p> <p></p>","<p>Field investigations on Hispaniola suggest that Black-capped Petrels lay eggs in mid- to late January, chicks hatch in mid- to late March and fledglings depart the colony sites in mid-June to early July (Simons <em>et al.</em> 2013). All nests located to date are at high elevations (&gt;1,500 m), and while most are in inaccessible areas (steep slopes, heavily forested) some are not (E. Rupp, <em>in litt.</em>). Nesting success from monitoring over 4 years was 70-77% (n = 47 nests) with abandonment and predation causing most failures (E. Rupp, <em>in litt</em>.)</p><p>Nesting birds commute long distances from breeding to foraging sites, typically feeding in flocks. It is primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, feeding on squid, fish, crustaceans, and <em>Sargassum</em>. In its primary foraging range, the Black-capped Petrel is most influenced by the position of the Gulf Stream, a dynamic current system, and not sea surface temperature or depth. (Simons <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p></p>","<p>The increased frequency of fires represents a significant threat to the Black-capped Petrel through habitat loss, degradation and direct mortality. Fires and electric lights can cause the birds to become confused and disorientated causing mortality through collisions or grounding of the birds (Wingate 1964). Once grounded, many birds are unable to regain flight, leaving them vulnerable to predation and starvation. A number of electric communication towers are located on mountaintops close to petrel breeding grounds and are often stabilised with multiple guy wires and well lit (Goetz <em>et al.</em> 2012). These towers appear to be a considerable source of mortality, with a two-night investigation in 2013 finding several dead and grounded birds below a single tower, as well as hearing birds hitting the guy wires (A. Brown <em>in litt</em>. 2013). Mitigation efforts are in place for some towers and have greatly reduced the impact at these locations however further towers require investigation and modification (A. Brown <em>in</em> <em>litt</em>. 2013).</p>  <p>Small-holder farming, cattle ranching and logging for charcoal are all significant sources of habitat loss, despite being illegal within the forests of Sierra De Baoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic (BirdLife International 2016). Rats and Feral cats are abundant at all known Black-capped Petrel breeding locations and, although their current impact on the species is unknown, in other ecologically similar petrels these species are responsible for nest failure and fledgling and adult mortality (Goetz <em>et al.</em> 2012). Dogs, pigs and mongoose may also predate the species. Direct consumption by humans is implicated in the extirpation of Black-capped Petrel on Martinique and Guadeloupe (Lee 2000), and this intentional use is ongoing in other areas. The gathering of terrestrial plants across the Black-capped Petrel’s range is not thought to cause significant declines.</p>  <p>Mercury concentrations in tissues from specimens of the species were found to be considerably higher than in other species studied (Whaling <em>et al.</em> 1980, Simons <em>et al</em>. 2013) but impacts are unclear and likely restricted to lowered reproductive success rather than direct mortality.</p>  <p></p>","The population is estimated as no more than 1,000 breeding pairs, perhaps as few as 500, and a total population of 2,000–4,000 birds.<p></p> <p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pterodroma hasitata</em> is confirmed as breeding in Hispaniola (comprising the nations of <strong>Haiti</strong> and the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>). The population there is estimated as no more than 1,000 breeding pairs, perhaps as few as 500, and a total population of 2,000–4,000 birds. The highest density of nests and most of the population occurs on La Visite Ridge in the western extent of the Massif de la Selle, Haiti. Smaller populations occur eastward along the Massif de la Selle and across the border in the Sierra de Bahoruco of the Dominican Republic, as well as around Pic Macaya in Massif de la Hotte in western Haiti. Radar surveys and aural observations indicate that small populations occur in other areas to the north and east in the Dominican Republic but nests have yet to be located (E. Rupp <em>in litt.</em>) Taking into account each of these known and suspected breeding sites, all of which are quite small, an area of occurrence estimate of 20 km<sup>2</sup> is reasonable (E. Rupp <em>in litt.</em>).</p><p>Radar surveys conducted in Dominica in January 2015 strongly suggest that Black-capped Petrels persist there; hundreds of petrel-like targets were recorded over 17 separate coastal and inland flight corridors, and eight individual Black-capped Petrels were observed over 5 locations (Brown 2015). These data, when coupled with recent observations of downed Black-capped Petrels on the island, suggests that there are still individuals breeding on the island, although the last confirmed nesting date was 1862.</p><p>Black-capped Petrels previously nested on Guadeloupe and Martinique, but have not been documented there since before 1900. However, hope persists for rediscovery on Guadeloupe (A. Chabrolle <em>in litt.</em>) based on offshore observations and the presence of inaccessible island peaks. Likewise, hope persists for Cuba. Though there is no documentation of Black-capped Petrels nesting in Cuba in the past or currently, there have been observations of birds flying inland at dusk from a known foraging area.&#160;</p><p>Black-capped Petrels are highly pelagic and undertake long-distance foraging trips. A compendium of about 5,000 at-sea observations indicates that waters in or adjacent to the Florida Current and the Gulf Stream between northern Florida and southern Virginia provide a distinct and relatively confined foraging range of Black-capped Petrels, with concentrations observed there throughout the year. In the Caribbean Sea, Black-capped Petrels can occur within the inter-island regions, straits and offshore zones of both the Greater and Lesser Antilles, but still primarily east of 80°W. The first satellite tracking of this species (three individuals) suggest a similar, but more spatially expansive range, including regular occurrence in the Caribbean Sea between Hispaniola and South America and regular occurrence east of primary foraging area indicated by the at-sea observations (Jodice <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;</p><br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway&#160;</strong></p><p>An International Black-capped Petrel Conservation Group has formed and facilitates communication and coordination among researchers and conservationists concerned about the species.

It now requires an urgent acceleration in targeted conservation actions in order to prevent it from becoming functionally extinct within a few decades. <p></p> <p></p>","This species inhabits arid and semi-arid grasslands with scattered short scrub, bushes and low intensity cultivation in flat or gently undulating terrain. Birds congregate in traditional less disturbed grassland patches to breed during mid-summer and monsoon. It nests in open ground, laying only one clutch (consisting of one and very rarely two eggs) per year. Outside of breeding season, it probably makes local and possibly long distance nomadic movements (largely unknown) in response to various factors, using areas rich in food resources and surrounded by natural grass-scrub habitat (including agricultural fields [G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016]) for easy navigation. It requires different microhabitat envelopes for different activities, such as grasslands with relatively tall (vegetation 25-100cm) and dense cover, high insect resources and less grazing for nesting; short sparse vegetation (&lt;25 cm vegetation) on slightly elevated ground for display; sparse vegetation (&lt;25 cm vegetation) with minimal scrub for roosting; and moderate (25-50 cm) vegetation or medium sized trees for shade or roosting (Rahmani 1989, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","Historically, widespread hunting for sport and food precipitated its decline, accelerated by vehicular access to remote areas. High intensity poaching still continues in Pakistan (which is probably shared with western Rajasthan and Kachchh populations), where 49 birds were hunted out of 63 that were sighted over a period of four years (Khan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Some poaching continues in India as well (Sridhar 2005, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011, Anon. 2013a, Anon. 2015), including one documented case where mine-workers that lost their livelihoods when mines near Gwalior were closed for the creation of the Ghatigaon Bustard Sanctuary hunted bustards to undermine the criteria on which the area was first designated as a sanctuary (Sridhar 2005). Additionally, in 2012, a bird was poached inside the protected area in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan (P. Patil&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012, G. Bhardwaj&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Hunting was also prevalent in Maharashtra in the past (Anon. 2015).&#160;Egg-collecting was rampant in many states during the early 19th century, and prevails very sporadically in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011). <br/><br/>However, the current threats are mostly from habitat loss and degradation, caused by; 1) widespread agricultural expansion and mechanization of farming; 2) infrastructural development such as irrigation (including a canal at Nannaj GIB Sanctuary [P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016]), roads, electricity pylons, wind turbines and constructions; 3) mining and industrialization; 4) well intended but ill-informed habitat management (Singh <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006); and 5) lack of community support (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2011, 2013, 2015). With increased availability of water due to Government irrigation policies, agriculture has spread over vast arid–semiarid grasslands. For example, the Indira Gandhi Nahar Project has caused drastic hydraulic changes and massive agricultural conversion in and around the Desert National Park Sanctuary. Moreover, irrigation facilities and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in the crop pattern from bustard–friendly traditional monsoonal crops (sorghum, millet, etc.) to cash crops (sugarcane, grapes, cotton, horticulture, etc.), which are not suitable for the species. Due to ill-defined land distribution policies and the ambiguity arising from segregated ownership between private, community and government bodies, encroachment is a major problem in many bustard areas, especially in and around bustard sanctuaries of Maharashtra, Kachchh and Rajasthan. <br/><br/>Activities such as mining, stone quarrying, growth of industries, heavy pesticide use, grassland conversion and power projects along with the expansion of roads, electricity pylons, wind turbines, solar energy projects and other infrastructures have increased the severity of habitat degradation and disturbance (Anon 2015).&#160;The population in Madhya Pradesh has been lost due to trespassing, encroachment, mining and quarrying activities (Anon. 2015).&#160;Two individuals in Maharashtra (P. Patil <em>in litt</em> 2011) and one individual in Kachchh were reportedly killed by collisions with power-lines (Gadhavi 2014). Traditionally, grasslands and scrub have been considered as wasteland and the Forest Department policy, until recently, has been to convert them to forests with plantation of fuel/fodder shrub/tree species, even exotics like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Prosopis juliflora</span>,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><em>Acacia tortilis</em>,<em>&#160;</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gliricidia&#160;</span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eucalyptus </span>spp., under social forestry and compensatory afforestation schemes (Forest (Conservation) Act 1988; Indian Forest Act 1927) resulting in further loss of habitat. Afforestation has been highlighted as a problem at five sites used by the species:&#160;Thar desert (Rajasthan),&#160;Naliya (Gujarat), Nannaj (Maharashtra), Ranibennur (Kamataka) and Rollapadu (Andhra Pradesh) (Anon. 2015, P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016, G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016). Overgrazing on unprotected lands has also led to degradation of some areas (Mathew 2007, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Anon. 2013c, P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011), especially in the Thar desert (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016), and nest failure is commonly attributed to trampling by livestock (Anon. 2013c, Collar and Kirwan 2015). Hunting and egg collection remains a threat (Anon. 2014a). Free-ranging dogs pose a threat at all sites in India through disturbance of nesting adults and destruction of eggs (Anon. 2014c, 2015, P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2015), while free-ranging pigs may also pose a threat (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Nests may also be predated by House Crows (<em>Corvus splendens</em>) (Collar and Kirwan 2015, P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Antagonism towards the species by local people is a major threat, and one reported to be increasing around Desert National Park Sanctuary due to political interests of local leaders (Anon. 2015). <p></p>","The species's total population was estimated at c. 300 individuals in 2008, indicating that there are probably fewer than 250 mature individuals remaining, hence the population is placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species&#160;occurs in the Indian Subcontinent, with former strongholds in the Thar desert in the north-west and the Deccan tableland of the Peninsula (BirdLife International 2001). It has been extirpated from 90% of its former range and is now principally confined to Rajasthan. In 2014 a survey of the Thar Desert, Rajasthan,&#160;estimated the species was present at a density of 0.61 ± 0.36 individuals/100 km<sup>2</sup>, yielding abundance estimates of 103 ± 62 in the sampled area (16.9 km<sup>2</sup>) and 155 ± 94 individuals in the Thar landscape (25,488 km<sup>2</sup>). During the survey, 38 individuals were detected (Dutta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), and surveys in 2015 found 40 individuals (G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016). Smaller&#160;populations (likely to be considerably fewer than 15-20 birds [P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016]) are present in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, with birds now absent from Madhya Pradesh (Anon. 2015), <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India</span>. It is also reported to breed in <strong>Pakistan</strong>, however, information on breeding activity has not been published (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Recent declines have been noted in several areas, including Maharashtra (Kasambe<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2006, P. Patil<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt</span>. 2011, Anon. 2015), Kachchh (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012) and Rajasthan (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2015). In Maharashtra, the latest population estimates suggest a population as low as 10 individuals (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2016, G. Bhardwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016), and numbers have been falling in the Bustard Sanctuary since at least the late 1980s, with the 2010 census recording only nine individuals and only three individuals (one male and two females) recorded in 2014 (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2014), while breeding has not been recorded there since 2007 at least (P. Patil <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011). A recent survey in Nashik, Maharashtra failed to find the species (P. Patil <em>in litt</em>. 2014), whilst a survey in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra provided an estimate of six or seven birds between April 2012 and May 2013 (Anon. 2014b). Populations in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are considered at risk of local extinction (Anon. 2015).&#160;In Kachchh the latest population estimate is fewer than 20 birds at densities of 0.05 per km<sup>2</sup> in c. 400 km<sup>2</sup> of suitable habitat (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The species is likely to be close to disappearing from Karnataka (Kumara and Mohan Raj 2007, S. Kottur <em>in litt</em>.), and it is thought to have completely disappeared from the states of Haryana, Punjab, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh (Anon. 2015), India, but some apparently survive in&#160;Pakistan, with reports from several localities (Khan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, Anon. 2013c, B. Lechleiter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2011). Indian states in order of importance for the species are as follows: Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh (Anon. 2015). Sites in order of priority for the species are: Desert National Park Sanctuary (Rajasthan), Naliya (Gujarat), Warora (Maharashtra) and Bellary (Karnataka) (Anon. 2015).<br/><br/>Its total population has declined from an estimated 1,260 individuals in 1969 to c. 300 individuals in 2008 (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010), equivalent to a reduction of c. 82% over 47 years (three generations), assuming an exponential trend. The results of a recent genetic study, in which the effective population size was estimated from the diversity of mitochondrial DNA, provide support for an estimate of fewer than 1,000 birds, and likely about 500 during the period 2006-2010, when samples were collected (Ishtiaq <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). This study found very low genetic diversity for such a widespread species, probably owing to a bottleneck event caused by its widespread extermination possibly even before the mid 19th century (Ishtiaq <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011). Population viability analysis predicts a high probability of local extinction within 50 years for populations numbering fewer than 30 individuals, with the more secure population of over 100 individuals showing sensitivity to the loss of one additional adult each year to human causes, indicating that present levels of off-take are unsustainable (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Current levels of hunting may result in the extinction of even the largest western Indian population in the next 15-20 years (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. In India it is legally protected under&#160;Schedule 1 (<span lang=""EN-IN"">Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act 2002 [<span lang=""EN-IN"">Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India&#160;2003])&#160;and there are severe  penalties for killing an individual. It has been the focus of several  publicity initiatives aimed at reducing hunting. Since 1981, extensive  fieldwork has investigated its status, distribution and ecology, and a  detailed conservation strategy has been published. Protected areas have  been specifically established for the species (Sonkhaliya-Sorson,  Lala-Naliya, Gaga-Bhatiya, Karera, Ghatigaon, Nannaj and Ranibennur), and  populations occur in some others (Desert National Park Sanctuary and Rollapadu  Wildlife Sanctuary). Desert National Park Sanctuary has now been proposed as a Biosphere Reserve by the Indian government (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Despite some failures (local extinctions in Sorson, Karera,&#160;Ghatigaon,&#160;Gaga-Bhatiya and Ranibennur), there have been some successes, and one female was recently seen in Sonkhaliya Lesser Florican area (D. Nandan <em>per. </em>P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).  Rehabilitation of grasslands has benefited the species in some  areas (particularly Desert National Park Sanctuary [P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016]). Grassland restoration through tree (<em>Gliricidia spp.</em>)<em>&#160;</em>removal has taken place at the GIB Sanctuary in Maharashtra (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016) and within six months Great Indian Bustards were seen in the area (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Tree removal&#160;is also planned for the Rollapadu Sanctuary (Anon. 2015).&#160;A programme of management to remove an invasive weed species,&#160;<em>Prosopis juliflora</em>, from&#160;grassland in Kachchh proved successful as within seven days, Great Indian Bustard was observed in the cleared area (Anon. 2014c).&#160;<br/><br/>The Indian government has provided financial support to  conservation actions for this species in some regions (Anon. 2009), and&#160;in association with several NGOs and experts has developed guidelines for State Action Plan for Resident Bustards’ recovery programme (Dutta <em>et.al.</em> 2013), as well as identifying key policies to protect grassland habitats (Anon. 2011a). 'Project Great Indian Bustard' has been launched in Rajasthan including  constructing breeding enclosures for the species and developing infrastructure to  reduce human pressure on habitats (Anon. 2013b). In Kachchh, a pilot programme has been established to neuter stray dogs around the core areas of the Bustard Sanctuary (Anon. 2014c). At the same time the dogs are vaccinated against rabies which will benefit the local community. Meetings and processions with local communities have been carried out in  the past by the Bombay Natural History Society (Rahmani 2006) to  generate support for birds among local people; and a&#160;procession was organised to establish a statue of Great Indian Bustard in a Hindu temple at Sankhala village in Rajasthan (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). More recently (March  2011), the Great Indian Bustard Foundation group held a two-day meeting with  communities within and around the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary at  Nannaj (Patil 2011). Nearly 600 villagers attended and discussions  covered the problems of local people and threats to the species (Patil  2011). School awareness programmes and large-scale community awareness programmes are also underway (e.g. Rahmani 1998, Sanctuary Asia 2016). Publicity materials and media stories have been produced to raise awareness of the species in India (Anon. 2015), and engagement activities with shepherd communities have aided in species monitoring and raising awareness (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>In August 2013 a three-year BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Programme/RSPB funded project was initiated with Bombay Natural History Society (Anon. 2014a), and a further project supported by the Whitely Fund for Nature (WFN) has also begun (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). A programme of research was set up to monitor the species and its grassland habitats (Anon. 2014a). In India, workshops on implementing conservation plans were held in four states with Great Indian Bustard populations, capacity-building workshops were also held for members of the local community, NGO and Government staff (Anon. 2015). A community awareness campaign was held in the Thar desert, Rajasthan between February and March 2014. Advocacy work under this project has helped to reduce community resentment against the species (including initiating a livestock health-check programme),&#160;and led to well-informed conservation planning, better coordination between different stakeholders, and mutual cooperation between different departments over conservation issues (Anon. 2014d, Anon. 2015).&#160;Community resentment may also be further reduced by making protected areas more targeted towards the habitats where the species occurs, as has been attempted in Maharashtra (Varghese <em>et al. </em>2016). Emergency conservation has been prepared for&#160;Rollapadu&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary, Andhra Pradesh, and for Karera and Ghatigaon GIB Sanctuaries in Madhya Pradesh (Anon. 2014d).&#160;To clear confusions over land records and ownership related issues inside Desert National Park a new scientific map is being prepared (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Rajasthan State Forest Department has initiated a process of transferring land inside Desert National Park Sanctuary from State Revenue Department to State Forest Department, and the Rajasthan State Forest Department has secured more breeding habitat for species by increasing the number and size of closures across important breeding patches (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Additionally,&#160;the Rajasthan State Forest Department has banned construction of any new wind turbine in prime bustard landscape (e.g. in region of Jasialmer [G. Bharwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016]) without prior permission and clearance from the government, and predator-proof fences are being made to prevent the entry of free-ranging dogs, pigs, foxes, and monitor lizards into Great Indian Bustard breeding areas (G. Bharwaj <em>in litt. </em>2016, P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Planting of plant species other than local grasses has been discouraged in prime habitat by Rajasthan Forest Department and waterholes are being strictly maintained with a constant supply of water (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Camera traps have been installed at waterholes to monitor threats and species movement (P. Patil <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;BNHS has initiated an advocacy with Indian Army in order to monitor and protect individuals inside army managed restricted areas (P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). A protected area for the species has been reportedly proposed by NGOs in Pakistan (P.

The measures involved include developing the community network to monitor the species and its threats and supporting ecosystem-based livelihood practices. For instance, the&#160;Rajasthan State Forest Department (in collaboration with BNHS) has initiated livelihood leverage for women near Desert National Park through the setting up of local craft businesses, and have&#160;involved local community Eco-Development Committees (EDC) into conservation actions benefiting people (Anon 2016). These programmes have also directly supported local livelihood through efforts such as the ‘Local Community Nature Guide Program’ at Desert National Park Sanctuary (Anon 2014d, Anon 2015, Anon 2016); and&#160;BNHS in collaboration with Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) and Rajasthan State Forest Department have organised field training on the prevention of wildlife crime with special reference to Great Indian Bustard for ground level staff of State Forest Department Staff in Jaisalmer (Anon 2016).&#160;More guards have also been recruited to help protect the Great Indian Bustard in Desert National Park Sanctuary, and the local youth have been engaged in monitoring and patrolling by the State Forest Department (Anon 2016).&#160;Additionally, a capacity building programme was organised on Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act for State Forest Department Officers in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>Threats such as large powerlines and wind turbines have been mapped over prime habitat (P.

The Government of India has published guidelines for the state action plan for resident bustards’ recovery programme through meetings and workshops involving many parties (officials, experts, local people) (Dutta <em>et al.</em> 2013). Rajasthan State Government has set up a sub-committee on rationalisation of boundaries of Desert National Park Sanctuary (Upadhyay <em>et al.</em> 2015) and put forward measures through&#160;‘Project Great Indian Bustard’; and&#160;IUCN Bustards Specialists Group along with Bombay Natural History Society and Rajasthan State Forest Department has published a 30 points action plan for saving Great Indian Bustard in Thar Desert, Rajasthan (Collar <em>et al. </em>2015). Broadly speaking, the proposed conservation actions are:&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>1) To consolidate core breeding areas identified across the species’s range by creating strict refuges during prime breeding months (March–September). This will require acquiring government lands that are not owned by Forest Departments; making all core areas inviolate by chain-link-fencing and patrolling guards; and removing nest predators therein. It has also been proposed that&#160;southernmost part of Desert National Park Sanctuary should be de-notified as it is highly degraded because of agriculture, pockets of grasslands should be developed by handing over revenue lands to Forest Department, privately owned areas and tourist zones such as Sam sand dunes could be excluded from protected area boundaries.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>2) To formulate landscape conservation strategies in priority areas (informed by telemetry research). Evidence-based habitat management interventions should be planned and implemented (Dutta <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012) including work to exclude any road construction activities and tall shrub/tree plantations as well as limiting grazing regimes. Infrastructure developments (roads, electricity network and wind turbines) known to have a negative effect on the species should be curtailed or minimised near core breeding areas, replaced by bustard-friendly alternatives (underground electric cables and passes), or have bird flight diverters attached. These actions can be achieved by declaring priority areas as community or conservation reserves or Eco-sensitive zones through legislation.&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>3) Community outreach. Local livelihoods should be linked with bustard conservation in priority areas by subsidy/incentive driven agro-environmental schemes that promote bustard-friendly farming practices, such as pesticide-free farming of short palatable crops separated by long fallow periods, and stall feeding of livestock during peak monsoon months. Community outreach to reduce resentment to the species should also be attempted, including providing facilities and services (e.g. local health care) (Anon 2011b, P. Patil <em>in litt. </em>2016). Establish a&#160;‘Conservation Reserve’ or ‘Community Reserve’ under Indian law, with a view to financing, retaining and promoting traditional agriculture throughout, aiming at organic and fence-free farming with sustainable livestock levels.&#160;In association with NGO-Tiger Watch and Bombay Natural History Society, Rajasthan State Forest Department has also planned a ‘Great Indian Bustard Village Guardian Programme’.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>4) Provide more support and equipment to park staff, to better protect areas; and&#160;establish a volunteer warden programme modeled on those operating in tiger reserves elsewhere in India, to monitor and patrol areas as directed by park/police staff; potentially in conjunction with the army.<span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><span lang=""EN-IN""><br/>5) Consider commencing an <em>ex situ</em> conservation breeding programme as an insurance against extinction. Since <em>in situ</em> conservation measures will require at least 5-10 years to be implemented and the rapidly declining population trend provides a window of &lt;5 years for procuring eggs from the wild, the implementation of a conservation breeding programme would have to be taken up urgently. However, this is not an alternative to effective habitat management, and is only a mechanism to repopulate extinction-prone small stocks after their habitats have been restored. Importantly, a recent study modelled the species's population dynamics and found that establishing effective <em>in situ</em> conservation measures within the next 10 years and not removing eggs from the wild would recruit more adult females to the wild population within 30 years than a programme of captive breeding and releases (Dolman <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;<span lang=""EN-IN""><span

It is therefore listed as Least Concern.","<em>Auchenoglanis occidentalis</em> is a demersal, potamodromous species. This species is found in inshore areas of lakes and major rivers, sometimes in swamps of flood plains (Eccles 1992). This species occurs in shallow waters with muddy bottoms. It is an omnivore and feeds on insect larvae, worms, crustacea, molluscs other invertebrates, but also on plankton, seeds, plants and detritus (Willoughby 1974, Bailey 1994). <em>Auchenoglanis occidentalis</em> is oviparous (Breder and Rosen 1966). The breeding season extends from May to October, and nested eggs are guarded and brooded by the male parent (Ochi <em>et al.</em> 2001). Furthermore, the male plays host to eggs and young of <em>Dinotopterus cunningtoni</em> which takes advantage of the already prepared nest and feeds on the host brood (Ochi <em>et al.</em> 2001). This is an example of interspecific brood care.","For the majority of its range, no major threats to this species are known. In eastern Africa, it is threatened by loss of flood plains and vegetated marshes around rivers and lakes due to agriculture extension, as well as overfishing. In northern Africa, dams, water pollution (agriculture, domestic and commercial/industrial), groundwater extraction and drought all pose possible threats to this species.",No population estimate is available but in eastern Africa the species is common in fisheries catches and on the markets around Rusizi and Malagarasi rivers deltas.

Young <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. The species is totally reliant on sagebrush <em>Artemisia</em> spp. for seasonal cover and winter foraging (Young <em>et al.</em> 2000), but it also uses areas where sagebrush occurs together with more deciduous shrubs, e.g. <em>Quercus</em> spp., <em>Amelanchier</em> spp., <em>Prunus</em> spp. (Braun <em>et al</em>. 2014)<strong></strong>. Lek sites have low vegetation with sparse shrubs, and are often surrounded by the big sagebrush-dominated plant communities required for nesting (BLM 1999)<strong></strong>. Broods are reared (May to autumn) in adjacent riparian plant communities and in mesic upland sites (BLM 1999, J. R. Young<em> in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. Nesting success is relatively high and apparently unrelated or only weakly related to local-scale and landscape-scale features (Stanley<em> et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, adult survival was found to be constant across years and between populations (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2015).

Inbreeding depression appears to be occurring due to the skewed mating system at leks: six of the seven extant populations now appear to be low enough to be suffering from this (Stiver <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Severe winters and potentially droughts may represent survival bottlenecks (e.g. in 1984, less than 10% of sagebrush emerged above the snow [Storch 2000]<strong></strong>), as may other habitat factors influencing chick survival (J.

Therefore, it is listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p>","The species breeds in steep and extremely rugged terrain at 160-1,200 m. It usually nests in burrows associated with the root structure of trees, including Ohia lehua (<em>Metrosideros polymorpha</em>) and a dominant understory of densely matted uluhe fern (<em>Dicranopteris linearis</em>) in montane mesic forests on steep slopes (<strong></strong>Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007). In general, it can nest in any habitat that is free of predators (Troy <em>et al. </em>2016, D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>The breeding season begins in April, when birds return to prospect for nest sites and, following an exodus in late April, egg-laying in early June is highly synchronised (NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Pairs produce one egg, which is incubated for an average of 53-54 days, followed by a fledging period of 81-94 days (NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. Most young fledge by November (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. The age at first breeding is around six or seven years (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. The species's diet is not well known, although it likely consists of fish and squid,&#160;particularly flyingfish and Purpleback Flying Squid (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, Ainley <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong></strong>. It forages for hundreds of kilometres offshore, often in large, mixed species flocks associated with schools of large, predatory fish that drive prey species to the ocean surface (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005, NSWG 2005)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>","<p>The main threat to this species is thought to be predation by non-native species (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 1999, Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005, NSWG 2005). Predation of adults and juveniles by feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> and Barn Owls <em>Tyto alba</em> has been documented on almost every colony on Kaua'i, including the most remote sites (NSWG 2005, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Polynesian Rats <em>Rattus exulans</em>, Black Rats <em>R. rattus</em>, Brown Rats <em>R. rattus</em> and House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em> were inadvertently introduced to the Hawaiian islands as a result of human activity and shipwrecks (Duffy 2010) and may depredate eggs and chicks (NSWG 2005). Brown Rats appear to be more associated with human settlement and do not appear to be as severe a threat as the other two introduced rat species (Raine <em>et al</em>. 2017). Another potential predator, the Small Indian Mongoose <em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>, has recently been discovered on Kaua'i (NSWG 2005), and could potentially be a greater threat than cats as its smaller size means it may be able to enter breeding burrows more easily (Duffy and Capece 2014). It is yet to establish a permanent presence on the island (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2016), although it has a history of incursions onto Kaua'i and one was trapped there in 2016 (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt</em>. 2016). When the Two-spotted Leafhopper <em>Sophonia rufofascia</em> first established on the Hawaiian Islands, it led to habitat loss through feeding on the Uluhe Fern D<em>icranopteris linearis</em> which provide cover for shearwater burrows (Cooper and Day 1998). The leafhopper was a cause for great concern not only for shearwaters, but also for agricultural crops and native flora; hence a biological control programme was initiated and the insect is now hard to find on Hawai'i (Coll and Wajnberg 2017). Dogs have been shot at Ka'ena Point, while attacking nestling albatrosses and shearwaters (Duffy 2010), but the scale of their impact is unknown. Habitat loss due to conversion and introduction of herbivores like domesticated goats and pigs pose another threat on the Hawaiian Islands (Reed <em>et al</em>. 2012), and have been suggested as a contributing factor for the recent abandonment of some colonies (Troy and Holmes 2008, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>On Kaua'i, hurricanes Iwa and Iniki devastated the forests in 1982 and 1992, dramatically reducing available nesting habitat and reducing breeding attempts for Newell’s Shearwaters (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Given that a large proportion of the population breeds on Kaua'i, catastrophic events, like hurricanes, represent a serious threat (Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>During the 1980s and 1990s an estimated 70 adults and 280 subadults each summer, and at least 340 fledglings each autumn, died as a result of collisions with power-lines and communications towers, or indirectly because of light attraction (Podolsky <em>et al.</em> 1998, Anon. 2007). In the surveyed areas on eastern and southern Kaua'i, 350 adults are reported dead each year from collisions with power lines (Podolsky <em>et al.</em> 1998). Fledglings on their first flight to the ocean are particularly susceptible to attraction to artificial light. The birds are attracted and disoriented by coastal street lights and once grounded, unable to fly and often killed by cars, cats or dogs, or die from starvation or dehydration (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005). Between 1978 and 1981, more than 5,000 individuals were grounded on Kaua'i, and more than 30,000 have been found as victims of fallout since 1971 (Anon. 2007, Griesemer and Holmes 2011). Intense rescue programmes have been initiated to find grounded birds and return them to the sea (Everett and Pitman 1993). On Kaua'i, approximately 1,500 fledglings are recovered annually after becoming grounded (Mitchell <em>et al</em>. 2005), although with the suspected steep population decline on Kaua'i, the number of grounded birds is expected to have decreased proportionately (D. Ainley <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Collision with artificial structures (such as powerlines and wind turbines) is another key threat to the species, particularly in flight corridors for subadult and adult birds accessing inland colonies. Nine communications towers have recently been constructed on the Hawaiian Islands without proper consultation, and these are now the subject of an ongoing lawsuit (Anon. 2007). A field of wind generators was planned for Kaua'i and Lana'i (Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 2009 <em>in</em> Duffy 2010), without accounting for the potential impacts on this species. Although wind farms have been shown to have only minor effects on other bird species elsewhere, night-flying Shearwaters may be particularly vulnerable and the cumulative effects of construction and maintenance, erosion, vegetation clearing and noise should be accounted for (Duffy 2010). It is not confirmed whether the wind farm projects will be realised (T. Holmes <em>in litt</em>. 2007, A. Raine <em>in litt.</em> 2016).</p>  <p>Plastic pollution poses yet another threat. On Kaua'i, 50% of Newell’s Shearwater fledglings necropsied during 2007–2014 contained plastic items in their digestive tract and there is evidence that the mass and the number of items ingested per bird have also increased since the 1980s (Kain <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is thought that consumption of even small quantities of plastic, including fibres and small fragments, exposes birds at all stages of the breeding cycle to plastic-associated co-pollutants and associated impacts survival (Kain <em>et a</em>l. 2016).</p>  On Hawai'i, cinder mining has resulted in habitat loss at several colonies (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1983 <em>in</em> Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997, Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 2005) and together with other causes of habitat degradation (invasive vegetation, agriculture and urbanisation) contributes to the exposure and increased predation of ground-nesting birds (Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997). The species is also likely to be impacted by the commercial fishery through bycatch and indirect ecosystem effects resulting from overfishing of tuna <em>Tunnus</em> spp. (Mitchell <em>et al. </em>2005, Waugh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<p></p>","There have been several population size estimates for this species (see  Griesemer and Holmes 2011), but the most recent gives a minimum  population estimate of 27,011 individuals (Joyce 2016), which roughly equates to 18,000 mature individuals. However, given the decline on Kauai and near extirpation from Maui, the population size could now be far smaller (D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016). The population size is therefore precautionarily placed in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Puffinus newelli</em> nests principally on the mountains of Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (<strong>U.S.A.</strong>). Small colonies exist on Moloka'i, Hawai`i and possibly Maui, with unconfirmed records from Lana`i. After not having been recorded on Oahu since the 1700s, a survey carried out in 2016-2017 located the species in two sites at Mount Kaala and at Poamoho, suggesting that it regularly visits or even breeds on the island (Young <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>In the late 1970s, a cross-fostering experiment was carried out at Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge (Kaua'i), in which 90 eggs were placed in nests of the Wedge-tailed Shearwater (<em>A</em><em>rdenna pacifica</em>) (Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. Subsequently, 30 young were fledged. Four breeding pairs nesting in 2006 were believed to be descendents of fostered birds (Anon. 2007)<strong></strong>. Between 2006 and 2013, colony calls were played at the Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge and artificial burrows constructed to attract nesting pairs, as there is a low threat from alien predators or collisions with artificial structures (Anon. 2007). Subsequently, up to 13 pairs have been recorded there (N. Holmes and A. Raine&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. After the construction of a predator-proof fence in 2015 within the Refuge, 8 chicks were translocated to the site from montane colonies and were raised to fledging (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). It is planned to translocate up to 50 chicks to the Refuge over a five year period (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Also since 2015, social attraction has also been employed in an attempt to save the population on Maui. While the results are looking favourable, it is too soon to evaluate success (D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>In total, predator control and monitoring activities are in place at six colonies on Kaua'i, which involve the control of cats, rats, pigs and Barn Owls as well as monitoring the effectiveness of these activities through the use of cameras and acoustic monitoring devices (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). On Kauai', Barn Owl control is also carried out at another five colonies located along the Na Pali coast, Kalaheo/Kahili and Hanalei valley (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). The effectiveness of Barn Owl control is being monitored through the deployment of acoustic recording devices via helicopter in management areas (N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>There is an active programme to control lights across Kaua'i. Building's lighting has been effectively re-designed to reduce collisions (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006 under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has enforced a campaign, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua`i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006)<strong></strong>. In the course of the campaign, also street lights are darkened or turned off by the island's electricity company.&#160;<br/><br/>Moreover, the electricity company of Kaua'i has started incorporating a range of  measures to reduce powerline collisions, including moving lines  underground, lowering them, fitting diverters and testing a ‘laser  fence’ on key lines to make them more visible to birds moving at night  (Griesmer and Holmes 2011, N. Holmes and A. Raine <em>in litt. </em>2016). Several lawsuits have already been brought forward for violations under the Endangered Species Act (Harrison 2009), including against a hotel which was responsible for over one quarter of all birds downed as a result of light pollution. However, there is still a considerable amount of infrastructure that needs to be modified. It is not expected that the threat posed by artificial lighting will ever be completely eliminated (N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Yet overall, significant improvements have been made to reduce light attraction and collision (N. Holmes <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>.  Over 30,000 downed birds have been rescued and released through the  Save Our Shearwaters programme since 1979 (Raine <em>et al.</em> 2017),  although few of  these birds have subsequently been found again (NSWG 2005, D.

Establish predator-free colonies through fencing, trapping of predators, and use social attraction to entice shearwaters to nest within (Griesemer and Holmes 2011, D. Ainley <em>in litt. </em>2016).

Anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk31280999"">The IUCN Red List criteria prioritise indices of mature animals at their breeding area. I</a>n the absence of such data for the eel, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of European Eels, leaving ‘continental’ waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of (pre-) spawning stock biomass, but such data sets for migrating silver eel are low in number, spatially limited and only recent (most only since 2010). The index data best representing the geographic range of <em>A. anguilla</em><em>, </em>over adequate time scales to apply the Red List criteria<em>,</em><em> </em>relate to glass eels, but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood (Westerberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). While there are hypotheses that certain regions may have greater importance for the spawning stock (e.g. Dekker, 2004, Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011), evidence is lacking to support such hypotheses and to deviate from the common view that the European Eel is a panmictic species, i.e. all individuals come from a single spawning stock. As such, escapement from a specific river/country/region will not be directly reflected in subsequent recruitment as this relies on the spawning stock as a whole, irrespective of escapement location. Furthermore, it is most precautionary to assume that each and every part of the continental distribution area potentially contributes to the reproductive process, or that each part may be the key part (Dekker 1999). Therefore, the IUCN Red List criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the most comprehensive estimate.</p><p>Yellow and silver eel data for <em>A. anguilla </em>have an uneven geographical spread and do not fully represent the stock across its range. Nevertheless, a cursory analysis of these data found that over three generation lengths (39 years; see Habitat and Ecology), the mean decline in yellow and silver eels was found to be greater than 50% (see Population). Both analyses on yellow and silver eels indicated declines within the range of Endangered (EN) category. <a name=""_Hlk26366036""></a></p><p>Compounding these declines in escapement of maturing eels, are strong correlations between recruit series from sites over the range showing substantial declines during the period of the last three generations (Bornarel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The ICES recruitment index is 98.6% lower in the ‘North Sea’ series, and 94% lower in the ‘Elsewhere’ series, compared to the 1960–1979 reference level (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). It is noted, however, that the most recent statistical analyses conducted on these recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Due to the period of time eels spend feeding and growing prior to silvering and migrating to spawn, the numbers of silver eels may continue to decline, reflecting past declines in recruitment. </p><p>Sampling for leptocephali in the Sargasso Sea was undertaken in 2011, and results compared with previous sampling across the same area occurring in 1983 and 1985 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). The reduction in catch rate was 89% between 1983 and 2011, and 64% between 1985 and 2011 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation indicates a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding grounds over this time period, suggesting a lower abundance of spawners, higher egg and/or larval mortality and/or a reduction in spawning success. Thus, data on leptocephali and recruits to continental waters indicate declines within the range of Critically Endangered (CR). </p><p>A suite of threats have been implicated in the decline of European Eel recruitment and stock: barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines and pumps; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly&#160;<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>); exploitation of glass, yellow and silver eels; changing hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation.&#160;The significance of these threats individually or synergistically may vary across spatial range of the eel. Further research is required to fully quantify and understand the complexities of individual and combined threats.</p><p>Eel Management Plans (EMPs) have been developed in European Union Member States after implementation of the EU Council Regulation No 1100/2007 relating to the recovery of the European Eel (EU 2007). The Regulation set the objective of each EMP to be to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock” (EU 2007), and that EMPs would be prepared with the purpose of achieving this objective in the long term. </p><p>A number of management measures are being implemented in line with EMPs,&#160;including control of fisheries, bypassing turbines and pumps, easing of barriers and restocking - transfer of eel from one watershed to another. Quantifying the effects of these measures on silver eel escapement biomass is complicated in many cases because (i) measures are not implemented in isolation, making it difficult to identify individual contributions, and (ii) measures affecting earlier life stages will take years to influence silver eels, and ultimately spawning stock. There remains a great deal of debate as to whether restocking benefits the eel spawning stock and thus enhances future recruitment. Regulations and management actions currently focus on increasing escapement from continental waters, although these do not take account of eel condition or quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). &#160;&#160;</p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). It was concluded that the Regulation has been important in catalysing activity towards the recovery of the European Eel and remains a relevant document (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). However, despite progress, the eel remains in a critical condition and recovery could take decades, and further ambition is required (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>).</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2007,&#160;&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;was listed in Appendix II of CITES (the&#160;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species&#160;of Wild Fauna and Flora)&#160;due to concerns over the impact of international trade on this species (this listing came into force in March 2009).&#160;In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded it was not possible to perform a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF) for this species (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). Exports out of, and imports into, the European Union (EU), have since ceased due to ongoing concerns over the decline in recruitment and stocks. However, trade continues within the EU and from non-EU countries within its range to other non-EU countries. In 2014, <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> was also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).</p><p>The limited understanding of the complex relationship between recruitment, growth phase, and escapement makes it difficult to determine how declines in one will affect the other. However, it has been concluded that low recruitment will very likely ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement for, at least one generation length (13 years; see Habitat and Ecology). Further, since there is a short time period (~two years) between spawning and subsequent glass eel abundance, low recruitment has been proposed to be indicative of low breeding stock. As such it was deemed appropriate to assign&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;a Critically Endangered (CR) listing under current observations and future projected reductions of mature individuals (A2bd+4bd).</p><p>This category status remains unchanged from the previous assessment. Ultimately the CR category accounts for a proportional decline in population over a continental scale and this species has undergone a substantial decline over the last three generations. Although implementation of management measures has shown improvement, there is still concern over the effectiveness of EMPs to generate recovery to historic reference state within an appropriate timeframe, in the context of multiple threats (European Commission 2020). Continued, and ideally increased, effort will be essential in promoting recovery. A drive to fill data gaps – particularly in relation to the southern range of this species – would allow a more spatially comprehensive assessment in the future. </p><p>                          </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is found in a range of habitats from small streams to large rivers and lakes, and in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters (ICES 2015). It also occupies open ocean areas during migrations but is rarely observed in this habitat. Under natural conditions, it only occurs in water bodies that are connected to the sea; it is stocked elsewhere.<br/> <br/> <strong>Ecology:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is facultatively catadromous, living in fresh, brackish and coastal waters but migrating to pelagic marine waters to breed (Tsukamoto <em>et al. </em>1998, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2000). While there is some understanding of the eel’s continental life history, relatively little is known about its marine phase. The migrations in the European Eel’s life cycle are the longest and most oceanographically complex of the Anguillid species (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2002). </p><p>There are no exact data about specific spawning sites, however, it is hypothesised that spawning takes place in an elliptic zone, about 2,000 km wide in the Sargasso Sea, in the West Central Atlantic (from 70° W and eastward to 50° W) (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2019). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). The adults are assumed to die after spawning (Tesch 2003). Oceanic migration of leptocephali is estimated to take about two years on average before they arrive at the continental shelf (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The mechanisms by which leptocephali reach the European and N. African coasts are not well understood. In the Atlantic region, recruitment has been found to follow a South to North gradient over a period of around four to five months (ICES 2020). This starts in September in the North-West and occurs progressively later in the Channel and North Sea (ICES 2020). Recruitment to the Mediterranean is slightly more complex, publications suggest most eel ascent occurs between December and March, and landings suggest a peak in January. Although in some areas, recruitment occur over a wider period, even year-round (ICES 2020). <br/> <br/> Glass eels enter freshwater as sexually undifferentiated individuals. Development and differentiation of the sexual organs are thought to be closely correlated with body size and associated with the yellowing phase of the life history. Sex determination is principally driven by environmental factors with density-dependence producing more males at high densities (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Male European eels initially grow faster than females, however, females achieve a greater age and size than males when sexually mature. Furthermore, the mean length increases significantly with latitude in females but not males, whereas age increases significantly in both (Durif <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. Aprahamian unpub. data). Male fitness is maximised by maturing at the smallest size that allows a successful spawning migration (a time minimising strategy) such that males tend to emigrate at a length of &lt;450 mm (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Conversely, females adopt a more flexible size-maximising strategy prior to migration that trades off pre-reproductive mortality against fecundity (Davey and Jellyman 2005). There is considerable geographic variation in mean length at metamorphosis of male and female European eels (Vøllestad 1992). Dekker <em>et al</em>. (1998) described the extreme sizes in each of the life stages of the European eel from data at a long-term capture locality in the Netherlands, this paper also discussed the international situation, finding no more extreme values (sizes (cm): Min–Max, glass eels: 5.4–9.2, yellow: 6.9–133.0, silver (Male): 21.2–44.4, Silver (Female): 26.4–101.0). Driven by density-dependence, there are often skewed sex ratios at individual localities as well as geographic bias associated with latitude.<br/> <br/> Eel growth increases with temperature, as documented in aquaculture (Sadler 1979, Dosoretz and Degani 1987, Holmgren 1996, Ciccotti and Fontenelle 2001), and growth rate is generally faster in saline water than fresh (Acou <em>et al</em>. 2003, Daverat and Tomas 2006, Cairns <em>et al</em>. 2009). Furthermore, those individuals produced in saline waters usually have significantly higher fat content and contain lower loads of the swim bladder parasite, <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> and thus may have improved chances of reaching their spawning grounds (ICES 2009, Marohn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Body burden of toxic compounds, that are thought to affect migration and reproductive success, are also variable over regions and river basins, dependent on local pollution pressure (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016). During the growth phase, dependent on size, eels feed on a variety of organisms including fish, amphipods and decapod crustaceans. In saline muddy-bottomed habitats, eels forage on bivalves, shrimp, small fish and polychaete worms. The tendency towards piscivory has been linked to eel length: there is evidence that eels &gt;40 cm have the ability to consume larger prey such as fish or crustaceans (Moriarty 1974, Mann and Blackburn 1991, Yalçın-Özdilek and Solak 2007). Lammens <em>et al</em>. (1985) observed periods of low chironomid biomass to be a factor resulting in eels switching to prey on fish. In a comparison of two lakes in Germany, piscivory in eels was also concluded to be controlled by macrozoobenthos density (Dörner <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>      </p><p>The age at which eels undergo the transformation to the silver stage and undertake their spawning migration, is hugely variable and dependent on latitude and temperature of the environment in which they have grown, food availability, physical barriers that block migration routes, growth rate and sex differences. Estimates for average ranges of the continental growth phase were suggested as approximately 2–15 years for males and 4–20 years for females (Tesch 2003) – noting that much older individual eels occur especially in the latter. Durif <em>et al</em> (2009) examined a number of data sets from across the species range in relation to age at silvering which indicated a range of 2 to 15 years for males and 2 to 30 years for females. From these ranges, an estimated generation length of 13 years was used for this assessment, inclusive of a two-year larval migration and one-year spawning migration of silver eels (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has however been stated that there is variability in the accuracy of the methods used to age eels (ICES 2015). Assessment of available data on generation length during the IUCN Red List process highlighted that defining the required single generation length value for species with a broad range of ages-at-maturation such as eels was extremely difficult. Factors that can significantly affect this parameter include longitude and latitude, sex, growth rates, habitat quality and resource availability.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is susceptible to a number of natural and anthropogenic threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat loss/degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). The occurrence and significance of these threats varies considerably from area to area across the species range. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Dekker 2004, Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures (listed below), are less likely to have a significant positive effect on the stock than a combined approach. </p><p>There is a significant body of information including a great deal of contradiction in peer-reviewed and grey literature, and in expert opinion, relating to these threats. The assessment process and accompanying external review indicated that a comprehensive discussion of these threats and their impacts was significantly beyond the scope of this assessment. Below, all suspected threats are listed (in alphabetical order), with some (but not all) key references and a very brief synopsis of these threats. This is by no means comprehensive and does not attempt to fully dissect the wide range of views and data on these pressures. As such, a robust and comprehensive analysis of the existing data and opinion on factors linked to the decline in abundance of the European Eel would be extremely timely.</p><p>Barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2006, Acou <em>et al</em>. 2008, Azeroual 2010, van der Meer 2012, Clavero and Hermoso 2015, Wright <em>et al</em>. 2015, Besson <em>et al</em>. 2016, Mota <em>et al</em>. 2016, Bernaś <em>et al</em>. 2016, Dainys <em>et al.</em> 2017, Piper <em>et al</em>. 2018, Verhelst <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>a,b</em><em>,</em><em> </em>Hanel<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2019).</p><p>Climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents (including the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)), and climate related hydrological changes (reduced precipitation, drought) (Castonguay <em>et al</em>. 1994, Dekker 2004, Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004, Minegishi <em>et al.</em> 2005, Bonhommeau <em>et al</em>. 2008, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Durif <em>et al</em>. 2011, Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pacariz <em>et al</em>. 2014, Miller and Tsukamoto 2016, Politis <em>et al</em>. 2017, ICES 2018<em>c</em>).</p><p>Disease and parasites (particularly <em>Anguillicola crassus</em>) (De Charleroy <em>et al.</em> 1990, Würtz and Taraschewski 2000, Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, van Ginneken <em>et al</em>. 2004, Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2005, Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sjöberg <em>et al</em>. 2009, Haenen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Becerra-Jurado <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kempter <em>et al</em>. 2014, Weclawski <em>et al</em>. 2014, Wysujack <em>et al</em>. 2014, Muñoz <em>et al</em>. 2015, Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017, Hafir-Mansouri <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/> <br/> Legal and illegal exploitation and trade of eels (ICES 2012, 2013, 2018<em>c</em>; Crook 2010, 2014; Shiraishi and Crook 2015, Dekker and Beaulaton 2016, Stein <em>et al</em>. 2016, Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2018, Musing <em>et al. </em>2018, Dekker 2019, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/> <br/> Habitat loss (and associated resource decline) (Boëtius and Boëtius 1980, Svedäng and Wickström 1997, van Ginneken and van den Thillart 2000, Feunteun 2002, Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Pollutants (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Maes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010, Sühring <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2014, 2015, Kammann <em>et al. </em>2014,<em> </em>Szlinder-Richert <em>et al</em>. 2014, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016, 2019, Claveau <em>et al</em>. 2015, Fernández-Vega <em>et al</em>. 2015, Jürgens <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rosabel <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rudovica and Bartkevics 2015, Caron <em>et al</em>. 2016, Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017, 2019, Maes <em>et al</em>. 2008, Michel <em>et al.</em> 2016, Polak-Juszczak and Nermer 2016, Castro <em>et al.</em> 2018, De Meyer <em>et al</em>. 2018, Nowosad <em>et al</em>. 2018, Rakocevic <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>Predation (Carpentier <em>et al</em>. 2009, DEFRA 2010, Simpson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Wahlberg <em>et al</em>. 2014, Wysujack <em>et al</em>. 2015, Amilhat <em>et al</em>. 2016, Hansson <em>et al</em>. 2018, Ovegård 2017, Lennox <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/> <br/> <strong>Summary:</strong> </p><p>Barriers to upstream and downstream migration are a threat to the European Eel through reduction of available habitat - pumps or hydropower turbines and their associated screens and water management systems can also cause mortality or sub-lethal injury (ICES, 2019). In the AMBER (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers) project has begun tracking barriers across Europe, compiling them into a ‘Barrier Atlas’ to better inform management and conservation (AMBER International 2019). The project is ongoing, but so far around 415,000 barriers - complete or partial, with degree of obstruction not often fully quantified - have been recorded within this tool (AMBER International 2019). Relating in particular to hydropower, 21,387 plants are recorded currently in existence in Europe, with a further 278 under construction, and 8,507 planned (Schwarz <em>et al</em>. 2019).<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> In the Iberian Peninsula, 80% of eel habitat had been lost when compared to a 19<sup>th</sup> century baseline, as a result of dams causing fragmentation (Clavero and Hermoso 2015). A full life cycle model developed by Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. (2015) suggested the decline of the European Eel between 1975 and 1985 may be somewhat attributed to habitat loss. The model projected a reduction in suitable eel habitat, by 16% in the Mediterranean and 71% in the North and Baltic seas (Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. 2015). Degradation and loss of available habitat is also exacerbated by development, flood control, water-level management and the abstraction of surface and ground water for both domestic and commercial use (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). For example, Portugal, Spain and Morocco have been impacted by dam construction and/or drought in recent decades (Kettle <em>et al.</em> 2011). Further, it has been hypothesised, that the decline in good quality habitat and associated resources may be causing a decline in body condition of escaping silver eels in parts of the range which may have effects on the success of migration and/or spawning due this species’, particularly the female’s, reliance on fat stores for reproductive success (van Ginneken and van den Thillart 2000).</p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in <em>A. anguilla</em> – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding area (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p><p>The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American Eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif <em>et al</em>. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to larval metamorphosis being impeded due to the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Miller and Tsukamoto 2016). <a name=""_Hlk13652216"">Using a high-resolution ocean model, Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. (2014) found ocean current variations to be a major driver in the onset of decline in European Eel recruitment that occurred in the early 1980s. Although after this period, the correlation between oceanic fluctuations and eel recruitment was lost, and lack of recovery was likely a result of other pressures (Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. 2014). </a>Pacariz <em>et al</em>. (2014), however, found that the overall success of larval drift from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958–2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson <em>et al</em>. (2012). Politis <em>et al</em>. (2017) found 18°C to be optimum temperature for spawning of <em>A. anguilla</em> under experimental conditions. The results suggested <em>A. anguilla</em> may inhabit a deeper layer of the Sargasso Sea during early life stages and may be vulnerable to changes in temperature as a result of ocean warming. A recent ICES WGEEL report described climate change and increasing ocean temperature under “new and emerging threats”, due to unusually warm and dry periods occurring throughout European countries (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). This warm and dry period resulted in higher water temperatures, reduced levels of dissolved oxygen, and in some cases habitat loss through drought, creating stressful conditions for eels and other freshwater biota (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). There were several reports of eel mortalities from European countries, connected to warmer water, increased instances of disease, or deaths that could not be explained (ICES2018<em>c</em>).</p><p>The parasite nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>), introduced when the Japanese Eel (<em>A. japonica</em>) was imported to Europe for culture in the early 1980s, is also thought to impact the ability of the European Eel to reach its spawning ground. There multiple proposed impacts which include a negative effect on silver stage physiology (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012); swimbladder damage which impairs swimming performance (Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007); and a reduced ability to cope with high pressure during their reproductive migration (Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sjöberg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Prevalence of <em>A. crassus</em> has been found to be higher in smaller eels (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017, Hafir-Mansouri <em>et al</em>. 2018), with the proposal that smaller eels feeding mainly on invertebrates have a greater infection intensity than larger, piscivorous eels, because of increased chance of encounter with infected invertebrate hosts (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p><p>Lipophilic pollutant contaminants and metals act as stressors within the continental stage of the European Eel life cycle (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). This can result in damage to the respiratory system, tissues and organs, alter the regular function of endocrine processes, osmoregulation, and haematological dynamics, as well as decreasing protein content, reducing the ability of an eel to cope with physiological stress (Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019, De Meyer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Lipids are essential for allowing normal migration and reproduction (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). As pollutants impair lipid metabolism and storage, it may reduce the ability of silver eels to migration (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). Chemicals stored by eels and released when fat stores are broken down during migration, could subsequently limit the capacity of the silver eels to complete their spawning migrations due to metabolic disruption (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al</em>.&#160; 2019). Further, there is concern that even if the spawning migration is completed that lipid stores containing xenobiotics may result in disrupted gonadogenesis and/or low-quality gametes, as well as transmission of pollutants to the larvae (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Sühring <em>et al</em>. 2015, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016;,Freese<em> et al.</em> 2017, 2019, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Nowosad <em>et al</em>. 2018). Ultimately, pollutants may be affecting eels at molecular and individual levels, but also scaling to population and community wide effects (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019). Lipophilic chemical pollutants have been identified as a cause of recruitment failure, although current policies focusing on increasing escapement from continental waters do not consider eel quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). To mitigate impacts of contaminants, it may be valuable for management to integrate methods to improve the condition and quality of both habitats and escaping eels (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). This may also be considered in relation to stocking activities, by ensuring eels have suitable, unpolluted rearing habitat (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Predation also represents a threat to <em>A. anguilla</em> and is increasingly being discussed in relation to competition with commercial and recreational fisheries. Cormorants in particular have been a focus of recent research, which has found eel consumption by cormorants to be of a similar quantity to that of fishery landings in both the Baltic Sea (Hansson <em>et al</em>. 2018) and some lakes in Sweden (Ovegård 2017). Human factors may exacerbate the threat. Under experimental conditions, acoustic disturbance has been found to reduce anti-predation behaviour in eels, affecting likelihood of survival (Simpson <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>Unsustainable exploitation is a threat to the species. Fishing for the European Eel began with small scale fisheries up to the late 1800s, before shifting during the mid-1900s to larger scale, commercial exploitation, with production peaking between 1960–70 (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016, Dekker 2019, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Across its distribution, all continental stages of the European Eel are currently exploited although data from different regions varies in quality and period of collection. Trade of European Eel continues within the European Union (EU) for consumption, culture and stocking, although export from the EU has been banned since 2010 although over this time period commercial landings of yellow and silver eels have remained relatively consistent (around 2000–3000 tonnes) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>) (see Conservation). Indeed, it seems that yellow/silver eels are declining while glass eel catches increase (European Commission 2020<em>a</em>).</p><p>                          </p><p>Despite the ban on trade outside of the EU, under-reporting, illegal fishing (poaching) and illegal trade are believed to occur throughout the range of the European Eel fisheries (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is little information regarding illegal exploitation of the European Eel, which is thought to be driven mainly by demand from East Asia for use as a substitute for <em>Anguilla japonica</em>, due to the reduced abundance of glass eels of this species (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Assessment of the impact of this component of fishery exploitation is therefore extremely difficult. Export of European Eel outside of EU borders is visible through trade statistics, and enforcement agencies report the tonnage of successful operations where shipments have been intercepted, and seizures made (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). A review of exploitation, including an attempt to understand the scale of eel trafficking for the European Eel was conducted by Stein and Dekker in Kaifu <em>et al</em>. (2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>Determining changes in the stock of European Eel is difficult due to limited data and the poor understanding of the relationship between recruitment, eels in continental waters, and escapement. Not only can there be a large time lag (10's of years) between the recruitment of glass eels to fresh and brackish water and the subsequent escapement of silver eels, but given that <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is panmictic, escapement from one area does not translate directly into returning larval recruitment at the same locality. Indeed, for all intents and purposes it is assumed that practically nothing is known about the population dynamics of the oceanic phase of <em>A. anguilla</em> (ICES 2013<em>a</em>). </p><p>Assessment of datasets using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria took into account the following: consistency of sampling; longevity of the data set; whether data were eel-specific or multi-species; whether the collection methods were active or passive; whether the watershed the data related to was subject to restocking activity; and/or whether, in the case of fisheries independent data, there was exploitation in the region.</p><p>There are more available datasets for <em>A. anguilla</em> in northern, central and southern European countries compared to North Africa. For the purposes of analysing recruitment trends, ICES often refers to the North Sea subpopulation in separate terms to the rest of Europe. This is because the rate of decline in abundance of <em>A. anguilla </em>recruitmen<em>t </em>has been shown to be substantially greater for this area compared to elsewhere (ICES 2012), although this declining trend can be mostly accounted for during the period between 1980 and 1985. Declines in both the North Sea and elsewhere indices are presented and considered. Unless otherwise stated, data were accessed through relevant contacts in the EIFAAC/ICES/GFCM Working Group on Eels (WGEEL).<br/> <br/> </p><p><strong>Glass and Yellow Eel Recruitment:&#160;</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Glass eel and young-of-year recruitment data used to inform this assessment were taken from the analysis provided in ICES (2019<em>a</em>). Data used in the ICES recruitment index were from Norway, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium in the “North Sea” series, and UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy in the “Elsewhere” series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment is based largely on data from the Baltic area where only yellow stage eels are recruited (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). <br/> <br/> Since the early 1980s, a steady and almost continent-wide decline has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels. The ICES recruitment index fell to its lowest historical level in 2012: less than 1% for the North Sea and 5% elsewhere in the distribution area with respect to recruitment from between 1960–1979 (ICES 2012). In the most recent ICES report, the provisional 2019 recruitment index was at 1.4% of the 1960–1979 reference level in the ‘North Sea’ series, and at 6.0% in the ‘Elsewhere’ series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These provisional values for 2019 show a slight decrease from final 2018 values, which were 1.9% in the ‘North Sea’ index, and 8.9% in the ‘Elsewhere’ index (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). However, statistical analyses conducted on recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment to European waters was 26.4% of the 1960–1979 reference in 2018 (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Data collection for 2019 was stated to be ongoing and so not available at the time of publication (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). The overall decline in recruitment will likely continue to influence adult stock for at least one generation length (ICES 2012). <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Yellow Eel (standing stock): </strong><br/> There were few time-series data sets available to this assessment for the yellow eel life stage, and they only cover a small amount of the geographical range. Data sets were made available from Skagerrak (southern Norway), Den Burg (Netherlands) and the East Anglian River Basin District (RBD) in the UK (Rivers Blackwater, Colne, Chelmer, Stour) (Environment Agency 2019). Skagerrak and Den Burg data derive from beach seines and fyke nets, respectively, and the East Anglian RBD data derive from electrofishing surveys. Data from Skagerrak contained mostly yellow eels, with some silvers, whereas the other data sets were for yellow eel only.<br/> <br/> The analyses of yellow eel data suggest declines that were not as severe as that of recruitment:&#160;in the East Anglian RBD, the mean decline&#160;was between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data,&#160;over a period of three generation lengths (39 years);&#160;in Skagerrak and Den Burg, the mean decline mirrored this trend.&#160;There is a variety of published literature describing abundance trends in yellow eels not captured within this analysis - note the following examples are not comprehensive. In the Bristol Channel, sampling conducted between 1981 and 2009 at power station cooling water intakes found yellow eel abundance to decline by 15% per year, to 1% of the level in 1980 (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, abundance decline has been documented in the River Meuse, in Belgium (Matondo and Ovidio 2016), and Ireland, in both the Foyle Estuary (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Lough Sheelin, in the upper River Shannon catchment (MacNamara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Conversely, a study to establish the status of stocks in England and Wales found rivers along the West coast, and some in the northeast remained similar, whereas declines were observed in the south-east (Bark <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fisheries-independent monitoring conducted on six sites along the Swedish west coast found yellow eel CPUE to display a slow increase between 1975 and 2003, after which it decreased, before increasing again from around 2011 (Andersson <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Declines in yellow eels were identified earlier than that of glass eel recruitment, occurring since the 1960’s (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016). The less pronounced decline in the yellow eel data analysed here compared to those reported for glass eel indices could be partially due to density-dependent mortality confounding the effects of changes in recruitment (Svedäng 1999). However, it needs to be taken into account that the age range of yellow eels is broad and that there may very well be a time lag in knock-on effects. As such, any increase in recruitment would not be expected to be immediately mirrored in a rise in yellow eel numbers, indeed, it is possible that this life stage may continue to decline. </p><p><strong>Silver Eels:</strong><strong><br/> </strong><br/> For silver eels, there is similar uneven geographical spread of data.&#160;Data sets of silver eel escapement were available from France (MNHN-Dinard and UMS PatriNat unpub. data.), Norway and Ireland and were collected from scientific surveys. Note that the silver eel escapement estimates generated for EMPs are only available from 2010 and therefore not dating back long enough to be used in these analyses.</p><p>Based on these data, silver eel decline does not appear as pronounced as for recruitment indices but, similar to yellow eels (standing stock), they indicated a mean decline of&#160;&#160;between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data, over the period of three generation lengths (39 years).&#160;Again, the less pronounced decline compared to recruitment indices may be due to density-dependent mortality at previous life stages, but it cannot be ruled out that a decline in silver eel escapement may continue despite increases in recruitment and/or yellow eels due to the long generation time.&#160;&#160;</p><p><em>Note</em>: The 2019 ICES data call included a request for available data on abundance trends for the standing stock of yellow and silver eels (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Information collected for yellow eels included long-term monitoring across various habitats for 70 sites, and for silver eels across 28 sites (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These data have not been reported by ICES yet, but future analysis will provide a more accurate understanding of the situation.</p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> has been included in a number of regional and national Red List assessments in Europe over the past 10 years. The European Eel has been assessed as Critically Endangered across Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011), for the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM 2007), as well as in Sweden (Gärdenfors 2010), Denmark (NERI 2009), France (UICN Comité français, MNHN, SFI and AFB 2019), Ireland (King <em>et al</em>. 2011) and north Belgium (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). Indeed, the European Eel showed the largest negative trend of any of the freshwater fishes (-75%) in the Belgian report (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Norway the status is now Vulnerable (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015).<br/> <br/> For the North African range there is considerably less information. A regional Red List assessment in North Africa suggests that <em>A. anguilla</em> is Endangered due to a decline in recruitment of 50% in the last 10 years with annual catches declining by between 10 and 25% since the 1980s, and by more in Tunisia alone (Azeroual 2010).</p><p>Currently, the best estimate metric for translation into the IUCN criteria for ‘Mature Individuals’ is the silver eel life stage, although this has its limitations. Following escapement from continental waters, there is the possibility that a proportion of silver eels may succumb to the effects of sub-lethal impacts incurred during growth / escapement and/or be predated before reaching the breeding area to spawn. </p><p>                      </p><p>An alternative metric that could be used in place of silver eel escapement is numbers of leptocephali collected close to the breeding area, as this would also give an indication of the state of the spawning stock. In 2011, sampling across the breeding area for <em>A. anguilla, A. rostrata</em> and other non-anguillid species was conducted, following the same methods as previous sampling in this area that occurred in 1983 and 1985, just after the beginning of the decline in eels occurred in 1980 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). Results from this study were compared with the previous sampling, and significantly lower numbers of European Eel leptocephali were collected in 2011, with a reduction in catch rate of 89% and 64% compared to sampling in 1983 and 1985, respectively (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation depicts a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding area over this time period, suggesting a reduction in the spawning stock, and correlating with the reduction in recruitment to continental waters. This is of great concern for the future resilience of the population.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> occurs in most inland waters of Europe and is distributed from North Cape in northern Norway, southwards along the coast of Europe, all coasts of the Mediterranean and on the North African coast (Schmidt 1909, Dekker 2003<em>b</em>). It very rarely enters the White and Barents seas, but it has been recorded eastward to the Pechora River in northwest Russia. The species occurs in low abundance in the Black Sea region where it migrates east to the Kuban drainage (occasional individuals reach the Volga drainage through canals). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> also occurs in northern Scandinavia and eastern Europe. A report by the ICES Study Group on Anguillid Eels in Saline Waters (SGAESAW) indicates that eel stocks can contain a mix of freshwater residents, saline water residents, and inter‐habitat migrants (ICES 2009). The continental distribution of the European Eel is over an area of approximately 90,000 km²&#160;in Europe and parts of North Africa (Moriarty and Dekker 1997), with a substantially larger range if their marine distribution is considered. </p><p>For several decades prior to a cessation of import to, and export from, the EU in 2010, <em>A. anguilla</em> was also exported to Asia for seed stock in eel farms (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species may well have been introduced in some parts of Asia (through escape or release from farms, e.g. Arai <em>et al</em>. 2017), however these will not contribute to the spawning stock and therefore areas of introduction have been excluded in the range information. </p><p>    </p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring, before eggs hatch and leptocephalus larvae migrate back across the Atlantic to begin the continental phase of their life history (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk17388906""></a><a name=""_Hlk17388861"">The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver</a>, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There is clear evidence for this in the case of <em>A. anguilla</em>. Traditionally, European Eel was consumed within its European and North African range states – yellow and silver eels were fished for direct consumption, and glass eels were caught for farming and also for consumption (mainly in Spain). Although still consumed within Europe, in recent decades European Eel became increasingly important in fulfilling demand in East Asia (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crook 2010, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>According to FAO data, total annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production (catch and aquaculture) has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Historically, eel farms used species of local provenance. France, Spain, Portugal and the UK are the principal fishing nations for glass eels, and Italy, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands the main producers of farmed European Eel for consumption within Europe. However, towards the end of the 1990s, a decline in stocks of Japanese Eels, combined with the apparently cheap and abundant supplies of European Eel glass eels, led to many Asian eel farms in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, supplementing farms with the European Eel (<a name=""_Hlk17273106"">Briand <em>et al</em>. 2008</a>, Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>Concerns over the impact international trade was having on European Eel led to it being listed in Appendix II of CITES in 2007. This listing came into force on 13 March 2009 – since then any international trade in this species needs to be accompanied by a permit. In December 2010, however, the European Union (EU) decided to ban all imports and exports of European Eel to and from the EU, as authorities felt they were unable to determine that trade would not be detrimental to the conservation of the species (a requirement for issuance of permits for CITES Appendix II-listed species). There were a number of exceptions to this ban: trade in “pre-Convention” specimens was permitted until the end of 2015), and internal EU trade is still allowed. Trade from non-EU range States to non-EU countries also still occurs (Musing <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>Global FAO catch data for European Eel are available for the period of 1950–2017, peaking at nearly 20,000 t in 1968 but declining thereafter and between 2013 and 2017, annual catches averaged just over 3,000 t. Over 60% of these catches were reported by five EU Member States: Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The principal non-EU range States reporting catches (10% of the total) were Egypt, Norway, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco (FAO 2019). Fishing of various life stages continues in a number of range States, but in many cases, catch is now being limited by quotas or other measures set as part of National Eel Management Plans, fulfilling requirements outlined in Eel Regulation - see Conservation Measures. Reported annual glass eel landings in the EU have declined since 1980, to 62.2 t in 2018, and 58.6 t in 2019 (provisional) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years. According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight; China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown in farms, which includes <em>A. anguilla </em>(Musing<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2018).</p><p>Due to a lack of species-specific Customs data, the precise quantities of European Eel in trade are still unknown. However, imports reported by East Asian Customs of live juvenile <em>Anguilla</em> eels from European Eel range States for farming purposes (defined as “live eel fry” in East Asia) provide a good indication of the amount of European glass eels in trade outside of the EU (both legal and illegal). Between 2003 and 2008, annual live eel fry imports from European eel range States to mainland China, Taiwan, Province of China, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong fluctuated between ~36 and 70 t. In 2009, annual imports dropped to ~9 t and in 2010 they increased again to nearly 28 t. Since 2011, reported annual imports of live eel fry from <em>A. anguilla </em>range States remained less than 10 t. France and Spain were the principal source countries among <em>A. anguilla </em>range States until 2010 (when commercial<em> A. anguilla</em> trade to and from the EU was banned). Imports from non-EU <em>A. anguilla </em>range States, especially from Morocco, began in 2009 and gradually increased over the years, despite a ban for export of glass eels being imposed in this range state since 2013 (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). Due to the reduced availability of European glass eels over the last decade, increasing quantities of glass eels of other <em>Anguilla</em> species have also been imported into East Asia to fulfil demand in farms (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>Since 2009, species-specific CITES trade data for European eel have been reported. Between 2009 and 2016, over 1000 t of live <em>A. anguilla </em>and another ~1000 t of meat/bodies were reportedly exported from a number of European Eel range States (mainly Morocco and Tunisia). Main destinations were Korea and Hong Kong. In addition, over 50,000 t of meat/bodies were re-exported, mainly from China to Japan (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There are serious concerns over illegal harvesting and trade of <em>A. anguilla.</em> In recent years, authorities have increasingly reported the involvement of organised criminal networks in the movement of legally and illegally sourced European glass eels from the EU to East Asia, principally to China, and have seen traders regularly change travelling routes and their <em>modus operandi </em>to circumvent controls (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). In 2015, EUROPOL initiated Operation LAKE, a European initiative aimed at combatting illegal eel trade. Under this umbrella, there have been a number of investigations into eel smuggling in air freight and personal luggage. For example, in 2017, Greek and Spanish authorities dismantled an international criminal network suspected of having smuggled 10 t of eels from the EU to China; raids led to the arrest of 32 individuals and seizure of 2 t of <em>A. anguilla </em>worth EUR 2 million (Europol 2017). However, European Eel appears to still be in the supply chain in East Asia – a recent paper indicated it was prevalent in supermarket products in Hong Kong (Richards&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>While there is demand for the species, pressures from trade, and unknown quantities in illegal trade, continue to be a serious conservation concern for the species. </p><p>                    </p><p>A detailed recent analysis of trade in <em>A. anguilla</em>, including Customs, CITES and seizure data, is provided in Musing <em>et al. </em>(2018).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The majority of conservation actions historically in place for the European eel were set up and controlled at local and national level, often with little coordination, which is of particular concern when dealing with a panmictic stock. Protection can be achieved effectively at a national or local level, distributed throughout individual management units, but an international objective is necessary to orchestrate this management (Dekker 2016).<br/> <br/> The Eel Regulation (EC Regulation 1100/2007; EU 2007) is an EU-wide recovery plan for the European Eel, adopted in 2007. As instructed by the regulation, EU member states have been developing and implementing Eel Management Plans (EMPs) with the objective to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.” (EU 2007). Member States are responsible for implementing measures to achieve their targets, and most actions have focussed on commercial and recreational fisheries, followed by hydropower-pumping station obstacles, and measures on habitat, restocking, and predator control (ICES 2013<em>b</em>,&#160;European Commission 2020<em>a</em>). Other actions expected to have indirect effects, such as implementing monitoring programmes and scientific studies, have been almost as common as controls on fisheries (ICES 2013<em>b</em>).</p><p>In a review of EMPs, eel biomass per hectare fell within a narrow range for most countries, apart from France and Spain, whose values were higher than what was reported for other countries (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). The most recent reporting (2018) did not provide mortality rate estimates for all EMPs, and therefore rates could not be summed to reflect the state of impacts across Europe (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). In December 2017, EU Member States reached an agreement prohibiting fishing for eels &gt;12 cm in marine waters of the Atlantic and North Sea over a three-month period (determined by each Member State) between 2018 and 2019 to aid eel recovery (Council of the EU 2018). In 2019, in line with measures implemented by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), this decision extended the mandatory closures to recreational and glass eel fisheries covering brackish waters (Council of the EU 2019).</p><p> As part of the EMPs, any Member State that allowed fishing for eels of &lt;12 cm total was required to reserve a minimum of 60% of their catch from 31 July 2013 onwards for restocking purposes (i.e. restocking waters with glass eels from elsewhere). Although there is evidence showing restocking to be beneficial at enhancing silver eel production within water bodies, the overall effectiveness of restocking programmes at enhancing the spawning stock remains open to debate (ICES 2016). Reviews (ICES 2012, 2016, Pawson 2012) on the contribution of restocking to the recovery of the panmictic European Eel state that there are major knowledge gaps to be filled before firm conclusions can be drawn either way. Until restocking studies are accompanied by suitable controls of areas without translocation, it is very difficult to determine whether there is a net increase in silver eel escapement or differences in growth rates and/or sex ratios in manipulated populations (Pawson 2012). </p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). Overall, escapement of silver eels remains below the 40% target biomass (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Catches of yellow and silver eel life stages were found to have declined, while glass eel catch has been steadily increasing (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Overall, there has been progress towards a reduction in fishing effort, but in some Member States’ effort has risen (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Anthropogenic mortality unrelated to fishing has not significantly declined, and this has received little focus in the EMPs and related actions (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). The report ultimately stated ""The Regulation’s success in ensuring the recovery of the European eel is still far from certain, as it is widely recognised that the recovery of the European eel will take many decades. In this respect, further ambition is needed to implement the Regulation with a greater focus on non-fisheries related measures.""</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In addition to the Eel Regulation, in 2007, the European eel was included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (CITES 2007). The listing came into effect on 13 March 2009, after which time exporters were required to acquire permits. An export permit may be issued only if the specimen was legally obtained and export is deemed non-detrimental to the survival of the species i.e. a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF). In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded an NDF was not possible for this species, and so a zero import/export policy was set for the EU, which is still in place (EC 2010, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2018, several reports investigating the challenges and lessons learnt in relation to implementing the Appendix II listing, including its enforcement and illegal trade were published (CITES 2018, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2008, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2010). In 2014, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) to catalyse collaborative conservation across range States, providing additional support for conservation and monitoring of the species (CMS 2014). Since the listing there have been three range state meetings in order to develop a mechanism under which signatories will work. At the most recent CMS Conference of the Parties in 2020, it was agreed a species Action Plan would be developed for the European Eel.</p><p>              </p><p>Across Europe, programmes for “trap and transport” (downriver transport), and “assisted migration” (upriver transport), are in place to provide eels with access to habitat that has been lost through the construction of migratory barriers. When applied to migrating silver eels, it can have a significant and immediate effect on local escapement. It is hoped that translocation can mitigate against the loss of habitat and positively contribute to enhanced escapement, and by association, future recruitment (e.g. for barriers: van der Meer 2012, McCarthy <em>et al.</em> 2014, Béguer-Pon <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is a necessity in the future, however, to reduce the level of direct human intervention by eliminating the barriers to navigation, or at least, providing more effective passage for eels.<br/> <br/> Continuous monitoring of eel escapement on a national or international scale is currently very rare and so in addition to localised monitoring, modelling has been explored for providing estimates of escapement in eel subpopulations. A number of assessment models have been developed; Demographic model of the Camargue (DemCam) (Bevacqua and De Leo 2006), Eel Density Analysis (EDA) (EDA 2.2: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2015, EDA 2.2.1: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2018), German Eel Model (GEM) (GEM II: Oeberst and Fladung 2012, GEM III: Oeberst and Fladung 2014), and, Scenario-based Model of Eel Production II (SMEP II) (SMEP: developed by El-Hosaini, Bark, Knights, Williams and Kirkwood; Aprahamian <em>et al</em>. 2007). Using time series eel data sets from a variety of locations across Europe, earlier iterations of these models were reviewed by Walker <em>et al.</em> (2011). The conclusions of this report suggest that all four models were capable of predicting escapement to a degree of accuracy (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/> <br/> In 2019,&#160; ICES stated that: “The status of European eel remains critical”, and that “all anthropogenic impacts (e.g. caused by recreational and commercial fishing on all stages, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) that decrease production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to,&#160; or kept as close as possible to,&#160; zero in 2020” (ICES 2019<em>b</em>). In 2019, provisional recruitment estimates remain low across the geographical range. Although, recruitment during the period of 2011–2019 has shown an increasing trend, statistically significant from zero.

It arrives on the breeding grounds from March<strong><sup> </sup></strong>where it breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups<strong></strong> in the northern spring (chiefly from mid-April to June) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Males undergo a post-breeding moult migration from early-May to early-June (females moulting one month later) during which they are flightless for 3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The autumn migration chiefly occurs between September and October (western Europe), during which the species is likely to travel on a broad front (e.g. across Arabia and into Africa) (Scott and Rose 1996)<strong></strong>. The species is usually found in pairs or small parties, although it often congregates when feeding (flocks of  20 or 30 to several hundred individuals occur in favoured areas in Africa <strong></strong>and large concentrations form at stop-over sites on migration) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. The species forages diurnally and roosts communally at night (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits permanent<strong></strong> shallow freshwater wetlands<strong></strong> from sea level up to 2,900 m (Ethiopia)<strong></strong>, preferred sites being those surrounded by dense stands of reeds or other emergent vegetation whilst being free of overhanging trees or fringing forest (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. Copious submerged aquatic vegetation sheltering abundant planktonic invertebrates is a valuable habitat characteristic (Johnsgard 1978)<strong></strong>. Suitable habitats include well-vegetated lakes and marshes and with muddy shores and substrates in open country (e.g. grasslands), as well as oxbow lakes, channels and swamps (former U.S.S.R.) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. It also frequents artificial waters bordered by lush grassland such as sewage farms, rice-fields and fish ponds (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005, Musil 2006)<strong></strong>. In the winter it can be found on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal muflats<strong></strong><strong></strong>, estuaries, coastal shorelines, fresh and brackish estuarine marshes, inland seas and brackish or saline inland waters<strong></strong>, occasionally occurring (briefly) on marine waters during migration (although it generally avoids very saline habitats) (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists of small aquatic invertebrates such as adult and larval insects (e.g. caddisfly larvae, damselfly and dragonfly nymphs, adult beetles, bugs <strong></strong>and flies), molluscs, planktonic crustaceans<strong></strong>, the seeds of emergent and aquatic plants (e.g. bulrushes and waterweeds)<strong></strong>, annelids, amphibian spawn, tadpoles, spiders, fish and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (e.g. duckweeds) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo<em> et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a scrape<strong></strong> or depression on the ground in tall grass, among hummocks, in the open<strong></strong> or (rarely) in bulrush marshes (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kear 2005)<strong></strong>. Usually the species nests close to water but if grass cover is unavailable in the wetland site it may also nest far away from water under bushes<strong></strong>, in hayfields or in meadows<strong></strong> (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, Kear 2005).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> African and Australasian populations of this species are non-migratory or only make local movements in response to seasonal habitat changes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Those populations in Europe and Asia, however, appear to be fully migratory, most flying southward from late-August to October and returning to the northern breeding areas from March to May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species breeds in solitary pairs in the spring, usually nesting during or just after the wet season (where this occurs) (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Langrand 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It is usually a solitary species, but can be found in pairs or family groups, and sometimes forages in small groups of up to 10 individuals in non-breeding areas (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species forages diurnally but is most active in the early morning and late afternoon or evening (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat </strong>The species frequents similar habitats throughout its range and throughout the year, although its breeding areas are characterised by low, dense, tussocky or continuous vegetation such as flooded sedges and grasses (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Langrand 1990, Marchant and Higgins 1993, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It inhabits freshwater, brackish or saline marshy wetlands, both inland and coastal (Australasia), permanent and temporary, with dense emergent and floating vegetation (especially reeds, rushes, sedges, tall dense grasses and <em>Typha</em> spp.) (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Marchant and Higgins 1993, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Typical habitats include marshes, swamps, peat bogs, flooded meadows, damp grassland, seasonally flooded pans and depressions, tussocky grassland interspersed with patches of mud on the margins of open water (e.g. lakes and reservoirs), pools in sand-dunes, swampy creeks, rivers and streams, tall reedbeds (2-3 m high) with extensive mud, shallow puddles and <em>Sesbania</em> bushes, and occasionally salt-marsh (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Marchant and Higgins 1993, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species also frequents marshy artificial wetlands such as irrigated fields of crops (e.g. rice), sewage ponds, salt-works, farm ponds and dense grassy vegetation in rural residential areas (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, Marchant and Higgins 1993, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Although the species shows a preference for shallowly flooded areas, breeding birds may occupy grassland and sedges flooded to a depth of 30 cm and will occur on floating vegetation or in tall shrubs flooded to a depth of 2 m (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet </strong>Its diet consists predominantly of adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, bugs, Odonata, stoneflies, caddisflies, flies and mosquitos), as well as annelids (up to 10 cm long), molluscs, small crustaceans (e.g. ostracods and copepods), small fish (up to 2 cm long), amphibians, and vegetative plant material and seeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is a shallow cup or platform of vegetation placed close to water on a grass tussock or in soft grass, usually 4-60 cm above the water level (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). Occasionally the nest may be floating or anchored to vegetation in water, or placed in or under low bushes (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Management information </strong>Changes in water level during the nesting period should be avoided, cutting and burning of vegetation near the waters edge should be controlled and the maintenance of natural vegetation around fish ponds and rice-fields should be encouraged (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).<strong></strong>","The species is threatened by degradation and loss of seasonal and ephemeral wetlands owing to drainage, overgrazing, cultivation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), reed-cutting, reed-burning and sudden changes in water levels caused by discharges from large dams (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).

Its principle food is carrion, with its diet including a large proportion of bones (as much as 85%) whereupon the bird gets nutrition from the marrow inside. The rest of its diet comprises tortoises, and occasionally also live mammals and birds. It is generally unwilling to compete with vultures at carcasses, and will wait patiently to feed, scavenging older carcasses if fresh meat is scarce. Bones are either consumed whole, broken using the bill, hammered against the ground, or lifted into the air and dropped from 50-80 m high onto hard rock.

EU Birds Directive Annex I. CMS Appendix II. Raptors MOU Category 1. A Multi-species Action Plan for African-Eurasian Vultures has been produced (Botha&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;In Europe, captive breeding and reintroduction programmes have been  carried out in the Austrian, French, Italian and Swiss Alps with  individuals subsequently spreading into other parts of France (Snow and  Perrins 1998, Frey and Walter 1989). Reintroduction programmes are underway in parts of Spain (J. A. Gil Gallus <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Feeding stations have been provided  in the Pyrenees with resulting increases in numbers of the species, and  the provision of similar stations across the species’s range could  improve its global population density (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). However, while these have helped to increase population growth and individual survival, they can have negative impacts on vultures; for instance they can lead to habitat saturation, with individuals' territories overlapping at these areas, and can lead to reduced productivity (Carrete <em>et al. </em>2009, Gil <em>et al. </em>2014). For example, the reintroduced population in the Central Alps increased exponentially between 1998 and 2015, but due to a high level of philopatry there has been little dispersal away from the initial release site, resulting in a high density of breeding pairs in the core area (Jenny <em>et al. </em>2018). Habitat saturation may also lead to polygyny (Gil <em>et al. </em>2017). Supplementary feeding in poor-quality territories and extraction of the extra young produced has successfully been used as a cheaper alternative to captive breeding for reintroduction programmes (Ferrer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017), however there are concerns that this may negatively impact the population from which the young are extracted (Margalida&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). A reintroduction programme was attempted in Kenya in 1999-2003 (S. Thomsett <em>in litt</em>. 2011). The species is monitored in Southern Africa, with an annual count day which not only aids in the monitoring of the species, but also raises awareness (Krüger 2015). A Single Species Action Plan for the conservation of the Western Palearctic population of Bearded Vulture was published in 2018 (Izquierdo <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct coordinated surveys to monitor the species's global population trend. Assess the threat posed by diclofenac and other drugs used in livestock, as well as the impacts of climate change and feral dogs. Reduce disturbance in and around nesting areas. Mitigate against the impacts of wind turbines and powerlines. Combat the threat of persecution through laws and awareness-raising activities. Provide feeding stations throughout the species's range. Try to address the illegal trade and use of vultures in medicine (Krüger 2015). Assess methods of negating the negative impacts that result from feeding stations (see Carrete <em>et al. </em>2009, Moreno-Opo <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;<br/>The Single Species Action Plan for the conservation of the Western Palearctic population of Bearded Vulture, <em>Gypaetus barbatus barbatus</em>, (2018) was prepared in the framework of the EuroSAP (LIFE14 PRE/UK/000002) LIFE project, produced by Vulture Conservation Foundation and co-ordinated by BirdLife International. It provides a comprehensive programme of research and conservation measures needed to conserve this species in its European range. As well as the actions mentioned above, it highlights the threat of lead poisoning, the need for collaboration with farmers to mitigate livestock-wildlife conflicts and the need to do more to conserve genetic diversity, including through creating a captive genetic reservoir.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Consequently it qualifies as Near Threatened. <p></p>","The species inhabits forested areas in hills and mountains at 300-1,400 m in Spain, but higher in Asia, where it also occupies scrub and arid and semi-arid alpine steppe and grasslands up to 4,500 m<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Thiollay 1994). It forages over many kinds of open terrain, including forest, bare mountains, steppe and open grasslands.  Nests are built in trees or on rocks (the latter extremely rarely in Europe but more frequently in parts of Asia), often aggregated in very loose colonies or nuclei.  Its diet consists mainly of carrion from medium-sized or large mammal carcasses, although snakes and insects have been recorded as food items. Live prey is rarely taken. In Mongolia, at least, the species is reliant on livestock numbers for successful nesting (Batbayar <em>et al</em>. 2006).  <p></p>","The two main threats to the species are direct mortality caused by humans (either accidentally or deliberately) and decreasing availability of food. The main cause of unnatural death is the use of poisoned baits for predator extermination<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b), although shooting and destruction of nests also occurs<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b; N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005), and they may accidentally get caught in traps set for other predators (Zhatkanbaev 2011)<strong></strong>. Shooting and poisoning are increasing in Mongolia<em></em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, and many birds are trapped or shot in China for their feathers. There are fears that veterinary application of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, which has caused the near-extinction of several <em>Gyps</em> vultures in India, may have a negative impact on <em>A. monachus</em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005; Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016)<strong></strong>, particularly as increasing numbers of the species are wintering in northern India<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(T. Katzner <em>in litt. </em>2005). The recent approval for commercialisation of veterinary diclofenac in Spain may have devastating effects on European vultures - in 2020 a Cinereous Vulture was confirmed as the first individual to die from veterinary diclofenac in Europe (BirdLife 2021). A study in central Spain during 2003-2005 found high concentrations of antibiotics in blood samples from 57% of nestlings tested<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Lemus <em>et al</em>. 2008). The same study found two antibiotics in the liver samples of all dead nestlings that were tested. It is hypothesised that antibiotic residues, particularly quinolones, cause liver and kidney damage, deplete lymphoid organs and alter bacteria flora, facilitating pathogenic bacterial and fungal infections<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Lemus <em>et al</em>. 2008). The anti-inflammatory drug nimesulide, suspected to be highly toxic is also considered to be present widely across Nepal (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2018). In Europe, decreased food availability was formerly caused by European Union legislation on carcass disposal<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004b), however, recently passed regulations will allow the operation of feeding stations for scavengers<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(A. Brunner <em>in litt</em>. 2010). In eastern Europe and central Asia, particularly in the former Soviet Union, changes in agricultural practices and human migration from the countryside to the cities have greatly reduced numbers of domestic livestock. In Georgia and Armenia, declines may be linked to the loss of subsidies for sheep-herding in the post-Soviet era (M. McGrady <em>in litt. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. Additionally, there have been steep declines in many populations of wild ungulates which provide a major food source for the species. The Saiga antelope (<em>Saiga tartarica</em>), for example, numbered over one million individuals ten years ago, and has now been reduced to a population of 30,000-40,000 owing to uncontrolled hunting and severe winters (W. Fremuth <em>in litt.</em> 2005). In South Korea, food limitation is a serious problem such that the species relies on supplementary food (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong style=""""></strong>. Habitat loss is also thought to be important<strong style=""""><sup> </sup></strong>(Anon. 2004). For instance, in Portugal, there may be suitable foraging areas, but nesting sites are limited (Lourenço <em>et al. </em>2013). The majority of brood losses occur during the incubation period and it is suspected this may be partially due to low and fluctuating temperatures (Batbayar <em style="""">et al</em>. 2006) and so changes in air temperatures resulting from climate change may be a potential future threat to the species. Nest abandonment can also occur as a result of disturbance, for instance cork exploitation (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2011). Recent studies surrounding the core population of Cinereous Vultures in the Balkans (thought to be genetically distinctive and geographically isolated) also found wind farms to be a potential threat towards the species (Vasilakis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Where operational wind farms existed, collision mortality was thought to affect c. 5-11% of the core population (Vasilakis&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Low mitochondrial diversity and demographic bottlenecks were also found in Turkish populations, likely preventing population expansion (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a, b). The exact effect genetic vulnerability however requires further investigation. Due to proximity to urban areas, electric shocks and collision can further impact migratory birds, especially across the species's migration route to China (Ming 2019).<br/><p></p>","The global population is estimated to number 8,400-11,400 pairs, equating to 16,800-22,800 mature individuals, or c.&#160;25,200-34,200 individuals. This consists of 2,900-3,400 pairs in Europe (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>) and 5,500-8,000 pairs in Asia (Anon. 2004).

It was considered to occasionally breed in Portugal, North Macedonia and Albania, but no longer breed in Slovenia, Italy, Cyprus, Moldova and Romania. However, the species was seen in Romania, Italian eastern Alps, and in northern France recently, as well as being recorded in a rehabilitation center in Jordan (Bowden and Botha 2017).&#160;Recolonisation was also confirmed in Portugal following reintroduction programmes (Bowden and Botha 2017).

Numbers are decreasing or fluctuating in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkey and the Ukraine<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2004; Barov and Derhé 2011; BirdLife International 2015), though new nesting areas have been recently found in Turkey (Kirazli and&#160;Yamaç 2013)<strong></strong>. A recent study moreover suggests that the Turkish population (the largest in the Western Palearctic) is likely to number c. 112 individuals, existing as a single subpopulation (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a). Overall, the European population underwent a large increase between 1990 and 2000, possibly &gt;30% overall<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2004;  I. Burfield <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong> and increased from 1,330-1,874 in 1993-1996 to 1,995-2,852 in 2000-2010 (Barov and Derhé 2011). The current European population trend is increasing (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).<br/><br/>Much less information is available regarding the status and population trends of the species in Asia, where the bulk of the global population resides.  There are probably over 1,000 pairs in the Asian part of Russia and a further 1,760 pairs in China<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Ye Xiao-Ti 1991).

Khan, A. Parveen and R. Yasmeen <em>in litt.</em> 2005) (where it is described as scarce), although fluctuations in distribution and breeding success occur, and populations within some nature reserves in Mongolia (where there are few domestic livestock) are declining<em></em> (N. Batbayar <em>in litt.</em> 2005).  In Kazakhstan, however, populations of all vulture species are in severe decline, owing to a precipitous decline in their main food resource, the Saiga antelope (<em>Saiga tartarica</em>) (W. Fremuth <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>. This trend may be mirrored in a number of other central Asian countries where populations of both domesticated livestock and wild ungulates have declined greatly in recent years<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(T. Katzner <em>in litt. </em>2005). Very little is known about population trends on its wintering grounds, although, in Nepal, wintering populations are declining in the east and possibly increasing in the west (but this may be due to better coverage) (Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016).<strong></strong>&#160;It may be increasing in India (T.

The Flyway Action Plan for the Conservation of the Cinereous Vulture (CVFAP) was additionally finalised in 2017 (Andevski <em>et al</em>. 2017). The EU Birds Directive has contributed to the recovery and conservation of the species in Europe, particularly Spain (see Moreno-Opo and Margalida 2014), where the population has increased from an estimated 290 pairs in 1984 to 2,068 pairs in 2011<strong style=""""></strong><span style=""font-weight: bold; ""> </span>(BirdLife International 2015). Co-operation between Spanish government agencies and conservationists under the 'Antidote Programme' also appears to have been effective in mitigating the effects of poisoned baits. Both the Spanish and the Andalusian Governments have produced anti-poisoning strategies, but the former still remain to be financially supported while the latter need more decisive official endorsement. A reintroduction project in Grands Causses, southern France has resulted in the establishment of a small breeding population (16 pairs were breeding in 2006 [Eliotout <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span> 2007]) with good prospects. Following further transfer of eight Cinereous Vultures from Spain to France, in 2017, 35 breeding pairs were subsequently observed, with confirmed recolonisation in the Alentejo Region of Portugal (Bowden and Botha 2017). The species has also been seen in Romania, Italian eastern Alps, and in northern France, as well as a recent record in a rehabilitation center in Jordan (Bowden and Botha 2017). Supplementary feeding programmes have been initiated in Spain and France to provide a safe, poison-free food source, although there are concerns that the species may be not very prone to feed at conventional feeding stations. Captive breeding populations have also been established (Tewes <em>et al.&#160;</em>1998). In the Balkans, the species has only one stable colony in the Dadia forest reserve in northern Greece, where WWF has long been involved. Supplementary food is also provided in Bulgaria for breeding birds<strong style=""""></strong> (Anon. 2007)<strong style=""""></strong> and South Korea during the winter, which may be the factor attracting birds from Mongolia (Lee <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong style=""""></strong>.

In Nepal&#160;in 2006, a ban was introduced on the production and importation of diclofenac for veterinary use and pharmaceutical firms were encouraged to promote a safe alternative called meloxicam (Swan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The use of diclofenac has since declined by 90% across parts of Nepal; however its complete elimination from the scavenger food chain has yet to be achieved (Gilbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).&#160;The Government of Nepal endorsed the first Vulture Conservation Action Plan (VCAP) for Nepal (2009-13), and a second was launched in 2015.&#160;Approaches&#160;include: advocating additional bans on NSAIDs; continual education programmes; continual monitoring of NSAID use; swapping diclofenac with meloxicam; collection of veterinarian pledges to stop using diclofenac; operation, maintenance and expansion of vulture-safe feeding sites. Diclofenac-free Zones have been created in 46 Districts covering a total area of 101,160 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(68.73% ) of Nepal (DNPWC 2015).

Research threats, particularly the decline in abundance of prey species. Carry out reintroductions to link up the western and the eastern sub-areas of the present range, following the recommendations of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Black Vulture Conservation Foundation; possibly focusing on releasing immature individuals rather than juveniles because they can breed earlier and so lead to faster settlement and breeding in the wild (Mihoub <em>et al. </em>2014). Develop the captive breeding programme to support both this and future reintroduction and supplementation efforts. Restore wild rabbit <em style="""">Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> populations in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands (Spain) as this may help to increase food availability, particularly during the breeding period. Promote cooperation and information exchange among people working on the species, both at a national and international level. Remove drugs like diclofenac and other harmful NSAIDs from the environment and control the illicit use of human diclofenac for veterinary purpose (H. S. Baral and C. Inskipp&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Strengthen and enforce legislation regulating trade in pesticides that are used to poison meat baits. Increase the rate of prosecution and the severity of judicial sentences for illegal poisoning. Protect appropriate breeding habitat (e.g. Moreno-Opo <em>et al. </em>2013). Investigate the extent to which operational wind farms could affect major breeding populations such as core populations in the Balkans (Vasilakis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Provide effective protection to the Turkish population (the largest in the Western Palearctic), specifically during breeding seasons and investigate impact of demographic bottlenecks and low genetic diversity (Çakmak <em>et al</em>. 2019a, b). At the European level, to prevent ecological barriers, stronger integration is needed in environmental policies across political borders (Arrondo <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/>The European Species Action Plan for the Conservation of the Cinereous Vulture (2017) provides a comprehensive overview of the conservation and research actions necessary to conserve this species in Europe (Andevski <em>et al. </em>2017). In addition to the above, the plan recommends: reintroducing or restoring wild ungulate populations; increasing the monitoring of poisoning of vultures; improving legal measures to reduce poisoning incidents; banning lead ammunition; and raising public awareness of the risks to Cinereous Vultures and the positives of maintaining vulture populations.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is therefore listed as Vulnerable. More information is needed to confirm the size and trends of populations in Asia. Should this information show that the population is larger than currently thought, or declining at a more moderate rate, the species will warrant downlisting to a lower threat category.<br/>  <p></p>","This is a lowland species that has been pushed to higher altitudes by persecution and habitat loss in Europe. In central and eastern Europe, it breeds in forests up to 1,000 m and also in steppe and agricultural areas with large trees, and nowadays also on electricity pylons. In the Caucasus, it occurs in steppe, lowland and riverine forests and semi-deserts. Eastern populations breed in natural steppe and agricultural habitats. Both adults and immatures of the eastern populations are migratory, wintering in the Middle East, East Africa south to Tanzania, the Arabian peninsula, the Indian Subcontinent and south and east Asia; wintering birds have also been reported in Hong Kong (China). These birds make their southward migration between September and November, returning between February and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Wetlands are apparently preferred on the wintering grounds. Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs, with small groups sometimes forming on migration or at sources of food or water (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In exceptional cases large groups of up to 200 have been known to form on autumn migration (Snow and Perrins 1998). Adults in central Europe, the Balkan peninsula, Turkey and the Caucasus are usually residents, whilst some immatures move south. Non-territorial birds often associate with other large eagles such as<em> A. clanga </em>and<em> Haliaeetus albicilla</em><em> </em>on wintering and temporary settlement areas. <p></p>","Breeding sites are threatened primarily by intensive forestry in the mountains, and by the shortage of large indigenous trees in the lowlands (e.g. illegal tree cutting affected several pairs in Russia [Karyakin <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span> 2009a] and Bulgaria).&#160;The species is sensitive to human disturbance, which means its breeding range can be highly restricted by human presence and infrastructural development in Central Europe (and probably elsewhere in its range e.g. Karyakin<em>&#160;</em>2011) (M. Horváth <em>in litt. </em>2016). Infrastructural and settlement network was the primary cause for the absence of the species at more than 30% of its potential habitats at the Hungarian Plain (Horváth 2009).&#160;<br/>Other threats are loss and alteration of feeding habitats, shortages of small and medium-sized prey species (particularly ground-squirrels S<em style="""">permophilus </em>spp.), nest robbing and illegal trade, shooting, poisoning, electrocution by powerlines and collisions with vehicles. An average of c.450 Eastern Imperial Eagles were killed by powerlines during the 2009 breeding season in the Altai region – 25% of the total population of the region (Karyakin <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al.</span> 2009b). Habitat alterations associated with agricultural expansion threaten historical and potential breeding sites in former range countries. In Central Europe intentional predator poisoning became the first cause of mortality from 2006 onwards affecting more than 80 specimens in 10 years only in Hungary (Horváth <em>et al.</em> 2011, M. Horváth <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Hunting, poisoning, prey depletion and other mortality factors are also likely to pose threats along migration routes and in wintering areas. Competition for nest sites with Greater Spotted Eagle <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Aquila clanga</span> has been reported in the Altai region, Russia (Karyakin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009c).<p></p>","In Europe, the breeding population was estimated to number 1,300-1,900 breeding pairs, equating to 2,500-3,800 mature individuals. Recent population estimates from Russia and Kazakhstan suggest the global population may exceed 10,000 mature individuals, but in light of criticism of these estimates the population is precautionarily retained in the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals here. This equates to 3,750-14,999 individuals in total, rounded here to 3,500-15,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species breeds in <strong>Austria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, Macedonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Russia, Mongolia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey </strong>and <strong>Ukraine </strong>(Heredia 1996, M. Horváth &amp; I. Karyakin <em>in litt. </em>2016). The species possibly breeds or is found in very small numbers in Armenia, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Kosovo, Moldova and Romania (BirdLife International 2015). In addition, breeding has not been proved but possibly occurs in Afghanistan, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. On passage and in winter, birds are found in the Middle East, east Africa south to Tanzania, the Arabian peninsula, the Indian Subcontinent and south and east Asia (from Thailand to Korea). The European population is estimated at 1,300-1,900 pairs, which equates to 2,500-3,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). This estimate alongside a previous estimate of 1,800-2,200 pairs for the period 2000-2010 (Demerdzhiev <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011) is higher than previous estimates of 1,051-1,619 pairs reported in 2000 (Horváth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2002) and 1,110-1,624 pairs in 2008 (BirdLife International 2008, Barov and Derhé 2011), and is partly due to increased survey effort rather than a genuinely large population increase. There was a rapid decline in Europe and probably in Asia in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Recently the central European population (240-260 pairs mostly in Hungary and Slovakia [M. Horváth&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2016]) appears to have been increasing (Horváth <em>et al.</em> 2005, Demerdzhiev <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011, BirdLife International 2015) as a result of conservation efforts, although the majority of the threats to the species persist (D. Horal<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in <em>litt</em></span><em>.</em> 2012). In the last six years the occurrence of persecution incidents significantly increased (Horváth<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2011), with more than 70  Eastern Imperial Eagles poisoned in Hungary (M. Horváth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2016). The Balkan population (76-132 pairs mostly in Bulgaria and Macedonia [Demerdzhiev <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2011] ) is apparently stable (although the last proven breeding in Greece took place in 1993). Recent surveys in Azerbaijan found relatively high densities in the north-western plains, estimating 50-60 pairs within a 6,000 km<sup>2</sup> study area (Horváth <em style="""">et al.</em> 2007), and a total population size of 50-150 pairs (Horváth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008, Sultanov 2010). This suggests that the Caucasian population may have been underestimated (it was previously assumed that less than 50 pairs bred in Azerbaijan and Georgia) (Horváth <em>et al.</em> 2007), and the population of Turkey may also have been underestimated with 32 pairs found in European Turkey and another 50 in north-west Anatolia (Demerdzhiev <em>et al. </em>2014, Horváth&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014). However, a large proportion of these Turkish nesting areas are threatened by intensive infrastructural development and habitat loss (M.&#160;Horváth <em>in litt. </em>&#160;2016). Populations in the Volga Region of Russia are relatively stable, but are suspected to decline in the future due to the presence of threats at breeding sites (M. Korepov and R. Bekmansurov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). At least half of the world population (and possibly more) breeds in Russia (900-1,000 pairs<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>[Belik <em>et al.</em> 2002]) and Kazakhstan (750-800 pairs [Bragin 1999]).

Between 2013 and 2017, surveys along 780 linear kilometres of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile discovered 25 cavities with signs of storm-petrel breeding activity in the area of Pampa de Indio Muerto in southern Antofagasta, Chile,&#160;and later captured one individual at a site 75 km from the coast and at 1,100 m above sea level (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2018). The breeding cavities were located in outcrops of gypsum in an area of pampa, and the authors noted that the breeding area could be much larger than that discovered, based on the large area of similar habitat that was not surveyed (Barros <em>et al.</em> 2018). Further surveys of the same breeding colony in 2018 estimated a population of 7,919 pairs in an area of 129.1 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Medrano <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The authors also discovered a single nest cavity at&#160;Salar de Quiuña in the region of&#160;Tarapacá, northern Chile, and observed an individual leaving a cavity in gypsum at&#160;Salar de Navidad, central&#160;Antofagasta, Chile (Medrano&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).

Brooke (2004) suspected the global population to number at least thousands of individuals, and probably tens of thousands, and marine surveys in the 1980s-1990s led to an estimated abundance of 637,200 in spring (95% CI: 0.5-0.8 million) and 1,011,900 in autumn (95% CI: 900,000-1,500,000) (Spear and Ainley 2007).<br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;</span>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/></p><p>The Ringed Storm-petrel Project recovers fledglings which have landed and are likely disoriented by the light pollution in urban areas along the cost in Lima, Peru.

Despite local declines, the global population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over 10 years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in 10 years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<strong>Behaviour</strong> Some birds are migratory, overwintering in Africa, although many others are resident or nomadic (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). It relies heavily on soaring flight, and has been shown to fly at altitudes of 10,000 m and higher. Birds hunt alone but congregate at food sources and roosts; they also tend to migrate singly, but concentrations (usually up to 15 individuals) form at sea crossings and strong thermals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>It is a species of expansive open areas in a wide array of environments, from mountains to semi-desert, and is recorded regularly from sea level up to c.3,000&#160;m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>It feeds almost exclusively on carrion, mainly that of large mammals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is usually built on a rocky outcrop, with sheltered ledges or small caves preferred (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> Effective protection in areas with a plentiful supply of food (which often includes the carrion of domestic animals), has been shown to catalyse impressive population recoveries, and reintroduction has been successful in parts of its range (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","It declined markedly throughout the 19th–20th centuries in much of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, mainly due to direct persecution and ""bycatch"" from the poisoned carcasses set for livestock predators (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001,&#160;Orta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Direct persecution has decreased, although it may still be a threat in eastern Europe, Central Asia and possibly the Middle East (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). Unintentional poisoning through poison bates remains the most significant threat to the species (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017) - during 2000-2010 2,146 Griffon Vultures were found poisoned in Spain (RSPB 2014). In some areas a reduction in available food supplies, arising from changes in livestock management practices, also had an impact (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001,&#160;Orta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012) and electrocution has been identified as a threat (Global Raptors Information Network 2015). Disturbance caused by visitors may also pose a threat in some areas (Choresh <em>et al. </em>2019). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used for veterinary purposes pose a threat to this species. One case of suspected poisoning caused by flunixin, an NSAID, was recorded in this species in 2012 in Spain (Zorrilla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015), and several more have occurred since (Herrero-Villar <em>et al. </em>2020). Diclofenac, a similar NSAID which has caused severe declines in&#160;<em>Gyps</em>&#160;vulture species across Asia, was authorised for veterinary use in Spain in 2013. Diclofenac was detected in livestock carcasses in the Iberian Peninsula between 2013 and 2019 (Herrero-Villar <em>et al. </em>2020), and in 2021 the first case of a vulture death in Europe due to ingestion of Diclofenac was confirmed (Herrero-Villar <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;<p>There were widespread declines in the population of Griffon vultures throughout Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula during the 20th century (Carneiro <em>et al</em>. 2015). This is a result of the species ingesting toxins from the carcasses they feed on, which accumulate in their system and increase mortality rates. Most of the carcasses the species feeds on are high in toxins as they came through livestock management or hunting practises; lead bullet fragments are often ingested leading to a build-up of toxic levels of lead within the species. This was worsened in 2001 when the EU legislated against the disposal of livestock carcasses in the field to curb the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. This lowered food availability and forced some vultures to seek out food in areas including garbage dumps, where they risk ingesting further heavy metals. In an analysis of 121 wild vultures sampled on the Iberian Peninsula, every individual had lead present in its blood, ranging in concentration from 4.97 to 300.23 μg/dl. The declines are further worsened by the intentional, and illegal, poisoning of Griffon vultures, the largest cause of non-natural mortality in large birds of prey (Carneiro <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>","The European population is estimated at 34,800-44,700 pairs, which equates to 69,600-89,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).

However, Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) estimate the population to be much smaller than this, at 80,000-120,000 individuals.

Of the 12 national assessments on the distribution and conservation status of the Giant Otter that were prepared, in two countries the species has been categorized in national Red Lists as Critically Endangered (Paraguay and Ecuador), in four countries as Endangered (Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia), and as Vulnerable in Brazil; it is considered Extinct in Uruguay, and probably Extinct in Argentina. In the Guianas, the Giant Otter is also protected by law though this is rarely enforced. There was a strong consensus among workers on Giant Otter that it should be considered as Endangered on a continental level. The total global Giant Otter population size is low but, more critically, individual subpopulations are fragmented and most are small. Because of its conspicuous behaviour and social nature, this species is easy to extirpate and is therefore extremely vulnerable. It remains highly susceptible to hunting (though currently hunting of Giant Otters is not a common practice). The killing of individuals and entire groups continues in some areas where fishermen are active, including in protected areas. Moreover, the Giant Otter is intrinsically vulnerable to extinction: combined with low habitat resilience and the fact that only a quarter to a third of the total population reproduces, the species also shows late maturity, late breeding age, suspected low transient survival, and low cub survival - all are traits which limit Giant Otter recovery and re-colonization. Although widely distributed on a continental scale, overall, they may occupy less than 5%, often less than 1% of a given watershed. This means that changes in this specific habitat, or impacts there-in, will have severe effects even if only a fraction of the overall area is affected. Rivers are roads into the forest, this is where people settle, where gold mining takes place, where there is competition for fish or overfishing, where “green” energy can be harvested, where climate change will have strong impacts, where contamination can be spread rapidly, and so on. This vital link to rivers and wetlands renders the Giant Otter much more susceptible than most other comparable large predators of the Amazon, such as the Jaguar.<br/> <br/> In South America, only 13 years from now (about half the time-span considered for this assessment) there will be an increase of 44 million people, much more than the total population of Peru. Brazil has seen the highest deforestation rate in the world and just in 2019 the deforestation of the Amazon represented almost 2,900 km² and at least 1.5 million hectares of the Pantanal have burned. There are estimates that the Amazon rainforest will be reduced by 40% in 2030. If just one or two of the Giant Otter’s strongholds is affected, this may be enough to lead to heavy declines in overall population numbers. Further, once remote watersheds are now accessible so that Giant Otters can no longer retreat to ‘safe zones’.<br/> <br/> Many emerging and/or growing threats pose serious problems for Giant Otters including contamination, overfishing and conflict with fishermen, and infrastructure such as roads and hydroelectric dams. With their preference for lowland wetlands, rivers, and lakes, their prime habitat overlaps completely with the demands of humans (gold mining, fishing, deforestation, mega infrastructure and energy developments, settlement, transport, tourism, etc.). The effects of climate change are already being felt, with Brazil recently suffering severe droughts. Large-scale deforestation in the Amazon could reduce basin-wide rainfall by 12% during the wet season and by 21% in the dry season by 2050 (Spracklen <em>et al</em>. 2012) with unknown impacts on (semi) aquatic species.<br/> <br/> In summary, three Giant Otter generation lengths approximately represent a 15 year period. Accelerating habitat destruction, degradation, and exploitation throughout the Giant Otter's range represents the greatest threat to the species, and is suspected to have caused a population decline of more than 50% in the past 15 years (three generations) (criterion A2), also potentially leading to a future reduction in population size of 50% or more over the next 15 years (criterion A3), suspected through a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and quality of habitat (subcriterion c), exploitation (subcriterion d),&#160; pollutants (especially mercury and fossil fuels), pathogens (domestic animal diseases), and competitors (fishermen) (subcriterion e) potentially playing important roles. Therefore, the species is listed as Endangered under criteria A2cde+3ce.","<p>The Giant Otter inhabits large rivers, streams, lakes and swamps (Duplaix 1980, Carter and Rosas 1997). In Suriname, the species seems to prefer black water creeks and rivers with sandy or rocky bottoms (Duplaix 1980). In Peru, large lowland rivers with gentle flow and oxbow lakes with high fish densities are preferred (Schenck 1999). In Bolivia, both clear and white water floodplains are used (Zambrana Rojas <em>et al. </em>2012). &#160;Since giant otters build dens and use campsites along the banks of water bodies, some habitat traits are important determinants of presence, such as gentle slopes and vegetation cover and proximity to the water’s edge (Lima <em>et al.</em> 2012). In seasonally flooded habitats, the availability of banks and other habitat features may change, and induce changes in habitat selection (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2013). During the peak inundation in the southern Pantanal, when no banks were available, giant otter groups used emerged shrubs as refuges and latrines (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2015). At such times, when prey is more dispersed, giant otters were observed in flooded forest, swamps and grasslands adjacent to the river (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2013). Territoriality and population density may lead some groups to use unusual sites, such as artificial lakes along roads in the southern Pantanal (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2013), even adapting their diet (Ribas <em>et al.</em> 2012). Giant otters also use agricultural channels (Laidler 1984) and the reservoirs of dams (Palmeirim <em>et al. </em>2014). The preferred habitat for giant otters seem to be undisturbed water bodies, with high-quality vegetation cover and abundant prey density.</p>  <p>Giant Otters are one of the most social members of the otter family. A giant otter group consists of a dominant breeding pair, non-breeding subadults and offspring. Group size can range from two to 16 individuals that may or may not be related (Ribas <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is related to the capacity of the group to defend high-quality territories, usually a function of group size (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2015, Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2015), possibly explaining the advantage of having non-related individuals in the group (Leuchtenberger and Mourão 2008, Ribas <em>et al. </em>2016). Giant otters attain sexual maturity at around 2.5 years old (Oliveira <em>et al. </em>2011, Sykes-Gatz 2004), and the earliest breeding may occur at age three years (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2015). A group usually produces one litter a year, ranging from 1-6 young, but averaging 2 (Duplaix 1980, Staib 2005, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006, Leuchtenberger and Mourão 2008).</p>  <p>Groups live in well-established territories that are constantly defended by scent-markings at latrines, campsites and dens along the banks of lakes and rivers (Leuchtenberger and Mourão 2009), and warning vocalizations (Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mumm Knörnschild 2017). Conflict encounters are common when an intruder is detected, and may lead to serious injuries or even death (Schweizer 1992, Rosas and Mattos 2003, Ribas and Mourão 2004). Territories vary in size from 0.5 km to 18 km in the dry season, and 8 to 24 km in the wet season (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2005, Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2015), and appears to be related to group size (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2015; Leuchtenberger <em>et al.</em> 2015). The size of neighbouring groups may limit the expansion of territory (Leuchtenberger <em>et al. </em>2015).</p>  <p>The diet of Giant Otters consists almost exclusively of fish, but may also include caiman and other vertebrates (Ribas <em>et al.</em> 2012, Rosas-Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2012). The species is opportunistic in its diet and adapts its diet according to prey availability.</p>  The average reproductive lifespan is about five years for females and males (Groenendijk <em>et al</em>. 2014). This, in tandem with a mortality of about 50% (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2014), a suspected high transient mortality, and difficulty to establish new groups (Schenck and Staib, 1998), means that population recovery and colonization of new areas can be slow.","<p>The species is threatened by multiple human activities throughout the species range, destruction of riparian habitat, overfishing, contamination of water bodies - especially by gold mining, fossil fuel exploration, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers, diseases spread by domestic animals, and mismanaged tourism (Duplaix 1980, Schenck 1999, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Human populations are increasing and expanding. In the last census, the Amazon region registered the highest population growth in Brazil. Illegal settlements, road opening and deforestation threaten pristine habitats. Colonization of new areas are expected, followed by intensive exploitation of natural resources. Furthermore, proposed mega-projects in the 2007 Brazilian Growth Acceleration Plan represent a significant threat to Brazilian Amazonian and Pantanal habitats. Changes in government and environmental protection policies in Brazil endanger the pristine areas of the Amazon, Pantanal and Cerrado. Between 2017 and 2019 4,500 km<sup>2</sup> of the Amazon were lost due to deforestation and burning, of which 65% occurred in 2019 (Cannon 2019, <span lang=""EN-GB""><a href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/deforestation-preceded-fires-in-massive-area-of-amazon-in-2019/"">https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/deforestation-preceded-fires-in-massive-area-of-amazon-in-2019/</a>). From August to November of 2019 at least 1,5 million hectares of Brazilian Pantanal were burned (<a href=""https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-next-fire-disaster-in-the-pantanal-wetlands/a-51199164"">https://www.dw.com/en/brazils-next-fire-disaster-in-the-pantanal-wetlands/a-51199164</a>).</p>  <p>Hunting for the pelt trade was the greatest threat to the Giant Otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazilian Pantanal (Duplaix 1980). From 1960 to 1969, records indicated a regional harvest of 12,390 giant otter skins. In 1973, giant otters were placed on CITES Appendix I, and the enforcement of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter&#160;skins in 1975 finally ended Giant Otter&#160;hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010).</p>  <p>The Giant Otter&#160;remains endangered because of the low recuperation rate of relict populations now also under pressure from human activities (Groenendijk <em>et al.</em> 2015). Direct conflict between humans and otters is an increasing problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen, who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local and commercial consumption (Gómez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Rosas-Ribeiro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Giant Otters can drown in fishing nets and traps and are also blamed for damaging them (Rosas-Ribeiro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Utreras&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Fish farming is rapidly increasing in the species’ range, for example in parts of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and expose otters to retaliation killing (V. Utreras pers. obs.). Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to be kept as pets (M. Marmontel pers. obs).</p>  <p>Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, conspicuous, social, and very vocal. They are active at daytime and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their signs – latrines and dens - are easily recognizable, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the pelt trade years, these life history attributes made them an easy target for fishermen. In 2017, a Giant Otter&#160;group was killed by fishermen in the Pantanal and according to locals, kills occur frequently during the fishing season (C. Leuchtenberger pers. obs.). In 2011-2012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter&#160;killing in their territory (Território Indígena Kanamari), based on their perception that the species was overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges for the hunters, who shot 64 Giant Otters (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can lead to extinction of small populations in a watershed.</p>  <p>Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region, in southeastern Peru, the western region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and northern Pantanal. The main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (<span lang=""EN-GB"">Kimbrough 2014). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high, whereas mercury is inexpensive. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003-2006 to 2006-2009 (Swenson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Even a decade after mining stopped, areas affected still had depleted fish populations and had not been re-colonized by otters. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish near Manu National Park were higher than considered tolerable for the Eurasian otter. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the area of influence of such contaminants. Contamination of otters by other heavy metals through pesticides and other agrochemicals is still poorly understood. </span></p>  <p>The many planned hydroelectric dams in the species’ range are a major threat to Giant Otters. These will alter hydrological regimes of rivers and affect fish populations and habitat (Latrubesse&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Dams disrupt the annual cycles of inundations, vital for the maintenance of populations of flood dependent species such as the Giant Otter&#160;(Mourão&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, Alho and Sabino 2011). One hundred and eighty-four new dams are planned or under construction, greater than two MW capacity over the next 20 years in the Amazon. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Sixty per cent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. Giant Otters are able to live in some artificial lakes, such as the shallow Balbina Reservoir in Brazil (Rosas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). In other areas, hydroelectric dams have depleted Giant Otter&#160;populations, as did the Curuá-Una Hydroelectric in the Brazilian Amazonia (Rosas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Around the Pantanal, there are over 115 projects of small hydroelectric plants. Other major infrastructure projects include the Inter-oceanic highway in southeastern Peru, and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2012).</p>  <p>Giant Otters are vulnerable to disturbance from poorly managed tourism, including sport fishing. It&#160;is important to control increasing levels of tourism on lakes and rivers both in and outside protected areas (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Research has shown that Giant Otter&#160;reproductive success and sighting success by tourists is considerably lower on unmanaged lakes than on managed lakes (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006).</p>  <p>Giant Otter cubs held in captivity have died of canine parvovirus, and all mustelids are susceptible to canine distemper, so domestic animal diseases may pose a serious threat to wild Giant Otter&#160;populations. Infection can also occur in remote areas, since transient otters and people hunting with dogs travel large distances with potential for contact and infection of vulnerable otter populations (Schenck&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999).</p>  Climatic changes are predicted to increase suitable areas for Giant Otters (Cianfrani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). However, long-term habitat and climatic modifications will increase the exposure of suitable core otter areas to the negative effects of the surrounding unsuitable areas (Cianfrani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). The species also has a high specialized niche, making it more vulnerable to climate change.","<p>There is no current total population estimate and current population trends are unknown: however, there is evidence that populations may be recovering in the Yavarí-Mirín River in northern Peru (Recharte and Bodmer 2010, Deza pers. comm. 2012), the Madidi and Itenéz or Guaporé Rivers in Bolivia (Ayala <em>et al.</em> 2015, Zambrana Rojas <em>et al. </em>2012), the Lagarto-Cocha and Cuyabeno rivers in the northeastern Ecuadorian Amazon (Utreras pers. comm. 2018), in the Amanã Reserve in Brazil Amazon (Marmontel <em>et al.</em> 2015) and the Brazilian Pantanal (Leuchtenberger and Mourão 2008, Ribas&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012, Tomás <em>et al</em>. 2015). Although in other regions, such as in the Department of Madre de Dios in southeastern Peru (R. Williams pers. comm. 2012) and in western Colombia (J.C.

Also, due to their social organization, the total number of adult individuals does not represent the effective population size, as only the alpha couple of a given group reproduces.<br/><br/>Accelerating habitat destruction, degradation, and exploitation throughout the Giant Otter's range represents the greatest threat to the species, and is suspected to have caused a population decline of more than 50% in the past 25 years (three generations, based on Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013), and (based on current trends) is suspected to lead to a future reduction of more than 50% in population size over the next 25 years.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Pteronura brasiliensis</em> is endemic to South America and is distributed east of the Andes in the Orinoco, Amazonas, and Parana basins, and the hydrographic networks of the Guianas. The northern limit of its distribution occurs in northern Venezuela, and the southern limit in Misiones, Argentina. The Giant Otter’s range has become discontinuous and fragmented due to local extinctions; the Uruguayan and Argentine populations are extinct or nearly so (Gil pers. comm., Buschiazzo pers. comm.), and the species is reduced to a single, small subpopulation in Paraguay, occupying less than 2% of its former distributional range. It is also extinct to the east of the Tocantins and Paraná basins in Brazil. In the Brazilian Cerrado a population persists in the face of intense habitat modification. Important subpopulations are still found in parts of the Amazon, in the Pantanal region, and, possibly, in the Guianas.","Hunting for the pelt trade was the single, greatest threat to the giant otter in the past and the species came close to extinction in the early 1970s in Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Brazil (Duplaix 1980). The inclusion of the Giant Otter on Appendix I of CITES in 1973, and the coming into force of international trade restrictions on Giant Otter skins in 1975 finally ended the economic benefits of Giant Otter hunting (Recharte and Bodmer 2010) and commercial hunting ceased shortly after. There is no current trade, although there have been reports of skins being displayed in homes as decoration (M. Marmontel and Lima pers. comms. 2012).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>The Giant Otter is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and as Endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act, 1973.

166485696,18597,Pseudoryx nghetinhensis,Critically Endangered,A2acd+3cd+4acd; C2a(i),2020,2015-11-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Assessment and conclusions are based in part on information exchanged among researchers at recent meetings of the Saola Working Group of the IUCN SSC Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group (Saola Working Group 2009, 2013).<br/><br/>All available information indicates that the species is in a clear and protracted decline throughout its small range from intense hunting pressure, accelerated by continued opening of its habitat to increased human access (mainly through road construction). No part of the species' area of occupancy is fully protected from hunting, and some areas have almost no protection at all. Local hunters in the species’ range commonly go years without seeing an animal, indicating very low and suppressed population density. Threats from hunting are exacerbated by other factors, especially those that increase human access to remaining occupied Saola habitat, and include loss of habitat, although at present forest loss is a comparatively smaller threat to Saola than hunting. The recently constructed Ho Chi Minh Road through the Annamite Mountains in Vietnam, and its numerous feeder roads branching into Laos, plus new roads constructed under&#160; the East-West Economic Corridor development initiative, are probably unmitigatable major threats. Rates of decline are likely to increase rather than decrease, and a population reduction of &gt;80% over three generations is estimated for the past, present and future. Remaining population is estimated at &lt; 250 mature individuals, with a continuing population decline, and largest subpopulation estimated to contain &lt;50 mature individuals.","Knowledge of Saola’s historical and current range suggests that the species has a highly specific habitat association with wet evergreen forest. This is a forest type with little to no dry season (rainfall never falling on average below about 40 mm per month), which occupies a restricted geographic range mainly on the eastern (Vietnamese) slopes of the Annamite Mountains (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999, Lunde <em>et al</em>. 2004). In Laos, wet evergreen forests are very localised, because the main spine of the Annamites inhibits moisture-bearing clouds from crossing from the eastern, Vietnam side to the the western slopes during the months of November to April (the dry season in Laos). Only at low points along the spine are the clouds able to spill across into the western slopes and valleys in Laos. Saola occurs in these areas, where rainfall is significantly less than 40 mm per month for approximately two to four months per year. Similar hill evergreen forest areas in other regions of Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia have, however, no evidence of Saola presence, suggesting that additional local factors are probably involved. These may include cooler temperatures, extensive cloud cover, and localised edaphic or climatic factors creating conditions similar to wet evergreen forest. However, it is also likely that the close proximity of wet evergreen forest which is (or was until very recently) contiguous to drier hill evergreen forest sites with Saolas is a significant factor in this distribution pattern.<br/><br/>The Saola’s altitude range is uncertain. It seems to be mid elevation species, with most records coming from 500-800 m asl (Robichaud 2011). However, most forest lower than 500 m in its presumed range has been lost, heavily degraded, and/or heavily hunted. While it is difficult to know the species’ lower altitudinal range in the absence of human interference, there is no indication that the species occurs extensively above 1,200 m. Such high elevation forest is still extensive, and relative to that at lower elevations less impacted by people, yet there appears to be no unequivocal evidence from any source of Saola occurrence above 1,200 m.<br/><br/>Information from villagers in its range indicates that Saolas are mainly solitary, although there are some reports of groups of two or three animals, and rarely groups as large as six or seven (Vu Van Dung <em>et al</em>. 1994). The species is possibly territorial, and might mark territory with scent from its large pre-maxillary gland (Robichaud 1998). However, other reports and circumstantial evidence suggest that the species might use a relatively large home range, and move between areas perhaps in response to seasonal factors. For example it has been reported that most hunted animals have been killed in winter (at least in Vietnam), when Saola are reportedly in more accessible lowland habitats (Vu Van Dung <em>et al</em>. 1994). While tropical forests have inherently low ungulate biomass, natural Saola densities are probably even lower than other sympatric ungulates such as wild pigs, serow, Sambar, and muntjacs. Additionally, the generation time and reproductive output of Saolas is presumably longer and lower than that of similarly sized ungulates.<br/><br/>Single foetus pregnancy has been documented. Information from local villagers suggests this to be the norm (Robichaud 1998). Saola may have a fixed breeding season, with births occurring in the summer.<br/><br/>Evidence from camera-trap photos and observations of captive Saolas suggest that the species may be be primarily diurnal, or diurnal and crepuscular (Robichaud 1998, Robichaud 2011). Local reports suggest the species is a browser, feeding mostly on leaves (Vu Van Dung <em>et al</em>. 1994, Robichaud 2011).","Natural Saola densities have probably always been relatively low, but it is clear that Saola populations must also be unnaturally depressed, as populations of all wild animals larger than 20 kg in its range have been significantly reduced by human exploitation. Field survey encounter rates with muntjacs and pigs in the Saola's range are remarkably low compared to some other parts of tropical Asia (there are very few published figures of encounter rates from the area, in part because it is so difficult to directly contact most species), and wild cattle, elephants, and Tigers are all nearing extinction in its range (e.g., Duckworth and Hedges 1998). Even typically resilient species such as Sambar are scarce. The declines are corroborated by local villagers across the area, who consistently report major reductions from former abundances, in the past few decades.<br/><br/>The greatest threat to Saola is hunting. While wildlife in the Saola's range are most threatened mainly by commercial hunting for the bushmeat and traditional medicine trades, specific demand for Saola is almost non-existent, because the species is unknown in the traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia (nor is its meat considered to be particularly tastier than muntjacs or Sambar). Instead, the animal is snared incidentally in the intense, general pursuit primarily of other species valued in the region’s wildlife trade.<br/><br/>The intensity of hunting in the Saola's range is hard to adequately describe, but some figures hint at the enormity of the problem. The human population of Vietnam is more than 90 million, that of China more than a billion. Together, they comprise an enormous market for wildlife products. For example, tens of millions of wild turtles are imported, legally and illegally, into China annually (van Dijk et al. 2000 and papers therein). Mammals valued in traditional Asian medicine, such as bears, Tigers and Sambar, are all hunted intensively in the Saola's range with snares, guns and dogs - all methods which are also effective at killing Saolas.<br/><br/>Although hunting for the bushmeat trade may be somewhat more localized than trade in medicinal animals (because of logistical issues of transportation before meat can spoil), its intensity is similar if not higher, because animals such as muntjacs and civets are relatively resilient to hunting and remain widespread. Probably close to ten million Vietnamese, i.e., ten million people with the propensity to eat wildlife, live within 100 km of forest inhabited by Saola. It is unlikely that any Saolas occur more than 35 km from a village. The bushmeat trade has little likelihood of abating as long as there are pigs, muntjacs, and civets to be hunted, but Saola will become extinct long before these more common species are hunted out. In Vietnam, informal interviews with hunters in Pu Huong Nature Reserve revealed that 30 Saola were killed there between 1995 and 2003 (Hoang Xuan Quang and Cao Tien Trung 2004). In some local villages in Vietnam, hunters used to kill three individuals per year 10 years ago, but now rarely catch any (Do Tuoc and Alexei Abramov pers. comm. 2006). Additionally, thousands of collectors of turtles, pangolins, rosewood, agarwood and other forest products comb every square kilometre of Saola range on a yearly basis, opportunistically hunting and setting snares for subsistence bushmeat and additional opportunistic income.<br/><br/>Although specific trade demand for Saola has been low, it could be increasing as the species grows rarer, and disposable incomes in the region expand.<br/><br/>With Saola populations now so low, local hunting for subsistence also poses a risk. Saola may be particularly susceptible to being hunted with dogs (Robichaud 1998). The pressure from proximal human settlements is so intense that there are no longer core areas in the Saola's range not regularly reached by hunters. It is likely that in 80% or more of forest within the Saola’s range, every year snares capable of catching Saolas are are set in every square kilometre. In some areas (possibly approaching 50% of potential Saola range) intensity probably reaches many thousands of snare-days per square kilometre per year.<br/><br/>Snaring is less intensive in Laos, but there the majority of Saola range lies along the Vietnam border, and is heavily hunted by transborder Vietnamese poachers, and/or coincides with the distribution of the ethnic Hmong in Laos, who avidly and effectively hunt a wide range of wildlife, including Saola. These forests are nearly as devoid of large mammals as forests in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Habitat destruction is also a threat to the species. Forests in the Saola’s range are destroyed or degraded for small-scale agriculture, commercial agriculture, timber extraction, roads, mining and hydro-power development. Although, there is presently more Saola habitat than there are Saolas, the human population growth rate in the Saola's range (both from in-migration and births) is high, which will intensify habitat lost in the coming years.<br/><br/>Presumably, the generation time of Saola is greater than three years, and reproductive output is lower than that of muntjacs, serows or Sambar, putting Saola at a conservation disadvantage. Additionally, pigs, serows, muntjacs and Sambar retain significant population reservoirs in areas of lower hunting pressure, such as difficult-to-reach areas of secondary forest, higher altitude forests and/or extensive blocks of monsoonal forest in Laos, but Saola does not. The apparent absence of Saola from extensive areas of secondary forest is either an indication of a greatly accelerated rate of decline compared with other species, or an ecological intolerance, neither of which bodes well for the species.<br/><br/>Economic development and expanding wealth in the region are increasing the demand for wildlife medicines and bushmeat. Development projects in the region commonly cite poverty as a principal cause of biodiversity loss, but the main threat in the Saola's range, at least for the mid-term, is increasing wealth in its range countries and in China. Wealth, not poverty, is the principal driver of the region’s wildlife trade.<br/><br/>The recent construction through the Annamite Mountains in Vietnam of the Ho Chi Minh Road, parallel to and with branches to the Lao border, affects Saola subpopulations by forest fragmentation and increased human access for hunting and the rapid transportation of wildlife to urban markets. It has also led to increased forest clearance in several critical areas, especially the Hue Saola Nature Reserve and Quang Nam Saola Reserve, as well as areas in Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces. The transboundary feeder roads from the Ho Chi Minh Road into Laos are likely negatively affecting Saola in all provinces where the species occurs in Laos.<br/><br/>Saolas have proved difficult (thus far impossible) to maintain in captivity (Robichaud 1998), although no efforts involving appropriate expertise and care have yet been made (Robichaud and Long in press). Approximately twenty Saolas, at least, have been captured in Vietnam and Laos since the species was described in 1993. All died soon afterwards, with exception of two released back into the wild shortly after their capture (Stone 2006).<br/><br/>Protected area management has been largely ineffective in the Saola's range. In a few areas the situation is beginning to change, but to-date protected areas have offered little or no refuge for the species. Most protected in the Saola’s range have proved particularly impotent in the control of poaching. Some have done better at safeguarding areas from economic development, but protected areas in the region are still commonly sites of hydro-power projects, road construction, and mining.<br/><br/>Lastly there are the threats arising intrinsically from small population size, including, but certainly not limited to, the possibility that individual Saolas may now be largely isolated from one another for breeding (Saola Working Group 2009, Robichaud and Long 2014).<br/><br/>In summary, intense hunting and a multitude of exacerbating pressures on Saola are increasing, and evidence indicates that the species, which is naturally uncommon and localized, is in a major decline. Without concerted action and change, the trend is likely to result in the extinction of Saola in the foreseeable future.","The area of forest remaining in the presumed historical range of the Saola is somewhere between 5,000 to 15,000 km², but much of this range is probably no longer inhabited by the species. The number of Saola subpopulations—defined as those in non-contiguous blocks of habitat—probably numbers 6 to 15, and none likely holds more than 50 animals. Consequently, total Saola population is undoubtedly less than 750, and likely much less.<br/><br/>No formal surveys have been undertaken to estimate Saola numbers accurately (Tham Ngoc Diep <em>et al</em>. 2004). Accurate population estimates would be exceedingly difficult to obtain even if the species were not rare, due to its reported secretive behaviour, the difficulty of making direct observations in dense, rugged and remote forest habitat, and the fact that signs of the species cannot at present be unequivocally distinguished from other ungulates of similar size in its range. Furthermore, it has been difficult for biologists to gain government permission to enter and survey parts of the species range in Laos. Nonetheless, based in part on information provided by local people in its range, and partly on low returns from camera-trapping efforts, all populations are small, localised and probably significantly isolated.<br/><br/>To date, scientists have recorded Saolas in the wild on only five occasions, from camera-trap photos. In addition, some freshly killed and newly captured animals have been observed. The first photograph of a Saola in the wild was taken in 1998 by a camera trap set near a mineral spring in Pu Mat National Park, Vietnam (Whitfield 1998). Several months later the species was twice camera-trapped in Laos, in Bolikhamxay Province (Robichaud 1999). Most recently, in September 2013, an adult Saola was photographed by a camera trap in the Hue-Quang Nam landscape of Vietnam (Hance 2013).<br/><br/>The paucity of data on Saola is indicative of the species’ critically small population. Although populations of other ungulates in the Saola's range are also severely depressed, they are encountered far more commonly by local inhabitants, researchers and camera-traps than are Saolas. Sightings of these ungulates by local people occur at a frequency often two orders of magnitude higher than for the Saola, while detection rates by camera-traps are closer to three magnitudes higher for commoner species such as Red Muntjac (<em>Muntiacus muntjak</em>). Documented villager sightings of Saolas in the past decade don't number in the thousands or hundreds, but in the tens. In contrast, sightings by villagers of muntjacs, pigs and even Sambar (<em>Cervus unicolor</em>) and serows (<em>Capricornis</em>) are so common that researchers generally don't quantify them.<br/><br/>Although the low population estimates for Saola are only informed guesses, the extremely low detection rate for the species (<em>ca</em> three orders of magnitude lower than that of species like Red Muntjac) is akin (or worse) in most locations to that of better known species such as Gaur (<em>Bos gaurus</em>), Asian Elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) and Tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>). The populations of these species in the region are estimated, based on better evidence, to be of a similar order of magnitude as estimated for Saola, thus lending confidence in the Saola estimates.<br/><br/>Speculative population estimates of 70 to 700 in Laos and several hundred in Vietnam were given in the IUCN Antelope Action Plan (Mallon and Eames 2001, Timmins 2001). Subsequent surveys in Laos indicated that the population there was likely near the country's low estimate, i.e., fewer than 100 remaining (Robichaud and Timmins 2004). Similar estimates of low hundreds at most were made in the 1990s by other researchers, based on the known range and reports from hunters (Vu Van Dung <em>et al</em>. 1993, Schaller and Rabinowitz 1995). More optimistic estimates have included analysis of hunter interviews conducted in In Pu Mat National Park, Vietnam in 1998 and 1999, which suggested that about 18 Saolas survived in the Khe Bong area in the southeast of the reserve and about eight in the Khe Chat and Khe Choang areas in the centre (Pu Mat constitutes <em>ca</em> 1/10 or less of the species' potential current range). In 2003, research suggested that these numbers had been reduced by about 50% over the intervening five years (Weir and Dinh Van Cuong 2004).<br/><br/>The former 2001 estimates may have been realistic at the time, but in light of a continuing high rate of decline, the current population is likely much nearer the lower figure (i.e., fewer than 250 mature individuals). The situation has deteriorated considerably since then and numbers are probably declining at a high rate due to intensive non-specific hunting of most larger species of wildlife throughout the species' range (spurred by commercial demand for bushmeat and traditional Asian medicine). This increase is unwittingly facilitated by an intense program of road and track construction on both sides of the border in the species’ range (which also contributes to habitat loss and degradation). The surviving population is suspected to be highly dispersed and its fragmentation worsening. Saola numbers may in fact be so low and dispersed that no viable populations remain.<br/><br/>There are no Saolas known in captivity.",Decreasing,"This species occurs only in the Annamite Mountains region of Laos and Vietnam. Most records are from south of the Song [River] Ca in Vietnam, south to at least Quang Nam, but a population to the north of the Ca River, in Phu Houng Nature Reserve, has also been found (Vu Van Dung<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al.</em> 1994, Kemp<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997). In Vietnam, evidence of occurrence comes from Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua-Thien Hue and Quang Nam Provinces.<br/> <br/> In Laos there is evidence of occurrence in Xieng Khouang, Bolikhamxay, Khammouan, Savannakhet and Xekong Provinces. Records come from as far west as central Bolikhamxay Province, but occurrence in Laos away from the main spine of the Annamite Mountains was likely always patchy because of generally unfavourable climatic conditions. The precise northern and southern limits to the species range in Laos, as in Vietnam, are still uncertain. Because of regional climatic factors, the majority of suitable habitat is, or was, probably more abundant in Vietnam than in Laos, but Vietnam's much higher human population density has severely reduced both habitat and Saola numbers in the habitat that remains. It is suspected to occur in less than 10 forest blocks in the two countries, with an extent of occurrence (EOO) probably totalling less than 10,000 km²<sup></sup>, and an area of occupancy (AOO) thought to be considerable smaller. It is probably absent from small forest fragments in the order of 100 km² or less, and is likely to be largely restricted to larger forest blocks with relatively low hunting pressure.</span>","Shot and snared opportunistically for meat by local people in Laos and Vietnam. Although rarely targeted specifically, offtake from widespread bushmeat snaring (especially in Vietnam) is a major threat. Possibly some medicinal use, but this is undocumented.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, the species was targeted for live-capture for supply to national zoos and local menageries. In 2010, an adult male Saola was captured by villagers in Bolikhamxay Province, Laos, and there were reports of subsequent attempted intentional live captures in the same province. The motivation in these instances for capturing a Saola is not clear.<br/><br/>Targeted for trophy hunting (horns) in the northern part of Vietnamese range (probably hunted in northern range in Laos by Vietnamese hunters for same reason). In 2000, horns marketed as belonging to the rare Saola were offered for sale in Hanoi, Vietnam for US$600 (Alexei Abramov pers. comm. 2006).",Terrestrial,"Saola is listed on CITES Appendix I and both of its range countries are CITES signatories. It is protected by national law in Vietnam (Decree 48; IB) and in Laos (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Regulation 360).<br/><br/>Two editions of a conservation action plan for the species in Laos were written (Robichaud 1997, 1999), and one for Vietnam (Anonymous 2006), but none of these were officially endorsed or adopted by the respective central governments. In 2010, the IUCN SSC Asian Wild (AWCSG) Specialist Group published a Regional conservation strategy for wild cattle and buffaloes in South-east Asia, which included Saola (IUCN-SSC Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group 2010). The AWCSG’s Saola Working Group subsequently completed and continues to update an evaluation of Saola conservation priorities (Saola Working Group 2012).<br/><br/>Parts of the Saola’s presumed range in Laos that are legally protected include:<br/><ul><li>National protected areas: Nakai-Nam Theun, Khou Xe Nong Ma and Xe Sap.</li><li>Provincial protected areas: Nam Mo (Xieng Khouang province), Nam Chat-Nam Pan (Bolikhamxay province), Laving Laveun (Savannakhet province)</li><li>Other conservation areas: Phou Sithone Endangered Species Conservation Area (Bolikhamxay province).</li></ul>However, only Nakai-Nam Theun, Phou Sithone and Xe Sap have active, well-funded management. Saola probably occur in several forest blocks outside protected areas, especially in Bolikhamsay Province (potentially some of the largest populations remaining), and perhaps also in Khammouan, and to the south of Xe Sap NPA in Xekong Province.<br/><br/>Parts of the species presumed range in Vietnam that are legally protected:<br/><ul><li>National parks: Vu Quang, Pu Mat, Bach Ma</li><li>Nature reserves: Pu Huong, Phong Dien, Dak Rong, Bac Huong Hoa</li><li>Other conservation areas: Hue Saola Nature Reserve, Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserve</li></ul>The majority of the Saola’s range in Vietnam is now included in protected areas. However, unprotected forests along the international border in Nghe An and Ha Tinh Provinces are possibly still important sites for the species, especially for successful long-term conservation of the species.<br/><br/>Highest priority areas for conservation focus are:<br/><ul><li>Eastern Bolikhamxay Province, Laos.</li><li>Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area, Laos and to a lesser degree the adjacent forests in Vietnam.</li><li>Transborder area of Khammouan and Savanakhet Provinces, Laos and Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces, Vietnam.</li><li>Southern Thua-Thien Hue and northern Quang Nam Provinces, Vietnam (and adjacent areas of Laos).</li></ul><br/>The highest, urgent priority for both countries is more effective patrolling against snaring and other types of hunting within areas that have management structures (Saola Working Group 2009). Another priority is to conduct a range wide assessment of Saola status and conservation opportunities, to best direct the limited resources effectively. This includes assessing unprotected sites which might offer significant potential for Saola conservation. The recent establishment of three new nature reserves specifically to protect Saola (Hue and Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves in Vietnam, and Phou Sithone Endangered Species Conservation Area in Laos) is encouraging.<br/><br/>Until recently, there had been no demonstration of effective anti-hunting measures anywhere in the Saola’s range. In the mid-1990s and early 2000s, the government of Laos generally failed to support, and in some cases actively blocked, efforts to initiate Saola conservation activities in the country. The reasons probably related to sensitivities over hydro-power development and logging. This has abated somewhat in recent years, and efforts to conserve Saola are now more active in Laos (and in Vietnam) than at any time since the species’ scientific discovery in 1992. <br/><br/>Some of the advances have been spurred by the positive development of the establishment (in 2006) and commencement of focused activities (in 2009) of a Saola Working Group (SWG) within the IUCN SSC Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group. The SWG has helped bring national and international attention to and support for Saola conservation; e.g. the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria made Saola the logo of its recent two-year (2012-2013), Europe-wide campaign to raise awareness and funds for the conservation of Southeast Asian wildlife. In the several years since 2009, more funds have flowed to Saola conservation activities than in all other years following the species’ discovery in 1992.<br/><br/>With the encouragement and assistance of the SWG, WWF, and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), management authorities of the three new Saola protected areas, plus Nakai-Nam Theun and Xe Sap National Protected Areas in Laos, have made significant improvements in the reduction of threats, particularly through the collection of tens of thousands of illegal wire snares. This model of international conservation organizations advising and/or funding, recruiting and managing teams of “forest guards” hired from local communities has vastly improved protection of Saola in these areas. But the teams have not yet succeeded in reducing snaring levels to near zero, and so given Saola’s small population, snaring even in these areas remains a significant threat. In most other protected areas in the Saola’s range (and areas of the Saola’s range range outside of protected areas), protection activities either do not exist or are woefully inadequate.<br/><br/>In recognition of the perilous wild status of Saola and slow pace of improved in situ protection, at its 2013 biennial meeting the SWG endorsed moving forward as quickly as possible to establish a captive ‘insurance’ population of Saola, in Laos or Vietnam with international best-practice management and technical support (Saola Working Group 2013). EAZA quickly responded by establishing an Intensive Management of Saola Advisory Group, whose role is to assist the the SWG and the range countries to design, fund, establish and staff a successful Saola captive management centre.<br/><br/>In summary, intense hunting and a multitude of exacerbating pressures continue to push Saola into a decline, even while efforts to ameliorate these and conserve Saola are increasing. It is not yet clear if the increased attention to conservation of Saola has come in time and has the capacity to save the species from extinction.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The species has, however, been recorded in varied modified habitats and so is not likely to be genuinely Endangered; given the scarcity of records it is, however, not clear whether it adapts well to disturbed situations.","<em>Atractus gigas </em>is a fossorial snake, primarily found in montane cloud forests. It is known to occur in&#160;mature forests, secondary forests, borders, open areas, roads, croplands, and rural gardens (Passos <em>et al</em>. 2010, D.

It is not clear how significant these threats are as the species appears to tolerate some modified habitats, however it is a rare species and if it is found in inhabited areas such as rural gardens persecution by people may pose a localized threat.","The species is rare in all places it is known to occur. Although it has only been recently described, the species has been known for more than 20 years and in that time only a few specimens have been collected, suggesting that it occurs at low densities (D. Cisneros-Heredia pers. comm. 2016). In the Guajalito Protected Forest, no more than three individuals have been seen each year since 1998 during the rainy season (D. Cisneros-Heredia, pers. obs.). A.

The main prey is sizeable mammals, birds and reptiles (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In Kenya's Maasai Mara, average pair territory size is approximately 175 km<sup>2</sup>, and evidence suggests that breeding pairs select strongly against human-disturbed habitats (R. Hatfield&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2020). In South Africa, 138 active Martial Eagle nests have been found along 1,750 km of power lines, suggesting the pylons provide artificial nesting sites, although this species remains extremely vulnerable to power line related fatalities (G. Tate&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2020).&#160;<p></p>","The species suffers from direct persecution (shooting and trapping) by farmers, indirect poisoning (these two threats by far the most important causes of losses), drowning in sheer-walled reservoirs, electrocution on power lines, habitat alteration and degradation (<strong></strong>Global Raptor Information Network 2009), and nest disturbance (J<strong></strong>M Thiollay&#160;<em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>2020).  Poisoning is largely carried out by a few large-scale commercial farmers, but is also a problem in tribal small-stock farming communities. Incidences of targeted poisoning in retaliation for the predation of domestic livestock have been recorded in Kenya (R. Hatfield <em>in litt. </em>2020). Deforestation may be having less of an impact on this species than on other large eagles, as this species can utilise man-made structures for nesting. In west Africa, it is also threatened by a decline in suitable prey through over-hunting (JM Thiollay&#160;<em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>2020). Large mammal populations in west Africa are highly threatened, and the threats are likely to increase in the future as human populations continue to grow. (H. Rainey <em>in litt. </em>2013).&#160; Reduction in natural prey may lead to an increase in predation on domestic animals, which may in turn lead to increased persecution by farmers. In some areas, birds may be taken for use in traditional medicine, and parts have been found in muthi markets in Johannesburg (R. Coetzee <em>in litt. </em>2013). The majority of protected areas in Kenya are too small to hold a single pair (S. Thomsett <em>in litt. </em>2013), and the size of territory means that birds nesting in protected areas will generally forage far outside them, making them more vulnerable to persecution. In South Africa, the highest declines were observed in areas with the greatest increase in temperature and areas with high densities of power lines, probably due to collisions and electrocutions. In Kruger National Park, higher densities of elephants were related to larger declines in Martial Eagles, probably as a result of a reduction in nesting sites or changes in habitat quality (Cloete 2013, R. van Eeden <em>in litt. </em>2013). Between 2013-2020, breeding success rate in the Kruger National Park has been poor (M. Murgatroyd&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2020). The species can use power pylons as nesting sites, which can lead to power outages, and so create human-wildlife conflict (Jenkins <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).<br/><p></p>","The global population has not been quantified, but was estimated as probably 'in tens of thousands' by Ferguson-Lees and Christie (2001).

region shows evidence of climate warming at regional (Peterson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Stephenson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, IPCC 2018) and local scales (Burrowes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Bhardwaj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Precipitation patterns are not as clear, but some studies have shown a significant drying trend (Nurse <em>et al. </em>2001, Neelin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Bhardwaj<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016). The frequency of extreme events like hurricanes, heavy rains, landslides, and droughts has increased significantly in the last decade (Méndez-Lázaro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Oppenheimer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019) and may continue to rise in the future (IPCC 2014, 2018).&#160;Due to characteristics intrinsic to their biology and physiology, patterns of recent climate change in the Caribbean are expected to be unfavorable to this species, and the increasing frequency, severity and duration of&#160;hurricanes are especially detrimental to it (Puerto Rico Red List Assessment Workshop 2020).&#160;Climate warming and drought have been associated with a decrease in arthropods (Lister and Garcia 2018), an important food item for frogs; however, there have been doubts regarding the methodology used by Lister and Garcia (2018) (see Willig<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). The effects of climate change can also be associated with an increased risk of chytridiomycosis (Longo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010).<span

The general habitat comprises low-lying, undulating plains (seldom rocky terrain, but never koppies), with a dominant low to medium-high shrub layer, a strong restioid and ericoid presence, and an essentially annual, herbaceous understorey with perennial grasses (Baard 1995a). During&#160;the hot and dry season&#160;<em>P. geometricus</em> takes refuge in slightly damper microhabitats under dense vegetation (E. Baard pers. obs.). This tortoise does not dig its own burrows but occasionally uses the burrows of other animals. The Geometric Tortoise is a rather small tortoise; males average about 10.0 cm in carapace length (CL) and 200 g in mass, females average 12.5 cm CL and 430 g, respectively. Large females of greater than 20.0 cm CL with a mass of 680 to 850 g have been recorded (Baard 1990, 1995b; M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data). Males reach sexual maturity after 8 to 10 yrs, while females usually mature at 11 to 13 yrs of age, but may mature in 10 yrs&#160;(Baard 1995b,&#160;Goode <em>et al</em>. 2012, M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data). Females may produce one or more clutches of one to five eggs in suitable conditions;&#160;or skip egg production&#160;during adverse periods (M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data). Egg and hatchling survival rates may be very low (possibly up to 99% mortality in the first year), thus recruitment is slow and generation time is estimated as 30 yrs (M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data). Longevity has been estimated at about 40 yrs (Goode <em>et al</em>. 2012), but these tortoises can probably live longer. Body condition declines during summer and autumn, with a simultaneous increase in blood urea nitrogen, indicating severe osmotic stress in the dry season, particularly in males searching for mates (Hofmeyr <em>et al.</em> 2017).","<p>Human-induced habitat alteration, degradation and destruction, largely due to extensive agricultural development (wine and wheat farming), have led to the irreversible alteration of more than 90% of&#160;<em>Psammobates geometricus</em>&#160;habitat. Human settlement, invasive alien species (both woody and herbaceous species), predators (including invasive feral pigs), overgrazing by domestic stock, droughts and wildfires (Baard 1997) seriously threaten survival in remaining habitats. Within its severely fragmented range, these threats are exacerbated in small, isolated subpopulations, which may not remain viable.&#160;Although infrequent, the illegal collection of specimens for local subsistence consumption and for the pet trade may be potentially significant threats.

A continuing threat involves improper management of&#160;<em>P. geometricus</em>&#160;habitat, which often becomes infested with alien plants and too densely vegetated to remain suitable for the species. A new threat is an increasing change of farming preferences from sheep to cattle, which cause greater damage to the habitat. The current conservation status is dire, and climate change, involving greater aridity (Midgley&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005), is likely to seriously compromise the survival of remaining, fragmented subpopulations (Hofmeyr&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, 2017).</span></p>","The range currently occupied by <em>Psammobates geometricus</em> has diminished markedly since historic times, but isolated subpopulations are still found in the Paarl district, north of Wellington towards Porterville, between Tulbagh, Wolseley, and Worcester, and in the Ceres Valley.

This species occurs within a small area of the&#160;Leuser Ecosystem, with an estimated extent of occurrence of approximately 8,000-15,000 km<sup>2 </sup>and there are continuing threats in all current known locations of Aceh Selatan, Kecamatan Kluet Selatan, Desa Pucuk Lembang and Gunung Leuser National Park. Therefore, this species is assessed as Vulnerable.","<em>Nemacheilus tuberigum</em>&#160;is recorded from shallow, clear, waters of small to moderate size streams, with gravel or sand bottom, and juveniles also known from murky water (Hadiaty and Siebert 2001). The waters it is known from are commonly tributary waters of larger streams. The average size of this species averages 53.4 mm SL (female) and most likely a total spawner fish (Hadiaty and Siebert 2001). More information is needed regarding the habitats and ecological role of this species.","This species faces large scale threats of habitat loss and degradation, and pollution through the expansion of urban developments and agricultural lands replacing its residence forests of the Gunung Leuser National Park (Sloan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Threats such as unofficial roads, legal and illegal deforestation, palm oil plantation expansion and forest fragmentation have been increasing throughout Sumatra, and within the Leuser ecosystem of Aceh. This is largely associated with prior forest degradation (Margono <em>et al</em>. 2012, Margono <em>et al</em>., 2014) from agricultural incursions, water extractions, forest extraction (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Linkie <em>et al</em>. 2014) and fires (Gaveau <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Sloan <em>et al</em>. 2017), much of which are done illegally also. The effects of these trends reflect the development pressures amidst poor spatial planning and law enforcement (Robertson and Van Schaik 2001).<br/><br/>An example of these potential threats to <em>Nemacheilus tuberigum</em>&#160;was the Kappi geothermal project, that was proposed for development within the Gunung Leuser National Park/World Heritage Site and was supported by the previous Aceh government (Sloan <em>et al</em>. 2018). Had it progressed, the development would entail the re-designation of 8,000 ha of primary forest in and around the park to ‘multi-use’ lands. However, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, responsible for the park management, rejected the proposal in late 2016 (Satriastanti 2016) and the central government later affirmed this position (GOI 2017), as did Aceh’s recently elected governor (Sloan <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although this is one example of a rejected development project, other projects have historically progressed and the illegal practices are still considered to be high and often to unknown levels (Sloan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).",More information is needed regarding the population size and trend.,Unknown,"<em>Nemacheilus tuberigum</em> is endemic to north-western Sumatra, Indonesia, Aceh, found within fresh-water rivers and streams of Aceh Selatan, Kecamatan Kluet Selatan, Desa Pucuk Lembang, and Gunung Leuser National Park (Hadiaty and Siebert 2001). This species found within multiple tributaries rivers including Kecamatan Kluet Selatan, Desa Pucuk Lembang in the Gunung Leuser National Park and the Alur Betung, Suaq Balimbing Research Station, a muddy forest tributary stream (Hadiaty and Siebert 2001).",More information is needed on the potential use and trade of this species.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation efforts directly focused for <em>Nemacheilus tuberigum</em>&#160;are not known, but the&#160;Leuser ecosystem is often the focus of conservation efforts by the Aceh government, and its distribution is largely within the&#160;Gunung Leuser National Park (Hadiaty and Siebert 2001). These two areas are in constant debate and shifting management of developments plans. As outlined and discussed by Sloan <em>et al.</em> (2018), production forest designations differ in protection against deforestation and are effective when the areas are relatively inaccessible, but also serve as overflow designation spots for cultivation and settlement. Sloan <em>et al.</em> (2018) also highlights the Leuser is a unique conservation area, having a unique ‘national strategic area’ for the protection of ecosystem services status that restricts infrastructure development and agricultural expansion, of which, the Aceh provincial government failed to recognise the Leuser as a 'national strategic area' and outlined countervailing infrastructure development plans.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

However recent data indicates that this population, which comprises the bulk of the global population, commenced a decline in 2010 that has since proceeded at an annual rate of 2-3%: a rate suspected to lead to an overall population reduction of between 25-38% over the three generations from 2010 and into the future. Causes of the recent decline are unknown, although population modelling indicates that only a small decline in estimated recruitment at current low levels of adult survival would lead to rapid declines in the Western Cape population. Previous declines were attributed to direct poisoning, power-line collisions and loss of its grassland breeding habitat owing to afforestation, mining, agriculture and development, any or all of which may once again be impacting the species along with potential capture for trade. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable. If the recent rapid rate of reported declines slows, then the species status will need revision.&#160;<br/><p></p>","<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is a partial migrant which makes local, seasonal movements across elevational gradients (best documented in Natal)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<strong></strong><strong></strong>Vernon <em>et al</em>. 1992, Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>.

In the fynbos it occurs almost exclusively in cultivated habitats, largely avoiding the natural vegetation<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(<strong></strong><strong></strong>Barnes 2000), although this habitat may provide important cover for juveniles<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Bidwell <em>et al.</em> 2006). The agricultural habitats that it uses include pastures; croplands, particularly where cereal crops are grown<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<strong></strong><strong></strong>Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>, and fallow fields.

Poisoning has decreased dramatically over the last few years. Accidental poisoning, however, still occurs occasionally when grain is soaked in agrochemicals for the capture of wildlife for food, although cranes are not usually the target species&#160;<strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, T. Smith <em>in litt. </em>2018). Farmers report high levels of crop damage from rodents and geese in the Overberg and Swartland (Mangnall &amp; Crowe, 2001; van Velden, 2016). Poisoned baits are commonly used for controlling rodents, which can result in accidental crane poisoning. Cranes are social birds and poisoning often involves a number of individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007). Afforestation is ongoing and large tracts of suitable grassland habitat have been designated for afforestation over the few years following 2007 in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007). In the Western Cape, the species is threatened by a change in agricultural crops and increases in the human population in agricultural areas<strong><sup>&#160;</sup></strong>(Bidwell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, K. Morrison&#160;<em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, 2017, Shaw&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010).

Morrison&#160;<em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, 2017)<strong></strong>. It is also uncertain how predicted hotter and drier conditions in the Western Cape will affect breeding cranes over the dry summers. Prolonged dry spells affecting habitat quality not only will directly impact the species, but can also result in competition with domestic stock for habitat at such times<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span>(R. Simmons&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>1999,&#160;<strong></strong>K. Morrison&#160;<em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, M. D'Alton <em>in litt. </em>2018).<br/><br/>Other major threats include collision with power-lines, which is now arguably the major cause of mortality and could have been a major hidden cause before lines were monitored<strong> </strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007, Shaw <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010, Shaw, 2013), entanglement with fences, illegal capture of fledglings (for food and a growing threat from local and international trade [K.

Scott <em>in litt. </em>2018), predation by domestic dogs and the drowning of chicks in water-troughs (<strong></strong><strong></strong>Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>. In the Overberg, Western Cape, which holds approximately half the global population, modelling gave a conservative estimate that c.12% (95% CI 5-23%) of the Blue Crane population in the study area is killed annually in power-line collisions (Shaw <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010), which exceeds the maximum annual adult mortality rate of 7.5% beyond which a population viability assessment predicts the Western Cape population would be unable to persist (Shaw <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). Collision rates are also high in the Karoo, but mortality there is likely to be under-reported (Shaw 2013, L. Leeunwner <em>in litt. </em>2018). Both the Overberg Western Cape and the Karoo have been earmarked by the South African government as priority areas for renewable energy development, ie, wind and solar (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2016). As of yet, wind turbines have resulted in only a small number of casualties of this species, but with predicted increases in the number of wind farms this could become a greater threat to the species (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2017). The expansion of powerline networks to connect these facilities to the national grid is another threat from renewable energy development.&#160;<p></p>Specific threats to the Namibian population include the encroachment of human populations onto the grasslands, and human activities connected to agriculture destroying Blue Crane habitat. Additionally, this species is illegally hunted for use in traditional medicine, and for consumption (Simmons, 2015).","The most recent published Blue Crane population estimates for South Africa are those of McCann <em>et al. </em>(2007), with a minimum of 25,520 individuals. Of these, the Western Cape held the largest numbers, 12,095 individuals, with 10,822 in the central Karoo and 2,616 in the eastern grasslands, the traditional stronghold (McCann <em>et al. </em>2007). The disconnected population in northern Namibia is very small, with annual maxima not exceeding 35 in recent years: 32 individuals was the high in 2018, 33 in 2019 (Namibia Crane Working Group 2018, 2019, Scott <em>et al. </em>2019). The minimum estimate for the global population size is therefore <em>c.&#160;</em>25,550 individuals.<br/><br/>A recent, unpublished, Distance-based survey in the Western Cape suggests that numbers here may be higher than those estimated by McCann <em>et al. </em>(2007), with possibly up to 25,000 birds in the Western Cape alone (C. Craig <em>in litt. </em>via IUCN SSC Crane Specialist Group 2020). This is a very preliminary estimate, assuming presence at equivalent density across all pasture/fallow land in the Western Cape, and would represent a rapid increase in this population up to the recent past. Assuming stability in the other regions, the maximum population size could be <em>c.&#160;</em>38,500 individuals, while if a further assumption is made that the proportions between the three areas have remained the same (i.e. all have increased) then the potential maximum is 45,132 individuals (C. Craig <em>in litt. </em>via IUCN SSC Crane Specialist Group 2020).<br/><br/>The total population size is therefore estimated at 25,550 - 45,132 individuals (here rounded to 25,000 - 46,000 individuals), which is assumed to equate to roughly 17,033 - 30,088 mature individuals, here rounded to 17,000 - 30,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>While numbers were previously increasing in the Western Cape, recent analysis of driven transect data suggests that this population is now declining by 2-3% annually (IUCN SSC Crane Specialist Group, International Crane Foundation, Endangered Wildlife Trust, K. Shaw &amp; P. Ryan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). If this rate persists, over the next three generations (37.5 years), dependent on the proportion of the whole population that this represents, the future three-generation reduction would be suspected to fall between 24.9-37.6%.",Decreasing,"<em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Anthropoides paradiseus</span></em> is near-endemic to <strong>South Africa</strong>, with a small breeding population also in northern <strong>Namibia</strong> after rapidly declining in 1980s-1990s.

However, since 2010 the Western Cape population has begun to decline by 2-3% per year (IUCN SSC Crane Specialist Group, International Crane Foundation, Endangered Wildlife Trust, K. Shaw &amp; P. Ryan&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2020). There has been a 5% reduction in the number of quarter degree grid squares occupied by the species between the two South African Bird Atlas projects (SABAP 1 (1987-1991) and SABAP 2 (2007-2020).&#160; Dramatic declines previously occurred in the latter part of the twentieth century, e.g. of up to 80% in Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and Eastern Cape during the 1980s<strong> </strong>(Barnes 2000)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>The increase in the Western Cape, which holds c. 52% of the population, accompanied the conversion of fynbos and renosterveld vegetation to agricultural land (McCann<em> et al</em>. 2007), although adult survival may be relatively low there (van Velden <em>et al. </em>2017). The population in the central Karoo region, representing c. 29% of the population, is presently thought to be stable, or potentially increasing (Allan, 2005; McCann<em> et al</em>. 2007; Shaw <em>et al</em>., 2015). In the grasslands, formerly the species's stronghold, numbers now represent <em>c.</em>14% of the total population and show significant reductions in reporting rate between SABAP 1 and SABAP 2.<br/><br/>In Namibia, the species continues to persist at low numbers: maximum counts in the 1970s of 138 individuals have dwindled to regular counts of fewer than 35 birds in the past decade (Simmons, 2015; A. Scott and M. Scott <em>in litt.</em>, 2018),&#160;and a maximum of only 33 in 2019 (Scott <em>et al. </em>2019; Namibia Crane Working Group 2019).<br/><p></p>Small numbers have been recorded in Namaqualand since 2005, a northwest extension of the South African range closer to Namibia (Simmons 2011).","The removal of crane chicks from the wild for domestic and international captive trade is considered a threat in South Africa, with legally kept cranes used to legitimise illegally-obtained individuals by reported that they are the chicks of the legal pair (Morrison <em>et al. </em>2019).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. Conservation measures have expanded in scale since the mid-1980s, including efforts to mitigate power-line collisions, addressing illegal trade, the adoption of stricter legal protection, local and national surveys in South Africa, increasing research on the species's biology and ecology, habitat protection and management programmes (especially on private land, where the majority of its habitat is [Young <em>et al.</em> 2003]), establishment of local conservation organisations, and the development of educational facilities, programmes and publications (Archibald and Meine 1996,<strong></strong> Barnes 2000). The introduction of more ecologically sensitive agrochemicals and tighter controls over their use has reduced the number of poisoning events<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong style=""font-weight: normal;""> (</strong>K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007).&#160;The African Crane Conservation Programme of the International Crane Foundation / Endangered Wildlife Trust Partnership (ICF/EWT) is working in a range of areas to help conserve this species (Shaw 2015). This includes increasing environmental education of stakeholders, community involvement in sustainable use of habitats, reducing conflict with farmers, population monitoring, monitoring of the trade of captive individuals, and working with the power company Eskom to reduce power line collisions (Shaw 2015). EWT/ESKOM research in the Karoo has shown that fitting devices on transmission powerlines to make them more visible to birds is very effective in reducing Blue Crane collisions (Shaw <em>et al. </em>2021). Prioritising powerline mitigation is key to reducing this threat. A PhD project between the Endangered Wildlife Trust/ International Crane Foundation and FitzPatrick Institute is currently underway, looking to understand the threats to the species in the Western Cape and Karoo, the population trends, and to predict the viability of the species in these regions (C. Craig <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). The formation of a Crane Working Group in Namibia has facilitated education, surveys, ringing and protection (R. Simmons<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2007). Future studies in Namibia will assess whether its population is genetically isolated from that in South Africa, and will use transmitters to help study habitat use, their choice of breeding areas and the occurrence of inter-breeding (Simmons <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Prevent conversion of grassland habitat to other land uses and secure sites critical to cranes in the grasslands (K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007). Monitor the species's population trends through regular surveys, and conduct further work to better understand the relative impact of the different threats facing the species to help plan and prioritise conservation actions (Shaw 2015). Include habitat management in future planning of afforestable regions (Barnes 2000). Encourage more responsible use of agrochemicals<strong> </strong>(Barnes 2000). Target awareness campaigns at the farming community so as to increase awareness and reduce deliberate poisoning of cranes for food<strong> </strong>(Barnes 2000,<strong> </strong>K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007). Provide effective non-lethal alternatives to prevent damages from geese and rodents, so that farmers do not resort to non-target methods such as poison. Make hazardous power-lines more visible with appropriate devices (Barnes 2000, Shaw <em>et al. </em>2010, Shaw <em>et al. </em>2021). Discourage the taking of fledglings from the wild<strong> </strong>(Barnes 2000). Encourage the retention of a mosaic of pasture and cereal cultivation in the Western Cape (Bidwell <em>et al.</em> 2006). Increase conservation protection of grasslands and wetlands north of Etosha National Park (K. Morrison <em>et al. in litt</em>. 2007) and establish captive breeding populations to support future reintroduction and supplementation efforts. A Biodiversity Management Plan for Species for cranes, as outlined in the National Biodiversity Act (2004) would encourage national support for crane conservation efforts. Actions identified for the Namibian population include researching and monitoring population size, survival and breeding success, and movement. Identify critical areas outside of Etosha National Park that are used by cranes and potentially need conservation attention. Monitor the power lines surrounding the park for collisions and mitigate where necessary (Simmons, 2015).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The species is also predicted to decline by more than 50% over the next three generations across its entire range due to continuing hunting pressures and loss of habitat. Hunted animals are used for traditional medicines, and for national and international trade in pets and tourist photo props. Bengal Slow Lorises are also caught for meat, and their body parts are used as tourist key rings. The combined effects of forest loss of more than 30% over the last 24 years, and disappearance of the species in several locations in countries like Cambodia due to hunting, and continued threats into the future are factors determining the declines in the past, continuing and suspected declines in the future.</p>","<p><span class=""apple-converted-space"">This is an arboreal, nocturnal species that inhabits tropical evergreen rainforest, semi-evergreen forest, and mixed deciduous forest. In Viet Nam it is found only in secondary forests, and on the edge of primary forests; the species also occurs in agricultural fields and plantations (V. Thanh pers. comm., Pliosongnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2014). It ranges from sea level (U. Streicher pers. comm.) up to 2,400 m (Choudhury 2001). In Cambodia, <em>N. bengalensis </em>has been observed in dipterocarp and evergreen forest (Mould 2013, Eam Sam Un 2014) and community forests (Eam Sam Un 2014). In India, they are found in semi-evergreen, evergreen and mixed deciduous forest (Das 2005, 2009, 2014; Pliosungnoen 2014). In Laos, the species is found often in protected evergreen forests (Evans 2000, Coudrat 2012), and have also been observed in plantation forests (Pliosungnoen unpublished data) and bamboo stands (Streicher pers. comm). It can live in heavily disturbed agricultural areas if suitable foods are available.<span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><br/>The diet of the Bengal Slow Loris consists of nectar, plant bark, fruits and small invertebrates; the majority of their wild diet comprises plant exudates and this is a key staple year round (Swapna <em>et al</em>. 2009, Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Das <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Nycticebus bengalensis</em> are venomous, as are other members of the slow loris genus (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013).</span><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><br/><br/>This animal's life span is about 15 years, and generation time is 7-8 years. Females give birth to one offspring per litter once every two years in semi-wild conditions (Rowe 1996). In captivity, this rate may be slightly higher (U. Streicher pers. comm).</span></p>","<span class=""apple-converted-space"">The major threats that this species' habitat faces include farming, timber removal, human settlement, road building, dams, power lines, fragmentations, soil loss and erosion, and deliberately set fires. It is hunted and traded for food, traditional ""medicine"", sport, and as pet (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris and Nijman 2007, V. Thanh and U. Streicher pers. comm., Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2014). Road kills represent another threat to this species (Rhadakrishna <em>et al</em>. 2006). It is also threatened for the tourist photo prop trade across some of its range, particularly in Thailand, where 94% of individuals photographed in the photo prop trade from Patong beach were <em>N. bengalensis </em>(Osterberg and Nekaris 2015); this trade is extending into Europe, in countries such as Turkey. The species has been observed for sale in markets for traditional medicine purposes at Mong La, on the Chinese border of Myanmar (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2013), where its arms are also sold as key rings (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is also known to be sold for use in traditional medicine elsewhere (Cambodia, Viet Nam and India) (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The exploitation of the species appears to be particularly high in Cambodia with researchers reporting no <em>N. bengalensis </em>present at most sites (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010). The release of slow lorises confiscated from the illegal pet trade with little or no rehabilitation is a threat to all slow loris species, as is translocation from human-dominated landscapes into forests, to which individuals of the species may not be adapted (Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2014, Starr and Nekaris 2015). Lack of law enforcement further threatens slow loris species across their range (Starr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<p>In India, the encounter rates vary from 0.1 to 0.77/km (Radhakrishna&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Surveys have been carried out in Assam, India since 2005, with densities fluctuating over time. In 2005, densities of <em>N. bengalensis </em>ranged from 0.03-0.05 individuals/km (Das, 2005), in 2009 densities were found at 0.18 individuals/km (Das <em>et al</em>. 2009). In 2014, densities of <em>N. bengalensis </em>had declined to a range of 0.06-0.20 individuals/km (Das <em>et al</em>. 2015). Known localities of the species are as follows: Arunachal Pradesh (Changlang, Tale Valley WS, Kamlang WS, Kamlang RF, Mehao WS, Pakkei WS, Itanagar WS, Pakke Tiger Reserve, Deban, Namdapha Tiger Reserve); Assam (Amsang WS, Barnadi WS, Basistha RF, Bherjan Borajan Podumani WS, Borlander RF, Borail RF, Borajan WS, Burachapori WS, Chakrasila WS, Chirrang RF, Dehing Patkai WS, Dhansiri RF, Dibru Saikhuwa NP, Garampani WS, Gibbon WS, Goalpara, Innerline RF, Jeypore RF, Kaziranga NP, Langting Mupa RF, Laokhowa WS, Manas NP, Nameri NP, Nambor-Doigurung WS, Sonai Rupai WS, Ranni RF, Pobitora WS); Meghalaya (Nokrek NP, Balpakram NP, Baghmara RF, Nongkhyllem WS, Narpuh RF, Angratoli RF, Darugiri RF, Sibbari-Jacksongram Community Forest, Dambuk Adingre Community Forest, Siju Dobakol caves, Siju Forest Complex, Matcha Nokpante Community Forest); Mizoram&#160; (Nengpui WS, Dampa WS); Tripura (Trishna WS; Sepahijala WS) (Das J, Chetry, D pers comm; Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003; Das <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2015; Radhakrishna <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2010; Swapna <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The few records available for Myanmar come from a survey by Fauna and Flora International in Kachin State, where no night walks were ever conducted over two years. In 2011, a juvenile Bengal slow loris was encountered downhill from Saw Law (N 26.15396, E 98. 27053; elevation 1,541 m asl) on the way back to Chibwe (N 25.88614, E 98.12851; elevation 257 m asl). Hunters in this area also reported seeing them during shifting cultivation. A captive Bengal slow loris was recorded in Phimaw Internally Displaced Person’s camp in February - March 2013 that was reported to come from the local area. According to local people, slow lorises are rarely seen in this area and are not easy to find. <br/><br/>In Bangladesh, no specific nation-wide population survey on this species has been carried out, but a 2015 survey team encountered 34 Bengal slow lorises (18-night survey) in Satchari National Park of Sylhet division. A one-night survey in Lawachara National Park revealed three individuals (S.C. Rahman, pers. comm). The species was also recorded in Rema-Kalenga&#160;Wildlife Sanctuary (Feeroz <em>et al</em>, 2011) and Rajkandi Reserve Forest of Sylhet area (M. Foysal, T. Khan, pers.comm). Feeroz (2013) reported <em>N. bengalensis </em>as being rare in Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary of Chittagong region. All of these forests are semi- evergreen. A photography record is available from Kaptai National Park, Rangamati Hill District under Chittagong division (S.R. Rahul, pers. comm.). Beside these records, since 2010, several Bengal Slow Lorises were taken from human habitation in Jamalpur, Sherpur and Mymensingh district. These districts have some deciduous forests and are connected with Meghalaya state of India.<br/><br/>In Bhutan Choudhury (2008) reports that Bengal slow loris habitat is mostly tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen forests in the foothills up to 300 m. The species has been indirectly recorded in the possession of woodcutters in four dzongkhags including Pema Gatshel, Samdrup Jongkar, Sarpang and Zemgang. From this, Choudhury inferred that they should occur in Royal Manas National Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Wangchuk&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2004) wrote that lorises also occur in Chukha and Samchi districts, but did not say on what evidence. The existing records indicate that the Sankosh River is the western limit for the species in Bhutan as well as Assam.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, some researchers report the population to occur potentially in large forest tracts (R. Timmins pers. comm). Duckworth (1994) and Ratajszczak (1998), however, both reported the species as being very rare in Lao PDR, with the former reporting abundance indices of about 0.30-0.65/km at sites including: Central Laos (Phou Xang He, NakaiNam Theun, Xe Piang, Muang Hom, Nam Kading, Nam Ao, Bang Navang) and South Laos (Xe Namoy). In 2000, published data from 1994-1995 recorded <em>N. bengalensis </em>frequency as “common” in some forests (Phou Khaokhoay NBCA, Nam Kading NBCA, and Bolavens Northeast PPA), whereas they were encountered “occasional” in others (Nakai Plateau) (Evans, et al., 2000, Streicher, 2014). A single record comes from Southern Laos in Xe Kaman lowlands in Dong Ampham NBCA, Attapu Province&#160; (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, the populations are severely reduced and have disappeared from many forests (Fitch-Snyder and Thanh 2002; V. Thanh pers. comm). Surveys carried out in northern Viet Nam at Na Hang Nature Reserve in 2013 recorded a density of 0.09 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data). Recent surveys of N. bengalensis in Central Vietnam at Bach Ma National Park returned no animals in 30.4 km of surveys (Blair, unpublished data). A large population with a phenotype of the Cambodian forms occurs on Phu Quoc island in the Gulf of Thailand (Huaong and Blair, pers. comm). Surveys in 2014 in Phu Quoc Island recorded a density of 0.38 individuals/km (Blair, unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Cambodia the species is very rare and has only been seen west of the Mekong River in Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Kulen National Park at 22.5-25.0 animals per km2 (Starr et al., 2010). Observations of recently hunted animals were made in Preah Vihear Protection Forest, Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Tbeng (Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2011). Starr <em>et al</em>. (2010) failed to detect this species in Bokor National Park and Cardamoms Protected Forest; they also did not detect it east of the Mekong (Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary and Mondulkiri PF); Coudrat et al. also could not find this species east of the Mekong at the following sites: Mondulkiri (Lumphat Wildlife Sanctuary, Phnom Pritch Wildlife Sanctuary) or Ratanakiri (Vonsei District, Virachey National Park, Seima Protection Forest, Snoul Wildlife Sanctuary). Other surveyors in Cambodia have noted the presence of the species in a number of community forests (Eam Sam Un, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Bengal slow loris is thought to be widespread (W. Brockelman pers. comm.) but has never been surveyed specifically.&#160; It is known from Khao Yai National Park. Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. (2010) found that the species is absent from many forests, and occurs at very low densities when present. In plantation forest in Khao Ang Runai Wildlife Sanctuary, they recorded Bengal slow lories at a density of 0.64 individuals/km (Pliosungnoen <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>In China, surveys have been carried out since 2013. Bengal Slow Loris habitat is mostly primary evergreen broad-leaf forest up to 2,200 m. The population occurs in counties of western and southwestern Yunnan (Yingjiang, Longchuan, Ruili, Tengchong, Mangshi, Zhenkang, Cangyuan, Gengma, Yongde, Shuangjiang, Ximeng, Lancang, Menglian, Menghai, Mengla), even in secondary forests and agricultural plantations (Ni, pers. comm.). Survey in Cangyuan recorded a density of 0.33 individuals/km (Ni, unpublished data). In southern and southeastern Yunnan, Bengal slow loris is mostly distributed in scattered nature reserves as follows: Yuanjiang, Amushan, Guanyinshan, Huanglianshan, Fenshuiling, Daweishan, Laojunshan, Gulinqing, Laoshan. The populations are severely reduced and have possibly disappeared from southwest of Guangxi Province (Ni, per. comm.). Suitable habitat, also containing gibbons, can be found in many nature reserves, where the species is likely present but still to be confirmed, including Nanguanhe, Ailaoshan, Xishuangbanna, Nabanhe, Wenshan in Yuannan; and Bangliang in Guangxi.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in Bangladesh, Cambodia West of the Mekong River, China (southern and western Yunnan and possibly in southwestern Guangxi), north-eastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand north of the Isthmus of Kra, and Viet Nam.</p>","The species is&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space"">hunted and traded for (i) food, traditional ""medicine"", sport, and as pets (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris and Nijman 2007, V.

Furthermore, timber management changes since 2000 within the species's range may provide more habitat in the future.

For this reason it is currently classified as Vulnerable. More accurate survey data may warrant a re-evaluation of its status.<p></p>,"It breeds in boreal wetlands, primarily around ponds and streams within the boreal forest (see Powell&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It winters primarily in wooded wetlands and is not strongly associated with open agricultural habitats. Large flocks have been known to gather in suburban areas during wintering periods (Newell Wohner <em>et al</em>. 2018).<p></p>","The reasons behind current trends are poorly understood but several threats are suspected to be causing the declines. The destruction and conversion of boreal wetlands (predominantly in the southern boreal forests) is a significant threat to the species. Strip-mining for tar sands is expected to increase in the future, with up to 300,000 ha of Canada's boreal forest and wetland predicted to be directly affected over the next 30 to 50 years (Wells&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2008). Other possible threats include boreal wetland drying and chemical change resulting from global climate change (Matsuoka&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, McClure&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), depletion of available calcium resulting from acid precipitation (Greenberg and Droege 1999, Greenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), increase in methyl mercury (Greenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Edmonds et al. 2012), disease (Barnard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010), loss of boreal forest habitat due to hydropower development (S. Luepold&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), loss of wooded wetlands in the south-east U.S. winter range (Hamel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Greenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), and mortality associated with past and ongoing blackbird control efforts&#160;(Greenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Recent research suggests that an ecological trap created through timber harvesting and clear-cutting on breeding grounds may be responsible for declines, possibly through increased Red squirrel (<em>Tamiascirius hudsonicus</em>)&#160;nest predation, however evidence of such a trap is largely lacking (Buckley Luepold <em>et al</em>. 2015). Forest loss within the species's range is currently estimated at ~5.4% across the stipulated ten year period (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). Potential low level mortality may also result from collisions with communication towers (Longcore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).<p></p>","The population is estimated to number anywhere between 0.2-2 million individuals (R. Greenberg <em>in litt.</em> 2006, Scarl 2013), although a lack of accurate population surveys render this estimate highly uncertain. Further research to accurately quantify this species's population size is a pressing requirement.",Decreasing,"<em>Euphagus carolinus&#160;</em>has a large range, breeding across the boreal zone of North America from New England, through&#160;<strong>Canada</strong>&#160;to Alaska and winters widely across the south-eastern&#160;<strong>U.S.A.</strong>. The population was estimated at 2 million individuals based on data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey collected during the 1980s and 1990s. This figure is now likely to be a considerable overestimate as the species continues to decline, and a recent study only found the species at &lt;10% of sites (Scarl 2013).

It no longer qualifies as Vulnerable as there is no continuing decline. Recent increases in the population have been driven by a reduction in adult mortality through a combination of winter habitat protection and creation, and potentially also a temporary increase in the extent of suitable breeding habitat due to glacial melting. <br/><br/>The species remains Near Threatened as it is plausible that further changes in breeding habitat driven by climate change will reverse the positive recent impact and result in loss of wetlands. In addition there is concern that the impact of existing threats will grow, specifically from feral dogs and human disturbance at breeding sites, and power line collisions and accidental poisoning events during migration and the non-breeding season.<p></p> <p></p>","It breeds in alpine bog meadows and riverine marshes, favouring lacustrine marshes from 2,600-4,900 m. It prefers to nest at large water bodies, at a water depth of around 30 cm: this probably minimises exposure to nest predators. It winters in river valleys and along reservoir shorelines in the vicinity of barley and spring wheat fields. Whilst it prefers breeding in lakes, shallow marshes and meadows are the most important habitat for feeding; its diet consists of roots, tubers, insects, snails, shrimps, fish, frogs, small birds and rodents (Wu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009; Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010a, 2014).<br/><p></p>","Threats to the species are primarily connected with the availability of sufficient undisturbed habitat with suitable water levels. There is evidence that Black-necked Cranes are becoming concentrated at fewer sites in wintering locations, with some previously used areas being converted to greenhouse agriculture or for industrial development (Jia <em>et al. </em>2019). The general increase in the human population in the vicinity of the wetlands the species uses results in higher water demands that can reduce the suitability of key sites, while some have been directly drained for development (Lhendup and Webb 2009). Consequently, development projects that affect the control of water levels must account for the potential impact on the species, which is highly sensitive to water levels due to the threat from mammalian predators. At Dashanbao National Nature Reserve, China, plans to designate the area as a National Park include the relocation of people away from the core zone, however the increasing population of Black-necked Crane demonstrate a clear affinity for human sites due to the provision of waste grain from farming activities (Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The relocation plan would lead to the abandonment of&#160;farmland, upon which the cranes depend (Kong&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011. Peng&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020, Wu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This represents a potential significant reduction in the number of cranes that this key site can support over winter in the future, which may drive increased adult mortality in this section of the population. Currently, a payment for ecosystem services pilot appears to be contributing towards a steady increase in crane numbers here (Peng <em>et al. </em>2020). A switch to planting a greater proportion of winter wheat reduces the availability of grain on cultivated land, and Peng <em>et al. </em>(2020) also demonstrate that the species generally avoids ploughed fields.&#160;<br/><br/>Climate change appears to be having a positive effect on the species's habitat over recent years (Li 2019), but there is concern that future change will reverse any positive impacts due to drying of breeding sites within the high altitude breeding range of the species (J. Harris&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2007, M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). In some areas water levels may be rising as a result of glacial melt and increased rainfall, but a lot of shallow wetlands used by the cranes are thought to be disappearing due to permafrost degradation (Farrington 2009). For example, in Ladakh, India, Lake Tsomoriri showed a rise in water between 2000-2006 and then the water level started decreasing, whereas Tsokar Basin is shrinking (P. Chandan&#160;<em>pers comm. per&#160;</em>M. A. Bishop and F. Li.&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). These peripheral areas of the population may be the first to demontrate negative impacts and these populations should be carefully monitored.<br/><br/>A small number of birds have been killed after striking power-lines (Li 2002; Li&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012), and wind turbines could prove an additional threat (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;The threat from power-lines is suspected to be growing following the rapid expansion of local power grids in China: 9 out of 15 juvenile Black-necked Crane fitted with satellite tags were killed in Linzhou, Tibet between 2018-2020 (Y. Guo&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). The use of poisoned bait to control rodent pests in breeding areas poses the risk of unintentional posioning (Li 2019). Intensive grazing has caused degradation of grasslands in breeding grounds, with an increase in grazing in wetlands of particular concern (Li 2019). In Bhutan and India, feral dogs have been increasingly observed to take eggs and chicks, and even adults (I. Acharja <em>in litt. </em>2020, S. Dhumal <em>in litt. </em>2020, J. Eaton <em>in litt. </em>2020,&#160;&#160;L. Visuddha <em>in litt. </em>2020)<br/>There are additional threats from poorly-regulated tourism to wintering areas, which could cause significant disturbance to large numbers of birds and reduce habitat area and quality through the creation of additional infrastructure such as roads (M. A. Bishop and F. Li&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Fish-farming, peat and firewood collection, river channelisation, industrial pollution and sedimentation, and the construction of roads and fences have resulted in increased disturbance and habitat degradation in Qinghai, Sichuan, Ruoergai and Yunnan, China (Wu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, Qiang Liu&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010). Further disturbance at the species's stopover sites arises from the use of the areas as camping grounds by local herders (Qian&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).&#160;The collection of eggs and poaching have been problems in parts of China and India, although the extent of this is currently not thought to be significant.","The global population is estimated at c.10,000-10,200 individuals in total (Li <em>et al </em>2014), roughly equivalent to&#160;c.6,600-6,800 mature individuals. Recent counts suggest that numbers may be larger than this (Jia <em>et al. </em>2019) and if these counts genuinely reflect a larger total rather than redistribution then&#160;this figure may need to be further revised upwards.",Stable,"<em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Grus nigricollis</span> breeds on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">China</span>, with a small population in adjacent Ladakh, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">India (</span>Li 2019). The breeding area stretches through mostly continuous plateaus (Li 2019). Ruoergai marshes is thought to hold the largest breeding population, estimated at 2,500 mature individuals (Li 2009). 476 individuals (plus 38 chicks) were recorded in a breeding population survey in the Changtang region of Tibet in 2008 (Li 2019). Repeated surveys at Shenzha in the southern part of the Celin Cuo Black-necked Crane National Nature Reserve found 16 nests in 1991 and 30 nests in 2000. Where breeding sites have been revisited, the recent numbers of breeding pairs have been greater than past reports (Li 2019).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Three isolated wintering populations<span lang=""EN-US""> have been identified at lower altitudes on the Qinghai-Tibet and Yunnan-Guizhou plateaus, China, and<strong> Bhutan</strong>.&#160;<br/>(1) The Eastern population, approximately 4,300 cranes, winters in northeastern Yunnan and northwestern Guizhou Provinces (Li <em>et al. </em>2014, Yang &amp; Zhang 2014). The majority winter in three national nature reserves on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in this flyway (Dashanbao, Cao Hai and Huize), where 2,469 Black-necked Cranes were counted in 2004 (Li and Yang 2005). Satellite tracking data of eight birds and two colour-banded cranes show birds from Dashanbao and Cao Hai migrate to Ruoergai for breeding (Qian <em>et al. </em>2009, Wu <em>et al.&#160;</em>1993).

Therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It is a native-prairie specialist (Anstey <em>et al.</em> 1995)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, its breeding range restricted to short-grass and mixed-grass prairie regions, and its wintering range restricted to dry grasslands and deserts, where it feeds on grains in high density flocks (Hill and Gould 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It prefers native grasslands recently disturbed by fire, grazing or mowing, and will avoid nesting in areas protected from grazing or cultivated fields (Maher 1973, <strong></strong>Owens and Myres 1973)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.&#160;Critical habitat has been identified as open areas of upland native grassland &gt; 39 ha in fair to excellent range condition with flat to gently rolling topography and with limited woody vegetation or invasion by exotic grasses (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018, COSEWIC 2019, D. Hill <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<p></p>","As a result of conversion of native prairie to croplands and urban developments it has disappeared from much of its historical breeding range (e.g. in Kansas, Nebraska and Minnesota); the species exhibits significantly lower nest survival and fledges fewer young in non-native grassland pastures compared to native prairies (Lloyd and Martin 2005, Davis <em>et al</em>. 2016). Fragmentation of native grasslands reduces the suitability of breeding habitat (D. P. Hill and L. K. Gould&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016); a study in southern Saskatchewan found that the species did not use habitat patches &lt;39 ha (Davis 2004). Abundance, and nest fledging, success and productivity are reduced along roads (Sutter <em>et al</em>. 2000) and in close proximity to oil and gas wells (Ng 2017, Yoo and Koper 2017, Ng 2019, PCAP 2019). It exhibits delayed displacement (&gt;300 m) in response to wind energy infrastructure (Shaffer and Buhl 2015).&#160;Conversion of the species's wintering habitat to irrigated agriculture in Mexico also poses a threat (G.

The wintering range has also contracted: this is presumed to have resulted from a population decline. Brown-headed cowbirds parasitise this species at low to moderate rates and there is a high level of predation by native predators (Hill and Gould 1997, Shaffer <em>et al</em>. 2019)<strong></strong>. It can be vulnerable to disturbance (Hill and Gould 1997), and it has been reported killed at communication towers (Longcore <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;The species is also thought vulnerable to predicted drying as a result of climate change in the western part of its breeding range and in the wintering range (G.

A recovery strategy for the species has been proposed under the Species at Risk Act (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018).

Spotted Owl faces strong competition from Barred Owl which is gradually displacing Spotted Owls from much of the northern part of their range, outcompeting Spotted Owls for food and space, reducing Spotted Owl occupancy and breeding propensity, and occasionally hybridising (Kelly and Forsman 2004, Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Wiens <em>et al</em>. 2014, Dugger&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Long and Wolfe 2019, Mangan <em>et al</em>. 2019)<strong></strong>.

Degradation and fragmentation of its habitat through clear felling and selective logging of large trees is a primary threat to the species (Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 1995, Jones <em>et al</em>. 2018); with habitat fragmentation shown to correlate with decreased probability of survival (Schilling <em>et al. </em>2013); the rate of logging is however reported to have declined notably in the past 20-30 years (Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, J. Dunk <em>in litt</em>. 2020). This has been compounded by the removal of a legal requirement that the U. S. Forest Service assess the viability of wildlife on national forest lands (Noon and Blakesley 2006)<strong></strong>. Forest loss throughout the species's range is currently estimated at ~7.25% over three generations (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). Populations in the&#160;southwest of its range, California, and dry inland forests of the Pacific Northwest&#160;are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation caused by high-severity fire (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2019) and drought associated with climate change  (see Peery <em>et al. </em>2011, Jones <em>et al. </em>2016, T. Supplee <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al. </em>2017, Wan <em>et al</em>. 2019) although low- and moderate-severity fires are not thought to significantly affect the species (see Bond <em>et al</em>. 2002, Roberts <em>et al. </em>2011, Lee <em>et al. </em>2012, Willey and van Riper III 2014, Ganey <em>et al</em>. 2017) and may even create favourable foraging conditions (Eyes <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;Habitat loss to wildfire has been greater than expected in recent years, raising the economic value of remaining habitat (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Projected climate change may result in hotter and drier summers with longer fire seasons and larger more intense fires, as well as increased tree mortality from drought and insects, and uncertainty over the viability of habitat restoration. Further effects from climate change may affect different areas differently (see Peery <em>et al. </em>2011) and could include changes in the frequency and duration of inclement weather during the breeding season (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012); and in the Pacific Northwest it may lead to wetter and warmer winters (Glenn <em>et al. </em>2010). Timber harvesting on private land is a significant threat, as well as renewed pressure to eliminate protections for the species on federal land in Oregon, in order to allow increased logging (T. Supplee  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011, R. Gutiérrez&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Unfavourable management includes intensive thinning of suitable habitat,  which is expected to result in declines over the short term (T. Supplee  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2011), as well as logging and manipulation of canopy vegetation to reduce the risk of wildfire (B. Bird <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). The species may also face high levels of disturbance, especially in recreational areas where it occurs such as National Parks (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Energy development and associated habitat loss and mortalities from collisions with powerlines could also be affecting this species, but the degree of impact is essentially unknown (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Potentially serious threats include West Nile virus, which is fatal to the species (although it may be absent from some subpopulations [Hull <em>et al. </em>2010]), the potential loss of habitat to Sudden Oak Death Syndrome  (D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), and avian malaria, which has been discovered in the species and found to weaken infected individuals, probably reducing reproductive success (Ishak<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al</span>. 2008, D. Heiken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). Enhanced exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (AR), illegally utilised, in and widely contaminating the remote forests of California, USA, may also be adversely impacting the species (Gabriel <em>et al</em>. 2018, Wiens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019a). Other potential threats have been put forward, for instance it has been mooted that water management could possibly have an impact on the species through indirect effects, though these will require further study (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012, Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 2017).<p></p>","Its population size was estimated at c.15,000 mature individuals (Rich <em>et al</em>. 2004).

Mexican Spotted Owl may be considered to be declining (U. S.

Lammertink <em>in litt.</em> 1998) and at least locally in New Mexico some subpopualations may be increasing (Ganey <em>et al. </em>2014b).

Protected Activity Centres are advocated for as an effective mechanism of conserving the species in parts of its range (Verner <em>et al</em>. 1992, Willey and van Riper III 2007)<strong></strong>. In 2012 9.6 million acres of habitat was designated as critical habitat for the Northern Spotted Owl by U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Society for Conservation Biology&#160;2012, Dunk <em>et al</em>. 2019). A captive breeding programme was started at the Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre, British Columbia, with a second attempt in Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. Neither have so far had much success (Moore 2013). Experimental removal of Barred Owls is underway (Oregon Fish and Wildlife Service and U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2013, A.

Conduct research into broad areas of the species's biology such as interspecific interactions, population structure and habitat relationships (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Maintain and restore habitat; large reserves, encompassing suitable habitat and widely distributed are needed to retain the owl's current range and a halt to logging operations throughout parts of its range are required to prevent local extinctions. Use analyses to inform habitat management decisions, and ensure appropriate habitat management, which may involve habitat restoration and recovery (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011, 2012, Peery <em>et al</em>. 2017). Large-scale Barred Owl control efforts are likely to be needed, especially for the Northern Spotted Owl, but may also be required within the range of the California Spotted Owl to prevent local extinctions in parts of the species's range.

However, the population in the wild remains dependent on intensive conservation management efforts. The population currently numbers 93 mature individuals, with 62 mature individuals in the largest subpopulation and as a result, it currently meets the threshold for listing as Endangered. However, the population only increased sufficiently above the threshold for listing as Critically Endangered in 2019, hence the species continues to be listed as Critically Endangered under the five-year rule. Should such population increases continue, it will warrant downlisting in 2024.<p></p> <p></p>","Its range includes rocky, open-country scrubland, coniferous forest and oak savanna<strong></strong>. Cavities in ledges on cliffs, rocky outcrops or in large trees are used as nest sites (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong>.  It scavenges on the carcasses of large mammals and also feeds on the carcasses of small mammals. California ground squirrels are a documented small mammal food source in California and a source of lead poisoning as they are routinely shot as nuisance animals on private ranges. Investigations into the amount of small mammal use as a food source in the Arizona/Utah population is ongoing (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Relative to foraging, released birds reach independence soon after release, and may range more than 400 km from release sites (Anon. 1998), though the distance an individual ranges can vary depending on season and individuals released at different sites have shown significantly different home range sizes (Rivers <em>et al. </em>2014), suggesting local ecological factors may play a role.<p></p>","The drastic population decline during the 20th century is principally attributed to persecution and accidental ingestion of fragments and residues from lead bullets and lead shot from carcasses (C. N. Parish <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), resulting in lead poisoning. Lead poisoning remains a key threat and the leading cause of death for released birds (Rideout <em>et al</em>. 2012, Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has caused many fatalities and resulted in the treatment of many more birds (Anon. 2001, Parish <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007, Walters <em style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2010).&#160;As a result of their life history strategy, characterised by&#160;high adult survival, long life expectancy, and low reproductive rates, condor populations are particularly sensitive to lead poisoning, which severely impacts adult survival; lead can build up initially in the blood, but then in the bone and tissues to dangerous levels over longer periods having been ingested over a broad area (Hunt&#160;<em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.&#160;</span>2007, S. Kirkland&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020)<strong></strong>. Lead poisoning therefore continues to be the principal threat to condors and at current levels threaten the long-term sustainability of reintroduced populations (Cade 2007, Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2012, Rideout <em>et al</em>. 2012). It was reported in 2009 that over 90% of condors released in Arizona still test positive for lead (Toops 2009) whilst Rideout <em>et al</em>. (2012) determined that lead toxicosis was the leading, identifiable cause of death in juvenile (26% of deaths where the cause could be determined) and adult (67%) free-ranging California Condors since the inception of the reintroduction program in 1992. A study conducted in California, using samples collected in 2004-2009, suggests that around one third of condors have blood lead values associated with toxicological effects based on inhibition of the&#160;heme biosyntheticenzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2012). Sequential feather samples have been used to reconstruct a condor’s lead exposure history over the 3-4-month time frame of feather growth and this data demonstrates that condors are exposed to lead more frequently, and at higher levels than indicated by blood monitoring data (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;2012). A study using samples collected between 1997 and 2011 showed that blood lead concentrations increased as birds became less reliant on provisioned food, as they became older and as their home range size increased (Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and Bakker <em>et al</em>. (2017) found that condor survivorship was negatively related to time spent feeding on provisioned food. In 2017, 69 of the 78 birds in the Arizona/Utah population showed high levels of lead exposure; despite a treatment, two individuals died from severe lead-poisoning (Vulture Specialist Group 2017).<br/><br/>The population along the Central Pacific Californian coast also suffers from reduced eggshell thickness, consistent with the effects of DDE exposure, a breakdown compound of the pesticide DDT, compromising reproduction in the wild (Burnett <em>et al.</em> 2013). Apparently restricted to condors feeding on the coast, DDE exposure has been linked to feeding on the carcasses of California Sea Lions that had been exposed to the pesticide during their lifetimes (Kurle <em>et al</em>. 2016). The lack of additional DDT inputs suggests that these effects will decrease over time, though at present this is an impediment to sustainable wild reproduction in the coastal population. Ingested anthropogenic material has been responsible for the deaths of nestlings and strongly implicated in a number of other nestling deaths. The dead condors were found to have swallowed significant quantities of micro-trash (e.g. glass fragments, wire, plastic cartridge cases, etc.) and Rideout <em>et al</em>. (2012) observed this to be the leading cause of death in nestlings (76% of identifiable causes); micro-trash has however, recently been observed not to be&#160;significant source of lead poisoning and that the vast majority of lead micro-trash items were related to lead-ammunition (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2015). Shooting still occurs and is often identified in live birds that have been radiographed during lead testing or in relation to other injuries. Eleven birds have been killed as a result of being shot since 1998 (USFWS 2019, <em>unpublished data</em>).<br/><br/>Puppet-reared birds were initially thought to exhibit greater problematic human-oriented behaviour, such as tameness and vandalising property, than parent-reared birds (Meretsky&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2000)<strong></strong>. However, there is no apparent difference in mortality between released birds that were puppet-reared and those which were parent-reared (Woods&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007)<strong></strong>.&#160;Clark <em>et al</em>. (2007) modified puppet rearing practices to try and address concerns with initial captive reared birds. Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2007) compared the post-release results of birds reared with modified puppet rearing techniques in an isolated population in Baja, Mexico, with those released in the United States and evidenced that changes in socialisation techniques of young captive reared birds largely alleviated early problems with captive reared birds. At present, condors in the current wild subpopulations are not entirely immune to some interactions with human structures (i.e. perching on communication towers, mountain homes, South rim of the Grand Canyon) and behavioural modifications including attempts to haze them when possible are still employed. Cade <em>et al</em>. (2004) identified three types of interactions with humans and human structures where Type 1 and 2 were acceptable, while Type 3 was considered unacceptable and associated with birds showing no fear of humans, approaching them with no escape route. These categories remain the general benchmarks for the Recovery Program in determining whether or not a condor is exhibiting problematic behaviour and few condors are now removed from the wild due to behavioural problems. In the early 1990s a number of captive-reared birds were lost owing to collisions with power-lines and a conditioning programme with mock power poles was initiated to address it (L. Kiff&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2005)<strong></strong>.&#160;This practice has since been adopted in the field to help avoid power pole electrocutions in wild-fledged condors. However, collisions and subsequent electrocution following mid-span collisions continue to periodically occur. Seventeen total cases of electrocution have been documented since 1993, including several in 2015, 2016 and 2019, with lead poisoning being identified as a cofactor in at least one of these deaths (USFWS 2019,&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>The spread of west Nile virus has not been a significant problem for the species as most birds are still vaccinated (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005) however, as the wild population continues to grow, it is anticipated that it will not remain feasible to vaccinate all wild nestlings. Therefore, efforts to understand the potential significance of west Nile virus on the recovery of the species are under way.&#160;Lead poisoning however, continues to represent the most significant known cause of mortality in the wild; approximately 50% of all deaths with a determined cause are lead poisoning (USFWS 2019,&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>). The&#160;effect of treating individual birds for lead poisoning is currently being studied to assess whether it has any effect on survivorship in the wild California population (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Currently, the population would not continue to grow without the continued release of captive-bred birds.","There are currently 201 adults in the wild that are old enough to breed (age 5 and older), and 93 have produced viable offspring.&#160;Twenty-three wild birds turned five years old in 2019 and 17 more will turn five years old in 2020.&#160; A total of 141 wild birds are 8 years old or older, the observed average age of productivity (i.e. producing young when greater than or equal to eight years of age). Since mature individuals (as defined by IUCN) only includes individuals in the wild that are currently capable of reproduction, and re-introduced individuals must have produced viable offspring before they are counted as mature individuals, the current global population <span style=""font-style: italic;"">sensu</span> IUCN is 93 mature individuals as of March 2020 (USFWS California Condor Recovery Program, <em>unpublished data</em>).",Increasing,"This species declined rapidly throughout its historic range from British Columbia to Baja California during the 19th century and reportedly disappeared from outside California, <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, in 1937 (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. The population had dropped to an all-time low of just 22 birds by 1981, and in 1983 eggs were first taken from wild nests for captive-rearing; in 1987 the species became extinct in the wild when the last of the six wild individuals was captured to join a captive-breeding recovery programme involving 27 birds (Wilbur and Kiff 1980,<em></em> Toops 2009)<strong></strong>. Due to intensive captive breeding and reintroduction efforts the population increased to 223 birds by August 2003, comprising 138 in captivity, and 85 reintroduced in California and northern Arizona (L. Kiff <em>in</em> <em>litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Breeding in the wild resumed in 2002 and now occurs in all wild subpopulations (California, Arizona/Utah and Baja, <strong>Mexico</strong>).<br/><br/>The sub-population in California comprises 200 wild individuals in two distinct but loosely intermixing flocks. The Southern Californian flock is managed by the USFWS Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Condor Recovery staff and the Central California flock is managed collectively by the Ventana Wildlife Society and Pinnacles National Park. Each of the&#160;California flocks includes approximately 100 free flying individuals as of December 31st 2019 (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;The Arizona sub-population includes 98 free-flying individuals and there are an additional 39 free-flying individuals in the Baja, Mexico subpopulation. The combined total wild population as of December 2019 stands at 337 with an additional 181 captive individuals, for a total world population of 518. The regular movements of the Arizona birds are mostly confined to Coconnino County (Arizona) and Kane County (Utah), although several individuals have been documented wandering in Wyoming, southwestern Colorado and New Mexico before returning to the Vermilion Cliffs release area (C. N. Parish <em>in litt</em>. 2020). The California birds occur regularly in Ventura, Kern, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterrey, San Benito, Tulare and Fresno Counties. Currently, range expansion has been documented as far north as Alameda County in the west and Madera County in the east along the foothills of the Central Sierra Nevada Mountains. The species's geographic range continues to expand as the population grows in size (Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The reintroduction programme continues and has expanded its geographic coverage, with six birds released into the Sierra de San Pedro Martir in Baja California, Mexico in 2002 (USFWS 2002)<strong></strong>. A release site in Baja was established in October 2003. The first chick hatched in Mexico for over 75 years hatched in April 2007. The Baja California birds are  largely confined to the Sierra de San Pedro Martir (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong>, where release efforts are ongoing to augment the wild population; these birds have continued to expand their range and have reached both the Pacific and Gulf of California coasts (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020). It is hoped these birds will range widely enough to be effectively connected with birds in the southern U.S.A., and a bird from the Baja population was seen in San Diego County in April 2007. Second generation birds have matured to breeding age and wild fledged pairs have now fledged their own chicks into the wild however, no population can be deemed sustainable, and without substantial reductions in the use of lead-based ammunition within the condor's range, none are likely to become so (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>. The recovery programme for the species continues to address threats to the wild population, but lead contamination remains the greatest of these threats (Finkelstein <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2017); lead poisoning represents approximately 50 percent of all known causes of death in the total population (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I and II. A large-scale, integrated captive-breeding programme, managed by the Peregrine Fund (at the World Center for Birds of Prey), Los Angeles Zoo, Oregon Zoo, San Diego Wild Animal Park and Chapultepec Zoo, Mexico City, and reintroduction program, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,&#160;Ventana Wildlife Society, Peregrine Fund, Pinnacles National Park and Government of Mexico, is maintaining and growing the population in the wild (USFWS 2019).&#160;The success of the captive breeding program has seen an increase from one chick hatched in 1988 to approximately 30 birds produced for release to the wild annually. The genetic diversity of the population is maintained through careful distribution and representation of founder genotypes at each captive-breeding facility and reintroduction site. Consequently the current population retains 99.5% of the likely heterozygosity of a wild panmictic population (Ralls and Ballou 2004)<strong></strong>. 'Aversion training' to avoid power poles&#160;appears successful in preventing electrocution from perching on power poles and is ongoing (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Condors still periodically collide with powerlines during flight hence&#160;California power companies have buried and replaced some above ground power lines with insulated lines in areas with high levels of condor activity; insulated&#160;lines protect condors from electrocution following mid-span collision and anecdotally may be more visible to the birds since they are darker and slightly thicker (S. Kirkland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>A total of 287 condors were released into the wild between 1992 and 2019 (USFWS 2019,&#160;<em>unpublished data</em>)<strong></strong>. Clean carcasses are provided for reintroduced birds to&#160;supplement the food they would otherwise receive from their parents in the wild, and to assist in trapping to replace transmitters, test for lead, and assess general health. Education programs aim to minimise persecution&#160;and educate the public about the conservation benefits of using non-lead ammunition for hunting and land management (Hunting with non-lead 2020, North American Non-lead Partnership 2020).&#160;However, as the recovery of the species has continued, individuals are now ranging further than when the population was younger and smaller, and are less likely to take the food provided for them after age two (Bakker <em>et al</em>. 2017). A huge step has been taken towards trying to eliminate the threat of lead-poisoning with the signing in 2007 of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, and Assembly Bill 711 which requires the use of non-lead ammunition for the taking of all wildlife species throughout the state of California; lead-based ammunition can however, still be used for the putting down of livestock, impacting condors that frequent livestock ranch lands for foraging (A. Brickey&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The effectiveness&#160;of these regulatory bans on the survivorship and recovery of the species remains to be seen. Meanwhile, there is a growing program to promote the use of non-lead ammunition in hunting and wildlife management. The Ventana Wildlife Society, Arizona Game and Fish Department and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources are distributing non-lead&#160;bullets free of charge to hunters within the foraging range of the condors. In 2008 an agreement was struck between the Tejon Ranch and five conservation organisations in California to preserve 240,000 acres of the 270,000 acre property as an open space in return for not opposing the development of the remaining land, providing a vast amount of foraging habitat for the condor (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>.&#160;This conservation program has certainly reduced the amount of lead available to condors, as larger and larger percentage of the Southern California flock continue to forage there, however this area only represents approximately 2.5 % of the 9,600,000 acre geographic range this flock occupies.&#160;The North American Non-lead Partnership is engaging State Wildlife Management Agencies, to promote the voluntary use of non-lead ammunition as a traditional wildlife management practice that benefits non-target trust wildlife resources by eliminating secondary poisoning from the ingestion of spent lead ammunition.&#160; A willing partnership between hunting and endangered species conservation that facilitates a cultural shift away from hunting with traditional lead ammunition, may be the most practical way a significant reduction in the use of lead ammunition is likely to occur.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to monitor population trends.&#160;Revise the recovery plan using updated population modeling (Bakker <em>et al.</em> 2017) and management information, to determine survivorship and demographic parameters for a self sustaining population of condors.

As a result, the number of mature individuals is continuing to increase and this species may merit downlisting to Vulnerable in the near future.<p></p>","It breeds in prairie wetlands, preferring small, shallow lakes and ponds, willow communities, marshes, mudflats and perhaps sedge meadows, but this may be atypical considering its historical range (Archibald and Meine 1996, Timoney 1999)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Eggs are laid from late April to mid-May (Archibald and Meine 1996)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It winters in coastal brackish wetlands. For the wild population winter mortality appears to be correlated with blue crab availability at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, with higher mortality in years of lower crab abundance (Pugesek <em>et al. </em>2013). The natural population are known to feed on beetles, crabs/crayfish, vegetation, seeds, molluscs and other vertebrates with introduced populations thought to feed on largely the same sources alongside benthic invertebrates, and amphibians and reptiles (Dinets 2016, Caven <em>et al</em>. 2019, Neri 2020). Stopover sites typically comprise wetland land-cover types and lowland grasslands (Baasch <em>et al</em>. 2019).<p></p>","Over-hunting, habitat conversion and human disturbance were the main causes of the species's decline. Currently, the most significant known cause of death or injury to fledglings is collision with powerlines (Lewis 1997)<strong></strong>. Powerline markers can reduce collisions by 50-80%, but most powerlines remain unmarked and collision is a major and growing problem (Lewis 1997, Folk <em>et al. </em>2013); 45 powerline collision-related mortalities were recorded between 1956-2006 (Stehn and Wassenich 2008, Smith 2019<strong></strong>. The anticipated placement of thousands of wind turbines in the migration corridor will decrease availability of crane stopover habitat and may also dramatically increase the number of powerlines (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Increases in the number of powerlines also stems from increased oil and gas exploration along parts of the species's migration corridor whilst activity and traffic associated with drilling may also be of significant detriment (Niemuth <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2007, a lightning strike during severe weather killed 17 captive-bred young  birds being housed in a top-netted release pen in Florida (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Eggs and pre-fledged chicks are subject to predation by various birds and mammals including raven, bald eagle, wolf, black bear and lynx (CWS and USFWS 2007), while harassment of nesting individuals by parasites such as black flies can lead to nest abandonment, and this has been proposed as a key reason for failed breeding in one of the introduced populations (Runge <em>et al. </em>2011, Barzen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Drought is a serious threat to the species as it is detrimental to all habitats utilized by this species, but is especially harmful by dramatically decreasing production on the nesting grounds (RENEW report 1999, Butler <em>et al. </em>2014)<strong></strong>. In early 2009, a prolonged drought and reduced water inflow to coastal wetlands led to a reduction in availability of blue crabs <span class=""st""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Callinectes sapidus</span> and wolfberries <em>Lycium spp. </em>(important food items), causing Whooping Crane mortality rates to double (Archibold 2009). Drought, and alteration and destruction of natural wetlands and rivers impacts roosting and foraging sites during migration (Niemuth <em>et al</em>. 2018, Baasch <em>et al</em>. 2019) whilst coastal development, sea level rise, climate change, chemical spills, reduced fresh water inflows, and human disturbance threaten the Texan wintering grounds (RENEW report 1999, CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong>. Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) can only support a maximum of 500 birds through the winter (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong> and falls short of the initial downlisting target of 1,000 birds. Continued population growth may force some cranes in future to use disturbed and suboptimal habitat (M. Reid <em>in litt.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Much of the currently unoccupied crane habitat at Aransas where the cranes would be expected to expand into is being threatened with construction of houses (T. Stehn, <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. There are currently concerns about oil spills and river inflows to Aransas NWR (CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong>, as well as reduced water flows in the central Platte River Ralley, Nebraska, a key stopover site for migrating Whooping Cranes (Chavez-Ramirez 2008). The spread of West Nile virus and avian influenza in the future may pose a threat to the species (Chu <em>et al. </em>2003)<strong></strong>.  The long-term effects of genetic drift after a severe population bottleneck are unknown (Glenn <em>et al.</em> 1999, Smith 2019)<strong></strong> There have been incidences of illegal shooting of the species and it is known to be an increasing threat with 27 confirmed shooting mortalities between 1967 and 2016 (MacKenzie 2011, Shaw 2011, Condon <em>et al</em>. 2018, Niemuth <em>et al</em>. 2018, Smith 2019).<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><p></p></span>","The total population in the wild numbers c.483 individuals. However, the only self-sustaining population breeding in Northwest Territories/Alberta, Canada and wintering in Texas, USA numbers 329 individuals, fewer than 250 of which are mature. Hence we retain a precautionary estimate of 50-249 mature individuals. Despite this however, the latest evidence from the Crane Conservation Strategy (Smith 2019) suggests that both the self-sustaining Aransas-Wood Buffalo population and additional reintroduced populations have increased notably in recent years and that the current population estimate may now be a considerable underestimate.",Increasing,"<em>Grus americana</em> declined from historic estimates of &gt;10,000 prior to European settlement of North America to 1,300-1,400 birds by 1870, and only 15 adults in 1938 (CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong>. As of 2016/17 there are four wild populations totalling c.483 individuals, including three reintroduced populations in the eastern U.S. that are not yet self-sustaining. The only natural wild population breeds in Wood Buffalo National Park, on the border of Northwest Territories and Alberta, <strong>Canada</strong>, and winters at and near to Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, Texas, <strong>U.S.A.</strong> (Meine and Archibald 1996) (although in 2011-2012 they were observed up to hundreds of kilometres away from here [Wright <em>et al. </em>2014]). It totalled 266 birds in 2007 (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, with 65 active nests (B. Johns <em>in litt.</em> 2007), followed by a record 270 birds in spring 2008 (Archibald 2009)<strong style=""""></strong>, dropping to 247 in spring 2009 (Archibald 2009) following a drought in the wintering quarters in Texas. As of winter 2015-2016 this population contained 329 individuals, including 122 adult pairs (Butler and Harrell 2016). A reintroduced, non-migratory flock in Florida numbered c.41 individuals in 2007, but due to lack of reproductive success and high mortality rates this project was discontinued in 2007 (T. Stehn <em>in litt. </em>2007, W. Harrell <em>in litt. </em>2016). This population contains a dozen or less individuals (H. Ray <em>in litt. </em>2016). A separate reintroduced flock migrates between Wisconsin and south-eastern USA. This population numbered 75 birds in 2007 (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>, increasing to c.90 birds in 2008 (Stehn 2008), and as of January 2017 the population numbers 104 individuals (Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership 2017). The first wild born chick fledged in Wisconsin and migrated successfully in 2006 (T. Stehn <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2007) and another&#160;<strong></strong>wild born chick hatched in June 2009 (Garland and Peterson 2009). A new reintroduced flock comprising 10 juveniles was established in south-western Louisiana in early 2011 (Zimorski 2011), and this population now numbers 38 individuals (Department of Wildlife and Fisheries State of Louisiana 2017, H. Ray and W. Harrell <em>in litt. </em>2016). Captive flocks totalled 151 birds in 2008 at 5 breeding centres and 6 display facilities in the USA and Canada (Stehn 2008)<strong></strong>.

CMS Appendix II. A U.S. District Court has ruled to restrict water offtake from the Guadalupe River, Texas, as so much water was being taken it was a breach of the Endangered Species Act against this species (Beilfuss 2013). There is an international recovery plan (CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong> focusing on increasing the size of the natural flock, establishing additional wild populations through experimental releases, teaching captive-bred birds to migrate (Lewis 1995, Line 1995, RENEW report 1999)<strong></strong>, and increasing the captive population for experimental releases and ecological research (e.g. habitat selection). Considerable progress has been made in improving the genetic health of captive stock and in breeding under-represented genetic strains, but delayed reproduction in captivity and the failure of some pairs to breed at all has slowed down progress (Putman 2007)<strong></strong>. In the past, recruitment was increased in certain years in Canada by removal of a single egg from two-egg broods (Boyce <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>; the removed eggs are used to supplement captive flocks, but the overall impact of the egg pickup program is largely undetermined (<strong></strong>CWS and USFWS 2007)<strong></strong>.

Mass poisonings in Argentina, Colombia and Peru, with suspected cases in Ecuador and Bolivia, threaten this wide-ranging scavenger. A further substantial threat is lead poisoning, which has recently been found to be widespread across its range. The species is consequently listed as Vulnerable.","The species is found principally over open grassland and mountainous regions up to 5,000 m, as well as adjacent upper and mid-montane cloud forests, descending to lowland desert regions and coastlines in Chile and Peru (Houston 1994, Parker <em>et al</em>. 1996), and over the steppes and southern-beech forests in Patagonia (S. Imberti <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","The species is clearly adapted for exceptionally low mortality and reproductive output, and is therefore highly vulnerable to negative demographic events including human persecution, which persists across its range owing to alleged attacks on livestock (Houston 1994, Cailly Arnulphi <em>et al</em>. 2017). Observations in the last decade or so have confirmed that individuals occasionally attack the soft body parts of juvenile domestic cattle (N. Rios <em>per </em>R. Wallace 2004, H. Vargas and F. Sáenz pers. obs. <em>per </em>R. Wallace <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Intensive observations in the field show that this appears to be an extremely rare event that represents less than 1% of the mortalities of livestock (Ballejo <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/>In addition, the persecution of mountain lions and foxes through the illegal  poisoning of carcasses is seriously affecting the species in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and probably Bolivia (Pavez and Estades 2016, Alarcón and Lambertucci 2018, Pauli <em>et al</em>. 2018, Piana 2019, Estrada Pacheco <em>et al</em>. 2020, F. Sáenz and D. Méndez <em>per </em>R. Wallace <em>in litt</em>. 2020, G. Wiemeyer <em>in litt</em>. 2020). This threat is increasing in intensity. By early 2020, species experts had systematized 225 individuals across the range, with about 50% of recorded cases resulting in mortality, although this percentage is biased by rescue centre animals and mortality rates are likely higher, as many dead poisoning victims are almost certainly not detected or reported across the range.<br/>The species is highly dependent on the carcasses of exotic herbivores in Argentina, which form 98.5% of their diet, making them vulnerable to changes in livestock raising and to the consumption of hunting ammunition (Lambertucci <em>et al</em>. 2009). Interspecific competition for carcasses with American Black Vulture <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Coragyps atratus</span>, which have recently begun to occupy the same areas, may have a deleterious effect on Andean Condor populations (Carrete <em>et al</em>. 2010, Ballejo <em>et al.</em> 2018). Similarly, a number of studies have revealed the significance of other threats to the species including lead poisoning (Lambertucci <em>et al</em>. 2011, Wiemeyer <em>et al</em>. 2017, Plaza <em>et al</em>. 2020), illegal use in folkloric events (Piana 2014, 2019), illegal wildlife trade (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011), use as pets (Pavez and Estades 2016), collisions with electrical and telecommunication infrastructure (S. Lambertucci pers. obs.) and competition with feral dogs (D. Méndez and H. Vargas pers. obs.). Habitat is lost through the conversion of natural vegetation for agricultural use and plantations (H. Vargas <em>in litt</em>. 2020).","The species is naturally scarce. The global population has been estimated at 10,000 individuals, which  equates to 6,700 mature individuals; however, recent information  suggests that this is a maximum estimate (R. Wallace <em>in litt</em>. 2020). In Venezuela, the species may no longer be resident, with infrequently observed individuals probably visiting from Colombia, where recent population estimates detail 130 individuals, including reintroduced birds (Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Ecuador, the population is estimated at 150 individuals (Naveda <em>et al</em>. 2016, Vargas <em>et al</em>. 2018). Peru holds a minimum of 150-250 individuals (Piana and Angulo 2015) and Bolivia holds around 1,400 individuals (Méndez <em>et al</em>. 2019). Chile and Argentina hold up to 2,000 individuals each, though there may be an overlap in these estimates (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2020). The largest known population is in north-west Patagonia, with about 300 individuals, including 200 mature individuals (Lambertucci 2010, V. Escobar-Gimpel <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Despite being a wide-ranging species that covers large distances, it shows substantial genetic structuring, with dispersal being modulated by topographic features (Padró <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is therefore tentatively assumed that the species forms several subpopulations, which contain less than 1,000 mature individuals each, but this requires confirmation.",Decreasing,"<em>Vultur gryphus</em> occurs along the length of the Andes in <strong>Colombia</strong>, <strong>Ecuador</strong>, <strong>Peru</strong>, <strong>Bolivia</strong>, south to <strong>Argentina</strong> and <strong>Chile</strong> (Houston 1994, Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species is considered vagrant in Venezuela, Paraguay and Brazil. Populations are exceedingly rare in the northern part of its range, particularly in Venezuela where the species is possibly no longer resident.

Previously, Red Kite was listed as Near Threatened because of a suspected moderately rapid population decline, owing mostly to poisoning from pesticides and persecution, and changes in land-use amongst other threats. However, these declines have been more than compensated by increases in the majority of countries within its range, at a rate that means that declines over the past three generations have been overcome. There are still declines in southern Spain, Portugal, and locally in Germany and perhaps France, and the species has recently been lost as a breeding species in Morocco. Poisoning (both deliberate and accidental) remains the greatest threat to continued population growth and threatens the persistence of the species regionally, especially in southern Iberia. However, overall the data indicate that the global population has increased by more than 30% over the last three generations and the species is assessed as Least Concern.<p></p> <p></p>","The species breeds in broadleaf woodlands and forests, mixed with farmland, pasture and heathland, up to 1,600 m in Switzerland (A. Aebischer <em>in litt. </em>2016) and formerly possibly to 2,500 m in Morocco<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo<em> e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 1994). In winter it also occupies wasteland, scrub and wetlands. Formerly an urban scavenger, it still visits the edges of towns and cities and is now frequent in suburban areas where they will visit gardens (Orros &amp; Fellowes 2014). It takes a wide range of food, but feeds mainly on carrion and small to medium-sized mammals and birds. Reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates are less important prey.<br/><br/>Many birds in north-east Europe are migratory, wintering mainly in southern France and Iberia, but with some travelling as far as North Africa<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(del Hoyo<em> et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1994). Migrants travel south from their breeding grounds between August and November, returning between February and April (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs, but sometimes form small flocks when soaring on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) or at open waste disposal sites. The availability of high density reliable food provided by landfill managed in certain ways may influence the degree to which kites are sedentary in an area (Evans and Pienkowski 1991): high availability of roadkill may also influence movement decisions.&#160;<br/><p></p>","The most pertinent threat to this species is illegal direct poisoning  to kill predators of livestock and game animals (targetting foxes, wolves, corvids etc.) and indirect poisoning from pesticides and secondary poisoning from consumption of poisoned rodents by rodenticides spread on farmland to control vole plagues, particularly in the wintering ranges in France and Spain, where it may drive rapid population declines<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(e.g. see Villafuerte <em>et al. </em>1998, Mougeot <em>et al. </em>2011, A. Aebischer <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>. </em>2009); there has been reported a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Carter 2007). An estimate of 430-1,800 individuals killed illegally in Spain annually indicates that this remains a significant problem for birds that do migrate and for the regional population (Brochet <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;The Spanish government released more than 1,500 tons of rodenticide-treated baits over about 500,000 ha to fight against a common vole plague in agricultural lands between August 2007 and April 2008; records of Red Kites dying by secondary poisoning in treated areas resulted<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(J. Vi<span lang=""ES"">ñuela <em>in lit<em>t</em></em><em>.</em> 2009). The total of recovered, confirmed poisoning cases in Spain is 1,187 individuals found dead between 1992 and 2015 (Cano&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;In north  Scotland, 40% of birds found dead between 1989 and 2006 were found to have been  killed by poisoning (Smart <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>In France populations disappeared at the same rate as conversion from grasslands to cereal crops<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(P. Tourret <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009). The decline of grazing livestock and farming intensification leading to  chemical pollution, homogenization of landscapes and ecological  impoverishment also threatens the species (Knott <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). Wind turbines are a potentially serious threat (Duchamp 2003, Mammen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009, Schaub<em>&#160;</em>2012, P. Tourret <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009); 18 Red Kite were located having been killed by collisions with windfarms in 2019 (F. David <em>in litt. </em>2020). Other less significant threats include electrocution and collision with powerlines<strong><sup> </sup></strong><strong></strong>(Mionnet 2007, P. Tourret <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>,&#160; hunting and trapping (Mionnet 2007, P.

It is now only a winter visitor in small numbers to Morocco, having recently become extinct as a breeding species (Radi <em>et al. </em>2020). Its status as a breeding and wintering species in North Africa is now uncertain. <br/><br/>The largest breeding populations are now in Germany (14,000-16,000 pairs), the U.K. (4,388 pairs), Sweden (3,100-4,100 pairs), France (3,000-3,900 pairs), Switzerland (2,800-3,400 pairs) and Spain (2,312-2,440 pairs) (BirdLife International in prep., Knaus <em>et al. </em>2018). These six countries together now hold over 90% of the global population, indicating a shift in the core abundance of the species towards central and northern Europe, with conservation reintroductions contributing to some of this shift (Stevens <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species previously suffered a moderate to rapid decline, and the population overall declined by almost 20%&#160;during 1990-2000 (BirdLife International 2004). In&#160;Germany, the population is now stable (Gerlach&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019), though with regional variation (increases in the south and west, but stable or declining elsewhere [Grüneberg and Karthäuser 2019])&#160;and it is estimated the population is currently still 16% lower than&#160;in the late 1980s.

Much of this decline is in the south, and the species is at risk of extirpation from Doñana National Park (Sergio <em>et al. </em>2019). The Balearic Islands population declined from 41-47 breeding pairs in 1993 to 27 in 2004<strong></strong>&#160;(Cardiel 2006); however, conservation actions have since enabled the population to recover, to 38 breeding pairs in 2007<strong>&#160;</strong>(Cardiel<em>&#160;in<em>&#160;litt</em></em><em>.</em>&#160;2007) and this trend has continued (Molina&#160;2015). A rapid decline is also thought to have occurred in Portugal, but without quantification except for a reported 50% reduction in the occupied area (H.

Since 2007, further reintroduction projects are aiming to re-establish Red Kites in Tuscany and in the Marche (Italy), the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland - the first breeding attempt in the Republic was recorded in 2009. An EU species action plan for the Red Kite was published in 2009 (Knott <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). National species action plans are in place in Germany, France, the Balearic Islands and Denmark, and a draft national action plan is in place in Portugal.

Successful conservation action has now reversed such declines and the species is observed to be increasing throughout both&#160;its largest extant population in&#160;Los Haitises National Park and additional reintroduced populations. If population increases continue, it may be eligible for a downlist in the near future.<p></p> <p></p>","The species has been recorded up to 2,000 m above sea level in a variety of undisturbed forest-types including rainforest, subtropical dry and moist forests, pine forest, limestone karst forest and marshland. It is often seen in secondary and agricultural habitats (Wiley and Wiley 1981) and appears to be attracted forest edges and human-inhabited areas (T. Hayes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Prey in the Los Haitises consists primarily of reptiles (with lizards, in particular <em>Celestus</em> skinks [Woolaver <em>et al</em>. 2013c], and snakes comprising 80% of the diet)&#160;and frogs. They occasionally prey on birds, small mammals (bats and rodents) and centipedes (Woolaver 2011). Nests have been found in the crowns of tall endemic trees, with Royal Palms <em>Roystonea hispaniolana</em> particularly favoured (Woolaver 2005, 2006, 2011;&#160;Gesto 2018). Nest-building occurs in December-June and eggs are laid in January-June&#160;(Wiley and Wiley 1981, T. Hayes unpubl. data)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The clutch size is 1-3 eggs. Pairs have successfully fledged three young, but more typically one or two. Males are known to participate in incubation. Disturbance by humans is sometimes a cause of nest failure (Woolaver 2011). The home range of three adjacent breeding pairs was just c.60 ha (Wiley and Wiley 1981)<strong></strong>. <br/><p></p>","Large-scale habitat loss due to clearing of forest for agriculture and pasture for livestock, as well as direct persecution have been major factors in this species's decline (Thorstrom 2004)<strong></strong>. Even within Los Haitises National Park, slash and burn agriculture is widespread; virtually all primary forest within the park has now been destroyed, and the remaining secondary fragments are being cleared at a rapid rate&#160;(Dirección Nacional de Parques 1991, Brothers 1997, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2018). A study of nest success from 2005-2009 found that of 216 nests monitored, only 40% were successful, with the majority of nest failures caused by human disturbance, including burning or cutting of nest trees, poaching or intentional killing of eggs/nestlings, and rocks and sticks thrown at the nest&#160;(Woolaver&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Local people still regard the species as a serious threat to poultry,&#160;so The Peregrine Fund now has a program to provide small chicken cages to local subsistence farmers so that they can protect their young chickens from depredation.<br/><br/>Significant causes of natural mortality are poor weather (rain lasting over several days when nestlings are less than one week old), collapse of nests and infestations of the parasitic bot fly <em>Philornis pici</em>&#160;(The Peregrine Fund 2014);&#160;<em>Philornis pici</em>&#160;causes high mortality in nestling hawks (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2018) and has also occasionally been recorded infecting adult nesting hawks (Quiroga <em>et al</em>. 2020). Infestation of nestlings by <em>Philornis</em> spp. is prevalent, some years affecting almost 90% of Ridgway’s Hawk nests and the odds of a nestling surviving to fledge decrease dramatically with infestation (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2018, Bulgarella <em>et al</em>. 2019). Electrocution on power poles is a also a significant threat in urban and suburban areas. In the Punta Cana release area over 200 power poles have been retrofitted to prevent electrocution, a joint effort between The Peregrine Fund and Grupo Puntacana (Dwyer <em>et al</em>. 2019, T. Hayes unpubl. data). Woolaver <em>et al</em>. (2013a) detected a weak but consistent sex ratio bias towards female nestlings, which could give cause for concern in the future. Inbreeding within the small population also poses a threat (Woolaver <em>et al</em>. 2013b).<p></p>","This species has an extremely small and fragmented population, which was previously in steep decline, with a 21% reduction in breeding pairs from 2006-2009, and as few as 109 breeding pairs in 2009 (Woolaver 2011). In 2014 The Peregrine Fund recorded 120 territorial pairs in Los Haitises and two pairs in Punta Cana (The Peregrine Fund 2014). In 2016 they recorded 120 territorial pairs in Los Haitises and 12 pairs in Punta Cana (T. Hayes&#160;unpubl. data). In 2019, The Peregrine Fund recorded 142 pairs of Ridgway’s Hawks in Los Haitises and 19 pairs in Punta Cana. These 19 pairs of hawks successfully produced 17 fledglings in 2019 and two additional young were fostered into nests in Punta Cana. Additionally, some areas in Los Haitises are not being consistently monitored, however we know that some pairs of hawks continue to exist outside the monitored area. The total number of Ridgway’s Hawks is estimated at a minimum of 427 individuals and 322 mature individuals.",Increasing,"This species occurs in the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>. It formerly also occurred in Haiti, with historical reports from the adjacent Haitian islands of Gonâve, the Cayemite Islands where it was reportedly common in 1934, Île-à-Vache where it was reportedly common in 1962 (Wiley and Wiley 1981) but is now likely extirpated (Brooks and Dávalos 2001), and in the Dominican islands of Isla Beata and Alto Velo.&#160;Recent surveys on Petite Cayemite Island and Grand Cayemite Island, <strong>Haiti</strong> report the first sightings of Ridgway’s Hawks there since 1918 (Wetmore and Swales 1931, Brooks and Davalos 2001). In August 2019, Haitian biologist Anderson Jean saw two Ridgway’s Hawks (one juvenile, one of unknown sex/age) on Petite Cayemite. In January 2020, Thomas Hayes (The Peregrine Fund) and Anderson Jean again reported two Ridgway’s Hawks (one adult female, one no confirmation on sex/age) on Petite Cayemite. Additionally, surveys during the same expedition found one adult female Ridgway’s Hawk on the adjacent island of Grande Cayemite (T. Hayes&#160;unpubl. data). There is a single record from the island of Culebra off Puerto Rico (to U.S.A.) (Raffaele&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998). It was formerly widespread, but has been extirpated from over 96% of its original range during the last century (Woolaver 2011). There have been very few recent records outside Los Haitises National Park (S. Latta <em>in litt.</em> 1998). It was also recorded in human-modified habitat on the Samaná Peninsula in 2003 (Thorstrom <em>et al.</em> 2005). The species has been reported from Isla Beata and Valle Nuevo in 1981 (Wiley and Wiley 1981); both sites have not been surveyed significantly since then and confirmation of its status at these two sites is a priority.&#160;<br/><br/>A new population is being established through releases of young birds at Puntacana Resort and Club, a private land holding in south-east Dominican Republic (The Peregrine Fund 2014, McClure <em>et al. </em>2017). The first birds were released here in 2009. One pair successfully bred in 2013 and fledged the first known wild-hatched young outside of Los Haitises National Park (The Peregrine Fund <em>in prep.</em>). In 2016, there were 12 recorded territorial pairs in Punta Cana, of which five pairs were successful in fledging 8 young (The Peregrine Fund <em>in prep.</em>). The Peregrine Fund was also establishing a new population in the private reserve of Loma la Herradura by translocating individuals from the Los Haitises National Park (Thorstrom 2008); however, releases were suspended in 2013 due to high mortality of released hawks caused by human persecution (The Peregrine Fund 2014).&#160;In 2019, The Peregrine Fund released 25 juvenile Ridgway’s Hawks in Aniana Vargas National Park, with plans to continue releases until a population is established (T. Hayes <em>in litt</em>. 2020).<br/><br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway&#160;</strong><br/>Effective protection of the&#160;Ridgway’s Hawk population in Los Haitises (currently the largest extant population).&#160;Most Ridgway’s Hawk pairs occur within Los Haitises, but this site is poorly protected and evidence suggests that it has been mainly deforested (Dirección Nacional de Parques 1991, Brothers 1997). Additionally, political structure in the Dominican Republic makes lasting changes to park rules and regulations difficult and the park boundary has changed several times, from 208 km<sup>2</sup> in 1976 to 1600 km<sup>2</sup> in 1992. Currently, Los Haitises is about 600 km<sup>2</sup> (Dominican Law: Ley 202-04). Ongoing conservation action in the park is essential for the continued growth of <em>B. ridgwayi</em>&#160;populations within its boundaries and should conservation action cease, the ongoing population increased observed may well slow, or even revert to declines.<br/>Improvement of reproductive success through treatment of Ridgway’s Hawk nests to prevent nest fly parasitism of nestlings by <em>Philornis</em> spp. The primary focus of Ridgway’s Hawk nest management is to prevent nestling mortality caused by parasitic nest flies of the genus <em>Philornis</em>. Treatment of nests and/or nestlings has resulted in a 179% increase in the probability that a nestling will successfully fledge into the wild (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2018). Should nest treatments for&#160;<em>Philornis</em>&#160;spp. cease however, reproductive rates would likely drop considerably as anywhere between 0.19-0.65 nestlings are common per pair in untreated nests, compared to 1.2-1.65 nestlings per pair in treated nests (T. Hayes <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Intensive research of Ridgway’s Hawk breeding ecology and conservation genetics are part of an ongoing study initiated in 2005, and annual surveys monitor the hawk population within Los Haitises (The Peregrine Fund 2014). Through intensive management of nests in Los Haitises, The Peregrine Fund is increasing productivity of wild pairs from 2 -4 fold (Hayes et al. 2018, T. Hayes unpubl. data). These actions are simultaneously bolstering the wild population of Ridgway’s Hawk in Los Haitises as well as allowing for the removal of some wild nestlings for translocation and release in regions where the species is native, but has been extirpated.<br/>The creation of at least three Ridgway’s Hawk populations outside of Los Haitises. The Ridgway’s Hawk population decline measured by Woolaver from 2005 – 2009 has been reversed and the Ridgway’s Hawk population in Los Haitises is now growing (Woolaver 2011, T. Hayes&#160;unpubl. data). In some areas that The Peregrine Fund is working (specifically in Los Limones, Los Haitises NP), the number of Ridgway’s Hawk nesting pairs has almost doubled since 2011. The Ridgway’s Hawk population is increasing in the other areas of the park as well (T. Hayes<em>&#160;</em>unpubl. data). The Peregrine Fund has focused their conservation effort on the management of nests in Los Haitises as well as the translocation of wild Ridgway’s Hawk nestlings for reintroduction into areas where the species has been extirpated. Captive breeding programs, while useful in some situations can drain limited resources away from the protection of wild populations. In 2008 and 2009, The Peregrine Fund began translocating nestling Ridgway’s Hawks from Los Haitises to two distinct sites, Loma la Herradura private reserve and Punta Cana (Thorstrom 2008, The Peregrine Fund 2014, McClure <em>et al</em>. 2017). From 2008 – 2012, 20 young hawks were released near the town of Pedro Sanches, Dominican Republic. Releases at this site were discontinued after 2012 because of high mortality due to human persecution. From 2009 – 2019, a total of 130 birds were released at Punta Cana, Dominican Republic of which the majority became independent, no longer relying on provisioned food (The Peregrine Fund 2014). In 2013, released birds in Punta Cana produced the first nestling ever recorded in the region. There were two breeding pairs the following year and the small population increased incrementally to 19 territorial pairs and 17 wild young fledged in 2019. Two additional nestlings were fostered from destroyed nests in Los Haitises to nests in Punta Cana for a total of 19 young hawks fledged in the wild in Punta Cana in 2019. As of 2019, 49 wild young have fledged in Punta Cana from wild nests (T. Hayes&#160;unpubl. data). In 2019, The Peregrine Fund began releasing Ridgway’s Hawks in Aniana Vargas National Park. This small park was created in 2009 and is approximately 130 km<sup>2</sup>. Habitat in this area is recovering from intensive agriculture and has undergone changes in recent decades to less intensive farming methods, primarily shade-covered cacao plantations.<br/>Education campaign to spread awareness of the ecological and economic benefits of Ridgway’s Hawk and to assist local people in the protection of their young chickens from depredation by hawks. A benefit of management of Ridgway’s Hawk populations within Los Haitises is that local individuals are able to carry out the fieldwork. This means that people in communities around the hawk population are invested in the conservation of the species. In 2005 by The Peregrine Fund initiated a publicity campaign to raise awareness of the Ridgway’s Hawk within local communities near hawk populations (Woolaver 2006) and environmental education continues in Los Haitises and in areas where the hawks have been reintroduced. In order to reduce direct human-caused Ridgway's Hawk mortality, The Peregrine Fund began an intensive environmental education program in Dominican Republic in 2013. In the first two years, the environmental education program engaged with over 1,168 individuals in communities around Punta Cana (The Peregrine Fund 2014). The Peregrine Fund is currently working with over 50 communities around established Ridgway's Hawk territories and areas where the Ridgway’s Hawk has been reintroduced, and have reached over 13,500 people through direct efforts since the start of the program. Environmental education activities have been ongoing, and include community and door-to-door visits, public presentations, school visits, celebrations of Ridgway's Hawk Day, as well as teacher training workshops revolved around environmental education and the conservation of raptors. Additionally, other project partners including Propagas Foundation, Grupo Puntacana Foundation, and Zoodom (Santo Domingo Zoo) have all taken an active role in increasing awareness of Ridgway’s Hawk (Marta Curti pers. comm.). Local populations must continue to be involved in conservation projects to prevent reversion to practices that result in high <em>B. ridgwayi</em>&#160;mortality.<br/>CITES Appendix II. The risk of electrocution on power poles is high for Ridgway’s Hawks in urban and suburban areas within the Dominican Republic. In 2014, 33% of young hawks in the Punta Cana region were electrocuted. The Peregrine Fund and Grupo Punta Cana have been working together to retrofit over 200 power poles to prevent electrocutions of Ridgway’s Hawk as well as other wildlife. Retrofitting of power poles to prevent electrocution is an ongoing effort and has dramatically improved survival in the Punta Cana region (in 2017 only one of 25 released hawks was electrocuted [Dwyer <em>et al</em>. 2019, T. Hayes unpubl. data]).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed&#160;</strong><br/>Ensure the de facto protection of remaining habitat in Los Haitises National Park. Continue and expand education and awareness campaigns to reduce direct persecution, including campaigning for a 'Ridgway's Hawk Day' to become a national holiday in the Dominican Republic (The Peregrine Fund 2014). Continue monitoring, nest management, and banding work (The Peregrine Fund 2014).&#160;Survey remaining forest fragments adjacent to Los Haitises National Park, as well as historical sites that have not experienced significant habitat loss.&#160;Assess potential sites for future relocation to establish additional populations within secure habitat. Ensure that translocated nestlings are genetically diverse (Woolaver <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Evaluate the threat posed by power lines and retrofit them where necessary in potential release areas (The Peregrine Fund 2014). Continue research into methods to reduce <em>Philornis pici</em> infestations. Recent sightings of Ridgway’s Hawk in Haiti reopen the possibility that conservation efforts in these locations may be warranted.<p></p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

For example, the species is now considered extinct in Bangladesh, and in India the species is generally not found outside protected areas except for in a few forest reserves. This decline is predicted to continue at the same rate or higher over the next three generations or 40 years. The species is likely to face increasing threat of population decline from the ongoing and projected threats from increasing habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation due to infrastructure development, new settlements, expanding monocultures, and slash-and-burn cultivation, from hunting for consumption and the traditional medicine industry, and from isolation stresses. Nationally, in Thailand this species is listed as Endangered.<br/><span lang=""ES-TRAD""></p>","This species ranges from tropical semi-evergreen forest to tropical wet evergreen forest and tropical moist deciduous forest (Chetry 2020). It prefers dense tropical semi evergreen forests (Chetry 2002, Choudhury 2001), but can persist in disturb secondary forests and those adjoining human-modified habitats. Srivastava and Mohnot (2001) report it from lowland semi evergreen forests to monsoon and montane forests. In India, it occurs at elevations of 50–1,300 m (Chetry 2002; Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003; Choudhury 2001, 2002; Srivastava and Mohnot 2001), between 200 and 2,200 m in Myanmar (Htun pers. comm.), and up to 2,400 m in China (X. Jiang pers. comm.). In Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia it is predominantly found above 400 m, while in karst limestone environments it is found in much lower elevations (R. Timmins pers. comm.). Climate varies from tropical to subtropical across this macaque's distribution. The species is good swimmer, but is terrestrial and diurnal. It spends 73-83% of its time on ground for feeding (Chetry 2002), where it feeds primarily on seeds, fruits, flowers, stem cortex, bulbs, shoots rhizomes, roots and to lesser extent on young and mature leaves, small vertebrates and insects. It will also raid crops for potatoes, sweet potatoes, turnips and rice. This species has a generation length of 10–12 years (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). It occurs widely in the hill and mountain areas of Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). In Thailand, it is widespread but discontinuous, in forests associated with limestone hills and outcrops, and other forest habitats (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). In China, it is found in broadleaved evergreen forests, and sometimes in secondary forests close to farmlands (X. Jiang pers. comm).<br/><br/>Long-term study in India reported that the species consumes 23.65% of time feeding on seeds, 21.81% on fruits, 14.22% on leaves and twigs, and 10.35% on roots and tubers. Moreover, they spent 8.09% of their time feeding on bamboo shoots, and 7.79% feeding other minor food items (Chetry and Chetry 2015).<br/><br/>Stump-tailed Macaque is very selective over the lodging trees. In India, it has been found to use only six species of tree for lodging: <em>Artocarpus chama</em>, <em>Ficus bengalensis</em>, <em>Castopnopsis indica</em>, <em>Ficus religiosa</em>, <em>Mangifera sylvatia</em> and <em>Ficus benjamina</em> (Chetry and Bhattacharjee 2004, Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Home range, as measured in Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary (Assam, India), ranges from 387 to 587 ha, and day travel ranges from 90 to 4.5 km (Chetry 2002, Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2007, Chetry and Chetry 2020). Daily movement differs from one place to another: for example, in Yunnan, China daily ranges are 2–3 km. Group size can be as small as 2-3 individuals or as large as 60 individuals.","<p>Habitat disturbances affecting this species' survival include selective logging, timber and firewood collection for charcoal, building roads, dams, power lines and fisheries, deliberately setting fires, fragmentation, and soil loss/erosion. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine”, and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food, and live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species is hunted as a pest in Khasi and Garo hill in “Paan Jhum” area in Northeast India (Srivastava 1999, Chetry and Chetry 2020).<br/><br/>In India, much of its habitat is affected by Jhum cultivation (shifting or slash-and-burn agriculture; Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). It has also been indiscriminately hunted over almost its entire distribution in India (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001). Its vulnerability to hunting is due to its large body size and terrestrial habit (Chetry and Chetry 2020, D. Chetry and J. Das pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is heavily targeted for use in traditional “medicine,” both nationally and for trade with China. Agriculture, hydropower and mining developments are the other threats that need to be watched.<br/><br/>Within Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting levels for food and for trade are also very high. Habitat loss is a relatively lower threat compared to hunting (R. Timmins pers. comm.), but increasing fragmentation is expected with ongoing and future planned hydropower projects (and associated road access, power lines, and timber extraction).<br/><br/>In Cambodia, where Stump-tailed Macaques are found only in three of 24 sites, concession mining and land mining are existing threats even in protected areas.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, the species suffers from opportunistic hunting in their area of occurrence across the country for supply of bones for “medicinal” use in Viet Nam and China is threatening the population. Logging, gold mining and shifting cultivation are accounted as some direct threats. Other threats include extensive poaching and earlier were used in manufacturing polio medicine. Poaching for traditional medicine is still on unabated and therefore pressing the remaining population. Absence of any new conservation measure is in not helping the situation either.<br/><br/>In Myanmar, logging and timber extraction are major threats. Commercial rubber plantations, hunting, and trade of animal parts with China are all major threats to this species. In China, hunting and habitat loss have reduced in population of this species, and it is locally extinct in some places. Over hunting might have extirpated the population in Guangdong Province. Habitat loss from plundering of evergreen broad leaf forest is a serious threat. In Thailand, habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation are major threats, while hunting is prevalent, but not a significant threat to the species (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). Until 1976, until the ban on international trade in 1976 of primates, trade and export of Stump-tailed Macaque was well and active. The United States of America alone imported ca 30,000 primates from Thailand, mostly macaques, for use in biomedical research and some were famously sold as ‘miniature chimpanzees’. The population in peninsular Thailand was thus significantly reduced due to this trapping for trade and export.<br/></p>","Populations of this species are critically threatened in India, declining in Myanmar and Viet Nam, probably stable in China, and the species is listed as Endangered in Thailand. There are some declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia. Future declines are predicted to be faster in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, India, Myanmar and China due to habitat loss and/or hunting. Populations in South Asia and in Myanmar are few and are fragmented (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003, S.Htun pers. comm.). This species is suspected to be extinct in Bangladesh, having last been recorded there in 1989 (M. Feeroz pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The population is declining rapidly in India except in the few protected areas; in fact, the species is extirpated outside the protected areas except in few reserve forests (D. Chetry and J. Das pers. comm). It is very scarce all over its range in northeastern India. It was previously reported as common in the mountains of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram&#160; and Tripura but currently only found in few isolated locations (Chetry 2002,Choudhury 2001). In India, it is found in the following protected areas:&#160; Arunachal Pradesh, Namdapha National Park, Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary, Assam-Barail Wildlife Sanctuary and Reserved Forest, Innerline Reserved Forest, Hollongapar Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, Meghalaya-Balpakram National Park, Nokrek National Park, Narpuh wildlife Sanctuary, Mizoram-Murlen National Park, Phawngpui Nationa Park, Dampa Tiger Reserve, and Lengteng Wildlife Sanctuary (Chetry 2018, Chetry and Chetry 2020, Chetry 2002, Choudhury 2002, J. Das and D. Chetry pers. comm.). In India, &lt;1,000 individual are estimated on the south bank of the river Brahmaputra and east of Dibang River in northeast India; the species is critical in India (D. Chetry and J. Das pers. comm). In China, the species is still common in western Yunnan, though the populations are thought to be lower in the eastern portions of its range, but recent record suggest that there is still existence of the species in Bangladesh (Dr. Md. Farid Ahsan pers. com.). In 2015, 23,000 individuals were estimated in China’s National survey on mammal populations (Long and Jiang pers. comm), albeit in several fragmented subpopulations. Li <em>et al</em>. (2018) estimated ~3,700 individuals. The population of this species should be larger than 3,700 in China (Pengfei Fan pers. comm.). In many places, populations have gone extinct locally (Chang pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There are no available population estimates for this taxon in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Thailand (R. Boonratana pers. comm.). The population is probably large as the species is frequently encountered throughout its distribution in these countries, although populations are mostly fragmented and isolated.",Decreasing,"<p>This species is found in Cambodia, southwestern China [Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Fujian and Yunnan provinces (Li <em>et al</em>. 2018)], northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tripura states), Lao PDR, northwestern Peninsular Malaysia (Perlis), northern Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. It appears that some occur on the border between Tripura and Chittagong Hill Tracks as confirmed in February 2016. The macaques were on the both sides of the border. Once widespread, the species in Thailand currently persists in a few isolated locations in the western, central and southern parts of the country (Treesucon 1988, Malaivijitnond and Hamada 2005). Formerly it was also found in eastern Bangladesh, but the species has vanished from most parts of its former range in Bangladesh. In China, it is found south of 25°N. The species has been introduced to Hong Kong. In northeastern India, it was long believed to be restricted to the south bank of the Brahmaputra River (Choudhury 1988, Chetry 2002). The Namdapha–Kamlang landscape is also on the south/east bank of the Brahmaputra and is a known stronghold of the species. However, it is to be seen whether it occurs north of the Lohit River, a major tributary of the Brahmaputra from where there are unconfirmed reports. Srivastava and Mohnot (2001), J. Das (pers. comm.) and Chetry <em>et al</em>. (2003) report possible records of this species from Namdapha National Park, though they were morphologically distinct from other representatives of the species, and could represent an undescribed subspecies. Introduced in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>It is suspected that its area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) are undergoing rapid decline due to ongoing and planned infrastructure development, which is causing habitat degradation and loss. For example, in Perlis (Malaysia), there has been a 24% decrease in tree cover since the year 2000 (Global Forest Watch 2020).<br/></p>","The species is hunted for food (subsistence and exotic), traditional medicine industry, pet trade, and sport, cultural and traditional hunting.",Terrestrial,"<p>Internationally, this species is listed under Appendix II in CITES. Regionally, India lists it as schedule II under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 (Srivastava and Mohnot 2001) amended up to 2002. In Indian context the species facing severe threats with few populations left and needs revision of the Indian status so that in can get better protection. The species is also protected in national wildlife acts of Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar.<br/><br/>Stump-tailed Macaques are found in a number of protected areas throughout their range, including: Nokrek National Park, Balpakram National Park, Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary, Hollongapar Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary, Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary, Murlen National Park (India); HuaiKhaKhaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, ThungYaiWildlife Sanctuary, PhuKhieo Wildlife Sanctuary, KhaoKrapuk-Khao Tao Mo Wildlife Non Hunting Area, KhaoSok National Park, KhaoLuang National Park (Thailand). They occur in Namdapha Wildlife Sanctuary (India), Perlis State Park (Malaysia; Syamil <em>et al</em>. 2019) and in Nam Ha National Biodiversity Conservation Area (Lao PDR).

This decline is predicted to continue at the same rate or higher over the next three generations. Ongoing threats from increasing habitat loss due to development, new settlements, agriculture, plantation, and other activities, and from hunting for various reasons, the species is likely to face a higher threat of decline unless specific actions are taken to ensure its survival. Nationally, in India this species is listed as Endangered, and in Bangladesh it is Critically Endangered.</p>","This is a predominantly arboreal animal. It is diurnal and frugivorous. It occupies tropical evergreen and semi­-evergreen forest, tropical wet evergreen forest, tropical&#160; moist deciduous forest, coastal forest, swamp forest, low elevation pine forests (in Lao PDR and China) and montane forest, including degraded forests. In China the species occupies elevations between 50­2,000 m (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003, Choudhury 2003). In Lao PDR and Viet Nam the species is associated with low lands, usually below 500 m. Its generation length is 12-­13 years (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). According to secondary information and recent records, populations in Myanmar live between 190­-400 m (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>Dark evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, tropical, subtropical and deciduous forests in plains, foothills, hills. (50-2,000 m). Found in lowland primary, secondary forest, pine, dry dipterocarp, coastal swamp, montane forest. Frequently observed in riparian forests in western Thailand and Laos, occasionally near human settlements, cultivated fields where it once relatively common (back in 1990), even in highly degraded regions. Known to share associations with Assamese macaques (<em>Macaca assamemensis</em>) western Thailand and the ranges of the two species were observed to overlap in Assam. Range overlaps also with Stump-tailed and Rhesus macaques besides langurs and Hoolocks (Anwaruddin Choudhury in litt., July 2019).<br/><br/>This species eats more than 91 kinds of plants such as mature and tender leaves, leaf buds, leaf petioles, seeds, stems, climbers, roots, flowers, flower buds, inflorescences, bamboo shoots, and gums, insects, larvae, termite eggs and spiders. They also feed on post-harvest Rice paddy in NE India and fruits and vegetables by slash and burn agriculture of the hill tribe. Habituated groups have also been observed to beg for food and feed on biscuits as in Khao Yai National Park, Thailand.<br/><br/>In NE India, winter-spring breeding has been observed. Females are sexually receptive in August-December, but some might continue through to February. Birthing occurs in mid-January, early May, and a few in June. Swellings occur during breeding, as in Lion-tailed Macaques (<em>Macaca silenus</em>). Gestation period is 171-180 days (Choudhury 2008).<br/><br/>This species is primarily arboreal, but it may use both terrestrial and arboreal pathways; individuals flee from danger through trees and not by ground. They use the ground when crossing clearings, roads, to forage, feed in degraded areas and also feed on crops. Seasonal fluctuations dictate the time spent on the ground feeding on crops. One site reported macaques spending over 20% of their time feeding on the ground on sugar cane left overs by elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>). Detailed observation of the species in eastern and central Assam in 1992-1994 and 2004 recorded three peaks of feeding and long mid-day rest, shorter mid-morning rest spells, resting 45%, feeding 23.5%, locomotion 17-19.4%, grooming 6-8%. Actual time spent feeding 153-229 mins/day. Spent 65% of feeding time in January on harvested paddy.<br/><br/>In Assam (Tikleswari, Borajan) the macaques raids the vegetable gardens, crop field and villages (D. Chetry and D. Das pers. comm).<br/><br/>Home range is 83-347 ha, with about 25-48% overlap (Choudhury 2008). Daily movement is 690-2,240 m, influenced by weather and availability of fruits: where fruiting trees were far apart, the daily movement increased. Multi-male, multi-female groups of 12-40 individuals are seen (Choudhury 2008). Estimated group size in Laos rarely exceeds 20-30 individuals. There are few records of groups numbering 50-150 individuals in KhaoYai National Park in Thailand, DakLak Province in Viet Nam and DhouPhouVieng National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos. It may be the case that two or more groups were feeding together.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km2 as studied in 21 sites.&#160; They spent only about 1% of their time on the ground and about 85% of their time on mid canopy and in 97.6% of the cases found inside the forest as opposed to the sympatric <em>M. mulatta </em>that is found outside forests in farms and gardens. Direct competition was found to be scarce between the species and the overlap or sharing of resources was only found to be 22.4%. Of the 101 plant species used between both the species, only 42.6%&#160; shared (Feroz 2012).<br/><br/>In KhaoYai National Park,Thailand these macaques preferred tall sleeping trees (mean 20.9+/- SD 4.9 m) and ‘high sleeping places’(15.8+/- SD 4.3 m) and tend to reuse the sleeping site, an anti-predator strategy (Albert <em>et al</em>. 2011).","Habitat disturbances affecting the future survival of this species include: selective logging; timber and firewood collection for making charcoal; building roads, dams, power lines; and deliberately setting fires. These threats lead to&#160; forest fragmentation and soil loss/erosion. Specifically, a decrease in habitat quality has been due to the loss of fruiting trees and sleeping sites through monocultures and plantations, selective felling, and a subsequent increase in canopy gaps. These animals are hunted and traded for food, sport and traditional “medicine”, and accidental mortality due to trapping occurs. There is a local trade for bones, meat for food and the live animals as pets (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). Habitat loss and poaching are the major threats in India and Bangladesh. There has been a reduction in forest in Assam by over 10% in two years between 2001 and 2003 (Forest Survey of India 2003) and the rate of habitat loss has not reduced. Recent forest cover survey report of Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Government of India suggest that the dense forest cover in the distribution range is decreasing 2011-2013.<br/><br/>In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia, hunting for food and trade is the primary threat, but as a predominantly lowland species habitat&#160; loss likely is also a major threat to the&#160; species. In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry. Sometimes, a well-trained macaque is sold for 1,000 USD. They are also in demand by resorts for show (R. Boonratana pers. comm). <br/><br/>In Myanmar, hunting, trade, habitat loss in varying degrees, shifting cultivation in the north, logging in the east and south, and rubber plantations are the major threats (S. Htun pers. comm).<br/><br/>In China, hunting, habitat loss and disturbance are major threats. There is a perceptible change in habitat quality that has an impact on the species (Huang <em>et al</em>. pers. comm).","In China, the species’ population is estimated to be less than 1,700 individuals (Jiang and Long pers. comm). No information is available on the status of the population dynamics, but it is suspected to be in decline. A very small population occurs in Bangladesh, which is isolated from the neighbouring Indian locations. This habitat is degrading rapidly, thereby causing a continuing decline in mature individuals in the country (Molur <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>A group density of 0.07 individuals/km² was recorded in Namdapha National Park, India, by Chetry <em>et al</em>. (2003). There is no precise information available on population numbers in Myanmar. In India the population is &lt;1,500 individuals and populations are declining rapidly (Chetry and Das pers. comm.) but in one protected area (Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary) it is increasing. Choudhury (2003) stated that there may have been around 24,000 of these macaques in India at the turn of this century. The population has apparently declined owing to habitat loss.<br/><br/>Niche occupation studies by Feroz (2012) in Bangladesh indicated the mean group size of 19.8 (13-26) individuals, with a density of 2.5-6.9 individuals/km² as studied in 21 sites. The mean of seven groups in Assam was 23.3 (range: 16-33) (Choudhury 2008); however, the largest group observed was of 43 macaques in Radhakishorepur reserved forest, Tripura in 2016 (Choudhury in press).<br/><br/>It is also declining steadily in Myanmar.&#160; The animals are very patchily distributed in Myanmar. <br/><br/>The species is widely distributed and common in large forest blocks remaining in southern and central Lao PDR, but it is much scarcer in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam (R. Timmins pers. comm). It is widely distributed through the remaining forest areas of Cambodia. Populations are stable in Thailand. <br/><br/>Declines are due to different threats in different countries. There have been declines of more than 30% in the last 30­-35 (three generations) years in India, Bangladesh, China, Viet Nam and Myanmar. There are perceptible declines in Lao PDR and Cambodia, but the rates are close to or lower than 30%. In most of the countries, the species is predicted to decline at a rate higher than 30% over the next three generations due to increasing trends in habitat loss, persecution, and trade.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in eastern Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China (southwestern Yunnan), northeastern India (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura (Choudhury 1988, 2013)), Lao PDR, Myanmar (including the Mergui Archipelago), Thailand (from about 8°N and including adjacent islands), and central and southern Viet Nam. There might be a gap in the distribution in central and northeastern Myanmar between about 20 and 25°N, where it has not been recorded except on the coast at Arakan. In India found north to the Brahmaputra River (Groves 2001).<br/><br/>Records from Xizang (China) are probably misidentified rhesus macaques (MacKinnon in press).  It has recently been recorded from Namdapha National Park in northeastern India (Chetry <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/><br/>The precise taxonomic boundary between <em>M. leonina</em> and <em>M. nemestrina</em> is not well defined. There are populations of the two taxa found on either side of the distribution limits in the Isthmus of Kra, but many of these populations are the result of release by humans. The two species hybridize in a small area of southern peninsular Thailand, as well as on the islands of Phuket and Yao Yai (Groves 2001).  <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, there are historical records from as far north as Nghe An province, but there is uncertainty whether the species was ever found north of this province. It is widely distributed throughout the lower elevations (below 500 m) of Lao PDR and Cambodia (R. Timmins pers. comm.). It is found over much Myanmar except in areas of human settlements.","In Thailand, the males of this species are exploited for picking coconuts by the industry.

Poaching for traditional medicine is now a threat to all primates in the country and no new conservation program is in place.<br/><br/>Other direct threats include logging, gold mining, shifting cultivation by the hill tribe minority, development of economy and infrastructure resulting in habitat loss and degradation, hunting for food by villagers, hunting for traditional medicine to supply bone to the Viet Nam for use in medicine. Although in their incipient stage, agriculture, mining and hydropower are causing significant damages in terms of forest loss. In Cambodia, the species is reported only in five out of 24 provinces: use in traditional medicine, loss of habitat from logging, and trade are major threats in the region. In Myanmar, logging, plantation, aquaculture, hunting for food and pets, political unrest in cultural minority states impact primates. Timber extraction, large scale farms and plantations, irrigation, hydroelectric projects, highway construction, mineral exploration, resettlement programs for hill tribes, recreation and tourism, have significantly reduced forest cover in Thailand. Shifting cultivation of hill tribes and ethnic Thais have cleared large forests.

It is suspected that the predominant scenario of small isolated subpopulations may aggravate the synergistic demographic and genetic effects of the already severely fragmented habitat. Also, the species suffers hunting pressure at different levels within its distribution range. Furthermore, it is highly susceptible to yellow fever, and an outbreak in 2008-2009 killed many individuals in southern Brazil. Lots of its subpopulations are impacted by urban expansion and infrastructure development, leading increasingly to vehicle and power line accidents and the predation by dogs. The yellow fever epidemic, coupled with ongoing habitat degradation, hunting pressure and other threats, has resulted in ongoing population decline, suspected to be at least 30% over three generations (36 years; 2008-2044). Thus, the species is listed as Vulnerable (VU) under criterion A4ce.","The species is an inhabitant of lowland, submontane and montane forest along the Atlantic coast of Brazil.

In Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, it occurs in the highly seasonal, subtropical and temperate, mixed broadleaf/Araucaria forest (Schneider and Marques 1999; Buss 2001). Aguiar <em>et al.</em> (2007) recorded it in periodically flooded, seasonal, semideciduous forest in the floodplains of the Rio Paraná in Paraná State. In Rio Grande do Sul it occurs also in seasonal deciduous forest fragments (Fortes 2008). Buss<em> et al.</em> (2009) reported the occurrence of <em>A. g. clamitans</em> in different vegetation types at Itapuã State Park, i.e. meso-hygrophilous, hygrophilous and sub-xerophilous forests.

The taxon is not restricted to primary habitats, suggesting that the species is tolerant to environmental changes and human disturbances.<br/><br/>The howler monkeys are the large leaf-eaters within the South American primate communities.

The most characteristic feature is the deep lower jaw, which encompasses the enlarged larynx and the hyoid apparatus, forming a resonating chamber. With this enlarged and highly specialized voice box howler monkeys produce their howls, grunts, roars and barks. Howling sessions, usually involving the entire group, can be heard at distances of 1-2 km, particularly in the early morning (Drubbel and Gautier 1993). <br/><br/>Brown Howler Monkeys live in groups of four to five individuals, reaching a maximum of 13 individuals (Alves and Zau 2007, Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2011, Jardim 2005, Ingberman <em>et al.</em> 2009, Miranda and Passos 2005). Ingberman <em>et al.</em> (2009) reported a mean group size of 4.5 (range: 1 to 6) individuals in 10 observed groups in the Ilha do Cardoso State Park. The authors compiled data from 16 additional studies, finding mean group sizes ranging from 1.8 to 9.4 individuals, and a maximum group size of 13 individuals. In Forest Hemlock in Rio de Janeiro State, Alves and Zau (2007) observed a mean group size of 5.8 (range: 3 to 8) individuals, based on four groups, each with a single adult male. Miranda and Passos (2005) reported 5 groups with a mean group size of 6.3 individuals (range: 4 to 10), including 1 to 2 adult males and 1 to 3 adult females.<br/><br/>There is usually only one dominant male in each group (occasionally two) with a harem of two to five females. Others males are either subordinate younger males, sub-adults, or juveniles. Unlike the spider monkeys, and related to the large proportion of leaves in the diet (up to 50% of the annual diet), howler monkeys have generally small and broadly overlapping home ranges. Home range size, however, varies depending on the type of habitat type (Neville<em> et al.</em> 1988). Bicca-Marques (2003) mentions a variation in home size ranging from 3.9 to 33.0 ha (mean ± SD = 10.2 ± 8.1, N = 11). Fortes (2008) studied a group that used two small forest fragments summing not more than 1 ha. Miranda and Passos (2011) documented variation in home range size reaching from 1.8 to 33 ha (mean ± SD = 10.0 ± 7.9, N = 15). A more recent review reported an average home range size of 13.0 ha (SD = 15.9; Fortes <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Howler monkeys are the only New World primates that regularly include mature leaves in their diet, although softer, less fibrous, young leaves are preferred when available. Their folivory and ability to eat mature leaves is undoubtedly one of the key factors for their wide distribution and the wide variety of vegetation types they inhabit. In many regions mature fruits are another important food item, especially wild figs (<em>Ficus</em>), but they also eat leaf petioles, buds, flowers (sometimes seasonally very important), seeds, mosses, stems, twigs, and even termites.<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Mean adult male weight: 6.73 kg (N=4); mean adult female weight: 4.35 kg (N=5) (Smith and Jungers 1997).","Widespread forest loss and fragmentation throughout its range are the main threats to <em>Alouatta guariba</em>. Its distributional range largely correlates with the most densely populated regions of Brazil. Only 12% of the original forest coverage is remaining in these areas, fragmented into almost 250 forest fragments, 83.4% of which are smaller than 50 ha (Ribeiro<em> et al. </em>2009). It is suspected that the current scenario of small isolated subpopulations, may progressively aggravate the synergistic, demographic and genetic effects of the severely fragmented habitat, including the increase of inbreeding. However, the species is able to survive in quite small forest fragments if there is no hunting. Especially in the northern part of its range it suffers from hunting pressure at different levels (Canale <em>et al</em>. 2012). Furthermore, the species is highly susceptible to yellow fever, and an outbreak in 2008-2009 killed a large number of individuals, with local extinctions recorded in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (Almeida <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fialho <em>et al</em>. 2012), and Misiones, Argentina (Holzmann <em>et al. </em>2010). This epidemic resulted in lethal aggression from local communities due to a fear of direct transmission from howler monkeys (Bicca-Marques and Freitas 2010). In addition, many subpopulations are affected by urban expansion and infrastructure developments. This includes accidents with vehicles and power lines and predation by dogs (Printes 1999, Pasquotto <em>et al</em>. 2002, Galetti and Sazima 2006, Fries <em>et al.</em> 2007, Lokschin <em>et al.</em> 2007, São Paulo (Cidade) 2011, Buss 2012).","Although the size of the total remaining population is unknown, there are a fair number of population estimates throughout the range of this species and it is suspected that the number of mature individuals exceeds the threshold of 10,000 individuals. Pinto <em>et al.</em> (2009) reported at least eight subpopulations with more than 500 individuals, estimated by using linear transect surveys in the Atlantic Forest area of southern and southeastern Brazil. Most of those studies were carried out in very small forest fragments. González-Solís <em>et al.</em> (2001) provided a summary, listing 11 sites (forests; ranging from 50 ha to 100,000 ha) where brown howlers were counted.<br/><br/>Densities can be very high. When not hunted, densities can vary, even within very small forest fragments due to being folivorous and their dietary flexibility. In a 50-ha site at Lageadinho in São Paulo State, group size was 6-12 individuals, and the density was estimated as 98 individuals/km² (Torres de Assumpção 1983). Chiarello (1993) recorded a density of 177 individuals/km² at the Santa Genebre Reserve (259 ha) in São Paulo State. Density estimates at the Caratinga Biological Station (survey area ranging from 570 to 800 ha) in Minas Gerais, varied from 92 to 149 individuals/km² (Mendes 1985, 1989; Hirsch 1995). Lower densities, e.g. 10.1 individuals/km², were recorded by Pinto <em>et al.</em> (1993) in the Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (4,000 ha) in Espírito Santo State. Hirsch (1995) estimated densities of 1.8 to 49.0 individuals/km² in the Rio Doce State Park (32,210 ha) in Minas Gerais. González-Solís <em>et al</em>. (2001) estimated only a density of 0.79 individuals/km² in four contiguous protected areas of the Serra do Paranapiacaba in the state of São Paulo, totalling about 140,000 ha (i.e., the state parks of Intervales, Turístico Alto Ribeira and Carlos Botelho, and the Xitué State Ecological Station). Surveys by Chiarello (1995) in the Linhares Forest Reserve, Espírito Santo failed to register howlers even though they were present. During later surveys in the same reserve, Chiarello (1999) recorded an encounter rate of 0.15 groups/10 km. Schneider and Marques (1999) estimated a density of 92-125 individuals/km² in the southern part of the range of this species, in mixed broadleaf/Araucaria forest in the Aracuri-Esmeralda Ecological Station. Buss (2001) estimated 65 to 85 individuals/km² in the Itapuã State Park. Ingberman <em>et al.</em> (2009) reported 10.6 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> or 2.4 groups/km<sup>2</sup> in Cardoso Island State Park. The same authors compiled data from 16 studies using different methods and obtained values ​​from 0.4 to 260 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>. Pinto <em>et al</em>. (2009) mentioned a variation in population density reaching from 0.3 to 176.8 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (N=20). Chiarello and Melo (2001) surveyed seven forest fragments in Espírito Santo, varying in size from 210 to 24,250 ha, and found the species in very low abundance. In two of these fragments (Sooretama Biological Reserve: 24,250 ha; Rio Preto National Forest: 2,822 ha) only by vocalization, in two others (Linhares Forest Reserve: 21,800 ha; M7/317: 260 ha) by a single encounter. Lower densities seem to occur in large and continuous forests. On the other hand, higher densities are found in small, isolated or peri-urban forest fragments.<br/><br/>The above quoted density estimates are mainly the result of a number of behavioural and ecological field studies conducted on this species. The study sites chosen are those where howler monkeys were found to be numerous and visible. Thus, the high densities reported are undoubtedly at the top end of the possible range and do not reflect a situation typical for the entire distributional range of the species. At localities where they are hunted they will occur in much lower densities, or not at all. In some areas they are scarce even though hunting is minimal or absent (for example, the Rio Doce State Park or the Augusto Ruschi Biological Station). The reason for low population densities in these areas is generally sought to be disease epidemics, especially yellow fever.<br/><br/>In Misiones, Argentina, densities of both <em>A.</em> <em>guariba</em> and <em>A. caraya</em> are extremely low, probably as a result of the dramatic habitat fragmentation observed in the last few decades, and due to repeated yellow fever outbreaks (1966, 2008-2009).",Decreasing,"<em>Alouatta guariba </em>inhabits a large part of the Atlantic Forest, along the coast of eastern Brazil. Its distributional range extends from Rio de Contas in southern Bahia (formerly south of the Rio Paraguaçu) (Neves<em> et al. </em>2015a, b), south to the basin of the Rio Camaquã, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (Printes <em>et al.</em> 2001), and further to the extreme North of Argentina in the province of Misiones (Crespo 1954; Rylands <em>et al</em>. 1998; Di Bitetti <em>et al</em>. 1994; Rylands 1994; Marques 2003). <em>Alouatta g. clamitans </em>occurs in sympatry with <em>A. caraya</em> in the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil (Aguiar <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2014; Bicca-Marques <em>et al. </em>2008) and in the Province of Misiones in Argentina (Agostini <em>et al. </em>2008). Hybridization between these two taxa is suspected in the contact zone and was observed in captivity (Jesus<em> et al</em>. 2010).&#160;Kinsey (1981) argued that the Rio Doce separated the northern subspecies (<em>Alouatta g. guariba</em>) from the southern subspecies (<em>A. g. clamitans</em>). However, throughout a large part of their range, i.e. north of the Rio Doce, howler monkeys were indistinguishable from those to the South of the river (S. Mendes pers. comm.). Surveys by Rylands <em>et al</em>. (1988) resulted in the discovery of groups just south of the lower Jequitinhonha River, which were all pale gold in colour, whereas further west, north of the middle Jequitinhonha, groups in deciduous forests showed sexual dichromatism typical of <em>clamitans</em> occurring further south (females dark brown, males golden brown). North of the Jequitinhonha River, only a few records of brown howler monkeys were reported, and only a few viable populations remain (Neves <em>et al. </em>2015a,b). If the uniformly pale howlers of the lower Jequitinhonha are, in fact, a distinct subspecies (the nominate subspecies), then the populations must be minuscule. However, the validity of the two subspecies remains doubtful. Also, recent genetic analysis, comparing populations from the south of the species’ range in the states of Santa Catarina, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro suggest a strong subpopulation differentiation within clamitans (Jerusalinsky 2001, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2005, Martins<em> et al.</em> 2011).",The species suffers from high hunting pressure for consumption or for cultural use (to remove the hyoid bone used in rituals and folk medicine)..,Terrestrial,"<p>Some initiatives focus on the conservation of the southern subspecies, <em>Alouatta guariba clamitans</em>, since the early 1990’s, implementing research and management actions. The Projeto Bugio (Howler Project) is an initiative of the Indaial Biological Research Center (CEPESBI), maintained by the Municipality of Indaial and the University Foundation of Blumenau (FURB). Since 1992 they have conducted research, environmental education, management of individuals and conservation activities in the northern region of the Santa Catarina State (Projeto Bugio 2016).<br/><br/> In 1993 the Programa Macacos Urbanos (Urban Monkeys Program), linked to the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and recently recognized as a Nucleus of Universitary Extension (NEMU/UFRGS), implemented a transdisciplinary approach towards the species conservation (Jerusalinsky<em> et al</em>. 2010). Actions implemented include: creation of new protected areas (Printes <em>et al</em>. 2010), environmental education activities (Teixeira <em>et al.</em> 2011) and the installation of rope bridges in the south of the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul State, by the Urban Monkeys Program (NEMU/UFRGS) to minimize road kills, dog attacks and electric shock accidents with public power lines (Lokschin <em>et al</em>. 2007; Teixeira <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The municipality of São Paulo has developed a number of reintroductions and environmental education activities of local communities (São Paulo (Cidade), 2009a; São Paulo (Cidade) 2009b; Alencar Jr. <em>et al.</em> 2011; São Paulo (Cidade) 2012).<br/><br/>The northern subspecies, <em>Alouatta guariba guariba</em>, was included in the Central Atlantic Forest National Action Plan, elaborated by ICMBio and collaborators in 2010, establishing a series of conservation strategies by means of research and management of the species and its habitats. As part of these strategies, the Projeto Barbado-Vermelho (Red-Howler Project), coordinated by&#160;IESB&#160;in cooperation with the National Center for Research and Conservation of Brazilian Primates (ICMBio/CPB) and the Uiraçu&#160;Institute, is developing research and management actions. The program is supported by the Rain Forest Trust, the Primate Action Fund (CI), and the Mohamed BinZayed Fund. The activities include the release of howler monkeys that were illegally kept in captivity (Serra Bonita, Camacan, Bahia), and the management of a complex of private reserves with more than 2.000 hectares (Neves <em>et al. </em>2015a, b). This subspecies was also included in the list of The World’s 25 Most Endangered Primates (Neves <em>et al.</em> 2015b).<br/><br/>It is listed on Appendix II of CITES.<br/><br/>This species is present in many protected areas:<br/><br/><strong>Brazil</strong><br/> Bahia:<br/></p><ul><li> Estação Veracel Private Reserve (RPPN) (6,069 ha) (Kinzey 1982; Hirsch <em>et al</em>. 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991; Hirsch <em>et al.</em> 1994)</li><li>Alto Cariri National Park (19,238 ha) (Chiarello <em>et al.</em> 2006).</li></ul>Espírito Santo:<ul><li>Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (3,572 ha) (Mendes 1991; Pinto <em>et al.</em> 1993)</li><li>Linhares Forest Reserve (Companhia Vale do Rio Doce) (22,000 ha) (Mendes 1991; Chiarello 1995).</li><li>Sooretama Biological Reserve (27,943 ha) (rare, Chiarello 1999)</li><li>Córrego Grande Biological Station (1,489 ha)</li><li>Córrego do Veado Biological Reserve (2,358 ha)</li><li>Pedra Azul State Biological Reserve (1,200 ha) (Mendes 1991)</li><li>Duas Bocas State Biological Reserve (2,910 ha) (Mendes 1991) </li><li>Fazenda Montes Verdes Forest Reserve (1,500 ha) (Mendes 1991) </li><li>Santa Lúcia Biological Station (400 ha) (Mendes 1991) </li><li>São Lourenço Biological Station (22 ha) (Mendes 1991)  </li><li>Forno Grande State Park (730 ha) (Passamani 2008)</li></ul>Minas Gerais:<ul><li>Mata Escura Biological Reserve (50,872.42 ha) (Melo 2005)</li><li>Mata dos Ausentes State Biological Reserve (945 ha) (Kinzey 1982; Hirsch<em> et al.</em> 1991; Oliver and Santos 1991; Hirsch <em>et al.</em> 1994)</li><li>Caparaó National Park (across the Espírito Santo border) (31,853 ha)</li><li>Rio Doce State Park (35,973 ha) (Stallings and Robinson 1991; Hirsch 1995)</li><li>Serra do Brigadeiro State Park (13,210 ha) (Cosenza 1993)</li><li>Ibitipoca State Park (1,488 ha) (Hirsch <em>et al</em>. 1994)</li><li>Feliciano Abdala Private Natural Reserve (RPPN) – Caratinga Biological Station (Mendes 1985, 1989)</li><li>Itacolomi State Park (7,543 ha) (Lessa<em> et al.</em> 2008)</li><li>Nova Baden State Park (215 ha) (R.G.T.

191703041,39929,Callicebus barbarabrownae,Critically Endangered,C2a(i),2021,2015-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Callicebus barbarabrownae </em>is a rare species, endemic to the Caatinga of the states of Bahia and Sergipe in Brazil. It occurs in very low densities with the number of mature individuals estimated at fewer than 250, in subpopulations holding fewer than 50 mature individuals. Numbers are evidently still declining, due to loss and fragmentation of their habitat. It is not known to occur in any protected area. For these reasons <em>Callicebus barbarabrownae</em> is categorised as CR C2a(i).",Occurs in caatinga (dry scrubland) with a preferences for dense arboreal caatinga (Printes 2007). There is no available information on its ecology.,"This species occurs in a region of Brazil with widespread deforestation and habitat fragmentation. Cattle ranching, agriculture and continuing urbanisation are the main threats. The area is characterised by rapid development facilitated by an extensive network of highways. Other threats include potential dangers from roads and power-lines and predation by domestic pets. This species occurs in small fragmented populations that are exposed to synergistic genetic and demographic risks. Hunting pressure needs to be ascertained, but it is probably moderate due to the small body size. During surveys, a few individuals were found being kept as pets (Printes<em> et al</em>. 2013).","Based on the data of Printes<em> et al</em>. (2011) the total known population of <em>Callicebus barbarabrownae</em> is less than 1,000 individuals, and we infer that the number of mature individuals is less than 250.",Decreasing,"Endemic to Brazil, the Blond Titi Monkey occurs in the states of Bahia (Hershkovitz 1990) and Sergipe at approximately 240-900 m asl (Printes 2007), from the Rio Paraguaçú basin to the border between the states of Bahia and Sergipe along the margins of the Rio Real. Prior to the survey of Printes (2005, 2007), this species was known from only four localities: Lamarão (type locality), Formosa, Bandeira de Melo and Mirorós in the municipality of Ibipeba all in the State of Bahia (Hershkovitz 1990, Marinho-Filho and Veríssimo 1997). However, the taxon has now been confirmed at over 55 sites in Bahia and Sergipe (Printes 2007, Estrela <em>et al.</em> 2007). In recent surveys (195 km) undertaken in Lamarão in Bahia, the species was registered in four locations, all caatinga scrubland fragments (Estrela<em> et al</em>. 2007), some considerably smaller than previously estimated (<em>A.

In the past, the coastal forests of the ‘Agreste’ in eastern Bahia probably supported large populations; however, this type of vegetation is rare today (Printes <em>et al.</em> 2011).

No titis were recorded in the region west of Araci and Nova Soure, which is dominated by the Cerrado. However, <em>C. barbarabrownae</em> was recorded in the Caatinga of the moister uplands northeast of Araci (Mandacaru, Mirandela and Serra Branca). The species was also recorded in Caatinga habitat further north as far as the Salitre river, 170 km from Juazeiro, but titis were not recorded west of the Chapada Diamantina (Printes 2007, Printes <em>et al.</em> 2011)<em> Callicebus melanochir</em> replaces <em>C. barbarabrownae</em> in the region known as the ‘Recôncavo Baiano’ (south of the Paraguaçu river in the municipality of Igrapiuna). The lower Paraguaçú forms the limit between the geographic ranges of <em>C. coimbrai</em>, restricted to the left or north bank, and <em>C. melanochir</em>, found on the right bank. Further west, in the region of Feira de Santana, <em>C. barbarabrownae</em> occurs on both banks of the Paraguaçú. There appears to be no physical barrier between the eastern limit of the range of <em>C. barbarabrownae</em> and the western limit of <em>C. coimbrai</em>.

The primary threats are currently thought to be contamination of their food supply and possibly a shortage in food supply, negative interactions with human infrastructure and hunting for use in the traditional health industry (Allan 2015). Further threats include disturbance at colonies, bush encroachment and drowning (Anderson 1999, Borello and Borello 2002<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>, Bamford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007)<strong></strong>. In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007, Anon. 2008)<strong></strong>. It is estimated that 160 vultures are sold and that there are 59,000 vulture-part consumption events in eastern South Africa each year, involving an estimated 1,250 hunters, traders and healers. At current harvest levels, the populations of this species in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho could become locally extinct within 44-53 years. Should the populations of<em> </em>White-backed Vultures <em>G. africanus</em> become depleted first, the resultant increase in hunting pressure on <em>G. coprotheres</em> could cause a population collapse within the subsequent 12 years (McKean and Botha 2007, Anon. 2008)<strong></strong>.

A study in South Africa found that should current rates of exploitation for market trade continue then the populations in Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape could be exhausted within 54 years (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The species suffers mortality from the ingestion of poison left for pests (not vultures) (Diekmann and Strachan 2006) and potentially diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses&#160;(BirdLife International news www.birdlife.org/news 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

A single poisoning incident can kill 50-500 birds, making the species susceptible to sudden local declines (M. Diekmann<em> in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. The collapse of a key colony in eastern Botswana has been attributed to human disturbance, especially insensitive tourism<strong></strong> (Borello and Borello 2002). The ongoing urbanisation around Hartbeespoort Dam and the Magaliesberg Mountains, South Africa, has limited the extent of natural areas for foraging by vultures, perhaps resulting in their reliance on supplementary food at vulture ""restaurants"" <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Wolter <em>et al</em>. 2007). If such restaurants were closed, vultures might be exposed to unsafe carcasses <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Wolter <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Poor grassland management in some areas has promoted bush encroachment, making finding carcasses more difficult for vultures (Schultz 2007, Bamford <em>et al. </em>2009). There are records of at least 120 individuals (21 incidents) of this species drowning in small farm reservoirs in southern Africa between the early 1970s and late 1990s (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1999), although modifications to many reservoirs have now been made (Boshoff <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009)<strong></strong>. Raptors are thought to drown after attempting to bathe or drink, with mass vulture drownings probably due to the triggering of group behaviour by the actions of one bird (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1999)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In Magaliesberg a large number of fatalities have been associated with powerline collisions and electrocutions, and this is one of the main factors causing the ongoing decline of the species in South Africa (K. Wolter <em>in litt</em>. 2007). It is estimated that a minimum of 80 vultures are killed annually by collision with powerlines in Eastern Cape Province (Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 2011). Also, due to an increase in incident reporting in South Africa, it is becoming evident that this threat to the species is severe. The strategic partnership between The Endangered Wildlife Trust and South Africa’s energy supplier, Eskom, has been recording wildlife-energy infrastructure interactions since October 1996. This database has 403 incidents involving the Cape Vulture; totaling 1,022 individuals, of which 866 individuals have died as a result of electrocution incidents on power lines, while 156 have been killed colliding with overhead cables (S. Page-Nicholson and C. Hoogstad <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>A controversial wind farm development in Maluti-Drakensberg, Lesotho, an important site for Cape Vulture was given approval in 2014 (Anon. 2014), and even relatively small-scale wind energy developments in the Lesotho Highlands pose a threat to the species (Rushworth and Krüger 2014), especially as, even after rehabilitation, injured (or poisoned) individuals have increased mortality compared to individuals of a similar age (Monadjem <em>et al. </em>2014). It is reported that a lack of adult females in the relict Namibian population may have led to four males breeding with <em>G. africanus</em>, although this is not thought to be a problem across southern Africa (Diekmann and Strachan 2006). Patterns in the contraction of the species's range since the 1950s imply that climate change could be an underlying factor driving its decline through changes in habitats and decreases in prey populations, though further research is required to confirm a link (Simmons and Jenkins 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.  <p></p>","In 2006, the total population was estimated at 8,000-10,000 individuals (M.

The global population estimate has been revised with an estimate of 4,700 pairs or 9,400 mature individuals (Allan 2015). Based on surveys, Hirschauer <em>et al.</em> (2020) estimated that the species's stronghold in the north-east, contained 3,560 breeding pairs, and that the stronghold contained 56-74% of the global population of mature individuals.&#160;<br/><br/>If the 3,560 breeding pairs represent 56% of the population, then the global population size may equate to 6,357 breeding pairs (12,714 mature individuals). If the stronghold represents 74% of the population, the global population size may equate to 4,810 breeding pairs (9,621 mature individuals). The population size is therefore placed in the band of 9,621-12,714 mature individuals, rounded here to 9,600 - 12,800 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is found in <strong>South Africa</strong> where overall numbers were previously thought to be decreasing (Vernon 1999, Barnes 2000, Benson 2000<strong></strong>) with a minimum of 630 pairs at 143 colonies and 2000 individuals in the Eastern Cape and 39% of colonies recorded between 1987-1992 now inactive (Boshoff <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009), however, more recent data from the northern provinces suggests that the number of 'active' nests has increased since 2000 and a similar increase may be occurring in the Eastern Cape Province (Benson 2015, Pfeiffer <em>et al. </em>2016,&#160;P.

Goodwin <em>in litt</em>. 2015]). By 2000 there were only 6-12 birds in Namibia (Simmons <em>et al.</em> 1998,&#160;R. Simmons <em>in litt. </em>1999, 2000, Diekmann and Strachan 2006), with 16 birds released in October 2005<strong> </strong>(Diekmann and Strachan 2006<strong></strong>). Birds fitted with satellite transmitters in Namibia have been recorded making flights of up to 400 km into <strong>Angola</strong> (M. Diekmann<em> in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>.

It is estimated that 160 vultures are sold and that there are 59,000 vulture-part consumption events in eastern South Africa each year, involving an estimated 1,250 hunters, traders and healers. At current harvest levels, the populations of this species in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho could become locally extinct within 44-53 years. Should the populations of<em>&#160;</em>White-backed Vultures&#160;<em>G. africanus</em>&#160;become depleted first, the resultant increase in hunting pressure on&#160;<em>G. coprotheres</em>&#160;could cause a population collapse within the subsequent 12 years (McKean and Botha 2007, Anon. 2008)<strong></strong>. Extrapolation from a limited study of traditional healers in Maseru, Lesotho, suggests that, conservatively, nearly 7% of the breeding population in that country would be lost annually for such use<strong></strong><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span>(Beilis and Esterhuizen 2005). A study in South Africa found that should current rates of exploitation for market trade continue then the populations in Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape could be exhausted within 54 years (McKean&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).",Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. It is legally protected throughout its range. A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian vultures was produced in 2017 (CMS 2017), and a Biodiversity Management Plan is being produced by the Cape Vulture Task Force, driven by The Endangered Wildlife Trust and BirdLife South Africa (S. Page-Nicholson and C. Hoogstad <em>in litt. </em>2016). Some breeding colonies lie within protected areas (Barnes 2000, Theron 2013)<strong></strong>. Non-governmental organisations have successfully raised awareness among farming communities in South Africa of the plight of this species (Barnes 2000). Many nestlings of this species were colour-ringed in southern Africa in the 1970s and 1980s<strong> </strong>(Botha 2006). The national electricity supplier in South Africa, in partnership with The Endangered Wildlife Trust, has replaced pylons in some regions with a design that reduces electrocution risk to large birds (Barnes 2000, S. Page-Nicholson and C. Hoogstad <em>in litt. </em>2016), and breeding numbers have increased in some areas (Hirschauer <em>et al.</em> 2020). <br/><br/>Supplementary feeding at vulture restaurants may have helped to slow declines in some areas (Barnes 2000). The establishment of a restaurant at Nooitgedacht, South Africa, is thought to have helped promote the recolonisation of the former colony there, and another restaurant has possibly contributed the species's recovery in Magaliesberg <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Wolter <em>et al</em>. 2007). Supplementary feeding is known to significantly increase the survival rate of first-year birds in the Western Cape Province of South Africa (Piper <em>et al</em>. 1999), and appears to have increased the number of breeding pairs at the Mzimkhulu colony in southern KwaZulu-Natal (Schabo <em>et al. </em>2016), although there seems to not have been an effect on breeding success (Schabo <em>et al. </em>2016). Additionally, in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, adult vultures did not appear to be dependent on vulture restaurants, but could find enough food from subsistence rural farmland (Pfeiffer <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>Thirty-seven individuals were held in captivity in Namibia in 2011, with 7 breeding pairs from which at least 2 chicks have been hatched (Anon. 2011). The VulPro project in South Africa holds over 80 non-releasable Cape Vultures in captivity, this includes 10 breeding pairs, with the first successful hatching in September 2011 (Wolter 2011, Wolter <em>et al</em>. 2014). The programme aims to release captive-born chicks into the wild to supplement wild populations. In February 2015, seven birds from VulPro and three from the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa were released into an open-topped enclosure so that they could eventually disperse into the wild (Hirschauer 2015). In October 2005, 16 birds from South Africa were released in Namibia and, although at least two perished (Diekmann and Strachan 2006). Data on flight patterns and breeding behaviour have been recorded from two birds that were fitted with satellite transmitters (Anon. 2006). By 2006, five birds had been fitted with satellite tracking collars (Diekmann and Strachan 2006, Bamford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007). In Namibia, both communal and commercial farmers have been educated about the benefits that vultures bring and thus the disadvantages of poisoning carcasses, whilst there is also an education centre and education programme for schools (Diekmann and Strachan 2006).&#160;<br/><br/>A press release was circulated in July 2007 to raise awareness of the impacts of hunting for medicinal and cultural reasons in southern Africa (McKean and Botha 2007)<strong></strong>. The threat posed by anti-inflammatory drugs in southern Africa is under investigation (K. Wolter <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. The Hawk Conservancy and The Endangered Wildlife Trust are   currently providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning   teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to  respond  to a neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). An expert workshop on the species's conservation was held in South Africa in March 2006<strong> </strong>(Boshoff and Anderson 2006). Rehabilitation and release of injured vultures has become an important conservation action (Allan 2015). The species is listed as Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini, and Critically Endangered in Namibia (Allan 2015, Simmons and Brown 2015).<br/><strong><br/>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Develop conservation plans for each of the 18 'core' colonies through the Cape Griffon Task Force (Boshoff and Anderson 2007, Jenkins 2010).

It is therefore listed as Vulnerable.<p></p>","It occurs in lowland tropical forest, typically below 900 m but locally to 2,000 m. It appears to have some tolerance of degraded forest and human-modified landscapes, as long as the forest matrix remains and there are sufficient large trees for nesting sites (Alverez-Cordero 1996; Aguiar-Silva 2016; Bowler&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020) and sufficient availability of prey (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021a). It will nest where high-grade forestry has been practised, and uses forest patches within a pasture/forest mosaic for hunting (Bierregaard 1994; Álvarez-Cordero 1996; Parker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996)<strong></strong>.&#160;However, it is mostly likely to be found in forest with at least 70% cover, and tends to avoid areas of cultivated land (Sutton 2021). A study in the Arc of Deforestation in Brazil found that it requires canopy vertebrate prey for successful breeding, and is unable to tolerate landscapes with less than 50% forest cover remaining (Miranda <em>et al. </em>2021a). It does not usually cross forest gaps of more than c.500 m (Aguiar-Silva 2016). It nests in very large trees of species such as&#160;<em>Ceiba pentandra</em>,&#160;<em>Swietenia</em>&#160;sp.,&#160;<em>Enterolobium contortisiliquum</em>,&#160;<em>Tabebuia impetiginosa</em>,&#160;<em>Berthorelia excelsa</em>,&#160;<em>Cavanillesia platanifolia</em>,&#160;<em>Cedrelinga catenaeiformis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Huberodendron&#160;</em>sp. (Muñiz-López 2008). In the Amazon, it appears to nest in only 28 species of tree (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). It typically nests below 310 m (Piana 2007; Muñiz-López 2008, 2016; González and Vargas 2011). It has been recorded feeding on a wide range of mostly mammalian prey species, including opossoms, primates, anteaters, sloths, armadillos, porcupines, agouties, carnivores and deer, as well as some large bird species (Alvarez-Cordero 1996; Miranda 2018), but in the Arc of Deforestation the majority of its diet consists of arboreal mammals, even in highly deforested areas (Miranda <em>et al. </em>2021a).","The main threats to the species are forest loss and degradation, and hunting, poaching and persecution. Collision with powerlines is an additional source of mortality (Banhos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018; Gusmão&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).<br/><br/>Although it is not consumed as food, the species is targeted by hunters, and is frequently killed across much of its large range (Trinca&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008; Giraldo-Amaya&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2021; A. Monroy-Ojeda <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021). It is sometimes persecuted with the intention of protecting livestock, or purely to satisfy curiosity (Trinca&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008; DeLuca 2012; Miranda <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021b).&#160;Roughly a third of the Amazon basin is indigenous territory, and within these areas the species is frequently poached&#160;by indigenous groups for the use of its feathers in traditional headdresses, arrow fletching or souvenirs, or to be kept or traded as a 'mascot'&#160;(Alvarez-Cordero&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996; Piana 2018; E. Miranda <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2021). It can be found for sale at live animal markets (Piana 2018). Increasing penetration of illicit mining operation, armed groups and farmers into previously intact forests in large parts of the species's South American range (C. Sharpe <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021) may lead to increased poaching and persecution. From the 1980s to 1990s, at least 45 Harpy Eagles were shot or poached in Venezuela alone (Alvarez-Cordero 1996). Of 18 individuals released in Panama and Belize and for which the cause of death was known, eight individuals were shot (Watson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Studies have found that shooting resulted in the death of 2.59 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup> annually in the Arc of Deforestation, which may quickly lead to local population depletion or extirpation (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021b; E. Miranda <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>Forest continues to be lost and degraded across much of the species's range, and particularly in southeast Amazonia and in Central America (Global Forest Watch 2021). Little forest now remains in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Forest is lost due to conversion to agriculture (crops and pasture), development of hydroelectric power plants and road-building (Banhos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018), and remaining forest is degraded due to selective logging, escaped fires and illegal mining. Almost all of the few species of tree used for nesting are favoured for commercial use for timber (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Selective logging may therefore reduce the availability of nesting trees for the species, and may result in the death of nestlings (Vargas&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006; Aguiar-Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014; Banhos&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018; Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Loss of canopy cover may lead to a reduction in the abundance of prey species, thereby decreasing the quality of habitat for the Harpy Eagle (Miranda <em>et al.</em>&#160;2021a), although a study in Peru found that the Harpy Eagle is able to survive in secondary forest by feeding on prey species that are tolerant of disturbance (Bowler <em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). A model projected that the species's range may contract by 7-14% by 2090 as a result of climate change (Sutton 2021).<br/><p></p>","The species is generally rare throughout its range. It has a very large territory and is patchily distributed (Thiollay 1989). In Brazil, it is most common in Amazonia, and rare in the Atlantic forest (Banhos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It is now very scarce in Mexico (A. Monroy-Ojeda <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021) and in Costa Rica (C.&#160;Sánchez <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2021).<br/><br/>Records for the area occupied by one breeding pair include 45-79 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Venezuela, 10-20 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Panama (Alvarez-Cordero 1996), 43 km<sup>2&#160;</sup>in Peru (Piana 2007),&#160;47.8 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and 19.6 (+/- 5.7) km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Ecuador (Muñiz-López 2008, 2016), and 14-16 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in Panama (Vargas González and Vargas 2011). In the arc of deforestation in Mato Grosso, Brazil, the species was recorded at a nest density of 1.97–4.84 nests/100 km<sup>2</sup> of forest habitat, or 0.79–3.07 nests/100 km<sup>2 </sup>where deforested areas were included in the calculation (Miranda&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2021a).<br/><br/>National population size estimates have included 1,000-2,000 mature individuals in French Guiana (MNHN, UICN France and GEPOG 2018), 5,000-10,000 individuals (roughly equivalent to 3,300-6,700 mature individuals) in Peru (Piana 2018) and 806-1,208 pairs (equivalent to 1,612-2,416 mature individuals) in Panama, which was thought likely to be an overestimate (Vargas González&#160;and Vargas 2011).<br/><br/>Based on the minimum and median of the above density estimates for Panama, the estimated area of tree cover with at least 50% canopy cover within the mapped range in 2020 (below 310 m and total: approximately 76,700 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and 108,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>; Global Forest Watch 2021), the population size in Central America is inferred to be within the range of 11,000-22,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 7,600-15,000 mature individuals.<br/>Based on the minimum and median of the above density estimates for Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil, the estimated area of tree cover with at least 50% canopy cover within the mapped range in 2020 (below 310 m and total: approximately 4,380,000 km<sup>2 </sup>and 6,027,000 km<sup>2</sup>; Global Forest Watch 2021), the population size in South America is inferred to be within the range of 160,000-421,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 110,000-281,000 mature individuals. <br/><br/>The global population size is therefore tentatively estimated to fall within the range 118,000-225,000 mature individuals. Hunting and selective logging are likely to have depleted population densities across large parts of the species's range, so the true population size may be lower; to account for uncertainty, the population size is here placed in the band 100,000-250,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>Genetic analysis in Brazil suggested a single subpopulation in the country (Banhos <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), so the species is suspected to have a single subpopulation.",Decreasing,"<em>Harpia harpyja</em> has an extensive range in southern&#160;<strong>Mexico </strong>(Monroy-Ojeda <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), <strong>Guatemala</strong>, <strong>Belize </strong>(B.

It has already been lost from large areas of its range due to the loss of grassland habitat and is now restricted to few, widely separated breeding regions. The species appears to be in imminent danger of becoming extinct in Madyha Pradesh and only very few are breeding in Maharashtra, leaving only two states with populations larger than a hundred mature individuals. The total population size is now thought to be fewer than 1,000 mature individuals, down from over 3,500 in twenty years.<br/><p></p>","The species is a local migrant with movements apparently determined by rainfall patterns (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;As such migration is considered partial and opportunistic with birds concentrating in areas that receive more rainfall, however there is believed to be a fairly high level of site fidelity among males (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Virtually all of the breeding areas are on private or revenue lands (Narwade&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Breeding coincides with the south-west monsoon, May-September, with birds congregating in north-central and west India for males to perform extraordinary leaping aerial displays. It occurs in productive rain-fed grasslands greater than two hectares, in lowland areas (below 250&#160;m), particularly dominated by <em>Sehima nervosum</em> and <em>Chrysopogon fulvus</em>, with scattered bushes and scrub (Dutta <em>et al. </em>2018); with breeding areas coinciding with areas of black cotton soil (H. Yahya <em>in litt. </em>2016). It has also been recorded breeding in soybean <em>Glycine max</em>,&#160;mung bean <em>Vigna radiate</em>, Black gram or Urad Bean <em>Vigna mungo</em>, Sesame <em>Sesamum indicium</em>, groundnut <em>Arachis hypogea </em>and infrequently in sorghum <em>Sorghum vulgare</em>, maize <em>Zea mays</em>, sugarcane <em>Saccharum, </em>rice <em>Oryza sativa</em>, mustard <em>Brassica campestris&#160;</em>and wheat <em>Triticum vulgare&#160;</em>crops as well as grassland in forest plantations (Sankaran 2000, Narwade <em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2017).<br/><br/>Non-breeding season movements are poorly understood, but the species sometimes uses lightly wooded areas as well as grasslands and scrubland (Sankaran 2000). Individuals may disperse large distances from breeding sites, as far as southern and north India (Dharmakumarsinhji 1950, S. Narwade <em>in litt. </em>2020, eBird 2021), but others remain on or near breeding sites year round (eBird 2021).<br/><p></p>","<p>Severe hunting pressure, particularly of males for sport and also food (e.g. Kasambe and Gahale 2010), precipitated its decline. </p>  <p>More recently, the most significant threats to direct mortality are likely to be predation of chicks by feral dogs and adult mortality through collisions with energy infrastructure. The species also continues to be threatened by hunting in Nepal (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012), and eggs and females may also be collected within its range (H. Yahya and P. Patil&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Unethical photography were also identified as threats by Dutta&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2018).</p>  <p>Declines have been caused by rapid reductions in the area of grassland owing to conversion to agriculture (with associated use of insecticides and fertilisers [H.

This along with a&#160;lack of coordination between different implementing agencies, lack of participatory planning, rapid industrialisation and spread of mining and quarry activities are key growing threats to species (Dutta&#160;<em>et.al.</em>&#160;2013, Narwade&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;In many areas, 40-80% of grasslands have been encroached and converted to intensive agriculture (Sankaran 1995, Joshua 2011, Dutta and Jhala 2012) within the last 2-3 decades.&#160;In addition, the rapid spread of the non-native&#160;<em>Prosopis glandulosa</em>&#160;threatens habitat quality. Over the last two decades, unreliable monsoon rains have caused significant population fluctuations. In Nepal, the species suffers from disturbance and insufficient protection resulting in overgrazing and subsequent grassland degradation (Inskipp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral<em>&#160;in litt</em>. 2012). It is also seriously threatened by inappropriate management, such as ploughing in protected areas, leading to a loss of suitable habitat. Pressure on lowland grasslands in Nepal continues to increase, and now very small areas of suitable habitat remain, and these are almost entirely within protected areas (Inskipp&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). In addition, the invasive plant&#160;<em>Mikania micrantha</em>&#160;has had serious impacts on Chitwan National Park and Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve. </p>","The total population has been calculated from a recent and robust survey over most of the range which estimated 340 displaying males&#160;(95% CI 162–597, Dutta <em>et al.</em> 2018). This excluded any birds in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh as the survey failed to locate any individuals (Dutta <em>et al. </em>2018), despite this 38-57 individuals (maximum 19 males) have been reported from these states for the 2018/2019 period (Pinjarkar 2018, Mishra &amp; Ghosh 2020). In addition, 6 males were present in Rollapadu Wildlife Sanctuary, Andhra Pradesh, in 2017, another region unsurveyed in the recent survey led by Dutta <em>et al. </em>(2018).&#160;Summing these values and assuming an equal sex ratio (a conservative assumption, as there may be multiple females per displaying male) the population size is therefore estimated to be 356-1,228 mature individuals, with a best estimate of 730 mature individuals.<br/>The methodology of the recent Dutta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2018) survey was designed to be comparable with that of Sankaran (2000), who estimated 3,530 mature individuals in 1999 (Sankaran 2000, Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). The population estimate in 1982 was 4,374 mature individuals (Collar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1994).&#160;Assuming a linear rate of decline from the 1999 estimate (Collar [2021] indicates the rate is likely to be accelerating), the rate of population reduction over the past three generations (15.9 years) is equivalent to 89%, however, calculating an accelerating rate of decline by incorporating the 2008 estimate of 2,500 mature individuals&#160;(Dutta <em>et al. </em>2013) results in an estimated 93% reduction over the past three generations. Both rate of declines indicate extinction within a few years, as noted by Collar (2021).<br/>The remaining strongholds are thought to be Velavadar (Gujarat), with 96-115 displaying males where the population is concentrated in few sites at high density, and and Shokalyia-Bhinai (Rajasthan). In Rajasthan the population is dispersed across a large area at very low density where 110-136 males were thought to be present (Dutta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018), however, only 35-40 displaying males are counted annually since 2017 (S. Narwade&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2021).&#160;<br/>Displaying males continue to be observed in Maharashtra, despite not being recorded during the 2018 survey (Dutta <em>et al. </em>2018). 7-8 males and 20-22 females were reported from a conservation partnership with the Phasepardhi community&#160;(Pandharipande 2015, Pinjarkar 2018). In Madhya Pradesh, annual numbers reported by the Chief Conservator of Forests for 2015 to 2018 were 48, 39, 19 and 27, but only 11 were recorded in 2019 (Mishra &amp; Ghosh 2020) and only 5 in 2020 (Tomar 2020): this population is in imminent danger of being lost.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Sypheotides indicus</em> breeds in <strong>India</strong> in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra,&#160;Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh (Raha and Prakash 2001, Kasambe and Gahale 2010, Bhardwaj <em>et al. </em>2011, Anon. 2014, P. Patil&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016), with some dispersal to south-east India in the non-breeding season. It is a very rare summer visitor (&lt;10 birds) to the terai of <strong>Nepal</strong>, although there have been no records for a few years and was formerly recorded more frequently, but may have only been an non-breeding visitor, dependent on monsoon rains (Inskipp <em>et al. </em>2016, C.

From 1982-1989, its population declined by nearly 60% (4,374-1,672 birds). However, by 1994, it had increased by 32% to 2,206 birds. These population fluctuations are directly correlated with breeding season rainfall patterns, indicating that it is susceptible to extinction in the event of severe, prolonged drought. Recent surveys have indicated an extremely rapid reduction that has continued and appears to have accelerated over the past 20 years (Collar 2021) with very few breeding birds noted in Madhya Pradesh (5 breeding males in 2020 [Tomar 2020]), 6 males in Andhra Pradesh in 2017 (Dutta <em>et al. </em>2018) and 7-8 males in Maharashtra (Pandharipande 2015, Pinjarkar 2018).

In Nepal, the species is protected at the national level (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012). In 1994, a conservation strategy was published, which proposed management recommendations for fodder-producing grasslands and increased protection for natural grasslands. In 1996, several sites in Rajasthan were identified for intensive conservation action. Two Lesser Florican sanctuaries exist: Sailana and Sardarpur, both in Madhya Pradesh (Rahmani 2006), and the Government of Madhya Pradesh has instigated as reward scheme for farmers who help to protect this species (V. Jain <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. The species occurs in a number of other protected areas.

In Europe, habitat loss through urbanisation, modification of agricultural practices, construction of roads, open-cast mining, agricultural expansion into steppe and grasslands and afforestation has caused a reduction in hunting areas and prey species. It also suffers from human disturbance, such as rock-climbers, pesticides, electrical powerlines and interspecific competition with Peregrine Falcon (<em>Falco peregrinus</em>) (Gustin <em>et al</em>. 2000; Di Vittorio <em>et al. </em>2017; De Rosa <em>et al. </em>2019). Local declines in southern Africa have possibly been associated with seed dressings, and whilst the overall effects of pesticides are unknown they have been shown to have negative impacts locally (Kemp 1994, Global Raptor Information Network 2015).

Birds occupying the mostly northerly regions (&gt;65°N), such as Alaska, northern Canada, Fennoscandia and northern Russia, migrate south. In the Nearctic there are southwards movements to southern Alaska and southwest USA in September, via regular flyways, in particular through southwest Alberta. In the Palearctic, movements occur in a broad front to wintering areas in southeast Europe, the Russian steppes, Mongolia, northern China and Japan. Juveniles and immatures will go as far as North Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Habitat </strong>The species occupies a wide range of flat or mountainous, largely open habitats, often above the tree line, from sea level to 4000m. In the Himalayas it has been recorded as high as 6200m (Watson, 2010).<strong> Diet </strong>The species’s diet is very broad, taking mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and carrion variously, depending on the regional prey availability. Prey taken are usually 0.5-4.0 kg and the species can hunt in pairs or small groups (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Breeding Site </strong>Nesting occurs on cliff ledges and where these are not available, in large trees or similar artificial structures. In central and southeastern Mongolia, birds regularly nest on the ground (Ellis 2020). Nests are constructed from sticks and are added to in successive years, growing to 2m in diameter. The breeding season spans March – August throughout the majority of its range, and in southern areas begins as early as November; whilst in the most northerly regions it will start as late as April (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).</p>","The species was heavily persecuted in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, and although this threat has diminished significantly with populations now generally stable, the species is still deliberately poisoned, shot and trapped (for example in landscapes dominated by grouse moors in Scotland [RSPB 2017]). In the past the species was affected by the use of organochlorine pesticides although this is not a significant problem today. There are, however, recent reports of high exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in the USA (Niedringhaus <em>et al. </em>2021). The relationship between stock grazing and Golden Eagle populations is complex - both undergrazing as a result of grassland abandonment and overgrazing have been reported as threats by various European countries (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Electrocution from power lines has been reported as one of the primary causes of anthropogenic mortality in North America - Golden Eagles regularly perch on distribution poles supporting energised equipment (Dwyer <em>et al. </em>2020), and the USFWS (2016) estimated that 504 Golden Eagles are electrocuted annually. Wind energy developments are a source of direct mortality for the species, particularly in California where wandering sub-adults are mostly affected (Watson 2010).&#160; Future developments in flyways may affect migrating adult eagles, and locally may cause effective habitat loss and lead to collisions (Katzner&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012b). In addition, afforestation, long term changes in food supply, including reduced livestock carrion through changing management practices, and climate change (for example drought [Smith <em>et al. </em>2020]) may threaten the species in future (Watson 2010). Within the Mediterranean region, declines in rabbit populations as a result of Viral Haemorrhagic Pneumonia may have a negative effect on productivity (Fernández 1993).","The Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020a) estimate the global population to be 130,000 individuals, which equates to approximately 87,100 mature individuals.

They begin their return journey in February and March, arriving in March and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Migration is generally on a broad front, although there is some concentration at a few sites (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). Hundreds of birds occasionally gather at roosting sites, sometimes with other harriers such as <em>C. pygargus</em>, but otherwise they are usually solitary, associating only temporarily at especially rich feeding sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They have a slightly greater tendency to be gregarious while on migration but the above still generally applies.

It relies heavily on soaring flight using thermals, and thus avoids large bodies of water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).

The latter is especially prevalent on migration, with possibly thousands of birds shot annually in Syria and Lebanon (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Deforestation is degrading breeding habitats (Dravecký <em>et al</em>. 2015), and disturbance caused by forestry workers reduces breeding success (Demerdzhiev&#160;<em>et al.</em>. 2019). Studies on habitat use in Estonia suggest that changes in agricultural practices, particularly a reduction in grassland, and an increasing sown area of oilseed rape and maize may degrade foraging habitat around breeding areas (Vali <em>et al. </em>2017). Abandonment of breeding territories has been linked to depopulation of rural areas leading to a decline in stock grazing, resulting in afforestation of grassland and a decline in rodent prey (Demerdzhiev <em>et al. </em>2019)<em>.</em>&#160;It is also very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (Strix 2012). Electrocution may pose an additional threat on migration and at wintering grounds, but this has not been well studied (Demerdzhiev &amp; Ratarova-Georgieva 2017).&#160;The Chernobyl nuclear accident may have affected the species (Alon 2000 in Global Raptor Information Network 2015). Construction of the new Istanbul airport could have an impact on the species (S. Oppel <em>in litt</em>. 2014). Egg collection for private collections has been recorded in Bulgaria (unpublished data, cited in Demerdzhiev&#160;<em>et al </em>2019)<em>.</em>&#160;Meyburg <em>et al </em>(2018) reported an incident in which a radio tagged Lesser-spotted Eagle was struck by an aircraft in Poland, suggesting that this may be an additional threat during migration.","The European population is estimated at 17,100-23,100 pairs, which equates to 34,200-46,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms approximately 73% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 46,800-63,300 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. A survey in 2014 counted 47,594 individuals in southern Turkey (S. Oppel&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2014). c.58,000 individuals were recorded in 2008 during migration counts over the Bosporus (Fülöp&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), and 51,850 were counted in 2014 at a migration bottleneck near Burgas, Bulgaria (Iankov <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;It is placed in the band 45,000 to 65,000 mature individuals.",Stable,,"Egg collection for private collections has been recorded in Bulgaria (unpublished data, cited in Demerdzhiev&#160;<em>et al&#160;</em>2019)<em>.</em>",Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation actions underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendix II, Raptors MOU Category 3, EU Birds Directive Annex I, Bern Convention Appendix II.

There are some areas where there may be local stability, and there is a paucity of information available regarding trends from the Asian portion of the species's range. Taking this information into account, overall declines are tentatively suspected to be rapid, and as such the species is listed as Vulnerable. Further information could show that the species warrants listing under a higher threat level.","<p><strong>Behaviour</strong> The species is resident across the Afrotropical, Indomalayan and fringing Palearctic regions (34°N to 31°S) but occurs in discrete populations. It is common across its range, and generally sedentary, although individuals are nomadic and will occasionally wander long distances. In West Africa individuals will make short distance seasonal movements south into the damper woodlands during October – November and return in April (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Habitat </strong>The species occupies dry open habitats from sea level to 3000m, and will occupy both woodland and wooded savannah. In India it can be found near cultivated areas, settlements and slaughterhouses (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Diet </strong>The species has a wide prey base, taking mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, and occasionally fish and amphibians. It will also regularly consume carrion and pirate other raptors’ prey (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).<strong> Breeding Site</strong> Nesting occurs on a large stick platform that may also incorporate animal bones, and is located on top of tall isolated trees or occasionally on top of a pylon. The breeding season in Africa spans March to August in the north, October to June in the West, April to January in central and southern areas, and year-round (but mainly May-November) in Kenya. In India the season spans November to August (Ferguson- Lees and Christie, 2001).</p>","The species has declined in the farmed areas of eastern and southern Africa, apparently as a result of consuming poisoned carcasses. Widespread poisoning of feral dogs in Ethiopia could then prove to be a major problem, in addition to private poisoning (E. Buechley <em>in litt. </em>2018). In western and north-east Africa declines have been reported but the causes are not known. In general the species’s opportunistic behaviour suggests it is resistant to the usual threats (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) although long term changes in rainfall patterns could affect the breeding success of the species in future (Wichmann <em>et al</em>. 2004). In South Africa it has been known to drown in farmland reservoirs (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1999) and birds have been killed through collisions with power lines (Global Raptor Information Network 2015, E. Buechley <em>in litt. </em>2018). Direct persecution and collisions with road vehicles when scavenging have also been identified as threats (Global Raptor Information Network 2015, M. Virani <em>in litt. </em>2018). Accidental poisoning has also been reported (Brown 1991) and while the impact of NSAIDs on this species is not clear, a congener, the Steppe Eagle (<em>Aquila nipalensis</em>), has recently been shown to be affected by diclofenac (Sharma&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).","<p>African Raptor DataBank data suggests that given available habitat, of varying suitability, there could be a population size of 73,860 pairs in Africa. Ferguson-Lees and Christie (2001) estimated a global population of 100,000-999,999 individuals, with the population in South Asia estimated at between 10,000-99,999 individuals.&#160;Therefore, the overall population size is placed here in the range 100,000-499,999 mature individuals.</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Aquila rapax </em>is a widespread raptor occurring over large areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, with isolated populations in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. Rapid declines in this species have been reported from across its African range, with the species having disappeared from areas such as coastal Gambia (C. Barlow&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2018). It has potentially gone extinct in southern Morocco (J.R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2018),&#160;and across Africa it is now becoming increasingly dependent on protected areas (e.g. Thiollay 2006, 2007, Virani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Simmons 2015, Taylor 2015). However, it does remain common in some areas, being the most common eagle in Ethiopia (E.

It is therefore listed as Vulnerable. <p></p> <p></p>,"It occurs in lowland forests near wetlands, nesting in different types of (generally tall) trees, depending on local conditions. Individuals wintering in the Mediterranean Basin preferentially use salt marshes, coastal lagoons and water courses (Maciorowski <em>et al. </em>2019). It feeds on unretrieved quarry, small mammals, waterbirds, frogs and snakes, hunting over swamps, wet meadows and, in Europe, over extensively managed agricultural land<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(A. Lõhmus <em>in litt.</em> 1999); birds soar to c.100 m high when hunting. It is a migratory species, with birds leaving their breeding grounds in October and November to winter in southern Europe, southern Asia and north-east Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). They tend to return in February and March. Birds migrate on a broad front, tending to pass in singles, twos and threes with the occasional larger group (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). They do not concentrate at bottleneck sites to the extent of many other raptors such as <em>Clanga pomarina</em> (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <br/><p></p>","There is strong evidence of hybridisation between this species and Lesser Spotted Eagle <em>Clanga pomarina</em><strong style=""""><sup> </sup></strong>(Bergmanis <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>1997; Lohmus and Vali 2001; Dombrovski 2002; Vali <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2010). In some European countries mixed pairs can constitute 50% of Greater Spotted Eagle pairs (Maciorowski and Mizera 2010) or even more (Vali 2011). It is unclear whether this represents a new phenomenon or a conservation concern, but <em>C</em><em style="""">. pomarina</em> is far more numerous than <em style="""">C. clanga</em> in the zone of overlap, and the range of <em style="""">C. pomarina</em> appears to be spreading east, further into the range of <em>C</em><em style="""">. clanga</em>. <br/><br/>Habitat destruction poses a significant threat, as suitable habitat mosaics of woodland and wetland have been lost as a result of deforestation and wetland drainage. In eastern Europe, agricultural intensification and the abandonment of traditional floodplain management have reduced foraging habitat quality (A. Lõhmus in litt. 1999).<em>&#160;</em>Deforestation in breeding areas poses a threat through loss of nesting sites - in an area in Russia where 40 pairs of Greater Spotted Eagles nested in 2012, half was cut down (I. Karyakin pers. comm. in Maciorowski <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Forestry operations are also a major cause of disturbance, as birds are intolerant of human presence in their territories (Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Drainage of wet woodland makes them more accessible to predators such as&#160;<em>Martes martes&#160;</em>(Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014)<em>.</em>Wintering habitats are also being lost - in Thailand, low intensity, rain-fed single crop rice are being replaced by multi-cropped intensive rice farms which are less suitable for foraging (P. D. Round <em>in litt.</em> 2016). <br/><br/>Shooting is a threat in Russia, the Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Africa (Brochet <em>et al. </em>2019; P. D. Round <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>1998, P. Mirski <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012), together with deliberate and accidental poisoning across much of its range (Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;The poaching of eggs and hatchlings for collectors is also a serious threat&#160;(Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). On migration and at wintering grounds, electrocution, collision with wind turbines, shooting and poisoning&#160;are major causes of mortality (Perlman and Granit 2012;&#160;Maciorowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Lead poisoning from consuming waterbirds is a threat in some areas, for example at wintering grounds in Spain (Perez-Garcia&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).<p></p>","In Europe, the   breeding population is estimated to number 960-1,300 breeding pairs, equating   to 1,900-2,500 individuals (BirdLife International In prep.). Europe forms 25-49%   of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population   size is 3,900-10,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. There is very little data available on population sizes further east in the species's range.

This negative trend is a result of a range of anthropogenic factors including electrocution on power lines, unsustainable capture for the falconry trade, as well as habitat  degradation and the impacts of agrochemicals, and the rate of decline appears to be particularly severe in the species's central Asian breeding grounds. This classification is highly uncertain and may be revised when new information becomes available. Surveys are urgently needed to produce more robust and less uncertain population estimates, in particular for China, Russia and Mongolia. Further research to monitor key populations and to clarify the extent of   anthropogenic threats and their effect on population trends is vital.<p></p>","It is physically adapted to hunting close to the ground in open terrain, combining rapid acceleration with high manoeuvrability, thus specialising on mid-sized diurnal terrestrial rodents (especially ground squirrels&#160;<em>Spermophilus</em>) of open grassy landscapes such as desert edge, semi-desert, steppes, agricultural and arid montane areas. In some areas, particularly near water and even in urban environments (A. Kovács <em>in litt. </em>2016), it switches to birds as key prey, and has recently substituted domestic pigeons for rodents in parts of Europe (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. It uses copses or cliffs for nest sites (sometimes even the ground), occupying the old nests of other birds (Baumgart 1991, <strong></strong>Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong>. Clutch size varies from three to five (exceptionally two to six), with means from 3.2-3.9 in different circumstances (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998, A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Breeding success varies with year (especially in areas where rodents cycle) (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The species usually occurs singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds are sedentary, part-migratory or fully migratory, largely depending on the extent to which food supply in breeding areas disappears in winter (Baumgart 1991, Snow and Perrins 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Migrant birds winter in East Africa, southern Europe and southern Asia, with 25-50% of the global population wintering on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2015b), and generally leave their breeding grounds in September and October, returning between February and May (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).<br/><p></p>","In Europe, this species has suffered mainly from&#160;electrocution on power lines and decreased prey availability due to&#160;the loss and degradation of steppes and dry grasslands through agricultural intensification, plantation establishment and declines in sheep pastoralism, while offtake for falconry has also been a serious problem, which has caused local extinctions in the past (Baumgart 1991, 1994, Kovács <em>et al. </em>2014,&#160;K. Ruskov <em>in litt. </em>2007, A. Kovács <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. In eastern Hungary, landscape reversion following the abandonment of agriculture could have a negative influence, as most prey species require short swards that are maintained by agricultural practices (S. Nagy <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Brochet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2019) estimated that 8% of the European population is illegally killed/ taken in Northern and Central Europe and the Caucasus each year. Deliberate shooting/ poisoning by pigeon keepers and unintentional or negligent poisoning through agriculture or hunting activities (e.g. rodenticides, poisoned baits, lead) poses a further threat.&#160;<br/><br/>Elsewhere, declines are mainly attributable to offtake for falconry (especially trapping of breeding birds), habitat change resulting in prey loss in Kazakhstan (Watson &amp; Clarke 2000) and electrocution on power lines (e.g. Dixon <em>et al. </em>2013, 2017),&#160;although persecution, pesticide use leading to secondary poisoning (notably in Mongolia in 2003) and agrochemical deployment play a lesser part (Baumgart 1991; Remple 1994; Barton 2000; Riddle 1994; Eastham <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 2000;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span>Fox 2002;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span><strong></strong><strong></strong>Haines 2002;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">&#160;</span>ERWDA 2003; Kovács&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). The number trapped annually for Middle East falconers has been estimated at 4,000 in Saudi Arabia, 1,000 in Qatar and 500-1,000 in each of Bahrain, Kuwait and U.A.E., which, allowing for a 5% mortality prior to receipt, indicates an annual consumption of 6,825-8,400 birds (Fox 2002, ERWDA 2003)<strong></strong>. Of these, the great majority (77%) were believed to be juvenile females, followed by 19% adult females, 3% juvenile males and 1% adult males, potentially creating a major bias in the wild population (Fox 2002, ERWDA 2003)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Other studies, however, give a far lower estimate for numbers legally trapped in Saudi Arabia, e.g. at an average of 22 birds per year in the period 2002-2009 (M. Shobrak <em>in litt. </em>2010); 19.7 individuals per year for period 1989-2013 to 575 individuals over period 1996-2013 (see Shobrak 2015). The Qinghai Wildlife Management Bureau estimate that at least 1,200 Saker Falcons per year are illegally trapped in Qinghai province, China (Zhang <em>et al. </em>2008). Illegal trapping has also been recorded in Jordan (Eid &amp; Handal 2018). Brochet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2019) estimated that 8% of the European population is illegally killed/ taken in Northern and Central Europe and the Caucasus each year. Electrocution is another significant cause of mortality - 1,721 electrocuted Saker Falcons were found during surveys in Mongolia during 2013-2015 and 2018, most of which were juveniles (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2020). It has been suggested that hybridisation with escaped or released hybrid falcons could influence the genetic integrity of wild populations (Nittinger <em>et al.</em> 2006), but risk is considered to be low (Dixon 2012). On the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau in China, policies to control rodents and herding practices, along with the development of hydroelectric dams and human settlements with electricity power infrastructure, have the potential to impact the population (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2016).

The number trapped annually for Middle East falconers has been estimated at 4,000 in Saudi Arabia, 1,000 in Qatar and 500-1,000 in each of Bahrain, Kuwait and U.A.E., which, allowing for a 5% mortality prior to receipt, indicates an annual consumption of 6,825-8,400 birds (Fox 2002, ERWDA 2003). Other studies, however, give a far lower estimate for numbers legally trapped in Saudi Arabia, e.g. at an average of 22 birds per year in the period 2002-2009 (M.

The Qinghai Wildlife Management Bureau estimate that at least 1,200 Saker Falcons per year are illegally trapped in Qinghai province, China (Zhang&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). Illegal trapping has also been recorded in Jordan (Eid and Handal 2018). Brochet <em>et al. </em>(2019) estimated that 8% of the European population is illegally killed/ taken in Northern and Central Europe and the Caucasus each year.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>This is a protected and Red-listed species in many range states, particularly in the western parts of its range (Baumgart 1991, 1994). It is listed on CMS Appendix I and II (as of November 2011, and excluding the Mongolian population) and CITES Appendix II, and in 2002 CITES imposed a trade ban on UAE, strongly affecting the unregulated market there (Fox 2002)<strong></strong>. It occurs in a number of protected areas across its range. Intensive wardening and management has produced a steadily rising population in Hungary (Baumgart 1994). Controls of illegal trade were implemented in various countries in western range in 1990s (Baumgart 1994)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding has developed strongly in some countries, including UAE, as a means of substituting farmed for wild-caught birds (Riddle and Remple 1994, Dixon, 2012, N. Fox <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2002). Clinics have also been set up to improve the longevity and availability of wild-caught birds in various Gulf states (Riddle and Remple 1994, Bailey <em>et al. </em>2001<strong></strong>). New research programmes in many parts of the range have begun to establish baseline data on distribution, population, ecology and threats. For instance, satellite tracking of individuals is taking place, with the aim of revealing movements and site use (e.g. Bagyura&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012,&#160;Gamauf and Dosedel 2012, Prommer&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).&#160;Artificial nests have been erected in some areas, and in particular in Mongolia, &gt;5,000 artificial nests were erected with funding from the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi,  providing nesting sites for 766 pairs by 2014 (Bagyura <em>et al. </em>2012; Rahman <em>et al. </em>2014; Dixon 2015; Dixon 2011); and this programme in Mongolia led to the production of &gt;10,000 fledglings since 2011 (A. Dixon <em>in litt. </em>2021). Over 10,000 artificial nests and perches have been erected by Chinese authorities on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as part of measures to control Plateau Pikas. chicks in 2013 (Middle East Falcon Research Group 2013). As a product of the resolution resulting from CMS COP10 in November 2011, a Saker Falcon Task Force was established and met for the first time in March 2012 in Abu Dhabi (UAE). A Global Action Plan for the Saker Falcon was produced in 2014 (Kovács&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Conservation efforts in Europe have resulted in positive population trends (A. Dixon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in <em>litt</em></span><em>. </em>2012). A captive-breeding and release programme is being implemented in Bulgaria to restore the extirpated breeding population (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2019a). 80 Saker Falcons were released during the period 2015-2020, and the first successful breeding in the wild was confirmed in 2018 (Lazarova <em>et al. </em>2021).&#160;Trials of mitigation techniques to reduce electrocution rates have been implemented at power lines in Mongolia (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2018, 2019b), with further proposals to implement retrofitting at a national scale in the country. CMS Raptors MoU, IUCN, BirdLife International and International Association for Falconry and Conservation of Birds of Prey launched an information portal and online survey in 2015, which was updated to a 10-language network with regional satellites in 2019, and has had 16,000 visitors (www.sakernet.org).&#160;<br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Implement the Saker Global Action Plan through strong stakeholder collaboration within the Saker Falcon Adaptive Management Framework (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Maintain or implement programmes of population and habitat management throughout the range, and ensure that legislation is appropriate and effective to prevent overharvest (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Maintain or improve systems of wardening and customs control (including DNA sampling to check provenance of traded birds). Enforce CITES regulations, particularly in the Middle East and Asia. Improve exportation standards including meeting IATA transportation specifications. Improve import regulations, staff capacity and practices (quarantine facilities). Monitor markets to quantify falcon trade. Develop existing microchipping schemes to help monitor and regulate trade and quantify its effects. Increase awareness of health and conservation issues among falconers. Continue key biological research (Baumgart 1991, 1994), such as&#160;studying, monitoring and censusing the species throughout its range.&#160;This may also include further studying of migration routes, changes in metapopulations, as well as investigating the degree of impact anthropogenic activities (other than trapping for trade) have on this species (Kovács&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Continue to establish controlled artificial nest systems where safe nest sites are limited to increase breeding population and breeding success (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;Falcon health care and controlled releases/reintroduction may reduce the pressure on wild Saker Falcon populations and thereby play an important role in the recovery of the species (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), and a pilot release project has been completed in Bulgaria to restore an extirpated population (Dixon <em>et al. </em>2019a). Maintain ecologically and socially sustainable grazing systems to ensure long-term survival of key prey species. Bring greater protection (against conversion, degradation and pollution) to key breeding environments (Baumgart 1991, Bailey <em>et al. </em>2001, Fox 2002, <strong></strong>ERWDA 2003)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Ensure that new and fully reconstructed electric lines are safe for birds by design, and modify existing high-risk poles to be safe for birds with the most cost-effective mitigation measures (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;Raise the awareness of stakeholders about the risks of bird - power line interactions, bird friendly designs, their quality applications and priorities for mitigation (A. Kovács&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;Review and improve the legal protection of the Saker Falcon where it is necessary to protect it from unintentional or deliberate killing and disturbance where it is considered detrimental (A.

Analysis of estimates from 334 localities across their global range indicates a reduction of more than 50% of the continental population in the past three generations (75 years) that is understood to be continuing and likely irreversible. The continental trend is not, however, spatially uniform; some subpopulations are increasing or stable while others are declining significantly faster than the continental rate. Many local subpopulations have been extirpated.<br/><br/>A generation length (GL) of 25 years is used; calculated in the standard format as the average age of mothers in the population (IUCN SPC 2019, p. 29). This figure is based on analysis of the life table of culled Savanna Elephant family groups in South Africa (Whyte 2001) and a 14-year study of Savanna Elephants in Kenya (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2013) which generated a range of 24.1–25 years.<br/><br/>Subcriterion A2 is applied because some of the major causes for population reduction, such as habitat loss due to human population expansion, have not ceased and are projected to increase in coming decades as well as unlikely to be reversible. The population reduction assessment for subcriterion A2 (considering three generations back) is inferred from published survey data using a modelling approach described in the Supplementary Information document. Density and distribution estimates for the African Savanna Elephant vary in methodology, completeness, regularity, date of first survey and confidence limits. Few credible estimates exist prior to the 1970s, and there is no credible estimate for the continental population more than two generations back. For this Red List assessment, an attempt was made to model the data three generations back to 1940 (see the attached Supplementary Information for description of data that is current as of and up to the end of 2015); however, given the sparseness of information available to inform the model, such modelling was of limited value. Therefore, rather than projecting declines well beyond the available data, we made the assumption that the continental African Savanna Elephant population of three generations back (1940) was equal to that of two generations back (i.e., 1965). Additional assumptions, necessary to fill gaps in the dataset, are detailed in the attached Supplementary Information document.<br/><br/>Subcriterion A3 has not been applied, because although the major threats to the species are known, projecting the level of such threats 25 or more years into the future (i.e., three generations, up to a maximum of 100 years) would likely introduce high levels of uncertainty.<br/><br/>An assessment of population reduction according to subcriterion A4 considering two generations back and one forward is in progress by this team of Assessors (Edwards <em>et al</em>. in prep.). Analysis of poaching and human influence in the recent past and anticipated in the future based upon available data of two representative indices (i.e., proportion of illegal killed elephants (PIKE) and the human footprint index) are being included as covariates in the projection.<br/><br/>Criteria B, C and D are not relevant to the threatened status as the species currently occupies more than 20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and there are more than 10,000 mature individuals. No quantitative analysis of the probability of extinction in the wild was conducted, and therefore criterion E does not apply.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Previous Assessments of African Elephant:<br/></strong>This is the first assessment of the African Savanna Elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) as a species separate from the African Forest Elephant (<em>L. cyclotis</em>).<br/><br/>The African Elephant, as a single species, was listed as Vulnerable (VU A2a) in the 2004 and 2008 updates of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, under the same IUCN Categories and Criteria used in this assessment (Version 3.1; IUCN 2001).<br/><br/>Previously the African Elephant, as a single species, was listed as Endangered (EN A1b) under the IUCN Categories and Criteria Version 2.3 (IUCN 1994), in an assessment conducted in 1996 by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group.</p>","<p>African Savanna Elephants are found over a wide latitudinal range between the northern tropics in Mali (16° North) to the southern temperate zone (34° South) in South Africa. They occupy a variety of habitats ranging from montane forest, miombo and mopane woodland, thicket, savanna and grasslands to arid deserts and a wide altitudinal range from mountain slopes to oceanic beaches.<br/><br/>See also the list of habitats.<br/><br/>African Savanna Elephants are capable of moving long distances and naturally do so in arid ecosystems and in response to climatic conditions (e.g., seasonality and drought). Depending on productivity, and water availability African Savanna Elephants demonstrate range residence, migratory, semi-migratory and near nomadic movement patterns in different regions of the continent. Home range sizes vary by several orders of magnitude primarily in relation to plant productivity and human activity in different ecosystems (Loarie <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wall <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thirty African Savanna Elephant subpopulations (eight of which number more than 1,000 individuals) span international boundaries, including the more than 200,000 elephants in the five-country Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017, KAZA Secretariat 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services:<br/></strong>Ecosystem services provided by African Savanna Elephants vary and depend to a large extent on the ecosystem (forest, savanna, grassland or desert), specific conditions on the ground and the geographical context under consideration. In general, they play an important ecological role as bulk processors of plant material (Owen-Smith 1989). In savannas, African Savanna Elephants are manipulators of woody vegetation structure which in turn influences the tree to grass ratio with knock-on consequences for the fire regime and potentially species composition in the area (Dublin <em>et al</em>. 1990, Augustine and McNaughton 2004, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2008, Holdo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, Goheen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Pringle <em>et al</em>. 2016). Where they are associated with wetlands African Savanna Elephants can be important in maintaining channels and open water ways. Soil fertility can be maintained by the transport of nutrients by large herbivores from nutrient rich sources (e.g., eutrophic soils in flood plains and termite mounds) to dystrophic soils (e.g., upland miombo woodlands) (Cumming <em>et al</em>. 1997, Doughty <em>et al</em>. 2016, Malhi <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p><br/>The charismatic nature of African Savanna Elephants plays an important role in attracting tourism into national parks. They also hold important symbolic significance within the cultures of many African communities. African Savanna Elephants are one of the few iconic species that occur in the majority of African countries, and innumerable stories, songs, and cultural traditions revolve around them.</p>","Poaching of African Savanna Elephants for ivory is a major cause of individual death and population decline (Wittemyer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). After a sustained period of intense poaching between the late 1970s and 1989, many African Savanna Elephant populations (e.g., in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda) experienced two to three decades of recovery. Some northern African Savanna Elephant populations, however, experienced persistent poaching pressure through the last three decades (Bouche <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012). Data collected as a part of the CITES Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants programme (MIKE), indicate that poaching significantly intensified across the continent starting in 2008 and peaking in 2011 – an unsustainably high level of poaching has continued into current times in some areas of the continent (CITES 2018, 2019), and may be increasing in some of the historically less-affected southern African populations (CITES 2018, 2019). Rapid land use change by humans is driving the direct loss and fragmentation of habitat for African Savanna Elephants and is an increasing threat to populations across their range (Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016, Mpakairi <em>et al</em>. 2019). Land conversion is a product of the ongoing expansion of the human population and associated agriculture and infrastructure development, which in turn are driven by economic and technological advances. A manifestation of this trend is the reported increase in human-elephant conflict (e.g., Pozo <em>et al</em>. 2018). Human population growth projections suggest land conversion will accelerate rapidly in the coming decades across Africa (see <a href=""http://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/"">https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/</a>) which will likely increase this threat.","<p>Over the past century, African Savanna Elephant subpopulations have declined across most of their range. The African Elephant Status Report 2016&#160;estimated a continental population of 415,428 (+/- 95% C.I. 20,111) for both African Savanna and African Forest Elephants combined and reported a continental decline of approximately 111,000 elephants since 2006 (Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). For a similar time period, following a survey of approximately 90% of their range, a decline of 30% of African Savanna Elephants was reported (Chase <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p><br/>For further information about this species, see the attached Supplementary Information document.</p><p><em></em></p>",Decreasing,"<p>African Savanna Elephants once occurred across all of Africa (Sikes 1971) and currently are found in 24 countries (see range map). Although knowledge of African Savanna Elephant distribution varies spatially and temporally, it is evident that the species’ distribution is retracting and becoming increasingly fragmented across their range in the continent. African Savanna Elephants occupy an estimated 15% of their historic pre- agricultural range (Chase <em>et al</em>. 2016). African Savanna Elephants are considered nationally extirpated in Burundi and Mauritania. In Eswatini, the once extirpated population has been re-established through reintroductions that began in the 1980s. Recent range expansion is evident in Kenya and Botswana (Douglas-Hamilton 1979; Said <em>et al</em>. 1995; Barnes <em>et al</em>. 1998; Blanc <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2007; Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The species' range map associated with this assessment is complete with the exception that some small private reserves in South Africa with less than 50 elephants each are absent as they were excluded from the African Elephant Database due to concerns about the census techniques.</p>","<strong>Ivory:</strong> Use of African Savanna Elephant ivory is entrenched in numerous cultures across the globe, primarily for ornamental and decorative items. Historically, demand for African Savanna Elephant ivory has been high in Europe, the USA and Asia. For example, beginning in the 1920s, Japanese carvers turned to African elephant ivory as Asian supplies diminished through the 1970s when Japan accounted for about 40% of the global ivory market (Martin 1986; Nishihara 2003, 2012).<br/><br/>In 1989, the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) banned the international commercial trade of ivory in response to a steep decline in African elephants across a substantial portion of their range. Thereafter, two CITES-sanctioned sales of national ivory stockpiles occurred in 2002 and 2008 with Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa selling ivory to China and Japan. At the same time, a nine-year moratorium (ending in 2017) on any new ivory sale proposals from the four African countries followed (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>). In the 2000s, Chinese demand for ivory greatly surpassed that of Japan where demand for ivory appeared to substantially decline (CITES 2014). As a consequence, prices rose steeply in China and in Africa (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Debates about the benefits and consequences of the sale of national ivory stockpiles are highly polarized with limited consensus (Stiles 2004, 't Sas-Rolfes <em>et al</em>. 2014, Bennett 2015, Biggs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Analysis of ivory seizure data indicates that the volume of illegally trafficked ivory has increased substantially since 2006 (Underwood <em>et al</em>. 2013; Milliken 2016; CITES 2018, 2019). Undercover investigations and DNA forensics point to the laundering of illegal ivory in legal domestic ivory markets. Seizure analyses indicate that the majority of illegally trafficked ivory is destined for Asia, especially China, Viet Nam and Thailand (CITES 2016, 2018 and 2019; Lui 2015; Krishnasamy 2016). In response to this and other concerns, China closed its legal domestic ivory market in 2017; Hong Kong SAR took steps to do the same by 2021 (<a href=""http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm"">https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm</a>), and Thailand tightened its domestic Asian Elephant ivory trade regulations in 2015 (<a href=""http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.htm"">http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.html</a>). A substantial drop in ivory prices in mainland China has been associated with this action (Vigne and Martin 2017, Meijer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Significant illegal ivory markets remain in several Southeast Asian countries, such as Lao PDR and Viet Nam (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>; Vigne and Martin 2017).<br/><strong><br/>Non-consumptive Tourism:&#160;</strong>African Savanna Elephants have significant tourism draw for wildlife watching and photographic tourism throughout their range substantially contributing to local economies (Naidoo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Tourism operations occur in national and local government protected areas, as well as on land under private or communal tenure.<br/><br/><strong>Trophy Hunting:</strong>&#160;In some range states sport hunting of African Savanna Elephants is legally permitted and forms an integral element of those countries’ wildlife management and community support programs (e.g., Naidoo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe have trophy hunting industries and in 2020 applied to CITES for a combined quota of 2,404 tusks <a href=""http://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php"">(https://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php</a> Accessed 16 August 2020). Depending on the governance and management structures, government bodies, private operations and local communities derive revenue from trophy hunting.<br/><br/><strong>Other Trade:</strong> A legal domestic trade in African Savanna Elephant hides is present in South Africa. There have been limited reports of African Savanna Elephant poaching for other body parts beyond ivory, such as meat, bone, skin and hair (Blignaut <em>et al</em>. 2008). International live trade in African Savanna Elephants occurs between South Africa and other countries, mainly in an effort to re-establish or fortify dwindling populations in some protected areas. Live trade in young African Savanna Elephants from Zimbabwe (Russo and Cruise 2016) and Eswatini (Madowo 2019) to Asia and elsewhere for zoological collections also occurs. Controversy surrounds these transactions as the conservation benefit to the species has been questioned. Domestic trade in African Savanna Elephants exists in South Africa at a low level for reintroduction purposes between reserves (Pretorius <em>et al</em>. 2018).",Terrestrial,"<p>The African Savanna Elephant was listed in CITES Appendix I in 1989 when all African elephants were considered a single species. Subsequently, the populations of Botswana (1997), Namibia (1997), South Africa (2000) and Zimbabwe (1997) were transferred to Appendix II, each with specific annotations. These annotations have been recently replaced by a single annotation for all four countries, with specific sub-annotations for the populations of Namibia and Zimbabwe. A separate CITES listing for each species has not occurred yet because a formal designation as two separate species (i.e.,&#160;<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>L. cyclotis</em>) is still in progress.<br/><br/>The African Elephant Action Plan (AEAP; developed and adopted by African elephant range countries) was adopted by CITES in March 2010 and is a statement by all range countries regarding the most important and immediate activities which require implementation and funding if Africa’s elephants are to be conserved. The African Elephant Fund was established to support the implementation of the African Elephant Action Plan. It should be noted that the AEAP does not distinguish different taxa of African elephant. The African Savanna Elephants which occur in transboundary populations introduce complications (e.g., matters of sovereignty) when considering national populations for CITES purposes (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>A number of CITES-initiated instruments were created to monitor and combat illegal trade in ivory. The CITES MIKE programme, which was established in 2002, has 66 designated sites across African elephant range and provides the most detailed and reliable data available on continental poaching pressure (CITES 2018, 2019); this includes 39 sites in 18 range countries of the African Savanna Elephant (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/prog/mike"">https://cites.org/eng/prog/mike</a>, Accessed 16 August 2020). Eswatini, South Sudan, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia do not have MIKE sites for their African Savanna Elephants. The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), established in 1996, is managed by TRAFFIC as a comprehensive information system for tracking illegal trade in ivory and other elephant products (CITES 2016, 2019). At a national level National Ivory Action Plans (NIAPs) are a tool designed to track significant and timely action to combat the illegal trade in ivory. Currently 24 African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries, as identified by ETIS analyses, are required to produce and implement a NIAP (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/niaps"">https://cites.org/eng/niaps</a>, Accessed 16 August 2020); 11 of these are range countries of the African Savanna Elephant.<br/><br/>At a national level the African Savanna Elephant is subject to varying degrees of legal protection in the 23 range states, with most countries granting the species the highest protection status. Providing this protection is complicated by the fact that over half of the species’ range may extend beyond the boundaries of protected areas (Taylor 2009). This point is emphasized by the evidence that the degree of protection is an important predictor of African Savanna Elephant’s presence and density (de Boer <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Conservation measures usually include habitat management and protection through policy, legislation and law enforcement. Successful anti-poaching and management at a site level has contributed to the re-establishment or recovery of a number of populations of African Savanna Elephants. In instances where protection efforts have failed, the African Savanna Elephant population was reduced by 70% or more in a matter of a decade (Chase <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the context where management culling was undertaken (mainly southern Africa) up until the late 1980s or early 1990s, culling has largely ceased and population density management is being attempted through actions such as translocation, contraception and range manipulation such as closure of artificial water point (Scholes and Mennell 2008). Fire management is being attempted in some transboundary situations to mitigate further habitat and/or woodland modification as a consequence of African Savanna Elephant activity (Starfield <em>et al</em>. 1993, Mapaure 2013, Eastment 2020).&#160;</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Overall it is suspected to have undergone a very rapid decline of 63-89% over three generations owing to intentional and unintentional poisoning, habitat loss and conversion to agro-pastoral systems, declines in wild ungulate populations, hunting for trade and collisions. These declines are likely to continue into the future. For this reason it is listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><p></p>","<em>Gyps africanus </em>is primarily a lowland species of open wooded savanna, particularly areas of <em>Acacia</em>. It requires tall trees for nesting, but has also been recorded nesting on electricity pylons in South Africa (de Swardt 2013). It is a gregarious species congregating at carcasses, in thermals and at roost sites. It nests in loose colonies. <p></p>","The species faces similar threats to other African vultures, being susceptible to habitat conversion to agro-pastoral systems, loss of wild ungulates leading to a reduced availability of carrion, hunting for trade, persecution and poisoning (see Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160; <br/><br/>In East Africa, the primary issue is poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide carbofuran), which occurs primarily   outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>species and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. rueppellii </span>puts them at significant risk, as this means they inevitably spend  considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010,   Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Kendall and  Virani 2012). Hunting with lead ammunition may also be incidentally contributing to species mortality (Naidoo <em>et al. </em>2017, Garbett <em>et al. </em>2018). Evidence from wing-tagging and telemetry  studies suggests that  annual mortality, primarily from incidental  poisoning, can be as high as  25% for the species&#160;(Kendall and Virani 2012). Cases across Africa suggest that the species may be subject to deliberate and accidental poisoning, respectively (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada<em> et al. </em>2016b): in the former case for belief-based use and to prevent birds from drawing attention to poaching activities. Mass poisoning events include at least 144 White-backed Vultures killed after feeding on an elephant carcass in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012 (Groom <em>et al</em>. 2013); 76 died after feeding on 6 poisoned lion carcasses near Ruaha National Park, Tanzania in March 2018 (SSC<em>&#160;</em>2018); 468 died after feeding on 3 elephant carcasses in Botswana in June 2019 (BirdGuides 2019). Modelling has shown that even one poisoned elephant carcass can have a dramatic impact on a population (Murn and Botha 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007), and the decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria has been attributed to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P. Hall&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2011). The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa, with an estimated 924-1,386 individuals traded over a six year period in West Africa, probably representing a significant proportion of the species's regional population (Buij&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). In South Africa, White-backed Vulture is one of the preferred vulture species in trade, according to a survey of traditional healers and traders (McKean&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). As a result of this and environmental pressures, it is predicted that the population in Zululand could become locally extinct in 26 years, unless harvest rates have been underestimated, in which case local extinction could be 10-11 years away (McKean and Botha 2007)<strong></strong>.&#160; There is also evidence that it is captured for international trade; for example in 2005, 13 individuals of this species being kept illegally in Italy were reportedly confiscated (F. Genero<em>&#160;in litt.</em>&#160;2005)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>In 2007, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, and which is fatal to&#160;<em>Gyps&#160;</em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses, was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. It was also reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>2007)<strong></strong>&#160;and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. However, given that livestock carrion is not generally left out for scavenger consumption, this is likely to have less of an impact than it has in south-east Asia (C. Kendall&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/>Electrocution on powerlines is also a problem in parts of its range, and it is vulnerable to nest harvesting or disturbance by humans (Bamford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009); perhaps more so than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. rueppellii</span>, as it breeds in trees rather than on inaccessible cliffs (C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Additionally, the wild ungulate populations on which this species relies have declined precipitously throughout West and East Africa, even in protected areas (Western&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009, Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), and, despite increased livestock numbers, improved animal husbandry and carcass disposal has reduced the number of livestock carcasses available (Mundy <em>et al. </em>1992). There is also a minor threat from road traffic, with individuals occasionally killed by vehicles (BirdLife Botswana 2008). Reported threats in the Athi-Kaputiei area in Kenya (an important breeding site for the species) include wind energy development, illegal logging of large trees (although Kendall <em>et al. </em>[2017] concluded that tree availability was not a limiting factor for vultures breeding in Masai Mara National Reserve), and natural gas exploration (Shema 2019).&#160;<p></p>","The species's global population was estimated at 270,000 individuals in 1992 (Mundy <em>et al. </em>1992), but it may now be more than an order of magnitude lower than this due to rapid population declines in recent years (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). The median estimate of the rate of decline, 4.1% annually (2.5-5.4%) (Ogada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016a), is equivalent to a three generation reduction of 81% (63-89%).",Decreasing,"This species is the most widespread and common vulture in Africa, although it is now undergoing rapid declines. It occurs from <strong>Senegal, Gambia</strong> and <strong>Mali</strong> in the west, throughout the Sahel region to <strong>Ethiopia</strong> and <strong>Somalia</strong> in the east, through East Africa into <strong>Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia</strong> and <strong>South Africa</strong> in the south. Its global population has been estimated at 270,000 individuals. Consistent with other vulture species, it has declined by over 90% in West Africa (<strong></strong>J. M. Thiollay <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, and it has largely disappeared from northern <strong>Cameroon </strong>(P. Hall <em>in litt</em>. 2016), <strong>Ghana</strong> apart from Mole National Park (Dowsett-Lemaire and Dowsett 2014), <strong>Niger</strong> (no records away from W National Park since 1997, J.

Simmons <em>in litt.</em> 2006, W. Goodwin <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. An ongoing study near Kimberley, South Africa, shows the number of breeding pairs has increased by 72% in 22 years (from 50 to 86 breeding pairs) (A. Anthony <em>in litt</em>. 2015). However McKean <em>et al</em>. (2013) suggest that if current levels of exploitation continue in South Africa, the species could become locally extinct by 2034 or sooner.&#160;Overall, it is suspected to have declined very rapidly throughout its global range.<p></p>","In southern Africa, vultures are caught and consumed for perceived medicinal and psychological benefits (McKean and Botha 2007), and the decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria has been attributed to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju practices (P.

The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). The species occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range, and ongoing monitoring efforts are underway in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Namibia, Ethiopia, and Botswana with plans to extend these to Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (BirdLife Botswana 2008, C. Kendall&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/>In 2007, a survey began to establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in Tanzania (Woodford <em>et al. </em>2008)<strong></strong>, and in 2008 an awareness-raising campaign at a conference of the World Organisation for Animal Health in Senegal led to a resolution being adopted unanimously by more than 160 delegates to ""request members to consider their national situation with the aim to seek measures to find solutions to the problems caused by the administration of diclofenac in livestock"" (C. Bowden&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.&#160;</span>2008, Woodford&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2008). A press release was also circulated in July 2007 to raise awareness of the impacts of hunting for medicinal and cultural reasons in southern Africa (McKean and Botha 2007), while&#160;BirdLife Botswana have launched a campaign to tackle illegal poisoning (Anon. 2013). At the 2014 Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Migratory Species, a set of guidelines to address poisoning was formally adopted (Ogada <em>et al</em>. 2016a). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are  currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning  teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to respond  to a neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Since 2015, more than 1,500 rangers, veterinarians, police and other law enforcement and conservation staff have been trained in poisoning response and intervention in 10 countries, and initial results suggest that this can reduce vulture mortality by up to 30% (SSC<em>&#160;</em>2018).<br/><br/>The species is listed as nationally Critically Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Allan<em> </em>2015), and Endangered in Uganda and Namibia (Brown and Simmons 2015, WCS 2016).<br/><strong></strong><br/><br/><strong>Conservation&#160;</strong><strong>and Research&#160;</strong><strong>Actions Proposed<br/></strong>As part of the Multi-species Action Plan for African-Eurasian Vultures, over 120 key actions were put forward (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). Of these, 117 are considered relevant to African species. Full details for these can be found in Table 6 of Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017), but those actions considered 'Essential' by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) are presented here.<br/><br/>The two objectives with the most essential actions are to address knowledge gaps, and to reduce vulture unintentional mortality caused by the hunting of vertebrates. Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) say that the essential actions when trying to address knowledge gaps are to monitor the population sizes, distributions and trends; conduct a study to put a value on the ecosystem services and eco-tourism benefits vultures provide; and develop criteria for Vulture Safe Zones and implement these throughout the range states of the MsAP. To address the objective to reduce unintentional vulture mortality, Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) suggest an overall analysis of poisoning's role in human-wildlife conflict, focusing on vultures; further awareness campaigns; training of staff to rapidly respond to poisoning incidents; and review and enforce penalties for wildlife poisoning, and if necessary introduce new penalties.<br/><br/>Further objectives also look into combating vulture mortality due to a range of factors. To combat the threat from NSAIDs, the essential actions proposed by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) are to prohibit the use of vulture-toxic NSAIDs in livestock and substitute them for vulture-friendly alternatives; and develop and implement a formal process to identify whether veterinary NSAIDs are toxic prior to them going on the market. For the threat from lead poisoning, the essential action proposed by Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) is to implement CMS Resolution 11.15 as well as encouraging the voluntary uptake of lead ammunition bans in countries not part of CMS. In order to combat the threats from illegal trade and sentinel poisoning awareness and engagement programmes with stakeholders and training of rapid response units, respectively, have been proposed as essential actions (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017; Murn and Botha 2018). There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies (Craig <em>et al. </em>2018). The threats from infrastructure (collisions and electrocution) have similar essential actions, which are to conduct sensitivity mapping exercises to identify key regions; and promoting CMS guidelines to reduce mortality due to these threats (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>Finally, Botha <em>et al. </em>(2017) recommend as an essential action the establishment of a framework to effectively implement the MsAP, including both global and regional coordination units, which may be key to implementing not only these other essential actions, but as many of the other high and medium priority actions laid out in the action plan.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It feeds on carrion, both putrid and fresh. While feeding considerable aggregations can form, and regular communal roost sites are used. It is social and usually found in conspecific flocks. It breeds in colonies in tall trees (e.g. in Himanchal Pradesh it is restricted to pine forest/plantations [Thakur 2015, M. Thakur <em>in litt. </em>2016]), often near human habitation. Movements are poorly known, although satellite-tagged birds have shown that they will forage over a vast range. The degree of connectivity of apparently separate populations is not known. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, as they were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in South Asia. <p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported&#160;(Prakash <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2007, Gilbert <em>et al.</em> 2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume. Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs which then cause&#160;renal failure resulting in visceral gout in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a<strong></strong>, Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Green <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;<strong></strong>Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014). Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in <em>Gyps</em> vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (<strong></strong>Green <em>et al</em>. 2004);&#160;and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality and diclofenac being banned in several range states, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Paudel 2008)<strong></strong>, potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam,&#160;an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan <em>et al. </em>2006a, Swarup <em>et al. </em>2007).&#160;Additionally, large vials of diclofenac continue to be manufactured for human use, which are then distributed, sold and used for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;A second veterinary drug in use in India and particularly in Bangladesh, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo <em>et al.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Nambirajan <em>et al. in prep.&#160;</em>2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla <em>et al. </em>2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). One study recorded that the sex of fledglings, the sex of dead adults and the sex of adults with visceral gout were all male-biased which may lead to problems in the future (Arshad&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>Other likely contributory factors in South Asia are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers) and poison and pesticide use, but these are probably of more minor significance (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;&#160;In Bangladesh, 61% of cattle owners surveyed said that they now buried dead cattle or used them as food in shrimp farms, which could lead to a reduction in food supply for vultures (Khan 2013). Forest fires may also be a threat in some areas, for instance in the Himalayas, though this may need further study (M. Thakur <em>in litt. </em>2016). Deforestation, electrocution and collision with energy infrastructure may pose additional threats in some parts of the range (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of deceased livestock reducing food availability (Clements <em>et al</em>. 2013)<strong></strong>. In Cambodia, vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides to kill stray dogs and for hunting wildlife (Loveridge <em>et al. </em>2019; Clements <em>et al. </em>2013; S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). Loveridge <em>et al </em>(2019) recorded 15 vulture poisoning events in Cambodia during 2005-2016, resulting in the known deaths of 32 White-rumped Vultures. The same study also recorded the first confirmed vulture mortality from carbofuran in Cambodia. Additional threats identified in Myanmar include direct persecution of the species through nest destruction, hunting and poisoning and indirectly through a loss of food supply (Hla <em>et al</em>. 2011).<p></p>","Formerly described as possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world, with a global population almost certainly numbering several million individuals, this species suffered dramatic population declines during the 1990s across its range. There are now an estimated c.6,000 individuals in India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2019), &lt;2,000 individuals in Nepal (DNPWC 2015), c.100 individuals in Cambodia (Sum and Loveridge 2016), c.260 individuals in Bangladesh (MoEF 2016) and 250-350 individuals in Bhutan and Pakistan (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). The total population is therefore estimated to be c. 6,000-9,000 individuals, equating to 4,000-6,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps bengalensis</em> occurs in <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, <strong>Nepal</strong>, <strong>Bhutan</strong>, <strong>Myanmar</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong>, <strong>Laos</strong>, <strong>Cambodia</strong> and southern<strong> Viet Nam, </strong>and may be extinct in<strong> </strong>southern<strong> </strong>China and Malaysia (BirdLife International 2001). It has been recorded from south-east Afghanistan and Iran where its status is currently unknown. As recently as 1985 the species was described as ""possibly the most abundant large bird of prey in the world"" (Houston 1985)<strong></strong>. However, it disappeared from most of South-East Asia in the early 20th century and the only viable populations in the region are found in Myanmar and Cambodia, mainly in the north (both probably in the low hundreds of individuals) (Hla 2003, Anon 2003, 2005, Eames 2007a,b, Hance 2009)<strong></strong>. Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in this part of its range is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005),&#160;as well as the impact of poisoning events as an accidental consequence of local hunting and fishing practises (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Since the mid-1990s, it has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 99%) across the Indian Subcontinent (the majority of its historic range), first noticed&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">by villagers in northern India in 1996-97 (A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016), with further early evidence from&#160;Keoladeo National Park, India, and then throughout India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2003, 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, Pakistan (Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006),&#160;Nepal (Baral <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012) and Bangladesh (Khan 2013)<strong></strong>, to the point that the species is highly threatened with extinction. Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a,<strong></strong> Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004<strong></strong><em></em>)<strong></strong>. This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, 2004b; Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, <strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Declines in India between 2000 and 2007 averaged 43.9% per year (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>, and ranged between 11%-61% in Punjab province, Pakistan over the same period (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, while surveys of 23 known colonies in Punjab province in 2006 found a total of only 37 breeding pairs (Murn <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. In the lowland districts of Nepal the species declined at 14% a year between 2002 and 2011 (Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2012). In Bangladesh, the species declined by 60% between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012 (Khan 2013), and the population trend in the country is still a decline (IUCN-Bangladesh 2016).&#160;The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan banned veterinary diclofenac in 2006 and the Government of Bangladesh followed suit in 2010 (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016). Since then, the rate of decline appears to have slowed, and may even have reversed in India and Nepal (Prakash <em>et al</em>. 2012). Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population (minimum 201 individuals in 2010; 183 individuals in 2011 [Clements <em>et al. </em>2013])<strong></strong>. Census results from Cambodia suggest the population there may have been increasing since 2004, or is at least stable (Eames 2007b, Clements <em>et al. </em>2013, S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), while there may be some local increases in India (D. L. Bohra <em>in litt. </em>2016). A local increase has also been noted in Pakistan, though this may be more a result of immigration (Murn <em>et al. </em>2014). Surveys of vulture restaurants in Myanmar in 2006 and 2007 estimated a minimum of 62 White-rumped Vultures were present (Hla&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices I &amp; II, Raptors MOU Category 3.

A letter from the Drug Controller General of India warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008)<strong></strong>. The availability of diclofenac in veterinary drug stores in Bangladesh decreased from 100% in 2008-2009 to 53% in 2011-2012 (Khan 2013). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, and this is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em> 2016). Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on <em>Gyps</em> vultures with no ill-effects (Swan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Swarup<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, such as ketoprofen (banned in&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Coimbatore, Erode and Nilgiris<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Districts [Venkitachalam and Senthilnathan 2016])&#160;(Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). There are currently multiple Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014, SAVE 2015). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as supporting wild birds (R. Cuthbert <em>in litt. </em>2016). They can also bring in vulture-related income for locals, through ecotourism (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).<br/><br/>Vulture restaurants are increasingly used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range, particularly Cambodia and Nepal, to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, A. Rahmani <em>in litt. </em>2016). The exchange of diclofenac with meloxicam near breeding colonies is taking place in Nepal in combination with diversionary feeding with diclofenac-free carcasses (Chaudhary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010). Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce but not eliminate vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian <em>Gyps </em>vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, simultaneously censusing nesting colonies, vulture deaths and looking for diclofenac use (Eames 2007a).&#160;Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., and to aid the development of suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004)<strong></strong>. Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that vultures provide (Gautam and Baral 2003)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres, each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding efforts are on-going and met with success when two chicks hatched in early 2007 at a breeding centre in Pinjore, Haryana (V. Prakash <em>in litt</em>. 2007, Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. Three more birds hatched in 2009 (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive flocks that will ensure the full geographical spread of the species is represented in captive breeding efforts (M. Gilbert <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. By April 2008, there were 88 in captivity at three breeding centres in India, as well as 11 at a centre established by WWF-Pakistan and 14 in captivity in Nepal (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. During 2009, these numbers increased to 120 in India, 43 in Nepal and 14 in Pakistan (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. In late 2009, trials of artificial incubation methods were due to start soon (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. By November 2015, the total number held in breeding centres affiliated to SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) stood at 218 birds at 3 centres in India, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015), of which 20 juveniles had successfully fledged (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012); and as of 2015 the Indian breeding centres were fledging 60 juveniles of all three resident&#160;<em>Gyps </em>species&#160;combined (V. Prakash <em>pers. comm. per. </em>C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2016). Six captive-reared birds were released in Nepal in 2017, followed by the first 8 captive-bred individuals and a further 4 captive-reared birds in September 2018 (SAVE 2018). Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the Wildlife Trust of India and the Assam Forest Department (Wildlife Trust of India 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). An updated action plan for vulture conservation in India was written in 2020 (MoEFCC 2020). Cambodia and Nepal have updated their 10-year (2016-2025)&#160;(Sum and Loveridge 2016)&#160;and 6-year (2014-2019) action plans (DNPWC 2015), and in 2016 an action plan was produced for Bangladesh. In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced&#160;<em>A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered&#160;</em>Gyps&#160;<em>vultures&#160;</em>that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Continue to measure the frequency of diclofenac and ketoprofen-treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, and support species management or restoration, as needed. Strengthen public awareness and public support programmes, including providing veterinary camps and livestock management training (SAVE 2014). Monitor remaining populations, in particular continue activities in Cambodia and Myanmar. Monitor the sale of veterinary drugs, and contamination of ungulate carcasses/dead vultures (SAVE 2014). Provide supplementary food sources, with appropriately-sized carcasses, where necessary for food-limited populations (see Hille <em>et al. </em>2016). Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres with the aim of holding at least 150 pairs of each species in captivity (<strong></strong>Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2008, Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008). Manage genetic stock in the captive-bred population (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012). Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternative to diclofenac, and improve its availability (SAVE 2015). Test other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones.&#160;Four additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide, flunixin and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2016), and support bans for these vulture-toxic drugs. Attempt to fully implement a restriction in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2011, SAVE 2014). Promote Vulture Safe Zones, with expansion to include trans-boundary efforts as well as the opportunity for vulture-based ecotourism (SAVE 2014, 2015). Safeguard nesting areas from logging (SAVE 2014). Estimate the potential value of ecosystem services provided by vultures (SAVE 2014).</span>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
204643889,22695215,Gyps himalayensis,Near Threatened,A3e,2021,2021-07-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has been listed as Near Threatened on the basis that it is suspected that it will undergo a moderately rapid population decline over the next three generations owing to the impacts of diclofenac use in livestock, a drug that has caused drastic declines in other <em>Gyps</em> species and appears to be fatal to this species when ingested. The distribution of this species and existing efforts to reduce diclofenac use may limit the impacts.","This species inhabits mountainous areas, mostly at 1,200-5,500 m (X. Lu <em>in litt</em>. 2016), but has been recorded up to 6,000 m (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In winter it moves lower down, with juveniles wandering into the plains. It feeds on carrion (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1994) and regularly visits carcass dumps in South and South-East Asia (Praveen J. <em>in litt</em>. 2012, T. H. Galligan <em>in litt</em>. 2016, D. L. Yong <em>in litt</em>. 2016).","The most serious potential threat to this species is thought to be mortality caused through ingestion of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) widely used in livestock, particularly in South Asia. Diclofenac has caused drastic declines in three other <em>Gyps</em> species in South Asia since the early 1990s, owing to kidney failure following ingestion, with clinical signs of extensive visceral gout and renal failure, and the drug also appears to be fatal in <em>G. himalayensis</em> (Das <em>et al</em>. 2010). Veterinary use of diclofenac is less common within the breeding range of <em>G. himalayensis </em>so adults are unlikely to be exposed, but juveniles may be when they migrate to lowland areas of India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan (Das <em>et al. </em>2010; Bothat <em>et al. </em>2017). The decline noted in the Upper Mustang region of Nepal in 2002-2005 was thought highly likely to be caused by diclofenac poisoning <span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says""><span class=""says"">(Acharya <em>et al</em>. 2009). Since diclofenac was banned in Nepal in 2006, this species has seen partial recovery, at least in part of its range in Nepal, (Paudel <em>et al</em>. 2015) and declines in other&#160;<em>Gyps</em> species may have slowed and even reversed (Prakash <em>et al</em>. 2012).

On the Qinghai-Tibet plateau the main threats appear to be chemical control for pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and the removal of livestock carcasses (X. Lu <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In Thailand lack of natural food sources has been the sole reason for birds (20 juveniles) being admitted to the Kasetsart University Raptor Rehabilitation Unit (C. Kasorndorkbua&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2012). In Pakistan, increased shrub cover due to a decline in winter grass cutting, promotion of stall feeding of livestock and decreasing nomadic pastoralism may be reducing the visibility of carcasses from the air, while reduced livestock numbers may be further limiting food availability (Siddique and Khan 2016). Electrocution or collision with energy infrastructure is likely to be a threat across much of the range, however there is currently little documented evidence (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017; MaMing and Xu 2015). There is anecdotal evidence of Himalayan Griffons being caught and kept as pets (Sum and Loveridge 2016).

Assuming a similar density across the rest of the species's range, a very preliminary estimate of global population is therefore c.290,000 (Lu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009).

This species feeds almost entirely on carrion, and often associates with White-rumped Vulture <em>G. bengalensis</em> when scavenging at carcass dumps and slaughterhouses. It nests almost exclusively in colonies on cliffs and ruins, although in one area, where cliffs are absent, it has been reported nesting in trees. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, and were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in India, which in turn reduces the amount of food available for potentially problematic species, such as feral dogs (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2012b).<p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Pakistan and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported (Prakash&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, 2007, Gilbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality, with renal failure resulting in visceral gout found in the vast majority of examined vultures (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, Swan <em>et al</em>. 2006b, Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>.&#160;Vultures are exposed to diclofenac and other NSAIDs through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that have been treated with the drugs prior to death and left for scavengers to consume (as is tradition in Hindu cultures). Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs that then cause renal failure and death. Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in the species just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues <strong></strong>(Green <em>et al</em>. 2004),&#160;and sampling livestock carcasses in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations<strong> </strong>(Paudel 2008), potentially leading to a slower uptake of meloxicam, an alternative veterinary drug that is of low toxicity to vultures and which has been promoted as a safe alternative to diclofenac in the region&#160;(Swan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006a, Swarup&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). Recent bans of diclofenac in the region still have not eradicated its use in veterinary treatments, as it is still found in the carcasses of livestock and vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014, 2015). This may be because the drug continues to be produced for human consumption, which is then sold on for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016); though this is not so much of a problem in Nepal and Pakistan (SAVE 2015). A second veterinary drug in use in India, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that they are present in sufficient concentrations to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010)<strong></strong>. Additionally, aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac, which is converted to diclofenac in cattle (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), and is therefore as toxic to vultures as diclofenac itself. Wild vultures have also been found dead in India with visceral gout and residues of the veterinary NSAID nimesulide in their tissues (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016; Nambirajan&#160;<em>et al. in prep.&#160;</em>2021). This combination has only been found previously for gout and diclofenac, and therefore provides a strong indication that nimesulide is also toxic to vultures (C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). The availability of other NSAIDs, including ketoprofen and nimesulide, is increasing (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011b, Khan 2013, C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016). Flunixin is another NSAID that has been associated with visceral gout in vultures (Zorrilla&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015), though it is not commonly in use in South Asia yet (T. Galligan&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Other possible contributory factors are changes in human consumption and processing of dead livestock (which have occurred in response to the collapse in vulture numbers), unintentional poisoning from consumption of poisoned baits intended for feral dogs or wild carnivores, electrocution or collision with energy infrastructure, disturbance from rock climbers at cliff nesting sites (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), drought (Hall <em>et al. </em>2012) and mining activity (Chhangani 2004).","Prakash <em>et al. </em>(2019) estimated the population to be c.12,000 individuals based on road transects carried out in 2015. This roughly equates to 8,000 mature individuals. It is placed in the band 5,000-15,000 mature individuals.&#160;<p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps indicus</em> breeds in south-east <strong>Pakistan</strong> and peninsular <strong>India</strong> south of the Gangetic plain, north to Delhi, east through Madhya Pradesh, south to the Nilgiris, and occasionally further south (Collar <em>et al.</em> 2001). The species was first recorded in Nepal in 2011 (Subedi and DeCandido 2013). It was common until very recently, but since the mid-1990s has suffered a catastrophic decline (over 97%) throughout its range. This was first noticed in Keoladeo National Park, India <strong></strong>(Prakash <em>et al. </em>2003), where counts of feeding birds fell from 816 birds in 1985-1986 to just 25 in 1998-1999. Only tiny populations in the Ramanagaram Hills of Karnataka and Nilgiri Forest Division in Tamil Nadu are known to remain in inland southern India, and it is rare elsewhere within its former range (Prakash <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Venkitachalam and Senthilnathan 2015, 2016).

It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. In 2006 the Indian government passed a bill banning the manufacture and importation of diclofenac as a veterinary drug, and in 2008 further legislation was passed banning the manufacture, sale, distribution or use of veterinary diclofenac.&#160;Similar laws are now in place in Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India in 2008 warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use'<strong> </strong>(BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008)<strong></strong>. However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, and this is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016).&#160;Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on&#160;<em>Gyps</em>&#160;vultures with no ill-effects (Swan&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006a, Swarup<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;et al.</span>&#160;2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016).<br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres each capable of holding 25 pairs<strong> </strong>(Bombay Natural History Society 2004) - ultimately at least 150 pairs of the three species should be held in captivity to ensure sufficient birds are available to re-establish wild colonies in the future <strong></strong>(<strong></strong>Lindsay 2008). Captive breeding efforts are ongoing - by 2015 the Indian breeding centres were fledging 60 juveniles per year of all three resident&#160;<em>Gyps&#160;</em>vultures combined (V. Prakash&#160;<em>pers. comm.;</em>&#160;Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), and there are currently over 600 individuals in captivity at three captive breeding centres in India<strong> </strong>(SAVE 2021)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focused on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs (Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Conservation activities include: meeting key groups (e.g. pharmacists, veterinarians and livestock owners); engaging government officials (e.g. drug control, livestock services and forest departments) at tehsil, district and state levels; engaging with the public (e.g. festival programmes, media coverage and signage); diclofenac-free district declaration; community-run formal or informal Vulture Safe Feeding Sites (i.e., vulture [Jatayu] restaurants); vulture-related income generation for villages at nesting or feeding sites; diclofenac-meloxicam exchanges; husbandry and veterinary training camps; and national and international ecotourism to feeding sites and conservation breeding sites (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;There are currently 12 provisional Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Diversionary feeding has been shown to reduce (but not eliminate) vulture mortality from diclofenac poisoning, and uncertainty over the movements of Asian <em>Gyps</em><em> </em>vultures makes the effectiveness of measures such as these uncertain (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008). Satellite tagging has been employed on Asian <em>Gyps </em>vultures&#160;to improve understanding of their movements and range use so as to aid the development of conservation strategies for the genus (Ellis 2004).<br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). An updated 5-year (2020-2025) action plan has been produced for vulture conservation in India (MoEFCC 2020), and a 4-year (2015-2019) action plan was was written for Nepal but has not been updated (DNPWC 2015).&#160;In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced&#160;<em>A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered&#160;</em>Gyps&#160;<em>vultures&#160;</em>that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Conservation Actions Proposed<br/></strong>Identify the location and number of remaining individuals. Measure the frequency of diclofenac treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac, and attempt to implement a ban on other vulture-toxic NSAIDs.&#160;Support species management or restoration, as needed. Monitor remaining populations. Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres. Manage genetic stock in the captive-bred population (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).&#160;Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternative to diclofenac. Test other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones. Three drugs, aceclofenac, ketoprofen and nimesulide, are thought to be toxic to vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2015), and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013). Fully implement restrictions in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011). Attempt to estimate the potential value, in terms of ecosystem services, provided by wild vultures. Protect nesting areas. Maintain and promote Vulture Safe Zones, including trans-boundary efforts. Within VSZs, promote livestock management training and provide free veterinary camps.These and multiple other Conservation Actions were proposed as part of SAVE (2014) and SAVE (2015) for all Asian vultures.

In East Africa, the primary issue is  poisoning (particularly from the highly toxic pesticide  carbofuran), which occurs primarily   outside protected areas; the large range sizes of this and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">G. africanus</span> puts them both at significant risk as it means they inevitably spend  considerable time outside protected areas (Ogada and Keesing 2010,   Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Kendall and  Virani 2012).

In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (C. Bowden<em> in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong> and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2007)<strong></strong>. The West African population has been heavily exploited for trade, with birds commonly sold in fetish markets (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Nikolaus 2006, Buij <em>et al</em>. 2015)<strong></strong>. It is one of the most commonly traded vultures in West and Central African markets, with numbers traded (1,128-1,692 individuals over a six year period in West Africa) probably representing a significant proportion of the regional population (Buij <em>et al</em>. 2015), with vultures being used in traditional medicine (W. Goodwin <em>in litt. </em>2016). The Dogon of central Mali climb the Hombori cliffs to take eggs and chicks of this species (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004)<strong></strong>. The decline and possible extirpation in Nigeria appears to be entirely  attributable to the trade in vulture parts for traditional juju  practices (P. Hall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011). It is apparently also captured for international trade. In 2005, 30 birds were reportedly confiscated by the Italian authorities (F.

In Mali, the Hombori and Dyounde massifs are dotted with at least 47 climbing routes, on which expeditions take place every year, mainly during the species's breeding season. However, the impact of these activities is not known (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004)<strong></strong>. Climate change may be causing a shift in suitable habitat, which may explain the increased sightings in Northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula (Garrido <em>et al. </em>2020). Electrocution and collision with power lines may pose a significant threat (Ogada <em>et al. </em>2016; Garrido <em>et al. </em>2020).&#160;<br/><p></p>","<p>Mundy <em>et al</em>.

This could indicate a population of 22,000 mature individuals and perhaps c.30,000 individuals at the start of the 1990s. Subsequent extremely rapid population declines mean that the population is now likely to be much lower.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occurs throughout the Sahel region of Africa from <strong>Senegal, Gambia </strong>and<strong> Mali </strong> in the west to <strong>Sudan, South Sudan </strong>and <strong>Ethiopia </strong>in the east.

In South-East Asia it was found in open and partly wooded country, generally in the lowlands. This species feeds almost entirely on carrion, scavenging at carcass dumps and slaughterhouses, and at carcasses dumped in the fields and along rivers. It has only been recorded nesting in trees, usually large ones, usually at a height of 7-25 m, sometimes near villages but usually more remote. It is a solitary nester. While feeding, considerable mixed species aggregations can form (where it can be one of the more regularly aggressive vulture species [Hille <em>et al. </em>2016]), and regular communal roost sites are used. It is social and usually found in conspecific flocks, interacting with other vultures at carcasses. Movements are poorly known, and the degree of connectivity of apparently separate populations is not known. Vultures also play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services. They were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in India.<br/><p></p>","By mid-2000, <em>Gyps</em> vultures were being found dead and dying in Nepal, Pakistan, and throughout India, and major declines and local extirpations were being reported. The anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, has been identified as the cause of mortality. Vultures are exposed to diclofenac (and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs [NSAIDs]) through scavenging on the carcasses of largely cattle and buffalo that had been treated prior to death (often as part of palliative care) and left for scavengers to consume (as is tradition in Hindu cultures).&#160;Vultures are unable to process diclofenac and other vulture-toxic NSAIDs that therefore cause renal failure and death&#160;(<strong></strong>Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, <strong></strong>Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004, <strong></strong>Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006).<strong></strong>&#160;Modelling has shown that to cause the observed rate of decline in <em>Gyps</em> vultures, just one in 760 livestock carcasses need contain diclofenac residues (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004)&#160;and sampling carcasses of livestock in India between 2004 and 2005 showed that 10% were contaminated with diclofenac (Taggart <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;Despite awareness programmes to educate locals about the association between diclofenac and vulture mortality, a survey in Nepal indicated that the vast majority of people still do not link diclofenac use to a decline in vulture populations (Anon 2009)<strong></strong>, potentially leading to a slower uptake of a vulture safe alternative drug (meloxicam). Also, despite bans and the wide availability of meloxicam, diclofenac is still widely found in carcasses and vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2014, 2016).&#160;This may be because the drug continues to be produced for human consumption, which is then sold on for veterinary purposes (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016); though this is not so much of a problem in Nepal and Pakistan (SAVE 2015).&#160;Other veterinary drugs (ketoprofen, flunixin, nimesulide, aceclofenac and fenbendazole) have also recently been identified to be potentially lethal to vulture&#160;species (Naidoo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009,&#160;Zorrilla <em>et al.</em> 2015, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2016, Galligan <em>et al. </em>2016, Sharma 2016).<br/><br/>In South-East Asia, the near-total disappearance of the species pre-dated the present crisis, and probably results from the collapse of large wild mammal populations due to overhunting and improved management of deceased livestock leading to scarcity of available food (Clements<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013), but persecution and poisoning is also thought to be a problem. In Cambodia vultures are still threatened by extremely low population densities of wild ungulates, a decline in the number of free-ranging domestic ungulates, felling of nesting trees for timber and accidental poisoning at carcasses laced with pesticides (S. Mahood&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012; Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Other potential contributory factors to declines in this species are direct persecution, pesticide use and electrocution/ collision with energy infrastructure (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017) but these are probably of minor significance.","Considerable confusion over the taxonomy and identification of <em>Gyps</em> vultures has occurred, making it difficult to be sure of the population size. In 2015, the population was estimated to be c.1,000 individuals in India (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2019; MoEFCC 2020), 47 individuals in Cambodia (Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016), fewer than 50 individuals in Nepal (DNPWC 2015), and a single breeding pair in Bangladesh (MoEF 2016). Very little is known about the size of the population in Myanmar, however counts made at vulture restaurants during 2003-2006 suggest a population of c.21 individuals (Hla&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010). The total population is therefore thought to be c.1,100-1,300 individuals, roughly equating to 730-870 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<em>Gyps tenuirostris</em> is found in <strong>India</strong> north of, and including, the Gangetic plain, west to at least Himachal Pradesh and Haryana, south to southern West Bengal (and possibly northern Orissa), east through the plains of Assam, and through southern <strong>Nepal</strong>, and north and central <strong>Bangladesh</strong>. It formerly occurred more widely in South-East Asia, but it is now thought to be extinct in Thailand and Malaysia, and the only recent records are from <strong>Cambodia</strong>, southern <strong>Laos</strong> and <strong>Myanmar</strong>. Considerable confusion over the taxonomy and identification of <em>Gyps </em>vultures has occurred, making it difficult to be sure of claims for this species. However, it appears to be allopatric or parapatric with Indian Vulture <em>G. indicus</em> where their ranges abut (or potentially do so) in northern India. <br/><br/>It was once common, but in South-East Asia populations declined through the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, and are now probably very small and restricted in distribution and limited mainly to Cambodia (where the first nests recorded in the country were recently found and surveys in 2015 recorded a total of 47 individuals at vulture 'restaurants' [Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016]) and Myanmar (counts made at vulture restaurants suggest a population of c.21 individuals [Hla <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010]). Given the lack of intensive agriculture and associated chemical use in South-East Asia and the continued presence of large areas of suitable habitat for the species, the primary reason behind its decline in the region is thought to be the demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (Anon 2003, 2005). <br/><br/>In India and Nepal, the species was common until very recently, but since the mid-1990s it has suffered a catastrophic decline of up to 96.8%, with a combined average decline in India of this species and <em>G. indicus</em> of over 16% annually between 2000 and 2007 (Prakash <em>et al. </em>2007)<strong></strong>. In Nepal the species was formerly fairly common and widespread, but during 2002-2011 it declined by 18.7% per year (Chaudhary&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), although there may have since been a partial recovery (Galligan&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;It is now extremely rare in the east of Nepal and local and uncommon in the centre and west (Inskipp <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;Extensive research has identified the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac to be the cause behind this rapid population collapse (Green <em>et al</em>. 2004, Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a, <strong></strong>Shultz <em>et al</em>. 2004,<strong></strong> Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005).<strong></strong> This drug, used to treat domestic livestock, is ingested by vultures feeding on their carcasses, leading to renal failure and causing visceral gout (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004a,b<strong></strong>; Swan <em>et al</em>. 2005, <strong></strong>Gilbert <em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Probably owing to the effects of diclofenac, breeding success in parts of its Indian range is reportedly low; of 14 nests found in Assam just four had chicks (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. Diclofenac is apparently entirely absent in Cambodia, adding greater importance to that remaining small population. Likewise, surveys conducted in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007 found no firm evidence of diclofenac use (Eames 2007).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendices I &amp; II, Raptors MOU Category 1. It has been reported from many protected areas across its range. The governments of India, Nepal and Pakistan passed legislation in 2006 banning the veterinary use of diclofenac, and Bangladesh followed suit in 2010. A letter from the Drug Controller General of India in 2008 warned more than 70 drugs firms not to sell the veterinary form of diclofenac, and to mark human diclofenac containers 'not for veterinary use' (BirdLife International 2008). These bans have led to a reduction of diclofenac within ungulate carcasses (the principal food source for vultures) in India (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011a ) and a study of 11 administrative districts in Nepal found diclofenac use dropped by 90% since 2006 following the introduction of measures to reduce its use (Anon 2008). However, levels of diclofenac contamination still remain high and human forms of the drug are still sold for veterinary use (Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2011a,b).&#160;In response to the misuse of human diclofenac, the Government of India banned the manufacture of all diclofenac products in vial sizes larger than 3 ml (the single dose for humans) in 2015, which is predicted to make the drug too expensive and too complicated to use on large-bodied animals and thereby stop its misuse in livestock (T. Galligan <em>in litt.</em> 2016).&#160;Efforts to replace diclofenac with a suitable alternative are on-going and are showing signs of success with evidence for a decrease in diclofenac and an increase in the safe alternative (Cuthbert et al. 2011c ). An alternative drug, meloxicam, which is out of patent and manufactured in Asia has been tested on Gyps vultures with no ill-effects (Swan et al. 2006a, Swarup et al. 2007); though three additional drugs, aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen, are known to be toxic to vultures, and approximately another 10 drugs need to be tested (Galligan 2013, Cuthbert et al. 2016).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs (Galligan 2013, Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). Conservation activities include: meeting key groups (e.g. pharmacists, veterinarians and livestock owners); engaging government officials (e.g. drug control, livestock services and forest departments) at tehsil, district and state levels; engaging with the public (e.g. festival programmes, media coverage and signage); diclofenac-free district declaration; community-run formal or informal Vulture Safe Feeding Sites (i.e., vulture [Jatayu] restaurants); vulture-related income generation for villages at nesting or feeding sites; diclofenac-meloxicam exchanges; husbandry and veterinary training camps; and national and international ecotourism to feeding sites and conservation breeding sites (T. Galligan in litt. 2016). There are currently 12 provisional Vulture Safe Zones being established in countries including India, Nepal and Bangladesh (Mukherjee <em>et al</em>. 2014). These areas will provide a safe environment into which birds bred in captivity can be released (Bowden <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Vulture restaurants are used as ecotourism attractions in parts of the species's range to raise awareness and fund supplementary feeding programmes and research - in Cambodia these are run by The Cambodia Vulture Conservation Project and a partnership between national and international conservation NGOs (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, H. Rainey <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Birds have been satellite tagged in various parts of their range to improve understanding of their movements, foraging range, site fidelity etc., in order to develop suitable conservation strategies for the species (Ellis 2004)<strong></strong>. Socioeconomic surveys in Nepal have shown that local people are strongly in favour of vulture conservation because of the associated ecological services that they provide (Gautam and Baral 2003)<strong></strong>. <br/><br/>The Report of the International South Asian Vulture Recovery Plan Workshop in 2004 gave a comprehensive list of recommendations including establishing a minimum of three captive breeding centres each capable of holding 25 pairs (Bombay Natural History Society 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding efforts began in 2006 when 18 Slender-billed Vultures were captured for the captive-breeding facility in Pinjore, India. The centre is part of a captive breeding programme established by the RSPB and Bombay Natural History Society. In April 2008, there were 28 birds at the three Indian breeding centres (Pain <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>, increasing to 35 birds in 2009 (Bowden 2009)<strong></strong>. Two individuals bred in captivity for the first time in 2009. By November 2015, the total number in breeding centres in India was 218, 15 at a centre in Pakistan and 57 at a centre in Nepal (SAVE 2015).&#160;The Central Zoo Authority of India has also set up several Vulture Consevration Breeding centres (T. Galligan <em>in litt. </em>2016).<em>&#160;</em>A website has been set up to allow researchers to contribute data on known colonies to identify founder individuals for captive breeding efforts that represent the full geographical spread of the species (M. Gilbert <em>in litt</em>. 2004)<strong></strong>. Captive breeding centres often receive vultures that have been found poisoned and then rehabilitated by rescue centres such as the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, Assam, which is run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the Wildlife Trust of India and the Assam Forest Department (Wildlife Trust of India 2019).&#160;Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, accompanied by searches for nesting colonies, research into vulture deaths and investigation of possible diclofenac use in livestock (Eames 2007). <br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha et al. 2017). An updated 5-year (2020-2025) action plan has been produced for vulture conservation in India (MoEFCC 2020), a 9-year (2016-2025) action plan for Cambodia (Sum &amp; Loveridge 2016) and Bangladesh (MoEF 2016), and a 4-year (2015-2019) action plan was was written for Nepal but has not been updated (DNPWC 2015). In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013). In 2014, SAVE produced A Blueprint for the recovery of South Asia’s Critically Endangered Gyps vultures that presents key conservation actions for the region and timelines for each action (SAVE 2014).&#160;<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Multiple Conservation Actions were proposed as part of SAVE (2014) and SAVE (2015). Measure the frequency of diclofenac treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac (as well as the removal of human-use diclofenac in vials of &gt;3 ml), and attempt to implement a ban on other vulture-toxic NSAIDs. Regulate the production of veterinary drugs to identify vulture-safe NSAIDs. Support species management or restoration, as needed. Initiate public awareness and public support programmes. Identify the location and number of remaining individuals and identify actions required to prevent extinction. Monitor remaining populations, in particular replicate conservation and research activities in Myanmar that have been implemented in Cambodia. Provide supplementary food sources where necessary for food-limited populations in South-East Asia, and maintain and promote Vulture Safe Zones, including trans-boundary efforts. Within VSZs, promote livestock management training and provide free veterinary camps.

It is suspected that it will decline at a rate of 20-30% over three generations in the future as significant threats are ongoing, and some (such as climate change) are predicted to worsen. It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable.   <p></p>","It breeds on sea coasts and inland near larger rivers (mostly on lower stretches) or lakes, where there are stands of mature trees. In the Magadan district of Russia, successful breeding pairs along coasts appear to produce more fledged chicks than successful pairs on rivers, and average brood size is larger for coastal pairs (Potapov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010, 2012). Annual net chick production showed an increase in constantly monitored coastal sites, but a decrease in river sites (Potapov <em>et al.</em> 2012). &#160;During the autumn birds forage along rivers where dead salmon are abundant. During mid-winter, birds in Russia tend to remain on the coast, except some that winter in Kamchatka along inland rivers fed by hot springs and at Lake Kurilskoye (M. McGrady <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012), while those wintering in Japan mainly stay near freshwater, but c.35% move to mountainous areas where many feed on deer carcasses (Ueta <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>.<br/><p></p>","In Russia, it is threatened by habitat alteration during the development of hydroelectric power projects, proposed large-scale coastal and offshore developments for the petrochemical industry, and logging for timber (Ferguson-Lees and&#160;Christie 2001). Industrial pollution of rivers and high levels of DDT/DDE, PCBs and heavy metals are further threats (Iwata <em>et al. </em>2000; Kim <em>et al. </em>1999). Over-fishing has caused a decline of fish stocks in Russia and Japan which has led to an increasing tendency of birds on Hokkaido to move inland and scavenge on sika deer carcasses left by hunters, exposing them to a risk of lead poisoning through ingestion of lead shot (Ferguson-Lees &amp; Christie 2001). Despite laws being introduced in Japan in 2004 prohibiting the use of lead ammunition for hunting large animals, and further laws in 2014 prohibiting possession of lead ammunition, lead poisoning continues to be a significant threat (Ishii <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160; On Sakhalin Island, the most significant threat to breeding success is nestling predation by brown bears, while other threats include adverse weather (which may form ecological traps on migration routes), food shortages due to overfishing, habitat alteration, disturbance at nest sites, and infection by the blood parasite haemosporida (Romanov and&#160;Masterov 2020). Shooting may also be a local threat in parts of the wintering range (GRIN 2021). Declines in reproductive output along the coastline and rivers of the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk are predominantly caused by&#160;increasing frequency and intensity of spring floods, which impede successful hunting and therefore reduce breeding output, and reduced ice cover in spring (Potapov&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;<p></p>","M.

However, Masterov and&#160;Romanov (2014) estimate the global population to be 6,000-7,000, which roughly equates to 4,000-4,670 mature individuals.

Nesting has been recorded in tall trees. It occurs at lower density than <em>Gyps</em> vultures owing to its predominantly territorial behaviour, and movements are poorly known. Vultures play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, and were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal and human remains in India. <p></p>","The disappearance of vultures from Asia is linked to a suite of factors: notably the demise of wild ungulates, unintentional poisoning, the intensification of agriculture, increased sophistication of waste disposal techniques, direct persecution and disease (Clements<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2013). However, rapid declines since the turn of the 21st century are believed to have been driven by the pharmaceutical NSAID diclofenac used to treat livestock, which has proven highly toxic to Gyps vultures, causing mortality from renal failure that results in visceral gout (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. A recent study found that Red-headed Vulture population declines in India had slowed and were possibly increasing following a ban on diclofenac, which suggests that the species is also adversely affected by the drug (Galligan <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by <em>Gyps</em> spp. vultures (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.

Monitoring of vultures has been conducted in a number of protected areas in India, and monitoring of vulture populations combined with supplementary feeding is underway in the northern and eastern plains of Cambodia. There are currently seven vulture restaurants in Cambodia, which are run by The Cambodia Vulture Conservation Project, a partnership between the Royal Cambodian Government and national and international NGOs (e.g. Masphal and Vorsak 2007, H. Rainey <em>in litt. </em>2008)<strong></strong>. Advocacy to reduce the use of poisons and poisoned bait to catch fish and waterfowl has succeeded in reducing the number of vultures being poisoned accidentally (S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). A captive breeding and reintroduction scheme is underway in Thailand, run by&#160;the Department of National Parks Wildlife Plant Conservation, Zoological Park Organization, Kasetsart University and Seub Nakhasathien Foundation. There are currently 5 vultures at Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo and Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Breeding Research Station, and the first egg was laid in 2021 (Chaiyong 2021), but captive breeding efforts are not as advanced as they are for Critically Endangered <em>Gyps</em> vultures and these are urgently needed. Surveys utilising vulture restaurants were carried out in Myanmar in late 2006 and early 2007, accompanied by research into the locations of nesting colonies, causes of vulture deaths and potential that diclofenac was being used in livestock (Eames 2007).<br/><br/>SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) has developed the concept of Vulture Safe Zones; areas (with a minimum of 100 km radius, equating to 30,000 km<sup>2</sup>) around important vulture breeding colonies, where education and advocacy efforts are focussed on eliminating the use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, such as ketoprofen<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;(Galligan 2013, Mukherjee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). There are currently multiple Vulture Safe Zones being established in India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh (Mukherjee&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, DNPWC 2015, SAVE 2015).<br/><br/>The species is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha <em>et al</em>. 2017). An updated 5-year (2020-2025) action plan has been produced for vulture conservation in India (MoEFCC 2020), and a 4-year (2015-2019) action plan was was written for Nepal but has not been updated (DNPWC 2015). In 2012 the governments of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh adopted a number of priority actions for the conservation of vultures, proposed by SAVE. These include banning large multi-dose vials of human diclofenac, testing other NSAIDs for toxicity to vultures and expanding the Vulture Safe Zones initiative (Galligan 2013).<br/><br/><p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Identify the location and number of remaining individuals and identify action required to prevent extinction. Measure the frequency of diclofenac treated carcasses available to vultures. Support the ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac and other vulture-toxic drugs, and support species management or restoration, as needed. Continue to carry out public awareness and public support programmes. Monitor remaining populations, in particular replicate conservation and research activities that have been implemented in Cambodia in Myanmar. Provide supplementary food sources, with appropriately-sized carcasses,&#160;where necessary for food-limited populations (see Hille <em>et al. </em>2016). Support captive breeding efforts at a number of separate centres. Promote the immediate adoption of meloxicam as an alternatives to diclofenac. Test other NSAIDs to identify additional safe alternative drugs to diclofenac and also other toxic ones. Attempt to fully implement a restriction in the size of diclofenac vials sold for human use to make them less practical to use for veterinary purposes and take action against companies that fail to comply with the diclofenac ban (Cuthbert&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, SAVE 2014). Continue the operation of Vulture Safe Zones and expand the network of these sites (e.g. DNPWC 2015).&#160;A comprehensive list of conservation actions proposed can be found in Botha <em>et al</em>.

Having increased steadily during the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century, the population now appears to have reached a plateau.<br/><p></p>","The species occurs in alluvial plains and dunes in the Guadalquivir marshes, plains and hills in central Spain, and high mountain slopes in the Sistema Central in Portugal. The abundance and distribution of rabbits, its favoured prey, influence population density, range and reproductive performance (Fernández<span style=""font-style: italic; ""> et al. </span>2009). Indeed, its evolutionary dependence on rabbits has been suggested as permanently limiting its abundance and distribution (Ferrer and Negro 2004), although it may take alternative prey where rabbits are scarce in the non-breeding season (Sánchez <span style=""font-style: italic; "">et al. </span>2010). Breeding birds are sedentary, with median home range sizes of 28,000 ha during the breeding period and 10,500 ha in the non-breeding season&#160;<span class=""datalabel1""><span lang=""EN-US"">(González and Margalida 2008).<span lang=""EN-US"">&#160;Within&#160;Doñana National Park, Spain, tree height and distance from human activity are the most important variables&#160;explaining nest site selection (Bisson<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2002), but many recently-colonised territories are located in human-modified habitat, especially farmland with high rabbit abundance (González and Oria 2004,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Castaño 2005, J.

Mortality from intentional poisoning, which appears to be a particular problem in hunting reserves where game is commercially exploited, may once again be on the increase (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2016). 15 cases of death have been reported from poisoning events in 2015 - 2016 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2016). This is of particular concern, as the dip in the population in the late 1990s was caused by additional mortality due to poisoning events, with the Doñana National Park population seriously affected by the illegal use of poisoned bait&#160;during this period (Ortega&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009, Ferrer <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160;Electrocution remains a significant source of mortality, despite mitigation measures leading to a highly significant reduction in the numbers of birds killed (<span class=""msoIns"">Lopez-Lopez <em>et al. </em><span class=""msoIns"">2011). This is a particular problem for immature eagles, and of six satellite-tagged individuals that visited Morocco in 2015 one was electrocuted, prompting the discovery of four further carcasses of immature birds near two recently installed high-voltage powerlines (Godino<em> et al.</em> 2016). Relatively few individuals are believed to have entered Morocco, indicating that powerlines may represent a serious threat to the potential re-establishment of a breeding population in the country. Despite the general success of mitigation measures applied in&#160;Andalucía (<span class=""msoIns"">Lopez-Lopez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em><span class=""msoIns"">2011), eleven individuals have been found electrocuted since 2010 (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;Several individuals have been found shot in the past decade in both Spain and Portugal (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2016,&#160;J. R. Garrido <em>in litt.</em> 2016), suggesting that hunting remains a threat to the species. Additionally, the ingestion of lead shot embedded in the flesh of prey items may be a problem in certain areas&#160;(González and Oria 2004, <span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns"">Pain&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). The threats from poisoning and shooting highlight the importance of maintaining co-operation with landowners throughout the breeding range. In Spain, rab<span lang=""EN-US"">bit populations declined by 55% between 1973 and 2002 (Virgós <em>et al.</em> 2007). The incidence of viral haemorrhagic diseases and changes in the management of hunting estates has reduced prey availability. (Cabezas-Díaz <em>et al. </em>2011). <span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span class=""msoIns""><span lang=""EN-US"">The intensification of farming through irrigation in parts of the range, coupled with increasing urban development, has reduced the availability and suitability of habitat in these areas and may constrain future population growth, with an increase in incidents of human conflict noted in these areas (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016). The development of large areas of land for the production of renewable energy so far does not appear to have had negative impacts, however one individual was found dead in Andalucía in 2012 (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt.</em> 2016), and this threat may be increasing as more wind farms are being installed in many parts of the species's range (S Cabezas-Díaz <em>in litt. </em>2020). Human activities in the vicinity of active nests can disturb incubating adults and reduce hatching success (González&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006,&#160;<strong></strong>Margalida&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007). The limitation of funds for adequate monitoring and implementation of mitigation actions (particularly around the safety of powerlines for birds) may be a significant constraint in the future (S.

Criado<em>&#160;in litt.&#160;</em>1999). The population has subsequently increased considerably, although it now appears to have reached a plateau (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). By 2020, the global population had increased to 530-540 pairs (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Portugal&#160;was recolonised in 2003 after an absence of breeding activity for over 20 years, and numbers have been slowly increasing since, with 16 breeding territories located in 2016 and 17 breeding pairs in 2019 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt</em>. 2013; S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Interchange of individuals has been noted between the populations in Portugal and in&#160;Andalucía. There is considerable variation in the rate of population increase throughout the range: In Extremadura, the increase was only c. 2% between 1990 and 2015 (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016), while in&#160;Andalucía&#160;the population has more than doubled since 2008 to 111 pairs (J. R. Garrido <em>in litt. </em>2016). Improved adult survival appears to have driven the population increase and the observed temporal and spatial variation in population growth rates (Ferrer &amp; Calderon 1990; Ortega <em>et al. </em>2009). More recently, reduced adult survival appears to have caused a plateau in population size (<span lang=""EN-US"">S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Initial positive trends were associated with conservation measures, which reduced the mortality associated with powerlines and poisoning events, but also benefited the population through supplementary feeding, reparation of nests, reintroductions and reduction of disturbance during the breeding period (González&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2007,&#160;<span lang=""ES"">López-López <em>et al. </em>2011,&#160;J.

However, recently mortality caused by powerlines, shooting and collision with wind turbines has increased, and poisoning remains a threat (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;In Andalucía, a reintroduced population has been established in Cádiz, with four to five breeding pairs producing offspring, which have subsquently bred at several sites in southern Spain and in Portugal (Muriel <em>et al. </em>2011, J.

As a result of the improving fortunes of the species in Iberia, an increasing number of dispersing immature birds are being recorded in <strong>Morocco</strong>, where the species became extinct as a breeding species in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century (Thevenot&#160;<em>et al. </em>2003, Maghreb Ornitho 2017).

Around 60% of the total breeding population is now located in protected areas (national and EU Special Protected Areas), down from c. 70% in 2011 (Barov and Derhé 2011), which may reflect the growth of the population into new areas. Dispersal and critical areas for the species have not been updated for several years, therefore many are not legally delimited or protected against damaging activities (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2020). Since 1987, national and regional governments have been implementing a coordinated conservation plan for the species. A European action plan was published in 1996 and updated in 2008 (Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2008). The national plan for Spain was implemented in 2018, while in <span lang=""EN-US"">Portugal a plan is being prepared&#160;(S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C.

As a result, a national law was approved in Spain in 2008, establishing tools for the protection of birds against collision and electrocution in power lines and best practice for new power line construction or modification (Guil <em>et al. </em>2011). &#160;Work has also been carried out to isolate dangerous power lines on private farms (Cabezas-Díaz 2011). In Portugal, the main potentially dangerous electric pylons have been identified in the core areas of the species and a modification plan has been established. Around 40 km of powerlines were modified between 2009 and 2011; however, around 80 km still require funding (S. Cabezas-Díaz and J. C. Atienza<em> in litt.</em>&#160;2016). Isolation of power lines has been demonstrated to be obsolete in many cases (S. Cabezas-Díaz&#160; <em>in lill. </em>2020). A supplementary feeding programme has been established to mitigate the effects of rabbit decreases, and has significantly increased breeding success (González and Margalida 2008).

This network involved 112 municipalities, 22,000 ha of private land and 96 schools, and focused on habitat management, species conservation, awareness raising and information activities across the whole distribution range in Spain (Cabezas-Díaz and Hernáez 2012). In Castilla-La Mancha, an EU LIFE-funded projected, ""Conservación de especies prioritarias en el monte mediterráneo en Castilla-La Mancha""&#160;is working for the conservation of this and&#160;other species related to Mediterranean forests, while a counterpart project, LIFE Imperial, is focused on the conservation of the species in Portugal (R.

Work is ongoing to raise awareness and support on private land where the species breeds, including improving habitat management (García 2007), and nearly 50% of breeding pairs are covered by such projects (González and Margalida 2008). In Cádiz, 73 young birds have been released as part of a reintroduction project (Ferrer 2011 <em>unpubl</em>.), and currently five breeding pairs have become established in the province providing a new population nucleus (Muriel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).

It forages in lowland and montane regions over open, often arid, country, and also scavenges at human settlements. It has a broad diet including carrion, tortoises, organic waste, insects, young vertebrates, eggs and even faeces (Margalida <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dobrev <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016). Usually solitary, individuals congregate at feeding sites, such as rubbish tips, or vulture restaurants (i.e. supplementary feeding stations), and form roosts of non-breeding birds<a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date: 20120227T1623""> (Ceballos and Donázar 1990</a>). It performs an energetic display flight with its mate. Several resident island populations show genetic isolation. Northern breeders conduct long-distance intercontinental migrations, flying over land and often utilising the narrowest part of the Strait of Gibraltar or the Bosphorus and Dardanelles on their way to Africa (García-Ripollés <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, López-López <em>et al.</em> 2014, Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species exhibits high site fidelity, particularly in males (Elorriaga <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009, García-Ripollés <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010,&#160;López-López&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<p></p>","This species faces a number of threats across its range.

Illegal poisoning against carnivores seems to be the main threat operating on the breeding grounds in Spain (Hernandez and Margalida 2009, Sanz-Aguillar <em>et al. </em>2015b) and the Balkans (I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt</span>. 2012, Oppell <em>et al. </em>2016). Declines in parts of Africa are likely to have been driven by loss of  wild ungulate populations and, in some areas, overgrazing by livestock and improvements in slaughterhouse sanitation<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, Ogada <em>et al. </em>2016). The population crash in the Cape Verde Islands has been attributed to a rise in mortality due to the former use of long-lasting pesticides (some of which, although now illegal, are still easily bought and used), the ongoing poisoning of stray dogs, and a decrease in food availability due to urbanisation, rural abandonment and better sanitation (Freitas <em>et al. </em>2020).<em>&#160;</em>Within the European Union, regulations introduced in 2002, controlling the disposal of animal carcasses, greatly reduced food availability, notably through the closure of traditional ""<em>muladares</em>"" in Spain and Portugal<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Donázar 2004, J. C.

Similarly, closures of over 300 small rubbish dumps in Oman as part of an upgrade in waste management may reduce food availability (S. Al Touqi, cited in McGrady <em>et al. </em>2018), although a study in Turkey found no short-term effect on reproductive success of closure of rubbish dumps (Katzenberger <em>et al. </em>2017). In parts of the range where transhumance occurs, there may be asymmetries in food availability at different times of year (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2018). However, recently passed regulations will permit the operation of feeding stations for scavengers and guidelines about how to operate them exist&#160;(A. Brunner<em> in litt</em>. 2010, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al.</em> 2010), and in eastern Europe dietary diversity has no effect on population sizes, but instead could affect territory size (Dobrev&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Poisoning is a significant threat to the species, often through the use of poison baits targeted at terrestrial predators (Carrete <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2009, Cortés-Avizanda <a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623""><em>et al</em>. 2009, 2015 Sanz-Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2015b, Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2016</a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a>), and through the consumption of poisoned animals. Recent analyses from many countries including Bulgaria (Angelov 2009) have highlighted potential contamination of Egyptian Vultures that may lead to increased mortality. Antibiotic residues present in the carcasses of intensively-farmed livestock may increase the susceptibility of nestlings to disease&#160;(e.g. avian pox has been reported as a cause of mortality in Bulgaria<strong><sup> </sup></strong>[Kurtev <em>et al.</em> 2008]).&#160;<br/><br/>It appears that diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for livestock, and which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses (BirdLife International 2008), is driving the recent rapid declines in India<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006, A. Rahmani <em>in litt</em>. 2012, Galligan <em>et al. </em>2014). NSAIDs are reportedly toxic to raptors, storks, cranes and owls, suggesting that vultures of other genera could be susceptible to its effects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). It seems plausible that this species previously had less exposure to the toxin owing to competitive exclusion from carcasses by <em>Gyps</em> spp. vultures<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006). In 2007, diclofenac was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). In addition, it was reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2007) and exporting it to 15 African countries<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). This drug has recently been approved for veterinary use in Europe, and is commercially available in France and Spain, which is a major concern for the species (Margalida <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;Mortality at power lines has been found to be particularly common on the Canary Islands (Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2007a) and &#160;potentially risky in other regions of Spain (<a style=""mso-comment-reference:A_1;mso-comment-date:20120227T1623"">Donázar and Benítez <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""></span></a><a class=""msocomanchor"" id=""_anchor_1"" href=""#_msocom_1"" name=""_msoanchor_1""></a> 2007, Donázar <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and in Africa (Nikolaus 1984, 2006), with 17 individuals found killed by electrocution in Port Sudan, over 10 days in&#160; 2010 (I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2010, Angelov <em>et al. </em>2013a), indicating a potentially serious problem that has persisted for decades and will continue to contribute to Egyptian Vulture population declines. In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W. Goodwin <em>in litt. </em>2016). Competition for suitable nest sites with Griffon Vulture (<em>Gyps fulvus</em>) may reduce breeding success<strong><sup> </sup></strong>in the short-term (Kurtev <em>et al.</em> 2008). <span style=""font-style: italic;""><p></p></span>","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number&#160;3,000-4,500 breeding pairs, equating to&#160;6,100-9,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms 25-49% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 12,400-36,000 mature individuals, roughly equating to 18,600-54,000 individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occupies a large range with isolated resident populations in the<strong> </strong>Cabo Verde and Canary Islands in the west (although they may still have some connectivity to the continental population&#160;[Agudo <em>et al. </em>2011]), through <strong>Morocco</strong>&#160;(Amezian and Khamlichi 2015) and parts of West Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie&#160; 2001). A small resident population persists in <strong>Angola</strong> and <strong>Namibia</strong>. The bulk of the resident population occurs in <strong>Ethiopia</strong> and East Africa, Arabia and the Indian Subcontinent, while Saharan and Sahelian parts of Africa in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Algeria</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Niger,</span> northernmost <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cameroon, Chad</span> and northern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sudan</span> also hold significant but presumably smaller populations (I.

Migratory birds breed in northernmost Africa (Morocco, Algeria, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tunisia, Libya,</span>&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Egypt</span>), southern Europe from<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> Spain</span> in the west through the Mediterranean, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Turkey</span>, the Caucasus and central Asia to northern <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Iran,</span> <strong>Pakistan</strong>, northern <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Nepal</strong>. These birds winter within the resident range, and in addition throughout the Sahel region of Africa. Global population estimates for the species are crude, but 3,000-4,500 pairs are estimated in Europe (BirdLife International <em>in prep</em>), &lt; 2,000 pairs in central Asia, just a few thousand pairs now in the Indian Subcontinent,  perhaps 1,000 pairs in the Middle East, and perhaps 1,000-2,000 pairs in Africa (Thiollay 1989, I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012).&#160;The population size in Europe is estimated to have decreased by 50-79% in 53.4 years (three generations) (BirdLife International 2015).&#160;In Spain, which with c.1,300 pairs may support as much as 40% of the European breeding population, the number of territories declined by at least 25% between 1987-2000 (i.e. equating to a decline of &gt;50% over three generations)<sup><strong> </strong></sup>(Donázar 2004, Del Moral 2009), likely due to high mortality rates (Cortés-Avizanda <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The Spanish population was estimated to be stable for the period 1998-2011 (BirdLife International 2015, Tauler <em>et al. </em>2015), and the adjacent French population appears to be increasing (Lieury <em>et al.</em> 2015), although 2015 appeared to be a bad year there (Vulture Conservation Foundation 2016). Balkan populations are however still declining at 4-8% per year, with the population in <strong>Greece</strong>&#160;having declined by 44-60% over 30 years&#160;(Xirouchakis and Tsiakiris 2009, Grubač&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Velevski <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declines are reported from the Middle East<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(S. Aspinall <em>in litt.</em> 2005), e.g. 50-75% in <strong>Israel</strong>, however in <strong>Oman</strong> the population appears stable or increasing&#160;(J. Eriksen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2005, Al Bulushi <em>et al. </em>2013, Angelov <em>et al. </em>2013b), although this may be more a reflection of count methods rather than genuine stability in the population. Around 1,900 birds are resident in a stable population on the island of Socotra (Porter and Suleiman 2012). The resident populations within Africa have declined by 5.9% per year over the past 29-36 years &#160;(Ogada <em>et al.</em> 2016), including those in Ethiopia and <strong>Djibouti<sup> </sup></strong>(G. Mulholland <em>in litt</em>. 2006, Arkumarev&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014), Kenya (Virani <em>et al. </em>2011),&#160;and Angola and Namibia (where just 10 pairs remain)<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(R. Simmons <em>in litt.</em> 2006). Across much of Africa residents are outnumbered by migrant European and probably Asian breeders<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(J. M. Thiollay <em>in litt</em>. 2006, I. Angelov <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt.</span> 2012). The species has gone Extinct in the region of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Taylor <em>et al. </em>2015), and is Extinct as a breeding species in Namibia (Simmons 2015).&#160;Most critically, the species has undergone a catastrophic decline (&gt;35% per year) since 1999 in India, where numbers detected on road transects declined by 68% between 2000 and 2003<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Cuthbert <em>et al</em>. 2006), but the recent ban on Diclofenac may have arrested the decline of the Indian population (Galligan <em>et al</em>. 2014).<em><p></p></em>","In Morocco at least, the species is taken for use in traditional medicine, and it (like all African vultures) may have local commercial value as a traditional medicine throughout Africa (W.

The veterinary drug diclofenac has now been banned by the Indian government. In 2007, a survey began to establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in Tanzania<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008). &#160;Due to the recent legalisation of diclofenac for veterinary use in the EU, there is an active campaign against the use of diclofenac in the European Union (http://www.birdlife.org/europe-and-central-asia/project/ban-veterinary-diclofenac). An International species action plan for the species was published in 2008 (Iñigo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). National species action plans are in place in France, Bulgaria and Italy, and the species is included in the Balkan Vulture Action Plan (BVAP). Efforts are being taken to release captive-bred individuals in parts of Italy. In Spain, France, Italy, Bulgaria and Macedonia birds have been fitted with satellite-tags to study juvenile dispersion, migratory movements and wintering areas (e.g. García-Ripollés <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010,&#160;López-López&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Oppell <em>et al. </em>2015). Nest guarding schemes for pairs that are most threatened by poachers have been implemented in Italy and Bulgaria, where very small populations survive (Zuberogoitia<em> et al.</em> 2014, Oppel<em> et al. </em>2016). Expeditions to study the limiting factors in the wintering areas and along the migration flyway have taken place together with local organizations in Mauritania, Senegal, Ethiopia, Sudan and Turkey (Arkumarev <em>et al.</em> 2014, Oppel <em>et al.</em> 2014). A training seminar was held in Ethiopia to help build capacity for conservation of the species on its African wintering grounds (Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds 2013). A LIFE-Nature project in the Canary Islands has significantly enhanced adult and sub-adult survival through actions including education campaigns, control of illegal poisoning and modification of power lines (Badia-Boher <em>et al. </em>2019).&#160;A multi-species action plan for African-Eurasian vultures was published in 2017 (Botha <em>et al. </em>2017), and an international Flyway Action Plan for the Central Asian and Balkan populations was initiated in 2015 in Bulgaria, encompassing the Balkans, Central Asia, Middle East, and East Africa (S. Oppel <em>in litt. </em>2016). The species is considered Critically Endangered at the national level in Uganda (WCS 2016).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Start and maintain intensive cooperation with local stakeholders to ensure poison- and poaching-free zones at sites with high densities or congregations of the species throughout the breeding, migration and wintering range, alongside similar efforts for other threatened species. Build capacity in countries along the migration flyways and in the wintering areas. There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies in Namibia (Craig <em>et al. </em>2018). Research threats, monitor populations and protect key sites along migratory pathways and bottlenecks along the Red Sea Flyway (Buechley <em>et al. </em>2018). Protect nest sites where persecution is a problem. Research the causes and extent of current declines across the species's range. Insulate dangerous electricity pylons in areas where high mortality is recorded.  Coordinate monitoring to assess trends throughout the range. Relax the European Union sanitary regulations in relation to carcass disposal. Establish supplementary feeding sites based on rigorous scientific knowledge and under adaptive and appropriate management (Moreon-Opo <em>et al. </em>2015, Cortés-Avizanda <em>et al. </em>2016). Raise awareness amongst pastoralists of the dangers of using diclofenac for livestock<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>. Effectively reduce risks of poisoning through strict enforcement of poison-bait ban and education. Lobby for the banning of diclofenac for veterinary purposes throughout the species's range, and support the enforcement of this ban where it has been adopted. Where applicable, establish the impact of wind turbines, and lobby for effective impact assessments to be carried out prior to their construction. Where  appropriate, guard nests to reduce disturbance. Confiscate illegally  kept live birds and use them for the purposes of captive breeding and  future restocking and reintroduction programmes. In key areas of the  species's range, implement long-term and large-scale education and  community involvement programmes. The Flyway Action Plan for the conservation of the Egyptian Vulture in Central Asia and the Balkans (2017) additionally highlighted: the need to improve detection methods and better understand the causes of poisoning and illegal killing; legislation and enforcement to mitigate illegal killing; raise awareness of illegal killing; mitigate electrocution and collisions with energy infrastructure; raise awareness amongst planners and developers of dangerous energy infrastructure; monitor breeding pairs, productivity and success rate; protect breeding sites and foraging habitats; and ensure a successful <em>ex situ</em>&#160;Egyptian Vulture endangered species programme.",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Data published in 2016 suggests that the population in Africa is declining extremely rapidly, and future population assessments may lead to further uplisting.<br/><p></p>","The species inhabits dry savanna, arid plains, deserts and open mountain slopes (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, up to 3,500 m (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In Ethiopia, it is also found at the edge of forests, having been recorded at Bonga Forest and forest in Bale Mountains National Park in 2007, as well as the Afro-alpine habitats of the national park in 2005 (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. It ranges widely when foraging (P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong> and is mainly a scavenger, feeding predominantly on any large carcasses or their remains (Mundy 1982, Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992). It is also known to hunt, probably taking a variety of small reptiles, fish, birds and mammals, and has been observed apparently group-hunting flamingo <em>Phoenicopterus</em> chicks (McCulloch 2006a, 2006b). It builds solitary nests (containing just one egg), often in <em>Acacia</em> (its distribution sometimes being limited by these trees' distribution [Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997]<strong style=""font-weight: normal;""></strong>), but also in <em>Balanites</em> and <em>Terminalia</em> (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It does not breed until at least six years old, then fledging c.0.4 young/pair/year (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992). Ringing studies in Namibia have revealed a very low return rate (Simmons and Bridgeford 1997). The species's minimum home range has been suggested to be 8 km<sup>2</sup>, and this can expand to 15 km<sup>2</sup> in some habitats (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005), but it may now be that 80-150km<sup>2 </sup>may be more appropriate (C. Murn <em>in litt.</em> 2016). In Mozambique, egg-laying occurs from late April until mid-August, with a peak in May and June (Parker 2005). A nest found in Oman contained a small chick in early March, and thought to have fledged in mid-June (Wernery 2009).<br/><p></p>","Widespread accidental poisoning, largely due to strychnine, used by many farmers for predator control,  and more recently carbofuran, has contributed significantly to declines (Brown 1986, P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 2000, Otieno <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010, C. Kendall <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Several Lappet-faced Vultures&#160;were found to have died after feeding on the carcass of a poisoned jackal in Namibia (Komen 2009) and two birds were killed as a result of feeding on a poisoned carcass in Kenya (Kendall and Virani 2012). A mass poisoning event involving at least 15 Lappet-faced Vultures occurred in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe in 2012&#160;(Groom <em>et al</em>. 2012), while another in Botswana in 2019 resulted in the death of 14 Lappet-faced Vultures (BirdGuides 2019). The upper beaks of eight of these birds were removed suggesting that they may be traded for traditional medicine.&#160;It is also often mistakenly persecuted as a livestock predator (Brown 1986): one major deliberate poisoning incident killed 86 individuals in Namibia (Simmons 1995)<strong></strong>.&#160;<br/><br/>Other major threats to the species include nest predation by humans, reduced food availability (including the replacement of the traditional ""Dabokka"" movement of camels with cargo tracks [H. Ibrahim <em>in litt. </em>2016])&#160;and electrocution (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Increasing use of agricultural pesticides may also be a problem for the species (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992), including those breeding at Tayma, Saudi Arabia (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nest disturbance, to which it is extremely sensitive (Steyn 1982)<strong></strong>, may be growing with an increase in forest settlements in Ethiopia (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong><strong></strong> and the increasing recreational use of off-road vehicles (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992).&#160;In Saudi Arabia, suitable nesting trees may be subject to the most intense human disturbance as shepherds also use the same large trees for shelter for themselves and their livestock (Shobrak 2011).&#160;Breeding birds at Tayma could face disturbance from motorised vehicles in the desert (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nest trees are also susceptible to fire and are often pushed over by elephants (Murn and Botha <em>in prep.</em>), although tree availability is not thought to be a limiting factor for the species (Kendall <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>The population collapse in West Africa may be a result of higher nest disturbance, local extinctions of wild ungulates through habitat modification and over-hunting, intensified cattle farming in which sick or dying animals are rarely abandoned, and an increase in accidental poisoning<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Thiollay 2006<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>, although the latter threat, in particular, requires further study (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). National vaccination campaigns in West Africa have reduced illness in domestic livestock, and sick animals can now be sold off, rather than abandoned, due to the proliferation of markets and abattoirs (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). The species may be hunted for medicine and cultural reasons in West Africa, and some ethnic groups in the sub-region hunt vultures for food, though the impact on this species is unknown (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). It is also thought to be used for traditional medicine in South Africa, with all vultures having the potential for traditional medicine use in southern Africa (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2013, W.

With 858-1,284 individuals reported to have been traded over a six year period in West Africa, numbers traded represent a potentially significant proportion of the regional population.<br/><br/>In central Mozambique, the population has declined due to a scarcity of game and livestock following the armed conflict of the 1970s and 1980s, and the surviving population continues to be threatened by the over-exploitation of game by poachers (Parker 2005). There are incidences of deliberate poisoning by poachers, due to the belief that the arriving vultures will give away the locations of poached animals (Hancock 2009, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada <em>et al. </em>2015). In Ethiopia, the principal threat to the species is habitat loss on the lowland plains (A. Shimelis <em>in litt.</em> 2007, 2012)<strong></strong>. Potential introduction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses may represent a potential future threat to the species.<p></p>","Data from Mundy <em>et al. </em>(1992) suggest the African population is at least 8,000 individuals, equating to c.5,330 mature individuals. National estimates for Africa include 160-500 individuals in Uganda (Pomeroy <em>et al. </em>2015), 150-200 pairs in South Africa (Barnes 2000), c.2,000 individuals in Tanzania (Shimelis <em>et al. </em>2005), 300 pairs in Zimbabwe (Boshoff <em>et al. </em>1997), 400-500 pairs in Ethiopia (Shimelis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005), 10-20 pairs in Egypt (Shimelis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005) and 500 pairs in Namibia (Simmons and Brown, cited in Shimelis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). There are an estimated 600 pairs in the Arabian Peninsula (Jennings 2010, cited in Botha <em>et al. </em>2017). The total population is therefore estimated to be least 9,200 individuals, of which c.6530 are mature individuals, although this may prove to be an overestimate given current trends for this species.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;breeds in <strong>Egypt</strong>, <strong>Senegal</strong>, <strong>Niger</strong>, <strong>Mauritania</strong>, <strong>Mali</strong>, <strong>Burkina Faso</strong>, <strong>Chad</strong>, <strong>Sudan</strong>, <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, <strong>Somalia</strong>, <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, <strong>Rwanda</strong>, <strong>Uganda</strong>, <strong>Kenya</strong>, <strong>Tanzania</strong>, <strong>Zambia</strong>, <strong>Malawi</strong>, <strong>Mozambique</strong>, <strong>Namibia</strong>, <strong>Botswana</strong>, <strong>Zimbabwe</strong>, <strong>South Africa</strong>, <strong>Eswatini</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> (an increasing population, in excess of 500 individuals [Newton and Shobrak 1993, M.

The last records from Morocco concerned two birds in 1972 (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is considered likely to be extinct in Western Sahara, as it has not been recorded there since 1955 (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). In Nigeria, there has been a major decline since the late 1970s and it may now have been extirpated (Brown 1986, Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It probably previously bred in Jordan<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Evans and Al-Mashaqbah 1996)<strong></strong>, has largely disappeared where formerly common in Somaliland (Somalia) (A.

The combination of these results with comparable transect surveys from Burkina Faso indicate a decline in abundance of c.97% in rural areas and c.39% in national parks between 1969-1973 and 2003-2004 (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004)<strong></strong>, and declines of 50% were also recorded between 1978-1986 and 2003-2005 on transects in the Masai Mara, Kenya (Virani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2011). It is suffering a slow decline in southern Africa (Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997); the largest conservation area in South Africa (Kruger National Park) contains only approximately 50 nests (Murn and Botha <em>in press</em>) and populations are likely to disappear in South Africa should current levels of exploitation and other pressures continue (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;However the population in central Mozambique is probably stable (Parker 2005)<strong></strong>. There are possibly 1,000 pairs (almost 3,000 individuals) in southern Africa, at least the same in eastern and northeastern Africa, and possibly only c.500 pairs in West Africa and the Sahara, giving a total rough estimate of the African population of at least 8,000 individuals (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992). However, given the age of this estimate this may prove to be an overestimate (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016)<em> </em>as<em> </em>Ogada <em>et al</em>.

It breeds in a number of protected areas within its extensive range. Road surveys in Uganda only recorded the species within protected areas (Pomeroy <em>et al. </em>2015). Ecological research is ongoing, notably in Saudi Arabia (Newton and Shobrak 1993)<strong></strong> and southern Africa (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016). Following a workshop, a five-year international action plan for the species was published in 2005, with the aims of stabilising or increasing its populations, improving knowledge of its distribution, population size and trends and minimising the impact of human activities at key sites (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). A comprehensive study of the species in Botswana was planned for 2007 (P. Hancock<em> in litt.</em> 2006), and 221 chicks were marked with patagial tags between 2006 and 2009 (Bridgeford 2009)<strong></strong>. In 2007, a survey began to  establish the extent of diclofenac use for  veterinary purposes in  Tanzania (BirdLife International 2007)<strong></strong>,  and in 2008 an  awareness-raising campaign at a conference of the World  Organisation for  Animal Health in Senegal led to a resolution  being  adopted unanimously  by more than 160 delegates to ""request Members to  consider their  national situation with the aim to seek  measures to  find solutions to  the problems caused by the administration  of  diclofenac in livestock""  (Woodford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to respond to and neutralise poisoned carcasses (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 2008 feeding stations were set up in the south of Egypt, at Shalatin, following the decline of vultures in the area (H. Ibrahim <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;The species is listed as locally Vulnerable in Namibia (Simmons and Brown 2015), Endangered in the Eskom Red Data Book of Birds of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Allan 2015), and Critically Endangered in the National red list for Uganda (WCS 2016).&#160;<br/><strong><br/>Conservation and Research Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Organise coordinated surveys and monitoring throughout its range to clarify population size and decline rates. Conduct further ecological research (Brown 1986, <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997, Shobrak in press<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>)<strong></strong>. Initiate awareness campaigns aimed at farmers, local communities, developers and ecotourists to reduce mortality from persecution, accidental poisoning and disturbance (Boshoff <em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Harrison&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997, <strong></strong><strong></strong>Barnes 2000, Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005, Shobrak 2011, Shobrak in press). There is potential for communal conservancies to raise awareness of vulture conservation in their constituencies in Namibia (Craig&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Identify important nesting areas (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Carry out research into the effects of nest disturbance (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005) and nest loss (Murn <em>in prep.</em>). Improve awareness amongst utilities and NGOs of hazardous pylon designs and suitable measures to prevent collisions through training courses and literature such as posters and best practice manuals (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Increase awareness amongst farmers of suitable reservoir and drinking trough modification methods (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Enforce legislation concerned with incorrect use of poisons and pesticides (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Carry out research into the impacts of different poisons across its range (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Study the impact of the species on livestock numbers and share information with stakeholders (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Enact legislation against the persecution of the species (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005). Encourage vulture feeding sites and the abandonment of livestock carcasses from death by natural causes (Shimelis <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>Provide enforcement for existing nature reserves in West Africa and design of a new one in northern Mali<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Thiollay 2006)<strong></strong>. In West Africa, determine the severity of accidental poisoning, hunting of the species for medicine and cultural reasons, hunting for food, and the threat from the development of powerlines (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). Complete a vulture census for West Africa (Anderson 2005)<strong></strong>. Eliminate the veterinary  use of diclofenac and other toxic drugs in  Africa.&#160;A number of recommendations were produced at the 2012 Pan-Africa Vulture Summit (Botha&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Ogada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016): 1) Regulate import, manufacture and sale of poisons; 2) Legislate and enforce measures to prosecute those involved in illegal killing and trade in vulture species; 3) Protect and effectively manage breeding sites; 4) Ensure new energy infrastructure is ""vulture-friendly"" and modify existing unsafe infrastructure; 5) Support activities to conserve vulture populations, including research and outreach activities.

This species is therefore listed as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>","This species inhabits open, arid and sparsely vegetated steppe and semi-desert (Launay <em>et al.</em> 1997, Osborne <em>et al.</em> 1997, Mian 2003, Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003). It favours scattered shrubby vegetation, typically comprising xerophytic or halophytic plants (Collar 1996). Those wintering in Iran have been shown to prefer more densely vegetated bush-steppe to sparser shrub-steppe; however, within those bush-steppe habitats they favour areas with reduced vegetation cover (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Bush-steppe is thought to contain a higher abundance of food sources such as<em> Salsola</em> spp. and arthropods (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). Birds wintering in Iran also routinely visit neighbouring farmland where alfalfa and salad rocket is grown, but avoid pistachio crops (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Although dense vegetation may provide a sanctuary from danger, as well as thermal protection when overnight temperatures drop in winter (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al.</em> 2010), more open, unvegetated areas are often favoured as night-time roosts in order to minimise the risk of ambush by nocturnal predators (Combreau and Smith 1997). On the breeding grounds, nesting females may also favour sites away from vegetation patches, which could provide cover for predators (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2012). Abundance of breeding males has been found to be higher in flat areas with shorter shrub vegetation which is likely to be more suitable for displaying (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<br/><p>The species feeds throughout the day, but is most active at dawn and dusk (Combreau and Launay 1996). It has an eclectic diet, mainly comprising plants and invertebrates (especially ants Formicidae and beetles Tenebrionidae: Tigar and Osborne 2000), but also including vertebrates such as rodents, lizards, small snakes and even young birds (Collar 1996, Tourenq <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/></p><p>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1996). Males play no part in rearing the young, and a brood may contain young sired by several different individuals (Lesobre <em>et al</em>. 2010). Females create a shallow scrape in the ground in which they typically lay 3-4 eggs, and occasionally up to six eggs in long-distance migrants (Collar 1996, Combreau <em>et al</em>. 2002). The incubation period is typically 24 days, whilst fledging takes around 35 days.<br/></p><p></p>","The principal threat is from hunting (primarily using falconry), largely but not exclusively on the species's wintering grounds (Judas <em>et al. </em>2009). Large numbers are also trapped, mainly in Pakistan and Iran, and shipped to Arabia for use in the training of falcons (Combreau 2007); hunting and trapping are responsible for more than 50% of mortality in Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;In 2014 an illegal shipment of 240 birds was intercepted en route from Pakistan to Bahrain (Shafaeipour <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Arab countries, the meat of this species is considered an aphrodisiac, attracting hunters of high status (Nabi <em>et al., </em>2019); in 2017-2019, permits for hunting of the Asian Houbara were given by Pakistan to royal Arabs, and unregulated hunting seems to be continuing. Eggs are also collected during the breeding season (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021). In recent years the species has been heavily hunted in Iraq, as the country has opened up to visits by hunters from other countries (R. Porter&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>In parts of the region, fast-paced development related to the growth of the petroleum industry has reduced the availability of undisturbed habitats and further exacerbated the species's decline. Oil exploration, road building, oil and water pipelines, mining and quarrying activities, powerlines and the general disturbance caused by four-wheel drive vehicles have all been identified as significant auxiliary threats.  Powerlines in particular may be a significant threat (M. Koshkin <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Preliminary data from Uzbekistan suggests that powerlines may contribute to species mortality (Burnside <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Livestock grazing is reported to have a negative impact on the species, both indirectly, by degrading the desert vegetation on which birds rely for food and concealment, and directly, through the trampling of nests and disturbance of nesting females (Lavee 1988). Recent research on the effects of pastoralism on this species in the Kyzylkum Desert in Uzbekistan, however, has found that low intensity livestock grazing may not widely degrade rangelands at a landscape scale (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has no effect on male abundance and female nesting success (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a,b). In Iran, loss of habitat to croplands, mainly through the planting of pistachio, has been judged to be a significant threat (Mansoori 2006); however, it has also been found that the species exploits other crops such as alfalfa and salad rocket (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Yousefi (2017) reported a high degree of dependence on habitats in the vicinity of croplands, with habitats more than 6 km away losing their suitability. In Saudi Arabia, eggs and nests are predated by a range of mammalian predators (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<p></p>Habitat modelling and climate projections predict an increase in suitable habitat in the future, including shifts in geographic distribution of suitable habitat (Yousefi <em>et al., </em>2017); however, the probability of chick survival may decrease in areas with relatively higher temperatures (Koshkin <em>et al., </em>2016), and higher mortality has been reported from Iran in harsh wintering conditions (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).<br/><br/>The primary conservation approach for this species has been captive-breeding and release, however this may be unsustainable and detrimental to wild populations. Over reliance on supplementation of wild populations with captive-bred individuals risks domestication and replacement, rather than conservation reinforcement, with the potential of release of less-fit individuals causing a long-term reduction in the size, genetic diversity and viability of wild populations (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018). With the current extent of unregulated harvest, one model reports that wild populations would require releasing over 3000 captive-bred females a year, more than the initial wild stock, to attain population stabilisation (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018).&#160;Releasing captive-bred stock may also create the allusion that mitigation measures are successful, which can lead to increased hunting pressure.","The population was last estimated to be between 78,960 and 97,000 individuals globally (O. Combreau&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2014, BirdLife International 2014), and stated as poorly known in 2016 (BirdLife International). Studies since have primarily focused on nest site selection and reintroduced populations; available data on breeding parameters of wild populations are insufficient (Azar&#160;<em>et al.,&#160;</em>2018). Accurately establishing the global population is extremely challenging. The population is expected to fall within the population band for 50,000-99,999 individuals, which is assumed to equate to c.33,000-67,000 mature individuals. The breeding population in Kazakhstan has been estimated at c.49,000 individuals (Riou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;extends from <strong>Egypt</strong> east of the Nile, through <strong>Israel</strong>, <strong>Palestine</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, <strong>Yemen</strong>, <strong>Oman</strong>, <strong>U.A.E.</strong>, <strong>Bahrain</strong>, <strong>Qatar</strong>, <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Kuwait</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>, <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>, <strong>Tajikistan</strong>, <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> and <strong>Mongolia</strong> to<strong> China</strong>.

The species is considered Critically Endangered on the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015). Studies have been conducted into the status, ecology and migration of the species in various parts of its range, most notably Kazakhstan (Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2002, Tourenq <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt</em><em>.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004, Riou <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Uzbekistan (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016a,b). Through its network of breeding facilities in the U.A.E., Morocco and Kazakhstan, the International Fund for Houbara Conservation (IFHC) has a long-term goal to produce 35,000 Asian Houbaras each year for reintroduction into the wild (IFHC 2014). The first releases were made in Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in central Saudi Arabia in 1991. This population is currently estimated to number 250–300 individuals. Further releases have taken place elsewhere in Saudi  Arabia (including at Saja Umm ar Rimth with c.50 individuals [M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016]) and also in U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Yemen, Jordan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. By the end of 2016, 13,504 houbara had been released into the UAE (Azar <em>et al., </em>2018). It is not yet clear what impact the releases of captive-reared birds have on the demographics and genetic integrity of the overall population,&#160;however according to Burnside <em>et al.</em> (2016), in order to compensate for the loss of wild adults to hunting, the number of released birds may need to be as much as 10 times higher than hunting quotas. At least three birds have been satellite tracked from Saudi Arabia to the breeding grounds in Kazakhstan (Zafar-ul Islam <em>et al</em>. 2014). The CMS Asian Houbara Agreement (2005) urges all range countries to take necessary measures to prevent the extinction of any population of Houbara and maintain a favourable status.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The most urgently needed conservation measures are those that will reduce exploitation to a biologically sustainable level. This will require precautionary and scientifically determined limits on the number of birds that can be harvested legally and stricter enforcement of bans on illegal forms of trade and hunting; it also requires in-depth studies of natural productivity in Asian Houbaras in relation to habitat selection and predator abundance. Carry out further surveys to gain an improved estimate of the overall population size and trend; continue research to determine the migration routes, schedules and strategies of all populations. Survey the species throughout the wintering range (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Produce a range-wide action and recovery plan, based on agreement under the Convention on Migratory Species; the CMS Asian Houbara Agreement has been drafted but has not been opened for signature. Develop and implement national and regional species action plans (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Create managed protected areas and review current protected areas. For example, approximately 85% of suitable habitat are outside the existing protected area network of Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;Where they can be shown to be detrimental, reduce grazing and other farming pressures (Goriup 1997, Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004). Establish long-term, range-wide population monitoring studies. Study the overall demographic and genetic consequences of releasing captive-reared birds.

It also occurs up to 4,000 m in Ethiopia, and perhaps 3,000 m in Kenya, and ranges across the thorny <em>Acacia</em>-dominated landscape of Botswana (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It generally avoids human habitation (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. The species is thought to be a long-lived resident that maintains a territory (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994, Murn and Holloway 2014)<strong></strong>. It may generally fly lower than other vultures, and is often the first vulture species to arrive at carcasses (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. While it is often found on the periphery of vulture congregations at large carcasses, it is also often found at small carcasses and is probably an occasional predator (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, Murn 2014, F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. It nests and roosts in trees, most nests being in <em>Acacia</em> spp. or baobabs (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Clutch size is one, the egg being laid a couple of months after rains have finished and the dry season is underway (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Pairs that breed have a success rate of 65-75% (Hustler and Howells 1988, Murn and Holloway 2014), however, up to 61% of pairs do not attempt to breed each year (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1994), often due to the presence of a dependent chick from the previous breeding season (Murn and Holloway 2014)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Reductions in populations of medium-sized mammals and wild ungulates, as well as habitat conversion through agricultural intensification and development throughout its range best explain the current decline (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992, P.

Potential introduction of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which is fatal to <em>Gyps </em>spp. when ingested at livestock carcasses may represent a potential future threat to the species, although livestock have not been recorded as a potential food source for this species (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016).<p></p>","An old estimate of 7,000-12,500 mature individuals was extrapolated from a number of regional estimates. This equates to 10,500-18,750 individuals in total. However, a new estimate of the global population suggests the population is much smaller, consisting of just 5,500 individuals (Murn <em>et al</em>. 2016). This equates to just 3,685 mature individuals here placed in the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;has an extremely large range in sub-Saharan Africa (from <strong>Senegal</strong>, <strong>Gambia </strong>and <strong>Guinea-Bissau</strong> disjunctly east to <strong>Eritrea</strong>, <strong>Ethiopia </strong>and <strong>Somalia</strong>, and south to easternmost <strong>South Africa</strong> and <strong>Eswatini</strong>), where it is uncommon, but generally widespread outside forested regions (Harrison <em>et al.</em> 1997)<strong></strong>. It has declined rapidly in parts of West Africa since the early 1940s (P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 1999, J. M.

The species has probably declined in central <strong>Mozambique</strong> (Parker 2005a), where the population was estimated at 200 pairs (Parker 2005b), but the entire country now contains approximately 150 pairs (Murn <em>et al. </em>2016). The largest protected area in South Africa contains approximately 50 nests (Murn <em>et al</em>. 2013, Murn and Botha <em>in press</em>), but the species is likely to disappear from the country in the near future should current levels of exploitation and other pressures continue (McKean <em>et al</em>. 2013). An extrapolated estimate of the global population suggested there were 2,600-4,700 pairs (7,000-12,500 mature individuals) (Mundy <em>et al.</em> 1992) however new data suggests the population is much smaller, at just 5,500 individuals (Murn <em>et al</em>. 2016).<p></p>","The species is recorded in trade in West and Central Africa (Buij&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).

It is classified as Vulnerable in Namibia (Simmons 2015), Critically Endangered in Uganda and South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (Allan 2015; WCS 2016)<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>. It is covered by a Multi-species Action Plan (MsAP) for the conservation of African-Eurasian vultures (Botha&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;Individuals were marked with patagial tags in Fouta Djallon vulture sanctuary, Guinea, in 2007 to monitor movements and for a toxicological assessment of the vulture population of the park (Rondeau 2008). Additional studies to monitor the movement of individuals within and between protected areas is under way in South Africa (C. Murn <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 2007, a survey began to  establish the extent of diclofenac use for veterinary purposes in  Tanzania (BirdLife International 2008)<strong></strong>, and in 2008 an  awareness-raising campaign at a conference of the World Organisation for  Animal Health in Senegal led to a resolution  being adopted unanimously  by more than 160 delegates to ""request Members to consider their  national situation with the aim to seek  measures to find solutions to  the problems caused by the administration  of diclofenac in livestock""  (Woodford <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008).&#160;At the 2014 Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Migratory Species, a set of guidelines to address poisoning was formally adopted (Ogada&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). The Hawk Conservancy along with the Endangered Wildlife Trust are   currently working on providing training and equipment for anti-poisoning   teams so that field staff will have the skills and equipment to  respond  to and neutralise poisoned carcasses (C.

The majority of its range lies outside Europe where it was not thought to be declining at a sufficiently rapid rate to approach the threshold for Vulnerable. However recent information suggests that the population outside Europe may be exposed to greater threats than was previously thought and has also undergone very rapid recent declines across much of the range. It is therefore classified as Endangered.<p></p>,"It inhabits areas of steppe and semi-desert, and is recorded breeding up to 2,300 m in mountainous regions (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;It feeds mainly on small mammals on its breeding grounds, with susliks forming the vast majority of its diet in some areas; when wintering it appears to feed mainly on mole rats in East Africa, and termites and Red-billed Quelea&#160;<em>Quelea quelea</em>&#160;predominate in southern Africa (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994).&#160;Nests have traditionally been built as large platforms on the ground, although recent habitat alterations seem to have caused a shift to building a few metres higher in bushes or trees (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). It also nests on artificial structures and will occur on rubbish grounds and waste sites (Keijmel 2019).&#160;The species is migratory, with birds wintering in south-east Africa and southern Asia (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrants leave their breeding grounds between August and October/November, returning between January and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Subedi 2014). It avoids sea crossings and thus forms large concentrations at bottleneck sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","The species has declined in the west of its breeding range, including extirpation from Romania, Moldova and Ukraine, as a result of the conversion of steppes to agricultural land combined with direct persecution (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Meyburg and Boesman 2013).&#160;It is also adversely affected by power lines and is very highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind energy developments (STRIX 2012, Meyburg and Boesman 2013). It was recently found to be the raptor most frequently electrocuted by power lines in a study in western Kazakhstan (Levin and Kurkin 2013) and in Saudi Arabia (Shobrak <em>et al. </em>2021). Three sets of factors have been identified as having detrimental impacts on the species in Russia and Kazakhstan: increased mortality owing to collisions with power lines, pesticide poisoning and direct persecution; a reduction in the area of suitable habitat and availability of food, historically due to overgrazing but now due to undergrazing, and to a lesser extent logging and mining; poor breeding success owing to destruction of nests and juvenile mortality during spring fires, entanglement of nestlings in artificial nest materials, and disturbance by people and livestock (Strategy of the Steppe Eagle Conservation in the Russian Federation 2016). Young eagles are taken out of the nest in order to sell them to western European countries (Mebs and Schmidt 2006). Recent studies using social media to assess impacts on wildlife found that the species was also being illegally killed in Jordan, of which the species is legally protected in the country (Eid and Handal 2018). A decline in the number of birds and a reduction in the proportion of juveniles migrating over Eilat, Israel began immediately after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, leading Yosef and Fornadari (2004) to suggest that the species may have been affected by radioactive contamination. This species is vulnerable to the veterinary drug diclofenac (Sharma <em>et al</em>. 2014), which was intensively used in the species's wintering range in Pakistan and India (Oaks <em>et al</em>. 2004).","Combined totals from across the whole range estimate the number of pairs at 31,372 (26,014-36,731), which equates to 62,744 (52,028-73,462) mature individuals or 94,116 (78,042-110,193) individuals (I. Karyakin <em>in litt</em>. 2015).

In Russia the population is estimated to be 2,478–3,688 breeding pairs (including 1,176–1,895 breeding pairs in European Russia), in Kazakhstan there are an estimated 22,000–31,000 pairs (I. Karyakin <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The largest numbers are found within the Russian Federation: Republic of Kalmykia – 194 known breeding territories with an estimated 500-700 breeding pairs; Volgograd district – 50 known breeding pairs, estimated 300–500 breeding pairs; Orenburd district – 139 known breeding pairs, estimated 200–350 breeding pairs; Republic of Altai – 301 known breeding pairs, estimated 400–600 breeding pairs; Republic of Tyva – 140 known breeding pairs, estimated 300–400 breeding pairs (I.

Karyakin&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2016). Migration studies observed 572 Steppe Eagles leaving the Tibetan plateau and heading to wintering grounds (possibly in the Middle East or Africa) in 2012, with a maximum observance of 1,102 individuals in 2013 and 6,166 individuals in 2014 at Thoolakharka, Nepal (Subedi 2014). More recently, 4,900 individuals were observed at a dump sites northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2019 (Keijmel 2019).

Movements are unpredictable and related to abundance of prey species; thought to vary considerably from region to region across polar tundra, and intensity of movements fluctuates annually&#160;(Doyle <em>et al</em>. 2017; Holt <em>et al. </em>2017). During years of abundant prey, increased numbers of young Snowy Owls fledge and hence greater numbers therefore migrate south into the USA from their Canadian/Alaskan Arctic breeding grounds to find sufficient wintering territory, a phenomenon known as a 'snowy owl irruption' (Therrien <em>et al</em>. 2017; Curk <em>et al</em>. 2018; Santonja <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>","Historically, this species was one of the most persecuted owls in North America - thousands of owls were shot for taxidermy, and adults and eggs were hunted for food (Holt <em>et al. </em>2020). Harvesting of the species for food, feathers and claws by native peoples still occurs but has decreased significantly, therefore while it may have a local impact on populations, it is unlikely to have any wider effect on total numbers. In some areas, nesting habitat may be degraded as a result of urban development (Holt <em>et al. </em>2009). Snowy Owls getting caught in traps set for foxes may be a significant threat in some areas (Ellis &amp; Smith 1993, cited in Holt <em>et al. </em>2020), as may secondary poisoning by Warfarin bait set for rats (Campbell &amp; Preston 2009, cited in Holt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Electrocution, aeroplane strikes, collision with vehicles and entanglement in fishing equipment have all been identified as sources of mortality in Alberta, Canada (Holt&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017). Climate change is likely to have a significant impact on the species, as changes in the onset of spring and snowmelt in the breeding areas are likely to affect prey populations (International Snowy Owl Working Group 2010).","Partners in Flight Science Committee (2013) estimated the population to number approximately 200,000 individuals (Partners in Flight Science Committee 2013) (although there is some uncertainty over whether this refers to individuals or mature individuals). However, Potapov and Sale (2013) presented a 'Loose Boid’ method of estimating population size&#160;which gives far lower figures. They concluded that instead of being evenly distributed across the tundra, snowy owls could be found in seven different loose 'boids': very thinly distributed groups which move throughout given areas in line with conditions, especially food availability. The largest of these boids was suggested to be in central northern Canada and could contain 4,000 pairs. In total, they estimated that, on average, each boid may contain 2,000 pairs and so the global population size would be c.14,000 pairs or 28,000 mature individuals, which fits with a maximal estimate of 14,000 females suggested by DNA analyses by Marthinsen <em>et al. </em>(2009). However, they also suggested that the population size could be as low as 7,000-8,000 pairs (Potapov and Sale 2013).

However, recent evidence indicates a stable or slightly positive population trend overall during the last three generations. Consequently it has been listed as Least Concern because it no longer approaches any of the thresholds for Vulnerable under the IUCN criteria. <p></p> <p></p>","It is usually a colonial breeder, often in the vicinity of human settlements. It forages in steppe-like habitats, natural and managed grasslands, and non-intensive cultivation. It is mainly migratory, with most breeders overwintering in sub-Saharan Africa, although some travel to parts of north-west Africa, southern Europe and southern Asia. Migrants leave their breeding grounds in September and return between February and April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). It migrates in flocks of varying sizes, usually tens to low hundreds, often with other falcons such as <em>F. tinnunculus</em>, <em>F. vespertinus</em> and <em>F. amurensis</em> (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Large numbers, sometimes up to thousands, gather at roosts on migration (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). They cross water bodies readily on a broad front, flying high enough to be barely detectable; they fly lower over land (often c.20-30 m), particularly on northward migration (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).<br/><p></p>","The main cause of its decline in the second half of the 20th century was habitat loss and degradation in its Western Palearctic breeding grounds, primarily a result of agricultural intensification, but also afforestation of low-productive farmland with wood plantations, land abandonment and urbanisation (Iñigo &amp; Barov 2010). The use of pesticides caused drastic reduction in prey, poisoning and reduced breeding success (during the period of DDT use) (Orta &amp; Kirwan 2020).&#160;In South Africa, key grasslands have been lost to agricultural intensification, afforestation and intensive pasture management (Pepler 2000). The neglect or restoration of old buildings has resulted in the loss of nest-sites (Davygora 1998, J.-P. Biber <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>.</em> 1999). At La Crau in southern France, where such nest sites are rare, a population increase in the 1990s may be linked to the progressive selection of ground nests in stone piles, reducing interspecific and intraspecific competition (Prugnolle <em>et al.</em> 2003). Survival of juveniles overwintering in the Sahel region is strongly correlated with rainfall (Mihoub&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010), therefore an increased frequency of draught conditions brought about by climate change is likely to affect the species. High levels of chick mortality recorded during unusually hot weather (particularly in nest boxes) may also be a cause of concern given projected levels of global warming (Orta &amp; Kirwan 2020). Collision with power cables or wind turbines may pose an additional threat (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018; Pescador <em>et al. </em>2019). Lesser Kestrels may be trapped in North Africa to use as lures to attract target species, however this is not thought to be a significant threat (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>). In some areas, nests may be deliberately destroyed due to sanitary concerns or the noise produced by the birds (Iñigo &amp; Barov 2010).","The European population is estimated at 32,900-42,600 pairs, which equates to 65,800-85,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Several thousand pairs breed outside this range, principally in central Asia. The population in China has been estimated at c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration (Brazil 2009). The population in Kazakhstan has been estimated at 5,000-10,000 pairs (Wassink &amp; Oreel, cited in Orta &amp; Kirwan 2020). The population in North Africa is estimated to be at least 2,500-3,000 breeding pairs (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>).

Several thousand pairs breed outside this range, principally in central Asia. Western Palearctic populations have undergone serious declines, although a few have begun to increase again. The western European population has declined by c.95% since 1950, and the species has disappeared from the Ural region of Russia and from northern Kazakhstan, as well as from the western and central parts of the Balkan Peninsula (Davygora 1998, B. Barov<em> in litt.</em> 2007). However, some populations in south-western and central Europe are stable or increasing (Iñigo and Barov 2010) and eastern breeding populations are also reported to be stable (Galushin 2009). Italy has seen a marked population increase and range expansion since 2000 (N. Baccetti<em> in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2010), and the population in Andalucía, Spain, increased from c.2,100 pairs in 1988 to c.4,800 in 2009 (J. R. Garrido<em> in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2011). In Kazakhstan, the species appears to be stable or increasing slightly, perhaps in association with the abandonment of villages and livestock stations in the 1990s (J. Kamp <em>in l<em>itt</em></em><em>.</em> 2010). Coordinated counts of the South African wintering population recorded 117,000 birds in 2005/2006 (van Zyl 2007, A. van Zyl <em>in litt. </em>2007) and 98,000 birds in 2006/2007 (A. van Zyl <em>in litt. </em>2007), but it is not clear whether this represents a genuine reduction in numbers or whether the missing birds were wintering elsewhere, most likely in East Africa (A. van Zyl <em>in litt. </em>2007).

Those breeding at lower latitudes or in the Southern Hemisphere tend to be resident (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrating birds leave their breeding sites between August and November, and return between March and May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrants readily fly over expanses of sea and ocean. Most birds travel singly or in pairs, even on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat</strong> It inhabits an extreme variety of habitats, tolerating wet and dry, hot and cool climates, from sea level up to c.4,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet</strong> Birds make up most of its diet, principally pigeons and doves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Eggs are usually laid in a scrape or depression in a rock face, with no nest being built (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information</strong> Populations recovered following the ban of harmful hydrocarbons in most countries, which appears important to the birds’ survival (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Historically, the species was affected by shooting in the U.K., notably during the Second World War (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Persecution throughout its range was the major threat in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries (Snow and Perrins 1998). While persecution has decreased significantly since the species received legal protection, illegal persecution still occurs in some areas, for example four Peregrines were confirmed illegally poisoned and nine shot, trapped, or nests destroyed in the UK in 2014 (RSPB 2014). Severe population declines in the 1960s-1970s were driven by eggshell breakage and mortality of adults and embryos from the hydrocarbon contamination associated with pesticides of that time (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Rock climbing activities may pose a threat to the species's nest sites (Global Raptor Information Network 2015), and careless methods of field study may result in abandonment of eggs (White <em>et al. </em>2020). In its West African range, the species may be vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). In North Africa, the main threat to the species is illegal trapping and collection of nestlings for use in falconry (Garrido <em>et al. in prep</em>). It is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012), and collision or electrocution from electricity cables may be common in some areas (White <em>et al. </em>2020). An oil spill in northern Spain was thought to have reduced reproductive success and caused adult mortality in the local population (Zuberogoitia <em>et al</em>. 2006). Urban fledglings are at threat from collisions with cars, windows and other man-made objects (White <em>et al. </em>2020). Warming of sea temperatures may reduce plankton and associated seabirds that serve as a food source for some populations of Peregrine Falcons (Nelson &amp; Myres 1976).","Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020) estimate the population in the USA/ Canada to be c.72,000 individuals. The North African population is estimated to be 2,290-2,900 pairs (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>). The European population is estimated at 16,100-31,100 pairs, which equates to 32,200-62,100 mature individuals (BirdLife International <em>in prep.</em>). Europe forms approximately 13% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 248,000-478,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

Migrant birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October, and those arriving in sub-Saharan Africa do so from October onwards (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The return journey begins from February through until April (the exact time probably dependent on food availability), and is often undertaken in small mixed groups with <em>F. naumanni</em> and occasionally <em>F. vespertinus </em>(Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species can be solitary or gregarious, being most often seen singly but sometimes travelling in flocks of up to 10 individuals, especially on migration. Larger groups may congregate at sources of abundant food. It is mainly diurnal (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). <strong>Habitat </strong>The species tolerates a wide range of open and partially forested habitats, and has been recorded up to 4,500 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>It feeds mainly on small mammals, particularly in northern Europe, with insects possibly more important in Africa and the Mediterranean (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>The locations of nests are variable, with rock ledges, buildings and abandoned corvid nests being commonly reported sites (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>Birds require suitable perches and roosting sites, usually provided by trees, telegraph poles, buildings or rock faces (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","<p>Past population declines resulted from the heavy use of organochlorine and other pesticides in the 1950s-1960s (Orta and Boesman 2013).

In Malta, the species was exterminated by shooting, though it has since returned (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The population in much of the rest of Europe has shown a more recent steady decline, thought to be due to agricultural intensification (Snow and Perrins 1998).

Migratory birds winter in southern Africa and southern Asia; northern birds leave their breeding grounds in September and return in March and April, and those breeding in South Africa move northwards in March and return in August (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). Migrants are thought to partially cross water on a broad front (assumed from regular occurrence on islands across the Mediterranean), but nevertheless many pass through bottleneck short crossing points each season. Birds tend to be seen singly or in pairs, and even on migration rarely form groups of more than five, and stay away from other raptors (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds soar c.200-300 m above the ground when hunting (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). <strong>Habitat </strong>It is a species of open woodland, preferring patches of forest interspersed with open areas; it is recorded up to 3,000 m (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Diet </strong>Small birds are the most important part of its diet (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built in trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994). <strong>Management information </strong>A mixture of woodland and open areas such as agricultural fields is optimal for this species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Threats affecting the species include habitat degradation, direct persecution and human disturbance (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001,&#160;Orta and Boesman 2013).

Powerlines were responsible for 19.5% of Booted Eagles mortalities in Spain during 1990-2006, with the number of cases increasing throughout the period (Martinez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). In the same study, illegal killing was responsible for 32.5% of mortalities, however the number of cases decreased significantly during the study period. The majority (19.5%) of killings were shootings, however nest robbing and captivity, trapping, and poisoning also occurred (Martinez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Poaching was also identified as a threat in Armenia, primarily due to fears over them killing domestic birds such as chickens and pigeons (Aghababyan &amp; Stepanyan 2020). Several Booted Eagles were shot during migration on Malta in 2016 (RSPB 2017). The trade of this species in Moroccan markets has been reported (Garrido <em>et al. in prep.</em>).

206634667,61695117,Buteo buteo,Least Concern,,2021,2021-08-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (extent of occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population trend appears to be stable, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour&#160;</strong>Populations in Scandinavia and most of the former Soviet Union are migratory, wintering in Africa and southern Asia. Those elsewhere are resident (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). Migrants move south between August and November and make the return journey between February and May. Birds tend to occur singly or in pairs, sometimes forming small family groups at roosts. However, they can migrate in groups, and as birds avoid sea crossings (and even freshwater bodies) as far as possible, they form huge concentrations at peninsulas and narrow straits (Brown&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Migration is strictly diurnal, and also often follows mountain ranges and ridges (Brown&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1982).&#160;<strong>Habitat&#160;</strong>It inhabits a wide variety of habitats but requires at least some tree cover for nesting and roosting; ideal habitat appears to be forest edge, or mosaics of forest and open areas (del Hoyo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994). In winter also uses more open areas, such as steppe, pasture and wetlands, migrants within Africa also use savanna (Global raptor information network, 2021).&#160;<strong>Diet </strong>It is versatile depending on the prey animals available, with small mammals usually predominating, but in some areas invertebrates making up the majority (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).&#160;<strong>Breeding site </strong>The nest is built on a fork or branch of a large tree, usually near to forest edge (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).&#160;<strong>Management information </strong>Although versatile in its habitat choice, trees are required particularly on its breeding grounds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1994).","Historically the most important threat has been persecution from shooting and poisoned bait traps (Orta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). Whilst persecution is now illegal in much of the Eurasian Buzzards' range and perceptions towards raptors have improved, reducing levels of shooting, in other regions it is still a considerable threat (Kalpakis&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009, Cianchetti-Benedetti&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016). In agricultural areas unintentional poisoning from pesticides and rodenticides, or ingestion of led shot are likely causing some localised declines (Coeurdassier&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2003, Battaglia&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Orta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020). The Eurasian Buzzard is one of the most common species in Europe to be effected by collision-mortality, with power lines, vehicles and wind energy developments (Lehman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007, Strix 2012, Vidal–Vallés&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). Whilst it is a generalist species able to use agricultural and suburban areas, it shows preference for mosiac habitats near woodland, and as such it has suffered from wide-spread agricultural intensification and urban development due to the removal of suitable trees for nesting sites, fragmentation and loss of connectivity with woodlands&#160;(Sergio&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Butet&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Orta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Asian populations are effected by low levels of use and hunting on breeding grounds, as live birds are traded at bird markets in Kuwait (Al-Sirhan &amp; Al-Bathali 2010) and hunted for sport in Jordan (Eid &amp; Handal 2018), but also on migration (Sandor&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160;Little is known about threats facing this migratory populations which spend the non-breeding period in southern Africa.","<p>The European population is estimated at 882,000-1,230,000 pairs, which equates to 1,760,000-2,460,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International&#160;<em>in prep</em>).&#160;Europe forms approximately 75% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 2,038,000-3,463,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. It is placed in the band 2,000,000-3,500,000 mature individuals.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"Widespread species occurring across Europe to central Asia. European populations are predominately resident, however some are partially migratory travelling to southern Europe or north-west Africa in winter. Eastern European and central Asian breeding populations are highly migratory, travelling to southern Africa (Orta <em>et al</em>., 2020)","Asian populations are effected by low levels of use and hunting. Live birds are traded at bird markets in Kuwait (Al-Sirhan &amp; Al-Bathali 2010) and hunted for sport in Jordan and Georgia (Sandor <em>et al</em>. 2017, Eid &amp; Handal 2018).<br/><p><br/></p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p><strong>Conservation actions underway</strong><br/> The species is listed on CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendix II and Raptors MoU Category 2.
