It can be found in rocky areas. Animals have been recorded from firm sandy beaches (U.A.E). It can be found on gravelly plains with sparse vegetation,  and in coastal areas. In southern Sinai it lives in coastal sand with very small hillocks. In Lebanon it inhabits open areas in semi-desert. It is also known from gravel plains and blown sand areas in wadis. The female lays five clutches of between one and six eggs per year.","While there are local threats to some populations there are no widespread, major threats to this species. The Lebanese population of <em>Mesalina brevirostris</em> is on the edge of its range, and it could be at the limits of its ecological tolerance. In Egypt, it is threatened outside of protected areas by urban development and off-road vehicles. Overgrazing appears to be a problem in parts of the range. In Iraq, it may have been affected by recent wars.  In Turkey, there are no major threats to this species.","It is very common in rocky mountainous areas of Saudi Arabia. This is a common species in Jordan, but is rare and restricted in Lebanon and Egypt.

1956551,19070,Rafetus euphraticus,Endangered,A4c,2017,2016-05-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Endangered because of serious population declines, estimated to be as much as 50% over the last 15 years, inferred from observed reduction in the extent of its habitat.&#160;While the percentage decline over time is difficult to estimate in the absence of historical records or even present data from substantial parts of the range, the systemic impacts of documented threats (dam effects, marsh drainage, wars and political conflicts) have lead to habitat fragmentation, destruction and desertification,&#160;such that a &gt;50% population reduction over three generations (estimated at 45 years, with 15 years per generation) is realistic and possibly an underestimate. <em>Rafetus euphraticus</em> was listed as Endangered under criteria A1ac+2c (version 2.3) in the 2003 IUCN Red List.&#160;It is certainly a Critically Endangered species in Turkey, CR A2bc, and probably in Syria and Iran as well. In Iraq, encompassing the majority of its range, the species probably qualifies globally as Endangered, EN A4c.","<p><em>Rafetus euphraticus</em> is almost exclusively riverine, inhabiting&#160;various freshwater habitats,&#160;preferably permanent and temporary tributaries and oxbow lakes, as well as slow-flowing sections of the main river channel (Gramentz 1991, Taskavak and Atatur 1998, Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2014, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016). The species is particularly thermophilic (Taskavak and Atatur 1998).&#160;<em>Rafetus euphraticus</em> feeds mainly on&#160;crabs, insects, and&#160;fish, but also scavenges and takes some vegetable material (Taskavak and Atatur 1998, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016). Nests are placed in sandy riverbanks close to the waterline.&#160;The nesting season in Iran extends from late April to early June, with mating observed in March; hatchlings emerge from their nest in early July (Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2013, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;Reported clutch sizes average 30–40 eggs (Taskavak and Atatur 1998, Baran and Atatur 1998, Biricik and Tugra 2011, Ghaffari <em>et al.</em> 2013, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016), but there is no information on clutch frequency, age or size at maturity, or generation time. Eggs are spherical in shape and 29.5 mm in diameter and the average weight is 13.6 g (Biricik and Tuğra 2011); the mean size of hatchlings is 41.5 mm and the mean weight 10.8 g (Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Maximum size is 68 cm carapace length and generation time is estimated at about 15 yrs.</p><p></p>","Anthropogenic fragmentation, alteration, and destruction of suitable habitat <span class=""s1"">throughout its range are the main threats to <em>Rafetus euphraticus </em>(Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;Major dams cause fundamental changes to water quality and the flow regime downstream, making it impossible for <em>R. euphraticus</em> to survive in long downstream riverine stretches. The loss of sandbank nesting habitat through flooding and sand mining is also a serious threat (Gramentz 1991, 1993b; Taskavak and Atatur 1998;&#160;Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;The use of pesticides in agricultural fields next to riverbanks causes pollution along the tributaries (Ayaz and Bayrakçı 2015).&#160;The draining of the&#160;Mesopotamian&#160;Marshes in southeastern coastal Iraq and southwestern Iran after the 1991 Gulf War is likely to have impacted Iraqi populations significantly.&#160;Animals accidentally caught by fishermen may be killed as perceived competitors, and nests destroyed (Taskavak and Atatur 1998, Baran and Atatur 1998, Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2014, Mobaraki in litt.).&#160;Animals are occasionally consumed;&#160;in Iran the turtles are not consumed by locals but it is reported that Chinese employees of the National Iranian Oil Company consume turtles in Hawr-al-Azim marshland along the border of Iraq (Taskavak and Reimann 1998, Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2014, Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Iraq, various wars and political conflicts, drought, dam construction, unsustainable fishing methods, especially electro-fishing, and the use of poisons and explosive materials are the main concerns for <em>Rafetus </em>survival. Furthermore, oil development, especially in southern Iraq and gravel mining in northern rivers threatens <em>R. euphraticus </em>populations (Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016). No information is available on threats to <em>R. euphraticus </em>in Syria, where it occupies territories under severe political unrest and turmoil&#160;(Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 2016). The Chinese Soft Shell, <em>Pelodiscus sinensis,</em> has been imported into Iran illegally and has the potential to become a competitor for <em>R. euphraticus </em>(Ghaffari <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<p>Little information is available on&#160;<em>Rafetus euphraticus</em> populations in most of its distribution, especially in Syria and Iraq, which comprise the bulk of its range.&#160;Gramentz (1993b) documented the extinction of a <em>R. euphraticus</em> population at Kirkiz, on the upper Euphrates, in Turkey, and considered low water temperatures caused by altered water flow dynamics resulting from the 1991 start of operation of the Ataturk dam to be the cause. The species is declining in Turkey because of dams and sand quarries. A total of 17 individuals in 14 different habitats were observed in 30 days in Turkish tributaries of the Euphrates; no individuals were observed along the main arm of the Euphrates, since no suitable habitats were left for nesting or basking, indicating a strong reduction in the previously observed population there (Ayaz and Bayrakçı 2015).

2310398,194299,Albula glossodonta,Vulnerable,A2bcd,2012,2011-03-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Shortjaw Bonefish occurs from Hawaii and French Polynesia to the  Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean, north to southern Japan and  south to Lord Howe Island, Australia. Reflecting results in Colborn <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2001), the geographic range of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. glossodonta</span> is likely representative of multiple species. Data on population decline are available from only a few locations, despite the expansive geographic range. In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and   modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6%   of the total catch; in 1992, they comprised only 7.5% of the total catch. This decline (37.1% in 15 years) was a result of overfishing, as opposed to a change in fishing method and effort (Beets 2000). Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). In Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati, recent studies have demonstrated significant declines in abundance and average size of bonefish in the catch between 1977 and the late 1990s. Given fisheries characteristics throughout the region, we expect that in areas where bonefish are exposed to fishing effort that Tarawa serves as an example of what would likely occur in other areas throughout its range.&#160; In addition, although data on population decline is limited, this species may be closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Valiela <em>et al.</em>(2001) estimate that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a rate of 2% per year.&#160; Using this estimate, mangroves have declined  global by an estimated 27% over the last three generation lengths for <em>A. glossodonta </em>(13.5  years).&#160; Much of this species' distribution lies in the Indo-Pacific,  where up to 14% of mangrove species are listed as threatened  (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) in some places  (Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160; The Indo-Malay Philippine Archipelago  is of particular concern, as it has one of the highest rates of mangrove  loss globally, with an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since  1980 (FAO 2007).&#160; In the tropical Indo-Pacific, 12% of all seagrasses  are currently threatened, and 20% of all seagrass species are  experiencing declines.&#160; In the temperate North Pacific, the  northern-most part of <em>A. glossodonta</em>'s range, 22% of all seagrass  species are threatened, and 44% are experiencing population declines  (Short <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; Given the&#160; declines in these habitats,   we infer that the extreme habitat loss in parts of its   Pacific  range  will have similar negative consequences for population    trajectories. In addition, the recreational fishery is not well-established in the Indo-Pacific region, so there is little economic incentive for conservation; we do not expect conservation to be occurring at present. Therefore, we estimate global decline to equal or exceed 30% over three generation lengths in the past (13.5 years), with some substantially greater localized depletions in parts of the Indo-Pacific. Perhaps the greatest hindrances to the global conservation of this species are uncertainties about population connectivity and taxonomic resolution.

Bonefish were the most important species in the commercial seine  fishery between 1966 and 1970, with average annual yields of nearly  18,000 pounds. Although the presence of multiple species within the  fishery makes species-specific declines hard to pinpoint, the commercial  seine catch now averages only 581lbs per year, accounting for less  than 8% of the catch. Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have declined from over  136.4 mt in 1900 to only 1.2 mt in 2001. This figure, however, includes  all   bonefish species in Hawaii (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/>Heavy fishing pressure and degradation of habitats at Tarawa and Kiritimati Atolls  have resulted in the loss of pre-spawning staging sites and spawning  migration routes, which may be responsible for the observed declines in  bonefish catches, average size, and sex ratios at these locations (Friedlander<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008). There are declines in CPUE, mean length and weight of fish and also a change in sex ratio (Beets 2000). Sex ratio (F:M) was 0.71:1 in 1977 and in 1992–1993 it was recorded as 0.15:1. In 1977, mean length was 46.4 cm and mean weight was 1.3 kg. In 1992, mean length recorded was 37.6 cm and mean weight was 0.84 kg. There was a decrease in the smallest size of sexually mature individuals between the two time periods: in 1977 the smallest size of sexually mature males was 42.5 cm&#160; and 46.5 cm for females; in 1992 is was 32 cm for males and 35 cm for females. In addition, Beets (2000) conservatively estimates that the 30% of total catch was non-reproductive. In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6% of the total catch; in 1992, they comprised only 7.5% of the total catch. Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). The effects of catch-and-release fishing on this species are unclear.<br/><br/>Unrestrained growth of human populations in the coastal zones has also  accelerated habitat destruction, water quality degradation, and  disruption of prey species dynamics. Fishing and habitat loss and degradation may pose the most significant threats to this species. Disruptions to shallow  coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses and mangroves due to climate  change may pose significant future threats to this species, particularly  in areas with accelerated rates of coastal development and  urbanization. <br/><br/>The limited range of this species may  also make it vulnerable to local threats, such as habitat loss  (Friedlander<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008). It has been noted that habitat alteration, fragmentation and loss may contribute to the  decline in abundance of this species in Tarawa (Beets 2000). Bonefish are closely associated with mangroves,seagrasses and other shallow coastal habitats. Given the dramatic  declines in these habitats (Mumby <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004, Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>  2001, Polidoro <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010, Orth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006, Short <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2011), we infer that comparable regional declines are likely  throughout its range. Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2001) estimates that mangroves have  decreased worldwide by 35%, at a rate of 2% per year. Since bonefish rely upon habitats of  limited extent, they are especially susceptible to habitat loss and  degradation, particularly due to climatic and anthropogenic influences. These habitats are often fragmented in nature, exacerbating this  issue. As with other coastal species, fragmentation will likely have  direct and indirect negative impacts on bonefish.","As multiple species within the genus are morphologically  indistinguishable, there is limited species-specific information  available on population status. Commercial landings of bonefish in Hawaii have declined from over 136.4  mt in 1900 to only 1.2 mt in 2001. This figure, however, includes all  bonefish species in Hawaii (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). A recreational fishing guide on Oahu indicated that although netting of  bonefish continues, it is not as prevalent as it once was (Adams pers.  comm. 2011). It is therefore unclear whether the decline in landings is due to a change in effort or a true change in population size. Capture of recruits (CPUE) of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Albula </span>spp. in Kahana, Hawaii was highest in 1999 and has declined by 79% since that time (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).<br/><br/>This species is rare in Mauritius (Sato <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).<br/><br/>In Tarawa, there has been a dramatic increase in scale of effort and  modernization of the fishing gears. In 1977, bonefish comprised 44.6%  of the total catch; in 1992, they were 7.5% of the total catch. This decline (37.1% in 15 years) was a result of overfishing, as opposed to a change in fishing method and effort (Beets 2000). Spawning aggregations are often targeted (Beets 2000). A survey from the Fisheries Division of Kiribati conducted in 1995 shows  that bonefish was the second-most common species caught, accounting for 7% of  total catch. Gill nets caught 82% of the bonefish, with handlines  providing the remainder (18%) of the catch (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). In Tarawa Lagoon, Kiribati, recent studies have demonstrated significant  declines in abundance and average size of bonefish in the catch between  1977 and the late 1990s. The annual take of bonefish from Tarawa Lagoon  is between 1,000,000 and 5,000,000 fish per year, but no stock  assessment has been conducted (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). This species is probably the most abundant molluscivorous fish in the lagoon (Beets 2001). Comparison data from fished and protected locations at Palmyra Atoll   show significant differences in population characteristics which may   indicate that threats are expressed asymmetrically across its range   (Adams pers. comm. 2011).&#160; Given fisheries characteristics throughout the region, we expect that in  areas where bonefish are exposed to fishing effort that Tarawa serves  as an example of what would likely occur in other areas throughout its  range. In addition, the recreational fishery is not  well-established in the Indo-Pacific, so there is little economic incentive for  conservation.&#160; Therefore, we do  not expect conservation to be occurring at  present.<br/><br/>Like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. vulpes</span>, <em>A. glossodonta</em>&#160; may be  closely associated with mangroves and seagrasses and other   shallow  coastal habitats. Valiela <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et  al.</span> (2001)  estimate that mangroves have decreased worldwide by 35%, at a  rate of  2% per year. &#160; Using this estimate, mangroves have declined global by an estimated 27% over the last three generation lengths for <em>A. glossodonta </em>(13.5 years).&#160; Much of this species' distribution lies in the Indo-Pacific, where up to 14% of mangrove species are listed as threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) in some places (Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160; The Indo-Malay Philippine Archipelago is of particular concern, as it has one of the highest rates of mangrove loss globally, with an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007).&#160; In the tropical Indo-Pacific, 12% of all seagrasses are currently threatened, and 20% of all seagrass species are experiencing declines.&#160; In the temperate North Pacific, the northern-most part of A. glossodonta's range, 22% of all seagrass species are threatened, and 44% are experiencing population declines (Short <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160; Given the&#160; declines in these habitats,  we infer that the extreme habitat loss in parts of its   Pacific  range will have similar negative consequences for population    trajectories. <br/><br/>Given population declines of at least 30%&#160; over three generation lengths at Tarawa, significant habitat loss throughout much of its range, we estimate global decline to equal or exceed 30% over three generation lengths (13.5 years),  with some substantially greater localized depletions in parts of the Indo-Pacific.",Decreasing,"<p>The Shortjaw Bonefish occurs from Hawaii and French Polynesia to the Seychelles in the western Indian Ocean, north to southern Japan and south to Lord Howe Island, Australia. Its type locality is in the Red Sea (Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). Reflecting results in Colborn<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> (2001), the geographic range of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. glossodonta</span> is likely representative of multiple species.&#160; <br/></p>","Bonefishes are targeted by commercial, recreational, and subsistence  fishers throughout the Pacific, including the Hawaiian Islands and Cooke Islands. Subsistence fishing for bonefish in  locations such as Tarawa consists of one of the most important protein  sources for the island's human population (Friedlander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2008).",Marine|Marine,"State regulations in Hawaii recently raised the minimum size regulation from 23 cm (9 in.) total length (TL) to 36 cm (14 in.)

As such, we reaffirm the prior assessment of the taxonomically restricted Mojave Desert Tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, as Critically Endangered, and add criterion “a” for direct population observations: CR A2abce+A4abce. The previously defined widespread species&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(<em>sensu lato</em>)&#160;was last assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 1996; a separate assessment currently in progress by the TFTSG for the Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai </em>(previously considered part of <em>G. agassizii</em>)&#160;has provisionally assessed that species as Vulnerable.","The life history of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is typical of long-lived chelonians and has been reviewed by Berry and Murphy (2019). Tortoises require 17–20 years to reach sexual maturity at a straight-line carapace length (CL) of 18 cm or more (Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, Medica <em>et al</em>. 2012). Variation in years is dependent on desert region, frequency of droughts, and quality of available forage. In the northern part of the geographic range, females smaller than 20.9 cm were not reproducing (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998).&#160; Maximum lifespan was estimated by Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) at 75 years, but few live beyond 50 yrs in the wild (Germano 1992). Generation time was estimated to be 20–32 years (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987, USFWS 1994). Based on data from three desert regions, mean sizes of females ranges from 21.4 to 23.1 cm, whereas the mean sizes of males ranged from 24.3 to 24.9 cm; the largest desert tortoises on record, a male, reached 38.1 cm carapace length (Stebbins 2003), whereas a female was 37.4 cm, but these animals were exceptions (Berry and Murphy 2019).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Mature females may lay clutches of one to 10 eggs in up to three clutches per year in spring and early summer; in some years, some females do not lay eggs (Rostal <em>et al</em>. 1994, Henen 1997, Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Wallis <em>et al</em>. 1999, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2015). Annual fecundity ranges from 0 to 16 eggs (Mueller <em>et al</em>. 1998, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2015). Several factors may affect egg production: site, year, size of female, size and number of eggs, and available water and protein from precipitation and forage in the year preceding egg laying, as well as the year eggs are laid (Henen 1997).&#160;<br/><br/>Incubation times for eggs range from 67 to 104 days (Burge 1977, McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012). Hatching success varies and appears to depend on year, location of the nest, and whether it is the first or second clutch. Eggs may be infertile or broken during laying (e.g., 12%; Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). Many nests are destroyed by predators before hatching and the loss of eggs (and nests) varies by year (Turner et al. 1987); they estimated an average loss of 37.1% of nests in a multi-year study. Hatching success in intact nests, undisturbed by predators, has been shown to vary from 73 to 100% (McLuckie and Fridell 2002, Rostal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bjurlin and Bissonette 2004, Ennen <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises inhabit desert scrub habitats, including saltbush, creosote bush, Joshua Trees and Mojave yuccas, and microphyll woodlands with ironwood, palo verde, desert willow, and smoke trees (Berry and Murphy 2019). In the northeastern part of their geographic range, they occur in an ecotone between the Mojave and Great Basin deserts with sand sagebrush and junipers. Actual occurrences tend to be in valleys, alluvial fans, bajadas, and ephemeral stream channels, although tortoises can be found in low sand dunes and on steep slopes of mesas and cliffs (Berry and Murphy 2019).<br/><br/>Desert tortoises are herbivorous and selective in their choice of plant species (Jennings 1993, Oftedal 2002, Oftedal <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jennings and Berry 2015). They primarily eat forbs when available. In years of abundant precipitation, they are selective feeders and prefer specific species of annuals and herbaceous perennials in the legume, mallow, borage, aster, four o’clock, and cactus families (as well as other families). Although they eat grasses, a diet solely of grasses is deficient in nutrients and is likely to inhibit growth and survival, especially in neonate, juveniles, and immature tortoises (Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The quality and quantity of preferred plant foods has diminished because of continuing invasion of non-native annual grasses and forbs and increased fire associated with the highly combustible&#160;non-native grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).&#160;<br/><br/>Annual survival and mortality of adults is dependent on sex, size of the tortoise, frequency and severity of droughts, numbers and types of anthropogenic uses, location, and decade of study. In a multi-year study in the eastern Mojave Desert, annual survivorship of juveniles increased with size, ranging from 0.767 when &lt;6.0 cm to 0.861 when 6.0 to 17.9 cm (Turner <em>et al</em>. 1987). When tortoises reach breeding age at an estimated 18.0 cm, survival rates were 0.87 to 0.944. Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported an annual survival of 0.883 for adults at Joshua Tree National Park. In a study in the Colorado Desert, Agha <em>et al.</em> (2015) estimated adult survival at a wind-turbine energy site (0.96) and an adjacent area (0.92). At two sites in the eastern Mojave Desert, Longshore <em>et al</em>. (2003) reported annual survival of adults of 0.985 and 0.829, with the lower survival rate at a site affected by drought.<br/><br/>Woodbury and Hardy (1948) estimated that 1% of adults died per year in a population mostly comprised of adults. In the northeastern Mojave Desert, Turner <em>et al</em>. (1984) reported mortality rates of 18.4% in a year of drought and 4.4% in a normal year. In the western Mojave Desert, death rates were lowest at a protected Research Natural Area (2.8%/yr) and highest in critical habitat (20.4%/yr). At Joshua Tree National Park, the mortality rate was 11.7% (Freilich <em>et al.</em> 2000), and in Red Rock State Park, 67% (Berry et al. 2008). In a demographic study of tortoises at 21 sites in the central Mojave Desert, mortality rates of adults ranged from 1.9 to 95.2% (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Turner <em>et al</em>. (1987) predicted an annual rate of population increase of <em>ca</em>. 2% in a model based on a tortoise subpopulation in the eastern Mojave Desert between 1977 and 1985. By 2000, this subpopulation had declined precipitously, apparently due to disease (see Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2002) estimated the recruitment rate of young tortoises into the adult subpopulation at 0.092 in a plot in Joshua Tree National Park. This number of tortoises on this plot was thought to be stable between 1991 and 1995, but later declined (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014).","<em>Gopherus agassizii</em>&#160;faces&#160;multiple threats to individuals, populations, and habitat (for annotated bibliographies of reports and published papers, see Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980; Berry 1984; USFWS 1990, 1994, 2010, 2011; Grover and DeFalco 1995; Bury and Luckenbach 2002; von Senckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002; Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2011; Lovich and Ennen 2013a; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015; Berry and Murphy 2019). Recent articles document further examples of threats (Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016; Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b,c). Much of the information with numerous references are contained in Berry and Murphy (2019). Substantial tortoise habitat was already lost to cities, towns, settlements, agriculture, energy developments, and military bases in the 20th century, and continuing habitat loss and degradation, combined with high mortality rates in dwindling low-density populations due to disease (upper respiratory tract disease / mycoplasmosis), road and off-road vehicle-induced mortality, subsidized predators (e.g., ravens), poaching for pets, and mortality from increasing droughts associated with climate change, are threatening most remaining populations of Desert Tortoises (summarized in Berry and Murphy 2019). The majority of desert tortoise populations are currently considered non-viable because of the low density of adults and their existence in isolated and fragmented pieces of habitat (Berry 1984, USFWS 2010, Allison and McLuckie 2018, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).&#160;<br/><br/>Many threats are cumulative in nature and interact synergistically with others. By rating them separately in the Standard Threats Classification Scheme below, the severity of threats and their negative impacts are not described in full measure. One of the limitations of the classification scheme for threats are the ratings for severity. Severity is associated with declines (or not) by percent over 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer. For species such as desert tortoises with long generation times (<em>ca</em>. 20–30 years), this may be 60 to 90 or more years. Here we provide a detailed and expanded Threats Classification Scheme for <em>G. agassizii</em>.<br/><br/><strong>Detailed Threats Classification Scheme<br/><br/></strong>Classification Level<br/><br/>&#160; a. Examples<br/>&#160; b. Timing and Scope<br/><br/>1.1 Housing &amp; urban areas, towns, settlements, ranches<br/>&#160; a. Desert cities, towns, settlements, scattered homes in rural areas, desert land entry, e.g., Inyokern, Ridgecrest, Red Mountain, Trona, Boron, Lancaster, Palmdale, Victorville, Lucerne Valley, Ft. Irwin, Barstow, Daggett, Mountain Pass, Joshua Tree, Twentynine Palms, Vidal Junction, Ludlow, Amboy, Needles, Las Vegas, St. George, Palm Springs, Borrego Springs, Parker, Blythe, El Centro,&#160;Stateline, Las Vegas, Mesquite, St. George.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, disappearance of tortoises and habitat; 20% of geographic range. Loss of habitat from widespread and rapidly growing and expanding cities, towns, and settlements associated with high levels of human population growth in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts and loss and degradation of adjacent habitat (Hughson 2009, U.S. Census Bureau 2010). In the northwest and southwest portions of the geographic range, tortoise populations are locally extinct, absent from valleys and fans and in low densities on military bases.<br/><br/>1.2 Commercial &amp; Industrial<br/>&#160; a. Airports and landing strips, military bases, solar and wind farms.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Severe impacts, loss of tortoises and habitat; 8% of geographic range. Development and use of multiple airports, landing strips, several large military bases with ground disturbing activities (military manoeuvres), and solar and wind farms (with associated transmission lines and roads)&#160;result in degradation and loss of substantial habitat in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts.<br/><br/>1.3 Residential &amp; commercial; golf courses, tourism, recreation<br/>&#160; a. Golf courses are associated with cities and towns that currently exist or are expanding within or near Desert Tortoise habitat (e.g., Las Vegas, Henderson). Vehicle-oriented recreation and visitation are very high in many parts of both deserts including what is now critical habitat, several State Parks and National Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, museums, and other points of interest.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing. Loss and degradation of habitat, illegal collecting of tortoises: 30%. The high levels of visitor use pose severe threats to <em>G. agassizii</em> throughout remaining habitat as well as in critical habitat. For example, at Lake Mead National Recreation, annual records of visitors from 1946 was &gt;1 million visitors per year; by 2018 more than 7.5 million visits occurred (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/"" style=""color: purple;"">https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/Reports/Park/</a>). In parts of critical habitat in the western Mojave Desert, visitor use is very high, e.g., visits and visitor days recorded annually from 2008–2018 ranged from 55,874 to 94,474 visits and 26,218 to 90,445 visitor days per year (USBLM 2019). Visitor use, particularly vehicle-oriented use, is very difficult to control; a substantial portion occurs off-highway and designated trails.&#160;Off-road vehicle recreational uses are associated with higher rates of deaths from gunshots in tortoises occurring in areas with high visitor use days (Berry 1986, 2020a).<br/><br/>2.1.3 Agriculture: Agro-industry farming<br/>&#160; a. Farms for cotton, alfalfa, pistachio, goat-nut, and other crops and dry farming in parts of the geographic range (e.g., Fremont, Antelope, Indian Wells, Victor, Apple, Lucerne, Mojave River, Chuckwalla and Virgin River valleys, bordering the Colorado River).<br/>&#160; b. Severe, cleared land, local areas, often expansive, throughout the geographic range. Historic and ongoing. Habitat and tortoises lost, 10%. Farming began very early (late 1800s) and continues to the present. Farming has negatively affected the water table locally, causing subsidence and fissures to develop in at least one area (Berry 1984), as well as altering vegetation in the vicinity. Habitat cleared for farming generally is used for industrial purposes, e.g., solar or off-road vehicle recreation after abandonment. Both agricultural and industrial uses are associated with influx and proliferation of non-native plants onto adjacent, high quality desert tortoise habitat and protected areas.<br/><br/>2.3.2 and 2.3.3 Agriculture: livestock farming &amp; ranching<br/>&#160; a. Cattle ranching, sheep grazing and driveways, allotments, licenses, and leases (often on federal lands); growing herds of feral burros and expansion into critical habitat.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Moderate to severe, historic (from 1850s), ongoing; 80% of the geographic range affected. Grazing of livestock and use of driveways was widespread and often intensive throughout the geographic range until the Taylor Grazing Act in 1932. Livestock grazing was widespread after that time but managed as an important desert use (e.g., Berry 1984, USBLM 1980). In 1990, after the tortoise was listed as threatened, sheep grazing continued but was excluded from critical habitat. Cattle grazing continued throughout much of critical habitat and still occurs in an estimated 17% of critical habitat (USFWS 2010). Feral burros also graze in tortoise habitats and are encroaching into one critical habitat (USFWS 2010; Berry et al. 2020c). Livestock cause degradation and loss of habitat through development of piospheres, trampling, altering cover, composition of shrubs and forage plants available for tortoises to eat (Webb and Stielstra 1979, Fleischner 1994, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Abella 2008, Tuma <em>et al</em>. 2016). The disturbances created by grazing contributes to growth and proliferation of non-native, fire-prone, invasive grasses (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992).<br/><br/>3.1 Energy production &amp; mining: oil and gas<br/>&#160; a. Oil and gas, drilling and exploration.<br/>&#160; b. Medium severity, local areas, &lt;1% of geographic range. Exploratory drilling has occurred in tortoise habitat and has left degraded and cleared areas of &lt; 1-2 ha, with spoil piles, drilling waste, and trash from the drilling operations spread over the area. These sites became focal points for camping and vehicle-oriented recreation, enlarging over time (K.H. Berry pers. obs.).<br/><br/>3.2 Energy production &amp; mining: mining and quarrying<br/>&#160; a. Small and large mines, exploratory pits, bulldozed areas, shafts, and major mines; quarries.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation on a local or regional scale; 5%. Mining on small and large scales began in the late 1800s, killing tortoises and destroying habitat. Roads were constructed to access potential mining areas and districts (Mojave,&#160;Rand, Atolia, Goldstone, Calico, Mountain Pass). Tortoises fall into pits and shafts and were killed. Some mines cover 7.8 km<sup>2</sup> or more and their influence can expand beyond that. Gold mines are associated with spread of mercury and arsenic in soils and plants far beyond the source (e.g., &gt;12 km), transported by wind and water (Chaffee&#160;and Berry 2006; Kim <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014). Tortoises are negatively affected by these elemental toxicants with poor health; these toxicants were reported in livers, integument, lungs, etc.&#160;(Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, Selzer and Berry 2005, Foster <em>et a</em>l. 2009).<br/><br/>3.3 Energy production &amp; mining: renewable energy<br/>&#160; a. Windfarms, photovoltaic, solar fields; new utility and transmission lines, power poles and towers with adjacent roads accompany these developments.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, future. Severe degradation and loss locally over large areas, 5% over the geographic range. Windfarms occur in tortoise habitat, generally on slopes or on hills and small mountains. Solar panels have been constructed on abandoned agricultural fields or in low density or marginal habitat. However, some projects were built in prime habitat, causing loss of habitat and displacement of tortoises. Solar and wind energy is a growing industry with losses of &gt;106 km<sup>2 </sup>as of 2019 (Mark Massar, U.S. Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>4.1 Transportation and service corridors: roads &amp; railroads<br/>&#160; a. Freeways, 2-lane highways, county gravel or dirt roads, and roads to points of interest; railroads (two major) and several spurs with associated dirt roads and tower lay-down areas for power towers and poles.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe loss and degradation of habitat. 5% throughout the geographic range. Roads were developed in the late 1800s and have proliferated and widened into freeways since that time. Several major freeways and state highways cross the geographic range. Importantly many more dirt roads exist to points of interest (e.g., mines, mining areas, water troughs and water sources, outlying rural areas, recreation areas). Tortoise populations are depleted on either side of highways and well-used roads for distances of &gt;4,000 m (von Seckendorff Hoff and Marlow 2002). A very small portion of these roads and highways have tortoise-proof fencing.<br/><br/>4.2 Transportation &amp; service corridors: utility &amp; service lines<br/>&#160; a. Telephone and electric poles and lines; major transmission lines and corridors.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, moderate to severe. Telephone poles and electric poles and lines usually parallel major or minor paved and dirt roads and extend from towns and cities&#160;into remote areas to provide service to agricultural developments, mines, wind and solar farms and individual residences or small settlements. Electric transmission lines cross many parts of the geographic range, including critical habitat (critical habitat alone: 1,634 km of lines in corridors, total area of corridors, 1,743.5 km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2010).&#160; These corridors are accompanied by dirt roads and spurs to the towers. Often corridors contain several sets of towers and electrical lines. Utility lines also include ground disturbance from fibre optic cables, aqueducts, and gas lines, all of which disturb tortoise habitat. Utility poles and transmission lines have allowed for spread of predators (Common Raven, Red-tailed Hawk) into remote parts of the desert, because they make use of the towers and poles for perching and nesting, leading to increased predation on tortoises (Knight and Kawashima 1993, Anderson and Berry 2019).<br/><br/>4.4 Transportation and service corridors: flight paths or military use<p>&#160; a. Commercial, non-commercial, and Department of Defence flight paths.<br/>&#160; b. Numerous, ongoing. Flight paths are minor or no impact if not associated with release of ordnance (bombing ranges). The noise may have effects on wildlife, including tortoises (e.g., Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1999).<br/><br/>5.1.1 Biological resource use: hunting &amp; trapping terrestrial animals: intentional use (species is the target)<br/>&#160; a. Illegal collecting of <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>for commercial sale, food, cultural purposes, and for international trade, etc.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Tortoises have been and continue to be collected for pets, food, tourism,&#160;commercial sale, and cultural purposes, although such collection has been unlawful since 1939 (Berry 1984, Berry <em>et al</em>. 1996, Berry and Murphy 2019, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.1 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: recreational activities<br/>&#160; a. Visits to State and National Parks and Preserves, National Recreation Areas, federal and state lands, private lands, and Open Recreation Use Areas (unrestricted vehicle play areas) by vehicle-oriented recreationists.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe impacts regionally and locally, especially in the western, central, and southern Mojave Desert and growing in the western Sonoran Desert; associated with proximity to cities, towns, and settlements. Formerly populated with Desert Tortoises, several intensively used areas are now severely degraded and have few if any tortoises (e.g., Bury and Luckenbach 2002, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014a, USFWS 2015, Berry and Murphy 2019). Vehicle-oriented visitation is exceptionally high, ranging from &gt;50,000 to 86,550 between 2008 and 2018 annually in some regions of the Mojave Desert (USBLM 2019). Other parts of the desert and critical habitat are also experiencing growing numbers of visitors. Deaths of desert tortoises from road kills and shooting is higher in areas with high levels of vehicle-oriented visitation (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020b).<br/><br/>6.2 Human intrusions &amp; disturbance: war, civil unrest &amp; military exercises<br/>&#160; a. World War II and subsequent. Military manoeuvres across substantial areas of habitat in the western Sonoran and eastern Mojave deserts to train troops using tanks and other vehicles for the war in North Africa. Since the 1960s, military manoeuvres with armoured vehicles in extensive areas in the western, southern, and central Mojave deserts; aerial bombing training in limited areas in the western Sonoran Desert.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Military manoeuvres in 1942 resulted in severely degraded habitat (compacted soils, damaged desert pavements, altered vegetation, including forage available for desert tortoises. Lands disturbed in 1942 have not recovered after 60 years (Prose 1985, 1986; Prose and Wilshire 2000). Similar disturbances have occurred and continue to occur in tortoise populations and habitat at military installations in the southern and central Mojave Desert. In the early 2000s, expansion of the Fort Irwin military installation in the central Mojave Desert caused loss and degradation of 760 km<sup>2</sup> of tortoise habitat and <em>ca</em>. 304 km<sup>2</sup> of the lost habitat was part of critical habitat (USFWS 2010, Berry and Murphy 2019). An estimated <em>ca</em>. 300 km<sup>2</sup> will be lost with additional, ongoing expansion of the same base. The western expansion of the Marine Corps base at 29 Palms caused hundreds of tortoises to be translocated and habitat lost in the southern Mojave Desert (USDD 2017).<br/><br/>6.3 Work and other activities: law enforcement, illegal immigrants, species research, vandalism<br/>&#160; a. Border patrol agents and illegal immigrants travel cross-country by foot and vehicle in tortoise habitat in the southern border range. Vandalism, specifically wanton shooting or killing of tortoises has affected some populations more than others, probably associated with higher visitor use and vehicle-oriented recreation.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, moderate severity. Border patrol agents travel north from the border into tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, to apprehend illegal immigrants. Vehicle travel can occur off dirt roads, widen existing roads, and create new disturbances. Shooting tortoises, running over them deliberately with vehicles, or otherwise killing them has been documented in both the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts (Berry 1986, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>7.1.1 Fires &amp; fire suppression<br/>&#160; a. Caused by lightning, car fires on highways or roads, arson.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, severe, with the severity dependent on the critical habitat unit or protected area. Mojave and Colorado Desert habitats did not evolve with fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). Fires increased in numbers, frequency, and amounts burned with the invasion and proliferation of non-native grasses which are highly combustible (Berry and Murphy 2019). Fires have occurred throughout the geographic range and have burned significant amounts of critical and other protected habitats in the southern, central, eastern and northeastern Mojave Desert regions. Once habitat burns, it is likely to burn again with higher frequencies and with potentially increased biomass of non-native annual grasses. Tortoises die in these fires or are injured, but some survive (Berry and Murphy 2019). Loss of cover of shrubs and food supply for the tortoises is severe in most burned areas. When fires are very hot, the seed bed may be damaged or destroyed. The most severely burned protected habitat is in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve with &gt;30% burned as of summer 2020 (McLuckie <em>et al</em>. 2021); the Mojave National Preserve also experienced a major fire and loss or degradation of 7% of the critical habitat unit in summer 2020 (Darby <em>et al</em>. 2021). <br/><br/>7.2.8 Abstraction of ground water<br/>&#160; a. For agriculture, primarily, followed by urban and cities.<br/>&#160; &#160; b. Ongoing, long-term degradation of habitat adjacent to cities, towns, industrial and agricultural developments. Depletion of the ground water table causing subsidence and formation of fissures has occurred in at least one part of the western Mojave Desert and in the northeastern Mojave Desert in the Las Vegas Valley in what was once desert tortoise habitat (Berry 1984, Burbey 2002). In the western Mojave Desert, the water table was depleted by agricultural uses (cotton, alfalfa) and now with solar energy development; and by cities in the Las Vegas Valley by depleted associated aquifers. Other regions have and continue to experience depletion of the water table in areas with agriculture and desert cities, e.g., adjacent to the Mojave, Colorado, and Virgin rivers (Stamos <em>et al</em>. 2001). Water is sought from sources and regions outside desert tortoise habitat (e.g., the Colorado River) to support cities and towns, as well as agriculture, because existing water tables are insufficient to support them.<br/><br/>8.1.2 Invasive and other problematic species, genes &amp; diseases: Named species<br/>&#160; a.&#160;<em>Bromus madritensis </em>ssp<em>. rubens, B. tectorum, Schismus </em>spp<em>., Erodium cicutarium, Hirschfeldia incana, Brassica tournefortii.<br/></em>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe degradation of the Mojave and western Sonoran ecosystems. Landscape conservation forecasting (Provencher <em>et al</em>. 2011) quantified the pervasive abundance of annual brome grasses that foster destructive wildfires of a size and intensity far greater than the fire regime with which Mojave Desert habitats developed over the past millennia.&#160;In addition to supporting fires, the non-native grasses compete with native forage species of forbs required by tortoises to grow, reproduce, and remain healthy. Non-native grasses and forbs dominate the ecosystem in biomass in both wet and dry years in many tortoise habitats (Brooks and Berry 2006, Berry 2014b). Non-native grasses are not nutritious plants for tortoises to eat and cause weight loss and can cause death in juveniles (Hazard <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). The awns of <em>Bromus</em> also can injure tortoise mouths. The non-native <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em> and especially <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, introduced through agricultural development, also compete with native forage species, changing the composition of the native flora (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b). They are not eaten by tortoises and can be high in oxalates, potentially a source of oxalosis in tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>8.1.2 Diseases. Named species<br/>&#160; a. Infectious diseases: <em>Mycoplasma agassizii, M. testudineum, </em>Testudinid herpesvirus 2 (TeHV2); Non-infectious diseases: oxalosis, gout, starvation, dehydration.<br/>&#160; b. Infectious diseases: ongoing, severe in some areas. The two species of <em>Mycoplasma</em> are infectious pathogens. The first (<em>M. agassizii</em>) was discovered in wild populations in 1989 and the second (<em>M. testudineum</em>) a few years later (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991, 2014). These pathogens are spread by contact between tortoises cause disease and death in some populations, and inhibit olfaction necessary for foraging (Jacobson and Berry 2012, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2014). <em>Mycoplasma agassizii</em> is common in captive desert tortoises, more so than in wild populations. Epidemiological studies indicate that the distribution of the two species differs, and that tortoises with antibody-positive tests for the diseases occur closer to human habitations rather than more distant (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mycoplasmosis has been implicated as a major contributor to a catastrophic die-off of tortoises at the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2020b). It is also associated with declines in other parts of the geographic range (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160; Non-infectious diseases of known etiology include oxalosis, gout, and starvation and dehydration (Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2002, Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2009). Some individuals and populations have been negatively affected by these diseases.<br/><br/>8.2.2 Problematic Native Species<br/>&#160; a. The Common Raven (<em>Corvus corax)</em>, an uncommon to rare resident between the 1920s and 1940s in the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts, is now an abundant predator in ecosystems where the Desert Tortoise lives.&#160;Red-tailed Hawks (<em>Buteo jamaicensis</em>) is another similar predator, and Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>) can also be a hyper-predator.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe and negative effects on population structure; loss of juveniles and immature tortoises. Populations of the Common Raven have grown enormously, supported by subsidies of food, water, perch and nest sites available from humans (Boarman 1993, Boarman and Berry 1995). They have been able to access formerly remote parts of the desert by relying on settlements, road kills and trash along highways and roads, and utility poles and transmission lines for perching and nesting (Knight and Kawashima 1993). Common Ravens are very effective predators on hatchling, juvenile and immature tortoises, with dozens to hundreds of shells recorded beneath perch and nest sites. They are responsible for preventing recovery in many parts of the desert by depleting young tortoise cohorts in populations that can lead to local extinctions (Kristan and Boarman 2003). Red-tailed Hawks have expanded their use areas into remote parts of the desert ecosystems, using utility poles and towers as nest sites and juvenile tortoises for food (Anderson and Berry 2019). Similarly, Coyotes are subsidized predators found in increased numbers near cities, towns, and some military installations and at times have high predation rates on tortoises (Esque <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>8.4.2 Problematic Species/ Diseases: Named Species<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Several non-native species of tortoises and turtles carrying disease or potentially carrying disease have been released illegally into Desert Tortoise habitats, e.g., African Spurred Tortoise (<em>Centrochelys</em> <em>sulcata</em>; Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018) and Central Asian Steppe Tortoise (<em>Testudo horsfieldii</em>; Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2013, Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.).<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe. Releases of tortoises, whether native or non-native are illegal in large parts of the geographic range. Nevertheless, introduced, non-native turtles and tortoises such as the African Spurred Tortoise and Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise have been found to carry new diseases that would negatively affect already declining <em>G. agassizii </em>populations (Nelson 2010; Anonymous 2018). The African Spurred Tortoise can do damage to habitat and to the native tortoise, <em>G. agassizii</em>, because of the large size and aggressive nature. One Central Asian Steppe&#160;Tortoise was captured in the Central Mojave Desert with a new herpesvirus not previously described in <em>G. agassizii&#160;</em>(Winters <em>et al</em>. in prep.). The concern is that this non-native tortoise may have transmitted the new herpesvirus to desert tortoises. New, non-native herpesviruses from other species and countries and continents are a threat to health in already declining <em>G. agassizii</em> populations.<br/><br/>8.5 Viral/Prion-induced Diseases<br/>&#160; a. Herpesviruses are implicated in illness and mortality in tortoises.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, potentially severe if coupled with other stressors. Herpesviruses are a threat to health and survival of desert tortoises, especially those herpesviruses introduced from other, non-native species to the desert. Tortoises with clinical signs of the disease were among populations that severely declined between the 1990s and 2000s; herpesvirus may have contributed in some areas (Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003). Testudinid herpesvirus 2 was first identified in captive tortoises, then confirmed in wild <em>G. agassizii</em> (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012). The estimated prevalence of this herpesvirus for captive and wild tortoises from the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts ranged from 15 to 56% (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>8.6 Diseases of Unknown Cause<br/>&#160; a. Shell diseases, i.e., cutaneous dyskeratosis, necrosis.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. A novel shell disease, cutaneous dyskeratosis and shell necrosis, was implicated in illness and deaths of Desert Tortoises (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1994; Homer <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2001) and a decline of ca. 80% in a once-robust population. Other populations in critical habitats appear to be affected similarly. This is a metabolic disease with lesions of the shell and integument as outward manifestations. The causes are suspected to be toxicants (e.g., elemental toxicants and/or nutritional deficiencies). The disease is implicated in elevated death rates in adult tortoises in the western Sonoran Desert and eastern Mojave Desert (Berry and Medica 1995, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>9.2.2 Industrial &amp; military effluents<br/>&#160; a. Seepage from mining.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, unremediated regionally. There are links between some diseases in tortoises and toxicants from mining and other similar developments. Tortoises dying of upper respiratory tract disease caused by <em>Mycoplasma</em> spp. in the western Mojave Desert in close proximity to a mining district had high levels of mercury in livers compared to tortoises without the disease (Jacobson <em>et al</em>. 1991). Ill tortoises with high levels of arsenic occurred in an area mining district with high levels of mercury and arsenic (Selzer and Berry 2005). Waste from the mines was transported by wind and water to distances of 15 km (Chaffee and Berry 2006; Kim et al. 2012, 2014). Mines in other tortoise habitat in different desert regions have yet to be examined.</p><p>9.4 Garbage &amp; Solid Waste<br/>&#160; a. Trash is a threat to tortoises because they can consume it or become entangled.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, low to moderate. Consumption of trash can lead to illness and death (Donoghue 2006, Walde <em>et al</em>. 2007). Balloons and other trash are common throughout the desert and most abundant near human habitations, along roads, and recreation use areas (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2008, 2014a; Keith <em>et al</em>. 2008). Trash attracts predators—Common Ravens, Coyotes, and other canids—thus creating an additional risk to tortoises.<br/><br/>9.5 Air-borne Pollutants<br/>&#160; a. Pollutants such as atmospheric nitrogen and increases in CO<sub>2</sub> enhance the growth of invasive grasses and thus fire.<br/>&#160; b. Atmospheric nitrogen from urban or other areas is transported to deserts and tortoise habitat, and deposited on soils, thus enhancing growth of non-native grasses and plants prone to fire (Brooks 2003, Rao and Allen 2010).<br/><br/>11.1 Habitat Shifting &amp; Alteration<br/>&#160; a. Desertification; degradation of vegetation, soils, and topography<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, severe. Throughout the geographic range, most, if not all, tortoise habitats have received (and continue to receive) one or more anthropogenic uses and activities resulting in compacted or eroded soils and alteration of the natural structure and composition of annual and perennial vegetation (e.g., Lei 2009). Long-lived shrubs and native annual wildflowers and grasses have been replaced in part with short-lived colonizers (shrubs, non-native, fire-prone grasses) typical of disturbed areas. These changes have brought fewer places to dig burrows and a reduced supply of nutritious plants to eat (Brooks and Berry 2006, Webb and Wilshire 1983). In some areas, the rich diversity of shrubs and annual plants have been replaced by a few shrub species and the annuals replaced with primarily non-native annual species (Brooks and Berry 2006).<br/><br/>11.2 Droughts<br/>&#160; a. Desert Tortoises require water from precipitation and a diverse diet of native annuals to grow, reproduce and survive.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, increasingly severe with reduced survival throughout the geographic range, often associated with hyper-predation by coyotes. Although the Mojave and western Sonoran deserts are typified by droughts often lasting more than a year, tortoises have adaptations to cope. However, tortoises die of starvation and dehydration during prolonged droughts (Berry <em>et al.</em> 2002, Christopher <em>et al</em>. 2003, Longshore <em>et al</em>. 2003, Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2014). Juveniles are especially vulnerable. With climate change and warming, droughts, including megadroughts lasting 10 years or more, are predicted to occur in coming years (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2017, Steiger <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>11.3 Temperature Extremes<br/>&#160; a. Tortoises are able to withstand the extremes of temperature experienced in the desert; however, increases in warm temperatures coupled with drying and changes in precipitation patterns present high risks to the species.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing and a growing issue, with climate change having negative impacts throughout the geographic range. Tortoises cope with the extremes of summer and winter temperatures (and lack of water, see 11.2) by using deep burrows and restricting above-ground activities and reproduction during drought. As temperatures rise with the rise in CO<sub>2 </sub>and other greenhouse gases, tortoises will need to find habitats where deeper burrows can be excavated. At the higher temperatures, the spring season for foraging on ephemeral annuals and egg laying is likely to be shortened, reducing the time for eating, growing, and egg production. Sex of tortoises is determined by temperature of incubation in nests, with females produced at the higher temperatures and males at the lower temperatures. Eggs laid in nest that will experience the high temperatures of summer may be predominantly female, and if temperatures are excessive, may not be viable. Although the species could survive at higher (and cooler) elevations, the habitat in mountain ranges will be more limited, steep, rocky, with exposed bedrock in places with inadequate forage.<br/><br/>12.1 Other Threats<br/>&#160; a. Climate Change.<br/>&#160; b. Ongoing, see 11.2 and 11.3. Change in timing and amounts of precipitation coupled with increasing temperatures are likely to have profound negative effects on the species, further reducing available habitat (e.g., Barrows 2011). Profound changes are predicted to cause deterioration in composition, structure, diversity and biomass of trees and shrubs (Munson et al. 2016) that provide shade and cover to the tortoises. Barrows (2011) predicted that tortoises may survive if they move from the western Colorado Desert to higher elevations.&#160; However, the long-lived tortoises have strong fidelity to existing home ranges.</p>","Population estimates and trends have previously been difficult to obtain with certainty for large segments of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> populations due to their patchy distribution, difficulty of detection, and associated statistical weaknesses of population estimates. Population data have been variously documented or reviewed by Woodbury and Hardy (1948), Hardy (1976), Berry (1984, 1986, 1989), Bury and Corn (1995),&#160;Freilich <em>et al</em>. (2000), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Berry and Murphy (2019). A recent rigorous range-wide population reassessment of&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;by Allison and McLuckie (2018) has demonstrated continued adult population declines in four of the five&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;recovery units and inadequate recruitment with decreasing percentages of juveniles in all five recovery units and low densities in nearly all subpopulations near the minimum required to remain viable (3.9 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>Between the 1930s and early 2000s, estimates of density and trends in populations were based on demographic data, habitat condition, and anthropogenic threats from both long- and short-term study plots of varying sizes, as well as reports by government agency personnel and expert observers (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948; Hardy 1976; Berry 1984, 1989). The study plots were limited in number and did not represent the entirety of subpopulations across the geographic range (e.g., Berry 1984). The subpopulation on the Beaver Dam Slope, Utah, was federally listed as threatened in 1980 (USFWS 1980). A petition submitted by the Desert Tortoise Council in 1984 to list all wild populations in the United States was denied; the USFWS determined that listing of U.S. populations was warranted but precluded because of other higher priorities (USFWS&#160;<span style="""">1985</span>). In 1989 and 1990, the State of California and USFWS listed the tortoise as threatened (USFWS <span style="""">1989,&#160;1990;</span> California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2016). The appearance of upper respiratory tract disease and rapidly declining populations in the western Mojave and a major decline in tortoises in parts of the western Sonoran (Colorado Desert, California) associated with appearance of shell disease were additional threats to the many causes of declines (USFWS 1990, 1994, and references therein). Reflecting its concern over these declines, USFWS (1994:3) stated that: “The most serious problem facing the remaining desert tortoise population is the cumulative load of human and disease-related mortality accompanied by habitat destruction, degradation, and fragmentation. Virtually every extant desert tortoise subpopulation has been affected by one or more of these factors.” As a result, the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994) also designated federal critical habitat units for desert tortoises at that time.&#160;In October 2020, the California Fish and Wildlife Commission accepted a petition from Defenders of Wildlife to up-list wild desert tortoises from threatened to endangered status; California has the largest subpopulation and geographic range of the species. The petition is currently under consideration by the agency with a response estimated in 2021.<br/><br/>To better measure trends in densities of adult populations in the threatened subpopulations, the Recovery Team proposed development of a landscape scale program (USFWS 1994). At the same time, the Recovery Team also noted the importance of study plot data, because more population attributes were provided than density of adults. After experimenting with different techniques, the USFWS decided to use distance sampling and initiated a formal, range-wide program for estimating densities of adult populations in critical habitat units (USFWS 2015, and references therein).<br/><br/>In the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994), population size, viability, and sizes of protected areas were discussed. Assuming the minimum density of adults in a population was “approximately 10 adults per square mile” (equivalent to 3.9 adults/km<sup>2</sup>), the target size for protected areas (then called Desert Wildlife Management Areas) was approximately 1,000 mi<sup>2</sup> (ca. 2,590 km<sup>2</sup>). This would ensure that even at such low densities and assuming half of such large areas might support no or few tortoises, each protected area would support enough adults for a genetically minimum viable population. The Recovery Team recommended six Recovery units with 12 different populations. The updated Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011) is based on the same number of populations but configured into five revised Recovery units with 17 different monitored subpopulations.<br/><br/>Most demographic data from study plots collected from the 1930s on the Beaver Dam Slope and between 1979–1980 in California and Nevada during the spring season indicated counts of 5–64 adult tortoises/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Berry and Murphy 2019). In describing trends between 1978 and 1990 in California, the USFWS summarized data from 10 study plots in the Mojave and Colorado deserts and reported a highly significant downward trend (USFWS 1994). Additional data for the period showed some populations with low but potentially stable densities in Nevada (Berry and Medica 1995). A review of population status (Tracy <em>et al</em>. 2004) considered updated information from the permanent study plots in California and found that population declines in the western part of the range in California continued and declines were perhaps beginning in the eastern part of the California range.<br/><br/>The current population trends are based on landscape-level assessment using distance sampling for the 11-year period between 2004 and 2014 (USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). The sampling represented all five recovery units with 16 subpopulations in critical habitat units of from 115 to 3,763 km<sup>2</sup> described in the original Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994). Joshua Tree National Park is treated as a protected area and monitored as a 17th subpopulation although not designated as critical habitat. Consistent downward trends have continued in four of the five recovery units, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 11 years. Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014; the exceptions were adult densities in the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) and the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (10.2/km<sup>2</sup>) (Berry et al. 2014, 2020). Unfortunately, in July 2020, a significant part of the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve burned and tortoises were found injured and dead. The Red Cliffs subpopulation declined from 2005 wildfires and with the recent 2020 fires, there will likely be further depression in densities. The six subpopulations with increasing densities had 2.7 to 6.4 adults/km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 2014. However, most of the 17 populations were near or below the 3.9 /km<sup>2</sup>&#160;density of adults considered as a minimum for viable populations (USFWS 1994, 2015).",Decreasing,"The Desert Tortoise was previously considered to be a single wide-ranging species, <em>Gopherus agassizii</em>, inhabiting the Mojave and Sonoran Desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico from southern California and Arizona through Sonora and into northern Sinaloa (Stebbins 1966, 2003; Iverson 1992). The species was found to be polytypic by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2011), who split the morphologically and genetically distinct Sonoran Desert populations as <em>Gopherus morafkai</em>, the Sonoran Desert Tortoise. Further analysis demonstrated that <em>G. morafkai</em> was also polytypic and split further to separate and describe the Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise further to the south as <em>Gopherus evgoodei</em> (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>Geographically restricted <em>G. agassizii</em>, the Mojave or Agassiz’s Desert Tortoise, is endemic to the United States, inhabiting southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and extreme northwestern Arizona west and north of the Colorado River (TTWG 2017, Berry and Murphy 2019). The Sonoran Desert Tortoise, <em>G. morafkai</em>, occurs in both the United States and Mexico, inhabiting Arizona south and east of the Colorado River, Sonora (including Isla Tiburón), and extreme northern Sinaloa (Murphy <em>et al.</em> 2011, TTWG 2017). The Sinaloan Thornscrub Tortoise, <em>G. evgoodei</em>, is endemic to Mexico and occurs in southern Sonora, northern Sinaloa, and extreme southwestern Chihuahua (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2016, TTWG 2017).<br/><br/>Within its geographic range, <em>G. agassizii</em> occurs in the Mojave Desert, the western Sonoran or Colorado Desert, the ecotone of the Mojave with the Great Basin Desert, and ecotones with vegetation types typical of higher elevations on the lower slopes of the Sierra Nevada, Transverse, Peninsular and desert mountain ranges (USFWS 1994). McLuckie <em>et al</em>. (1999) identified a subpopulation of <em>G. agassizii</em> east of the Colorado River in the Black Mountains of northwestern Arizona in which morphometric and mtDNA characteristics of the majority of the subpopulation were typically Mojavean; however, elements typical of tortoises in the Sonoran Desert were also evident. Edwards <em>et al.</em> (2015), using new genetic techniques, examined this and other nearby tortoise subpopulations, and identified hybrids (F2) in three mountain ranges near the Colorado River in Arizona. The two <em>Gopherus</em> species come in contact in limited places where Mojave Desert habitats meet Sonoran Desert habitats. The two species likely maintain largely independent taxonomic identities due to ecological niche partitioning (Inman <em>et al</em>. 2019). The species has been recorded at elevations of up to&#160;1,570 m asl (Rautenstrauch and O’Farrell 1998); however, tortoises may be found in unusual places, often transported by humans or other animals (e.g., the type specimen of <em>Xerobates lepidocephalus</em>&#160;[Ottley and Velázquez-Solis 1989] from southern Baja California, Mexico, is actually an introduced <em>Gopherus agassizii </em>[Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2011]).","Commercial take or use of <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> is prohibited by law, and few animals have been documented in (illegal) trade in recent decades. The evaluation of conservation status, conservation and monitoring actions for the species have generated significant financial investments in the species, supporting a range of local and visiting livelihoods. The approximate cost to develop and implement the 25-year recovery program for the Mojave Desert Tortoise was USD 100 million (USGAO 2002, Ernst and Lovich 2009, USFWS 2011, Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012). Thirty years have passed since the federal listing of&#160; <em>G. agassizii</em> as threatened in 1989–1990, declines of breeding adults continue, and many tasks to reduce deaths, described first in 1994 (USFWS 1994), remain to be implemented (see also USFWS 2011, Reports from the Recovery Implementation Teams). If fully implemented, the recommended actions could exceed 159 million USD plus additional costs that could not be estimated in the 2011 Recovery Plan (USFWS 2011). As one of the keystone species of the Mojave Desert, <em>G. agassizii</em> plays an unquantified but substantial role in generating tourism income to regional protected areas (see Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave National Preserve, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area (<a href=""https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/"">https://irma.nps.gov/STAT/</a>).",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Conservation Measures taken:<br/></strong>The first legal conservation measures for <em>Gopherus agassizii</em> came from the State of California in 1939 (California Department of Fish and Game Code 1939–1981).&#160;Additional protective regulations followed until <em>G. agassizii </em>was listed as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act in 1989 (California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife 2016). Federal legislation to protect <em>G. agassizii</em> first occurred in 1980 and was restricted to the Beaver Dam Slope population in Utah (USFWS 1980). In 1989–1990, <em>G. agassizii</em> was federally listed as threatened (USDI&#160;<span style="""">1990&#160;</span>and references therein). The only population of <em>G. agassizii</em> that is not protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, is in the northwest corner of Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recovery efforts have been underway since 1990. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1994) published the first Recovery Plan in 1994, coupled with designations of critical habitat units by the U.S. Department of the Interior (USFWS 1994); this was followed by a revised Recovery Plan in 2011 (USFWS 2011), and regional Recovery Implementation Teams established in 2012. These teams are chaired by an employee of the USFWS Desert Tortoise Recovery Office, and are composed of federal, state, and county employees from the range of the desert tortoise, including representatives from local and national conservation and other stakeholder organizations. <br/><br/>The species is included in CITES Appendix II as part of Testudinidae spp., requiring that any commercial international trade be documented not to be detrimental to the survival of wild populations. CITES Trade records generally show very low levels of international exports of live animals; the vast majority of live traded Desert Tortoises are personal pets moving in-country with their owners, and many of the records in fact concern seizures of illegally transported specimens (CITES UNEP-WCMC trade database).<br/><br/>Conservation and recovery efforts began in the early 1970s, long before efforts of the federal actions by the USFWS in 1989–90. The Desert Tortoise Council formed in 1974-75 out of an interim recovery effort involving the four Southwestern states. This non-profit corporation was and continues to be dedicated to preserving representative populations of desert tortoises; educating the public; holding annual introductory workshops; and annual symposia to bring together representatives from government agencies, academia, and the public to learn and discuss important topics aimed at recovery of tortoise populations. The Desert Tortoise Council was instrumental in providing critical materials for federal and state listings of the species. The Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee, Inc., was formed in 1974 to establish protected areas for <em>G. agassizii</em>. This non-profit organization is a land trust and mitigation bank, a source of education, and research. They were instrumental in establishing the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area and increasing its size.<br/><br/>Two preserves or protected areas exist with moderately high degrees of protection. One is the 100 km<sup>2</sup> (and increasing) Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area, which was formally designated by the U.S. Congress in 1980. It is fenced, with no vehicle access, livestock grazing, mining, or surface disturbances other than a few limited natural trails and a kiosk. The Natural Area is for wild tortoises only and populations are allowed to fluctuate naturally with no augmentation. Population density of adults throughout the Natural Area in 2011-12 was 10.2/km<sup>2</sup> (Berry et al. 2014a). The second preserve is Red Cliffs Desert Reserve in Utah (251 km<sup>2</sup>). The Red Cliffs National Conservation Area provides additional protection for federal lands within the Reserve. Several paved roads, fenced and unfenced, run through the Reserve and recreation occurs throughout (e.g., hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking).&#160;The next and lower level of protection could be described as occurring within National Parks, State Parks, and National Recreation Areas such as Joshua Tree and Death Valley National Parks, Mojave National Preserve, Red Rock Canyon, Anza-Borrego, and Red Rocks State Parks, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and the Beaver Dam Wash National Conservation Area. These parks and recreation areas have very high visitor use, unfenced paved roads, and some illegal collecting and release of captive tortoises of one or more species. <br/><br/>Twelve critical habitat units, the basis for Tortoise Conservation Areas (term defined in USFWS 2011), were designated by the USFWS (1994), and have far less protection than either the Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area or the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve and are subject to multiple land uses that fragment and degrade habitat and create vulnerabilities and risks to the tortoises (e.g., invasive non-native grasses and other non-native species; highways; roads; utility poles, towers, and electrical transmission lines; gas lines and fibreoptic cables; recreational vehicle use; shooting; domestic and feral dogs; cattle grazing and feral burros; mining; military installations; fire that causes degradation of habitat).<br/><br/>Seventeen monitored subpopulations in the 12 critical habitat units are contained within five recovery units which cover a total of 25,678 km<sup>2</sup>. The following information for each recovery unit and the 17 Tortoise Conservation Areas reports area (km<sup>2</sup>), and density of breeding adults per km<sup>2</sup> in 2014. Western Mojave Recovery Unit: Fremont-Kramer (2,347 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Ord-Rodman (852 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.6/km<sup>2</sup>), Superior-Cronese (3,094 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Colorado Desert Recovery Unit: Chocolate Mountains Aerial Gunnery Range (713 km<sup>2</sup>, 7.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Chuckwalla (2,818 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.3/km<sup>2</sup>), Chemehuevi (3,763 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Fenner (1,782 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.8/km<sup>2</sup>), Joshua Tree (1,152 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Pinto Mountain (508 km<sup>2</sup>, 3.4/km<sup>2</sup>), Piute Valley (927 km<sup>2</sup>, 5.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Eastern Mojave Recovery Unit: El Dorado Valley (999 km<sup>2</sup>, 1.5/km<sup>2</sup>), Ivanpah Valley (2,447 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.3/km<sup>2</sup>); Northeastern Mojave Recovery Unit: Beaver Dam Slope (750 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.2/km<sup>2</sup>), Coyote Spring (960 km<sup>2</sup>, 4.0/km<sup>2</sup>), Gold Butte (1,607 km<sup>2</sup>, 2.7/km<sup>2</sup>), Mormon Mesa (844 km<sup>2</sup>, 6.4/km<sup>2</sup>); Upper Virgin River Recovery Unit: Red Cliffs Desert Reserve (115 km<sup>2</sup>, 15.3/km<sup>2</sup>) (USFWS 2015; Allison and McLuckie 2018). The overall decline in tortoise populations in critical habitats (Tortoise Conservation Areas) between 2004 and 2014 was 32.2% (USFWS 2015). Four of the five recovery units are in a state of decline, with 11 of the 17 subpopulations registering declines in adult tortoises ranging from 26.6 to 64.7% during the 10 years (USFWS 2015). Most of the increasing subpopulations were in Nevada. Population densities for adults ranged from 1.5 to 7.2/km<sup>2</sup> in declining populations as of 2014 (USFWS 2015).<br/><br/>Extensive research has been published in peer-reviewed journals on many aspects of natural history, general ecology, physiological ecology, reproduction, health and diseases, population attributes, causes of death, movements and home range, predators, head-starting, translocation, and many other topics, making <em>G. agassizii</em> likely the most well-researched non-marine turtle species (Lovich and Ennen 2013b). Over 400 journal articles were published as of 2018, most between 1990 and 2018, as well as hundreds of reports (see three annotated bibliographies covering almost 160 years: Hohman <em>et al</em>. 1980, Grover and DeFalco 1995, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016). Some information has been integrated into recovery programs, but many of the recovery measures recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) have not been implemented as of 2020.<br/><br/>Economic relevance: The approximate cost of USD 100 million to develop and implement the first and second Recovery Plans is significant within the regulatory, scientific and local economic sectors involved and much remains to be implemented (USFWS 1994, 2011; Averill-Murray <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/><br/><strong>Conservation Measures needed:<br/></strong>The USFWS (1994) published recommended regulations for the areas that were designated as critical habitat. They described activities to be prohibited (e.g., all vehicle activity off designated roads; all competitive and organized recreational vehicle events on designated roads; habitat destructive military manoeuvres, clearing for agriculture, landfills and other surface disturbances; domestic livestock grazing, grazing by feral burros and horses; vegetation harvest; collection of biological specimens or vegetation harvest except by permit; dumping and littering; and deposition of captive or displace desert tortoises except under authorized translocation research projects; uncontrolled dogs out of vehicles; discharge of firearms except for hunting of game between September and February. There were many other recommended management actions but few of these recommendations were adopted when critical habitat units were officially described (USFWS 1994), and others have only been partially implemented by 2020.&#160;There were also recommendations for monitoring and research. In the second recovery plan, the USFWS (2011) identified and ranked (Darst <em>et al.</em> 2013) priority actions for recovering the Desert Tortoise and established regional Recovery Implementation Teams to implement these recovery actions. These Recovery Implementation Teams identify local, regional, and range-wide actions by submitting proposals to team members for discussion and prioritization. Ultimately the proposals are submitted to range-wide Management Oversight Groups composed of state, federal, and county government agencies for review, discussion, and potential sources of funding. Some projects are successfully funded and implemented, while many recommended in 1994 remain unfulfilled.<br/><br/><br/>&#160;<strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Conservation Actions Needed, we provide the following notes:<br/></strong>1.1. Land/water protection -&gt; Site/area protection<br/>&#160; &#160; a. Better protection of Critical habitats could ensure that populations of tortoises become stable and/or increase. Examples of protective measures included in recovery measures for the tortoise are exclusion fencing and culverts along highways and roads; reduction in populations of hyper-predators such as the Common Ravens; control and removal of newly introduced and previously existing non-native plants; and control of recreational vehicle use.<br/><br/>2.1. Land/water management -&gt; Site/area management<br/>&#160; &#160; a. The first recovery plan identified site-specific or critical habitat-specific measures to ensure protection of habitat and reduction of deaths of tortoises from anthropogenic sources (USFWS 1994). Most of these recommendations are still relevant. The Recovery Implementation Teams have provided recommendations similar to those in the first recovery plan. Many of these measures remain to be implemented. For example, in the State of California where most desert tortoise habitat and populations occur, acquisition of private land would be beneficial, because a substantial portion of habitat is in multiple private ownership. Both the USFWS and State of California recommend that developers of tortoise habitat acquire replacement habitat for habitat lost to development, and such actions have been occurring for ~20 years. Another topic and critical area that would benefit from protection is the population and hybrid zone with <em>G. morafkai</em> east of the Colorado River in Arizona (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015). This small population is not protected under the federal Endangered Species Act (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>2.2. Land/water management -&gt; Invasive/problematic species control<br/>&#160; a. Non-native grasses (e.g., <em>Schismus arabicus</em>, <em>S. barbatus</em>, <em>Bromus tectorum</em>, <em>B. madritensis rubens</em>) and forbs (e.g., <em>Brassica tournefortii</em>, <em>Hirschfeldia incana</em>) present serious and severe problems to tortoises because tortoises are selective in the choice of forage (Jennings and Berry 2015). The non-native annuals contribute to changes in forage availability, habitat structure, and increases in fire (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). These non-native species thrive under disturbance and spread via roads, livestock, military maneuvers, and disturbances created by recreational vehicle use off-road (e.g., D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992, Brooks and Berry 2006, Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2006, Brooks and Matchett 2006). The grasses are highly combustible and fire-prone in wildlands that did not evolve with short-term fire cycles (D’Antonio and Vitousek 1992). The grasses also compete with native annuals used as forage by the tortoises, and the species of grasses contain little nutrition, require water to metabolize, cause weight loss in the tortoises, and can become embedded in the jaws (Medica and Eckert 2007; Hazard <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2010; Drake <em>et al</em>. 2016). Similarly, <em>Brassica tournefortii</em> competes with native species used for forage and often occurs in dense stands, inhibiting movements of tortoises (Berry <em>et al</em>. 2014b).<br/><br/>3.2. Species management -&gt; Species recovery<br/>&#160; a. Species management and recovery are guided by the Recovery Plan and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. On-the-ground management is by the administering agency, e.g., U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Department of Defense, States (for state land), and private owners. That being said, much can be done by implementing actions recommended in the first Recovery Plan (USFWS 1994) and by restoring degraded habitat (e.g., Abella and Berry 2016); controlling recreation vehicle use off-road and reducing fragmentation of habitat; limiting spread of invasive, non-native grasses and forbs; controlling hyper-predation in common ravens (USFWS 2008)&#160;and coyotes; preventing dogs and dog packs from running loose in the desert; and acquiring habitat.<br/><br/>4.3. Education &amp; awareness -&gt; Awareness &amp; communications<br/>&#160; a. See Conservation Actions in Place. Expansion of on-going programs to prevent take or shooting in the wild and release of captive tortoises of several species.<br/><br/><br/><strong>In association with the following standardized categories of Research Needed, we provide the following notes:</strong></p>While research on some topics is desirable, more is known about <em>G. agassizii </em>than most other reptiles (Lovich and Ennen 2013b, Berry <em>et al</em>. 2016 and references therein). Instead, implementation of previously identified actions to protect populations and habitat is more critical, specifically actions that will reduce deaths and loss or degradation of habitat.&#160;<br/><br/>1.1. Research -&gt; Taxonomy<br/>&#160; a. Genetic relationships between and within populations: human-mediated translocations of tortoises have occurred for decades, some authorized, some not (see Murphy et al. 2007). One recent question is the source of tortoises in Anza Borrego Desert State Park in the Colorado Desert of California. One might expect that the source would be tortoises occurring in the Colorado Desert, but instead tortoises have genotypes typical of the southwestern Mojave Desert population (Manning and Edwards 2019). More information on nearby tortoises (e.g. Lovich <em>et al.</em> 2020) occurring on the east-facing slopes of the Peninsular Range north of the Park may shed light on whether this is a naturally occurring population or a source that came from human-mediated translocations.<br/>&#160; b. Translocation of thousands of tortoises has occurred in the last &gt;20 years. Yet the only information available as to whether these translocated tortoises have been assimilated into the recipient or existing resident populations is research by Mulder <em>et al.</em> (2017) on assimilation of translocated males into the population of resident tortoises. Much more needs to be done on following males and females over a 10- to 20-year period to determine if and when adult males are assimilated into resident populations.<br/><br/>1.2. Research -&gt; Population size, distribution &amp; trends<br/>&#160; a. More information on current population attributes such as size-age class structure, recruitment of juveniles into adult populations, sex ratios of adult tortoises, and causes and contributors to death is highly desirable. Landscape sampling undertaken and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Desert Tortoise Recovery Office has provided valuable region-wide information on adult densities but not on other essential population attributes (i.e., Allison and McLuckie 2018). Resurvey of long-term, mark-recapture tortoise plots has been spotty for the past 20 years while support has increased for line-distance sampling representatively and on a landscape scale (see USFWS 2015, Allison and McLuckie 2018). Nonetheless, it is clear (USFWS 2011) that species recovery cannot be assumed based on patterns of adult counts alone, and active work to describe vital rates across the range will be an important part of assuring tortoise populations reflect healthy population dynamics or determining regional and size-specific recovery needs.<br/><br/>1.3. Research -&gt; Life history &amp; ecology<br/>&#160; a. More information is needed on survival of neonate, juvenile, and immature size classes (first 12 to 15 years of life) and causes of mortality in the wild. Frequent input of new data on causes of and contributors to mortality for all size classes is essential for improving management of the species and for achieving upward trends.<br/><br/>1.5. Research -&gt; Threats<br/>&#160; a. The USFWS developed a model to identify major threats to the species (Darst <em>et al</em>. 2013); the information in this model is based on published research only, and not on the hundreds of reports and manuscripts available in Annual Reports to the USFWS on research permits. The model is outdated and needs major revisions to more accurately reflect available information and more recent priorities. In addition, support could be provided to speed up publication of important research projects that will lead to more protective management actions.&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>3.1. Monitoring -&gt; Population trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on population attributes in critical habitat, near highways, and in critical habitat near urban areas.<br/><br/>3.4. Monitoring -&gt; Habitat trends<br/>&#160; a. Monitoring is especially needed on wildfires, non-native plants, seed beds, and recovery of preferred forage plants.<br/><p></p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

In April 2009 the population was estimated at 291 adult (&gt;1 year old) wolves (EWCP annual report 2008–2009) and in April 2010 at 290–320 (EWCP annual report 2009-2010). Since then 23 carcasses have been retrieved, and 56 individuals have gone missing, probably as a result of a canine distemper epizootic that affected several subpopulations in Bale.<br/><p>Ethiopian Wolves are restricted to seven isolated mountain enclaves in the highlands of Ethiopia. The Afroalpine range available to the species is shrinking and increasingly fragmented. The species’ extent of occurrence is estimated at 4,200 km² with an area of occupancy of 2,779 km². Population estimates across the species’ range suggest that between 360 and 440 adult (&gt;1 year old) wolves remain, of which &lt;250 are mature individuals. One relict population in northern Ethiopia (Mt Guna) is now functionally extinct.</p>  <p>The largest population occurs in the Bale Mountains in southern Ethiopia, where intensive monitoring of wolf packs indicate that population size varies widely due to the recurrence of infectious disease epizootics affecting local subpopulations. Since 2008 to date this population has declined by ~30%, from approximately 300 to an estimated 210 adults, due to consecutive epizootics of rabies and canine distemper. This equates to a 20% global decline in the population in the last three years; although narrowly below the threshold for uplisting to Critically Endangered under C1, this continued decline merits careful ongoing monitoring of population numbers (and a reassessment if necessary) and sustained conservation interventions.</p>    <p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Number of ""Mature Individuals""</span><br/> The number of mature individuals in the population (population size) was determined using the IUCN's new definition (in: Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria) and the following formula:<br/> <br/> Mature individuals = 0.31N1+ 0.4N1+0.57N2 +0.16 N2 then<br/> Mature individuals = 0.71N1+ 0.73 N2 where:<br/> N1= adult male population<br/> N2= adult female population<br/> <br/> Calculations of mature individuals capable of reproduction were derived from empirical data on wolf populations in the Bale Mountains, between 1988–1992 and 1997–2000. Of all adult males in a population, 31% are alpha males and thus reproductive individuals (= 0.31N1). Of all subordinate adult males (= 0.69N1), some may access reproduction either by replacing the alpha male or through extra-pack copulations. This proportion was subjectively estimated at 60% and thus the contribution of subordinate adult males potentially capable of reproduction is 0.6 x 0.69N1 = 0.41N1. <br/> <br/> Of all adult females in a population, 57% are in alpha position and thus reproduce (= 0.57N2). Of the suppressed adult females (= 0.33N2) we estimated a 50% likelihood to access reproduction in their lifetime (0.5 x 0.33N2=0.16N2). This was derived from the rate of breeding opportunities, calculated as 0.12 for female per year from empirical data, over four years (0.12 x 4 years= 0.5).<br/> <br/> Population estimates were derived from current availability of habitat types and extrapolations of the density of adult and subadult wolves to the area of each habitat type. Population estimates (N) are numbers of adult and subadult wolves. Given a population sex ratio of 2:1 males to females then the male population is 2/3N = 0.67N and the female population is 1/3N= 0.34N. Eighty percent of males and 70% of females are adults, therefore:<br/> <br/> N1= adult male population= 0.8 x 0.67N = 0.53N<br/> N2= adult female population= 0.7 x 0.33N = 0.23N <br/> <br/> and, Mature individuals = 0.71N1 + 0.73N2, so:<br/> Mature individuals = 0.37N + 0.17N= 0.54N<br/> <br/> Mature individual estimates for 2010 based on IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group (2011):<br/> <br/> Bale Mountains: N = 210; mature individuals = 113<br/> Arsi Mountains: N = 54; mature individuals = 29<br/> Simien Mountains: N = 52; mature individuals = 28<br/> North Wollo: N = 19; mature individuals = 10<br/> South Wollo: N = 16; mature individuals = 9<br/> Menz : N = 15; mature individuals = 8<br/> Mt Guna: N = 0; mature individuals = 0<br/> Total: N = 366; mature individuals = 197<br/> </p><p>Guassa-Menz estimate of 15 adult wolves was derived from intensive observation of wolf packs in recent years which yielded an estimate of 25 adult wolves, and was corroborated by DNA fingerprinting in 2008 (which identified 23 individuals). During 2010 40% of the known wolves have died or disappeared due to canine distemper, resulting in the revised estimate. </p>  <p>Arsi and Simien estimates (EWCP unpublished) were derived from intensive observations of wolf packs across both ranges. Recent improvements in monitoring resulted in a larger estimate for Simien, and a smaller one for Arsi. These revised figures reflect improved field techniques and effort rather than actual population change.</p>  <p>For North and South Wollo, population estimates are conservative and were based on habitat availability. Using field maps, the extent of suitable habitat were estimated and populations extrapolated from known densities in Bale for habitats with similar characteristics (Marino 2003a).&#160; Here the lower value of densities observed were used (i.e., good habitat: 0.2 wolves/km²; marginal habitat 0.1 wolf/km²).<br/> <br/> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Other parameters used:</span><br/> Generation time: mean 4.5 yr, range 3–8; extent of occurrence: 4,200 km² [defined as area above 3,000 m asl]; area of occupancy: 2,800 km²; number of populations: 7; number of sub-populations: 10.<br/> <br/> Given the information above, Canis simensis meets the criteria for Endangered under criterion B based on &lt;5,000 km² extent of occurrence (B1), as the population is severely fragmented (a), and there is a continuing decline (b) in area, extent and or quality of habitat (iii) and number of mature individuals (v). It also meets the criteria under C based on &lt;2,500 mature individuals in the population (EN C and D), exceeding a 20% decline in the population in the past eight years (two generations), and a continuing decline in population size (EN C2) and &lt;250 mature individuals in each subpopulation (EN C2a(i)). Finally, it also meets the threshold of &lt;250 mature individuals for listing under D.</p>","<p>A very localized endemic species, confined to isolated pockets of Afroalpine grasslands and heathlands where they prey on Afroalpine rodents. Suitable habitats extend from above treeline at about 3,200 m up to 4,500 m, with some wolves present in montane grasslands at 3,000 m. However, subsistence agriculture extends up to 3,500–3,800 m in many areas, restricting wolves to higher ranges (Marino 2003a). Rainfall at high altitude varies between 1,000 and 2,000 mm/year, with one pronounced dry period from December to February/March.<br/> <br/> Wolves utilize all Afroalpine habitats, but prefer open areas with short herbaceous and grassland communities where rodents are most abundant, along flat or gently sloping areas with deep soils and poor drainage in parts. Prime habitats in the Bale Mountains are characterized by short herbs (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Alchemilla</span> spp.) and grasses and low vegetation cover, a community maintained in continuous succession as a result of molerat (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Tachyoryctes macrocephalus</span>) burrowing activity. Other good habitats include tussock grasslands (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Festuca</span> spp., <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Agrostis</span> spp.), high-altitude scrubs dominated by <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Helichrysum</span> spp. and short grasslands in shallow soils. In northern parts of the range, plant communities characterized by a matrix of 'guassa' tussock grasses (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Festuca</span> spp.), 'cherenfi' bushes (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Euryops pinifolius</span>) and giant lobelias (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lobelia rhynchopetalum</span>) sustain high rodent abundance and are preferred by wolves. Ericaceous moorlands (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Erica</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Phillipia</span> spp.) at 3,200–3,600 m are of marginal value, with open moorlands having patches of herbs and grasses which are relatively good habitat.</p>","<p>Continuous loss of habitat due to high-altitude subsistence agriculture represents the major threat. Sixty percent of all land above 3,200 m has been converted into farmland, and all populations below 3,700 m are particularly vulnerable to further habitat loss, especially if the areas are small and of relatively flat relief (Marino 2003a). Habitat loss is exacerbated by overgrazing of highland pastures by domestic livestock, and in some areas habitat is threatened by proposed development of commercial sheep farms and roads. Human persecution triggered by political instability in the past is currently less severe and associated with conflicts over livestock losses (Marino 2003a). Recent population decline in Bale has been mostly due to disease epizootics, with road kills and shooting as secondary threats. Rabies is a potential threat to all populations, with canine distemper also a concern in Bale. Most of these threats are exacerbated by the wolves' specialization to life in the Afroalpine ecosystem.</p>  <p>In Bale, the Ethiopian wolf hybridizes with domestic dogs (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Canis familiaris</span>). Gottelli <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (1994) used mitochondrial DNA restriction fragments and microsatellite alleles to conclude that hybridization was relatively common in western Bale as a result of crosses between female wolves and male domestic dogs. Hybrids have shorter muzzles, heavier-built bodies and different coat patterns. Although hybrids are confined to the Web Valley in western Bale they may threaten the genetic integrity of the wolf population. Following hybridization, a population may be affected by outbreeding depression or reduction in fitness, although to date this does not seem to have taken place in Bale. Currently there is no indication of hybridization taking place outside western Bale.<br/> <br/> There is no exploitation of the species for furs, body parts or other purposes.</p>","<p>More than half of the species' population lives in the Bale Mountains, where wolf density is high for a social carnivore of its size, and positively correlated with density of rodent prey and negatively with vegetation height (Sillero-Zubiri and Gottelli 1995). Highest wolf densities are found in short Afroalpine herbaceous communities (1.0–1.2 adults/km²); lower densities are found in Helichrysum dwarf-scrub (0.2/km²), and in ericaceous heathlands and barren peaks (0.1/km²). Wolves are also present at low density (0.1–0.2/km²) in montane grasslands at lower altitudes.</p>  <p>Elsewhere, overall wolf density is relatively lower. In Menz, wolf density was estimated at 0.2 animals/km² using transect data (Ashenafi 2001). Comparison of census transect data from recent comprehensive surveys (Marino 2003a) indicates higher abundance in North Wollo (0.20 ± 0.20 sightings per km), intermediate in Arsi and Guna (0.10 ± 0.11 and 0.10 ± 0.14, respectively), and lower in South Wollo and Simien (0.08 ± 0.13 and 0.06 ± 0.11, respectively). These results were supported by counts of wolf signs (i.e., diggings and droppings) and interview results. <br/> <br/> A summary of population abundance and status in each region can be found in Sillero-Zubiri <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2004), with the most recent information on population status found in IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group (2011), and summarized above. Time series from long-term monitoring of wolves in the Bale Mountains of southern Ethiopia, spanning over 20 years, indicated marked variation in wolf abundance in association to rabies epizootics affecting high-density populations in 1991, 2003 and 2008 (Marino 2003b, Marino <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2006, IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group 2011). Population numbers returned to previous levels after the first two disruptions, evidencing resilience to catastrophes, but at very low density population growth was unexpectedly low, due to delays in the formation of new breeding packs (Marino <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> in review). Canine distemper (CDV) appears to be more important than previously thought, with CDV outbreaks affecting wolves across subpopulations in the Bale Mountains in 2005, 2006 (Malcolm 2006), and 2010 (Gordon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Endemic to the Ethiopian highlands, above the tree line at about 3,200 m. There are no recent records of the species at altitudes below 3,000 m, although specimens were collected at 2,500 m from Gojjam and north-western Shoa at the beginning of the century (references in Yalden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1980). Reported in the Simien Mountains since the species was first described in 1835, but scattered and irregular sightings suggest numbers have been declining. Reported on the Gojjam plateau until the early 1900s (Powell-Cotton 1902, Maydon 1932). South of the Rift Valley, wolves have been reported in the Arsi Mountains since the 1920s, and, more recently (1959), in the Bale Mountains. Reports of small populations in North Sidamo (Haltenorth and Diller 1980) may be in error. There is no evidence that the Ethiopian Wolf ever occurred in Eritrea (Coetzee 1977).<br/> <br/> The species currently is confined to seven isolated mountain ranges of the Ethiopian highlands, at altitudes of 3,000–4,500 m (Gottelli and Sillero-Zubiri 1992, Marino 2003a). In the northern highlands wolves are restricted to land above 3,500–3,800 m by increasing agricultural pressure (Yalden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1980, Marino 2003a). Wolf populations occur north of the Rift Valley in the Simien Mountains, Mount Guna, North Wollo and South Wollo highlands, and Menz. Recently extinct in Gosh Meda (North Shoa), and absent from Mt Choke, Gojjam, for a few decades. South-east of the Rift Valley there are populations in the Arsi Mountains (Mt Kaka, Mt Chilalo and Galama range) and in the Bale Mountains, including the Somkaru-Korduro range (Marino 2003a).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p>The species is not included on the CITES Appendices. It has full official protection under Ethiopia's Wildlife Conservation Regulations of 1974, Schedule VI. Killing a wolf carries a sentence of up to two years.<br/> <br/> The Ethiopian Wolf occurs in several protected areas: Bale Mountains National Park; Simien Mountains National Park; Borena Saiynt Regional Park (South Wollo); Guassa Community Conservation Area (North Shoa); Arsi Mountains Regional Park. As a result of boundary extensions (Simien) and new parks created (Arsi) the area of suitable wolf habitat within protected areas increased to 87%. </p>  <p>A number of important steps have been taken in the interests of conserving this endemic species, including: 1) a dog vaccination campaign in Bale, and vaccination campaigns&#160; in response to rabies outbreaks in dogs close to wolves in Menz and Simien; 2) sterilization programme for hybrids in Bale; 3) vaccination of wolves in response to rabies epizootics in parts of Bale; 4) community and school education programme in Bale and Wollo; 5) strengthening the capacity of the Bale Mountains National Park – funding patrolling, maintenance of infrastructure, etc.; 6) surveys to determine the persistence and status of all populations of wolves; 7) monitoring of all wolf populations; 8) A Strategic Planning workshop for Ethiopian wolf conservation held in Lalibela, February 2011, resulting in a National Action Plan for the next 10 years (IUCN/SSC Canid specialist Group 2011). </p>  <p>In 1983, the Wildlife Conservation Society established the Bale Mountains Research Project, which publicized the wolf's plight and started a regular monitoring programme for the species. A detailed four-year field study followed (Sillero-Zubiri 1994). Based on its findings, the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group produced an action plan for the Ethiopian Wolf (Sillero-Zubiri and Macdonald 1997), which provided a detailed strategy for the conservation and management of remaining wolf populations. This plan advocated immediate action on three fronts – education, wolf population monitoring, and rabies control in domestic dogs – to conserve the Afroalpine ecosystem and its top predator. As a result, the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme (EWCP) was established in 1995 by Oxford University with financial support from the Born Free Foundation, Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS), the Wildlife Conservation Network&#160; and other donors. The Programme’s overall aim is to protect the Afroalpine ecosystem and many of its rare highland endemic plants and animals through better management in Bale and the establishment of other conservation areas in Menz and Wollo. The EWCP currently monitors the demography of the Bale and selected populations in South and North Wollo, supports park patrols within the wolf range, undertakes domestic dog control and the removal of dog-wolf hybrids. Additionally, the EWCP carries out a community conservation education campaign that targets people living inside the wolf's range and is aimed at improving dog husbandry and combating disease in the park and surroundings. A large-scale dog vaccination programme (targeting up to 5,000 dogs a year) seeks to reduce the occurrence of rabies and distemper within the Ethiopian wolf range and is backed up by further epidemiological and demographic studies. The EWCP is also active elsewhere in Ethiopia, with representatives surveying and monitoring all wolf ranges and implementing education campaigns about the plight of the species. Zelealem Tefera Ashenafi set up the Guassa Biodiversity Project in 1996, looking at the relationships between pastoralists and wildlife in the highlands of Menz. FZS and partners are working in North Ethiopia to protect the Afrolapine ecosystem, supporting the Simien Mountains National Park and creation of a new community conservation area in North Wollo. </p>  There are no animals maintained in captivity.<br/><br/>Although the behavioural ecology of the species is well known, research has focused largely in the optimal habitats in the Bale Mountains.

It occurs in dry, open woodland, in flat semi-desert and in semi-arid savanna on sandy soils, and avoids clay soils and stony areas (Wagner<em> et al.</em> 2013, Largen and Spawls 2010). It favours areas with sparse grass, herb or shrub cover, and is absent from areas with grassy or rocky substrates (Wagner<em> et al</em>. 2013). Adults shelter in burrows they excavate, typically beneath vegetation, and which end in relatively humid soils; juveniles do not burrow but shelter in dense vegetation or beneath surface debris (Wagner <em>et al</em>. 2013). Burrows housing adult males can be as little as 70 cm apart (Roos 2002). A report by Parker (1942) that the species is nocturnal may result from animals' tendency to seek shelter in burrows when disturbed, as a result of which these shy lizards are rarely seen to be active by day (Wagner <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on data from Hargeisa the diet includes varied insects as well as plant material, although at this site densities appear to be highest around termite mounds (Wagner <em>et al</em>. 2013).","It is unknown whether major threats to this species exist. This lizard's range lies wholly within a politically unstable region, and it may therefore be subject to localized impacts as a result of conflict. In Hargeisa, unintentional release of chemicals from a pesticide store destroyed by bombing was documented to result in mortality and in avoidance of the surrounding area by a number of reptile and amphibian species (Lambert 1997). Only one individual of <em>Xengama taylori</em> was encountered in this study, away from the release site, and so the effects on this species are unknown. It is rather widespread in an area with few roads and low human population density, and is unlikely to be at significant risk from either human activities or exploitation (S. Spawls pers. comm. 2014).","This species is described as being very common around Hargeisa, in the Somaliland region (Wagner <em>et al.</em> 2013), and can be found in suitable habitat patches within the town itself (Mazuch 2013).",Unknown,"This species is only known to occur in the Togdheer region of northern Somalia (Lanza 1990), where it appears to replace <em>Xenagama batillifera</em> in the Haud (Parker 1942), and from nearby eastern Ethiopia (Largen and Spawls 2010).

It is likely that the species has lost between 10% to 65% of habitat within its range over the last three generations and that habitat loss will continue at high rates three generations into the future, particularly due to mining and infrastructure development.","Night monkeys typically occur in primary and secondary forest (including disturbed forest and selectively logged forest), seasonally flooded and <em>terra firma</em>, lowland forest, submontane and montane (cloud forests) in Colombia and in the Andes to 3,200 m above sea level (the specifically montane forms are <em>Aotus lemurinus </em>and <em>Aotus miconax</em>) (Hernández Camacho and Cooper 1976, Aquino and Encarnación 1994a, Defler 2004). Aquino and Encarnación (1994b) reviewed the habitat and forest preferences of the genus.<br/><br/>Night monkeys are nocturnal: they are most active at dawn and dusk. During the day, they rest in hollows tree trunks and within dense vegetation” (Tirira, 2007). They are frugivorous; their diet includes fruit, nectar and flowers, leaves, and small animals prey such as insects (Wright 1989; Fernandez-Duque 2007). <em>Aotus azarae </em>and <em>Aotus zonalis </em>has been observed to include a significant portion of leaves in their diet (Hladik and Hladik 1969, Ganzhorn and Wright 1994, Giménez and Fernandez-Duque 2003). The diet of montane night monkeys has been studied by Castaño<em> et al.</em> (2010) in the Western and Central Andes and included 65.8% of fruits, 28.2% of arthropods and complemented its diet with flowers, leaf buds and seeds and Guzman <em>et al.</em> (in review) also reported that montane night monkey fed mostly on fruits and flowers.<br/><br/>They are socially monogamous, living in small groups of an adult pair and offspring of different ages (infant, one or two juveniles and sometimes a subadult. In <em>A. a. azarae</em>, a significant number of adults range alone. They may be subadults that have left their natal groups or older adults which have been evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernandez-Duque and Huntington 2002, Fernandez-Duque 2004). Both sexes disperse. Males care for the infants (carry them) (Rotundo <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2005). Lone adults were observed by Villavicencio Galindo (2003) in northern Colombia. Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 5-18 ha (depending on the species and location) (Wright 1978, 1981; Fernandez-Duque 2007). Wright (1994) and Fernandez-Duque (2007) review the behaviour and ecology of the genus.<br/><br/>Captive male <em>A. lemurinus</em> reach sexual maturity when 2 years old, and captive female <em>A. vociferans</em> and <em>A. nancymaae</em> first breed when 3-4 years old (Dixson 1983, Fernandez-Duque 2007). In the wild, male <em>A. azarae</em> reach adult weight only when about 4 years old, and age at first reproduction is about 5 years of age (Juárez <em>et al.</em> 2003; Fernandez-Duque 2004). A female <em>A. azarae</em> was found to breed for the first time at 58 months of age (Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2002). Single offspring are the rule. Wright (1985) recorded births between August and February for <em>A. nigriceps</em> in Peru (Manu National Park), and Aquino <em>et al.</em> (1990) indicated a birth season between December and March) for <em>A. nancymaae</em> in north-eastern Peru. In the Argentinean Chaco, <em>A. azarae</em> shows a peak of births between March and June (Fernandez-Duque 2007).<br/><br/>Size:<br/>Adult male weight average 0.920±0.075 kg (n=7, range 0.608-1.15 kg), adult female weight 0.859±0.088 kg (n=6, range 0.578-1.05 kg) (Hernández-Camacho and Defler 1985). NB: This could refer to <em>griseimembra</em>, considered by Hernández-Camacho and Defler (1985) to be a subspecies of <em>A. lemurinus</em>.","Most of the geographical distribution of montane night monkey (montane forests in the northern Andes) overlaps with areas of high human population densities and strong anthropogenic disturbance (Etter and Wyngaarden 2000). The major drivers of habitat transformation and forest fragmentation are associated to deforestation for agricultural and cattle ranching activities and more recently expanding illicit crops. A significant amount of the species’ habitat has been lost (Global Forest Watch 2020).<br/><br/>Many <em>Aotus</em> in Colombia have been released from captivity outside their range and could be hybridizing; however, very little is known of the effects of this practice.<br/>A potential big impact for the population of this species in Ecuador is the mining, as it is one of the main activities of development the in the Andes foothills, along the distribution range of the species (Tirira <em>et al.</em> 2011, Vandegrift <em>et al</em>. 2018).","No information available. Aquino and Encarnación (1994b) reviewed population structure and densities for the genus. It is suspected that the population has undergone at least a 30% reduction over the last three generations due to habitat loss (due to deforestation, expanding illicit crops, coffee, mining and armed conflict) and degradation. It is suspected that this population decline will continue at the same rate into the future.<br/><br/>In Ecuador, Sierra (2013) estimated the deforestation rate in the montane forests of the eastern slopes of the Andes to be high and stable from 1990 through 2008. In this period, the percentage of deforested area in these ecosystems changed from 19.6% to 32.2%. Most of the deforested area was used for pastures. Although there are no published current estimates of the deforested areas, if this trend persists, the percentage of deforested area by 2020 would be about 40%. In another study carried out in the south-eastern Andean slopes, Torracchi <em>et al</em>. (2013) calculated a mean annual deforestation rate of 1.87% between 1976 and 2002 in the lower montane forest that is part of the species' geographic range. If this deforestation trend persists to date, about 65% of the forest area estimated in 1976 would have been lost. In Ecuador, mining is posing an increasing threat to montane ecosystems east and west of the Andes. A large percentage of the forests in the eastern Andean slopes are conceded to mining companies (Vandegrift <em>et al</em>. 2018).",Decreasing,"Montane Night Monkey is distributed in the Western, Central and Eastern Andes mountains from about 1,000 up to treeline elevations of 3,000 to 3,200 m (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1986). Following the range map in Defler (2003, 2004), it extends south as far as region of the headwaters of the rios Caquetá and Orteguaza. Tirira (2007) provisionally regards the montane night monkeys occurring in the subtropical humid forest along the Eastern Andes (elevations 940-1,800 m) as belonging to this species, although he points out (p.160) that its identity has yet to be confirmed. Castaño and Cardona (2005) reported nine different localities with montane night monkeys ranging from 970 to 2050 m. There are few records and all are based on sightings in the wild; the few museum specimens have yet to be studied in this regard. The possibility remains that it may be a variant of <em>A. vociferans</em> occurring otherwise throughout eastern Ecuador and adjacent northern Peru (Aquino and Encarnación 1994a), or even an as yet unrecognized, distinct species.<br/><br/>There is only scant information on the elevational distribution of <em>Aotus lemurinus</em> and its distribution limits with <em>Aotus griseimembra</em>.<br/><br/>The species’ extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) are declining. In Ecuador, Sierra (2013) estimated the deforestation rate in the montane forests of the eastern slopes of the Andes to be consistently high from 1990 through 2008. In this period, the percentage of deforested area in these ecosystems changed from 19.6% to 32.2% (or a 64.3% decrease in forested area). Most of the deforested area was used for pastures. Although there are no published current estimates of the deforested areas, if this trend persists, the percentage of deforested area by 2020 would be about 40% (i.e. a further 24.2% decrease in forested cover by 2020).<br/><br/>Another study carried out in the south-eastern Andean slopes Torracchi <em>et al</em>. (2013) calculated a mean annual deforestation rate of 1.87% between 1976 and 2002 in the lower montane forest that is part of the species geographic range. If this deforestation trend persists to date, about 65% of the forest area estimated in 1976 would have been lost by 2002.<br/><br/>In Ecuador, mining is posing an increasing threat to montane ecosystems east and west of the Andes. A large percentage of the forests in the eastern Andean slopes are conceded to mining companies (Vandegrift <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In Colombia, deforestation from 2000 to 2019 in the species’ range has ranged from 4.3% in Cundinamarca to 11% in Norte de Santander (Global Forest Watch 2020).",Use and trade informations for this species are missing.,Terrestrial,"This species is confirmed, or may occur, in the following protected areas:<br/><br/>Colombia<br/><ul><li>Puracé Natural National Park (83,000 ha) (in range, Defler 2003, 2004)</li><li>Tama National Natural Park (48,000 ha) (in range, Defler 2003, 2004)</li><li>Serranía de Los Yariguies (56,000 ha)</li></ul><br/>Ecuador<br/><ul><li>Llanganates National Park (219,707 ha) (Tirira 2007)</li><li>Sumaco Napo Galeras National Park (205,249 ha) (Tirira 2007)</li><li>Cofán-Bermejo Ecological Reserve (55,451 ha) (Tirira 2007)</li><li>Cabañas de San Isidro Reserve (1170 ha) </li><li>Yanayacu Bird and Wildlife Reserve (250 ha)</li><li>Sierra Azul Reserve (2500 ha) </li></ul><br/>It is listed on Appendix II of CITES.<br/><br/>Most urgent is the protection of any forests that provide habitat for populations in northern Colombia.

Surviving subpopulations remain  threatened by ongoing and increasing habitat loss due to the planting of  oil palm and illicit crops, expanding cattle ranching, increased oil  exploration and mining, and fires.","Night monkeys typically occur in primary and secondary forest (including disturbed forest and selectively logged forest), seasonally flooded and <em>terra firma</em>, lowland forest, and submontane and montane (cloud forests) in Colombia and the Andes to 3,200 m above sea level (the specifically montane forms are <em>Aotus lemurinus</em> and <em>Aotus miconax</em>) (Hernández Camacho and Cooper 1976, Aquino and Encarnación 1994a, Defler 2004). Aquino and Encarnación (1994b) reviewed the habitat and forest preferences of the genus. A research in San Martin area, in 100 forest fragments, found <em>A. brumbacki </em>groups in fragments of gallery forest, lowland rainforest and <em>Mauritia flexuosa</em> swamps (Carretero-Pìnzon and Defler in prep.)<br/><br/>Night monkeys are nocturnal: they are most active at dawn and dusk.  The only exception is <em>Aotus azarae azarae</em> of the Chaco of southern Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, which is cathemeral (active during night and day). They are frugivorous; their diet includes fruit, nectar and flower (seasonally important for the <em>A. a. azarae</em> in the Chaco), leaves, and small animals prey such as insects (Wright 1989; Fernandez-Duque 2007). <em>Aotus azarae</em> has been observed to include a significant portion of leaves in its diet (Ganzhorn and Wright 1994, Wright 1985, Arditi and Placci 1990, Giménez and Fernandez-Duque 2003), as has <em>Aotus zonalis</em> on Barro Colorado Island in an early study by Hladik and Hladik (1969).<br/><br/>They are socially monogamous, living in small groups of an adult pair and offspring of different ages (infant, one or two juveniles and sometimes a subadult. In <em>A. a. azarae</em>, a significant number of adults range alone. They may be subadults that have left their natal groups or older adults which have been evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernandez-Duque and Huntington 2002, Fernandez-Duque 2004). Both sexes disperse. Males care for the infants (carry them) (Rotundo <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2005). Lone adults were observed by Villavicencio Galindo (2003) in northern Colombia. Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 5-18 ha (depending on the species and location) (Wright 1978, Fernandez-Duque 2007). Solano (1995) estimated a home range of 17.5 ha for <em>A. brumbacki</em> on the Río Duda in Tinigua Natural National Park, Colombia. Wright (1994) and Fernandez-Duque (2007) review the behaviour and ecology of the genus.<br/><br/>Captive male <em>A. lemurinus</em> reach sexual maturity when two years old, and captive female <em>A. vociferans</em> and <em>A. nancymaae</em> first breed when 3-4 years old (Dixson 1983; Fernandez-Duque 2007). In the wild, male <em>A. azarae</em> reach adult weight only when about 4 years old, and age at first reproduction is about 5 years of age (Juárez <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernandez-Duque 2004). A female <em>A. azarae</em>was found to breed for the first time at 58 months of age (Fernandez-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2002). Single offspring are the rule. Wright (1985) recorded births between August and February for <em>A. nigriceps</em> in Peru (Manu National Park), and Aquino <em>et al.</em> (1990) indicated a birth season between December and March) for <em>A. nancymaae</em> in north-eastern Peru. In the Argentinean Chaco, <em>A. azarae</em> shows a peak of births between March and June (Fernandez-Duque 2007).<br/><br/>Size: Hernández-Camacho and Defler (1985) recorded a weight of 875 g for one individual (sex unknown), and 455 g for a female, probably not fully grown.","Although the distribution of <em>Aotus brumbacki</em> remains poorly known, much of this Colombian endemic’s presumed range lies within regions of savanna habitats, already cleared forest, fragmented forest and ongoing ‘hotspots of deforestation’ (Etter <em>et al</em>. 2006, Sanchez-Cuervo and Aide 2013).&#160; Three of four sub-populations inhabiting protected areas remained threatened; El Cocuy National Park lies within a region characterized as a deforestation hotspot (Sanchez-Cuervo and Aide 2013), while Serranía de la Macarena Natural National Park and Tinigua Natural National Park are surrounded by areas that are already more than 70% deforested (Etter <em>et al</em>. 2006, Carretero-Pinzon 2013) and/or subjected to high levels of armed conflict (Morales 2017). Surviving subpopulations remain threatened by ongoing and increasing habitat loss due to the planting of oil palm and illicit crops, expanding cattle ranching, increased oil exploration and mining, and fires (Baptiste <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; In areas where armed conflict has subsided or the combatants have changed, these threats may be increasing, even within protected areas (Morales 2017).","Little information is available regarding the total population size, structure and dynamics of <em>Aotus brumbacki</em>, save for the fact that few subpopulations have been documented or are assumed to be present in several protected areas. Of these, two subpopulations (Sierra de la Macarena National Park and Tiniqua National Park) have been reduced to fragments surrounded by areas where more than 70% of the forests have already been cleared since the year 2000 (Etter <em>et al</em>. 2006), and a third (El Cocuy National Park) lies within the largest identified&#160; 'hotspot of deforestation' located in the Colombian Llanos (Sancez Cuervo and Aide 2013).<br/><br/>Much of this monkey's presumed range lies within regions of savanna habitats that have already been cleared forest, fragmented forest and ongoing ‘hotspots of deforestation’. Surviving subpopulations remain threatened by ongoing and increasing habitat loss due to the planting of oil palm and illicit crops, expanding cattle ranching, increased oil exploration and mining, and fires. Based on these threats, it is suspected that the population has undergone a reduction of at least 30% over the last three generations (24 years), and that it will continue to decline at this rate for the next 24 years.",Decreasing,"<em>Aotus brumbacki</em> is a lowland night monkey, that extends East from the Cordillera Oriental in Colombia between the Ríos Arauca and Guaviare (Hershkovitz 1983; Defler 2003, 2004).

It is diurnal, terrestrial, arboreal, and folivorous. It is a diurnal and mainly terrestrial species, but may prefer arboreal canopies to flee from danger. Individuals are sometimes known to prefer barren rock cliffs for warmth.&#160;<br/><br/>Langurs inhabit semi evergreen Sal (<em>Shorea robusta</em>), and alpine cedar forests. They could range as high as as 3,500-4,000 m and could well survive harsh winters and rainy summers in July-October and an annual rainfall as high as 2,500 m. Most of their diet is composed of leaves (40-60%), and the rest of&#160; fruits (20%), ripe, unripe, herbaceous fruits. Other constituents are seeds, storage organs, roots, flowers, cambium, bark, twigs, coniferous cones, moss, lichens, epiphytic fern, young bamboo shoots, rhizome, grass and invertebrate animals. They prefer young leaves of broad-leaved deciduous trees than of evergreen trees. Seasonal variation in food preference is well pronounced. In spring and summer, when their diet is diverse, they feed on leaf clusters of <em>Zanthoxylem nepalense</em>, young leaves and bark of <em>Jasminum humile</em>, acorns, young deciduous leaves, and pine cones. In monsoon, feed on young deciduous leaves and fruits, while in autumn consume unripe fruits, seeds and fleshy ripe fruit, herb leaves and fruit, fleshy plant tissue, cultivated potato <em>Solanum tuberosum</em>. In winter, leaf buds, fruits (ripe) of <em>Cotonester frigidus, Berberis aristata, </em>leaf buds of <em>Sorbus cuspidate</em>, herbs and pinecones.<br/><br/>Birthing is concentrated between late winter to early spring and most mating happens between July-September. This arrangement allows for the langur infants to grow strong to survive their first winter. Besides, winters also mean migration down hill and the independent mobility of infants allows for easy migration for the both the mother and the infant. The inter-birth interval is usually 25 months, until the female gets pregnant and when she weans her infant. Inter-birth intervals are shorter when the infant dies and the female becomes receptive to mate again.<br/><br/>Like other Himalayan species, this species lives in multi-male, multi-female groups. Group sizes range between 4-47 individuals with 1-4 adult males and the female sex ratio 1-1.5-1.7. Larger groups may split while maintaining contact through intermittent call by males. The annual home range is 1,275-12,700 ha due to seasonal migration up and down the mountain. The call of dominant males is a ‘Wao’ or ‘Ua’ and these langurs don’t woop like the southern Indian or plain dwelling langurs.

Habitat destruction and degradation have occurred across the range of C. <em>polykomos</em> in Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Each of these countries lost between 14% and 21% of their total forest cover between 2001 and 2017, and the drivers of forest loss continue to operate (www.globalforestwatch.org). In addition, human populations in these countries increased by 120%. Commercial logging and subsistence hunting are common across the range countries, and the development of large-scale mining, logging and industrial agricultural concessions in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea are having devastating effects on wildlife (WCF 2014, 2015; Tweh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Laws against hunting and other illegal activities in protected areas are poorly enforced in all countries in the species' range. As a result, during the last three decades, the King Colobus has disappeared from the majority of the protected areas in which it once occurred and now occurs only in a limited number of forests, usually at low densities. Based on the ongoing habitat degradation/fragmentation, poaching pressure, human population growth and the decline in forest cover, the total population of <em>C. polykomos </em>has declined by more than 50% during the last three generations.","<p>This species depends on rainforest and gallery forest; it is rarely found in degraded habitats, although sometimes occurs in secondary forests. <em>Colobus polykomos </em>usually forms small multi-male groups. In the Cantanhez Forest in Guinea-Bissau, groups consisted of 3–10 individuals, while at Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary in Sierra Leone, one habituated group had nine members (Dasilva 1989). Lone individuals have also been observed. At Tiwai, it associates with the Western Red Colobus (<em>Piliocolobus badius badius</em>). Mean group size of the Taï population is 15 (range 12–19) (Korstjens 2001, Zuberbühler and Jenny 2002). In Mt. Nimba, Liberia, it associates with the Diana Monkey (Galat and Galat-Luong 2000). Low mtDNA diversity indicates that female philopatry and male dispersal is common in this species (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). Dasilva (1994) studied the diet of <em>C. polykomos </em>in the mid-1990s at Tiwai and found that 30% of feeding time was spent eating leaves and seeds. In Taï, this species is more frugivorous than the sympatric red colobus and Olive Colobus monkeys (Korstjens <em>et al</em>. 2007).<em><br/><br/>Colobus polykomos </em>c<span class=""datalabel1"">an live in high altitude areas.

The Upper Guinean rainforest is a highly fragmented system and remains one of the most severely threatened forest systems in the world. From 2001 to 2017, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau respectively lost 7.2%, 14%, 21% and 12% of their forest cover (Global Forest Watch 2019). The forest cover of these five countries declined from 321,680 km²&#160;in 1990 to 300,540&#160;km²&#160;in 2015, a loss of 21,680&#160;km²&#160;(7%) (FAO 2015). Based on World Bank data (2019), the human population in these countries increased from 30.5 million inhabitants in 1987 to 67.0 million in 2017, an increase of 120%. Habitat encroachment for agricultural purposes occurs throughout the range countries even inside protected areas. In Cote d'Ivoire &gt;80% of the protected areas have been converted to plantations (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015). The secondary threats are forest loss, degradation and fragmentation.<br/><br/>Hunting is common across the range countries of <em>C. polykomos</em>. In the Tai National Park in Cote d'Ivoire, where the largest subpopulation of this species remains, several studies have documented the impacts of hunting (Refisch and Kone 2005, McGraw 2007,&#160;Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2008). A local bushmeat market survey conducted by Covey and McGraw (2014) on the Liberia-Cote d'Ivoire border found that <em>C. polykomos</em> represented 11.4% of the primate carcasses for sale. A nationwide survey in Liberia found that signs of hunting were the most frequently encountered anthropogenic threat recorded, with a rate of 1.32 signs per km (Tweh <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The development of large-scale mining, logging and industrial agricultural concessions in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea threatens all wildlife (WCF 2014, 2015; Tweh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a><em>Colobus polykomos </em>has declined across its geographic range.<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Taï National Park probably sustains the largest population remaining in all the range countries. A survey by Zuberbühler and Jenny (2002) in Taï NP estimated the population density at 35.5 individuals per km² in research areas. Line transect survey data collected by Covey (2009) at the same site indicated a decline of 30% (1.62 group/km², equivalent to 25 individuals/km².&#160;Inside Taï&#160;NP but outside the research area, the species has become very rare (Covey 2009). With the exception of Taï, the species has been extirpated in more than 95% of the protected areas in Cote d'Ivoire where it previously occurred. During a 2007–2010 monitoring survey in the Cavally FR, the species was reported at a very low encounter rate (0.02 group/km; WCF 2010). The ongoing hunting pressure, habitat encroachment and human settlement within such forest reserves pose severe threats to the survival of these remaining populations.<br/><br/>In Guinea, <em>C. polykomos</em> has been extirpated in several localities, including protected areas. In the Boke region, a 2005 RAP survey (Eriksson and Kpoghomou 2006) found no evidence of the species' presence, although it was formerly reported from the region by local people. A rapid survey of primates conducted from November to December 2015 also failed to find evidence of the species in the CGB-Halco concession (WCF 2015). Surveys conducted between April 2012 and February 2014 confirmed the presence of <em>C. polykomos </em>in the Lebekere sub-prefecture, in the northern sector of the Fouta Djallon mountain range. The ongoing loss and fragmentation of this habitat suggest that the population is in decline (Fernandez-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In Guinea-Bissau, the species occupies patches of forest where anthropogenic habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and poaching pressure are high (Minhós&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In Cantanhez National Park in southwestern Guinea-Bissau, Minhós&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2013) estimated an effective population size of 251–575 based on an analysis of the mtDNA hypervariable region (HVR). A 2015 recce survey in Dulombi National Park reported the presence of the species at a low encounter rate of 0.33 groups/km (Bersacola<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018). The presence of&#160;<em>C. polykomos</em>&#160;in the Boe region has been reported in&#160;a 2013 survey (Hoogveld 2013).<br/><br/>In Liberia, the species has already been depleted in most protected and unprotected areas. Subsistence and commercial hunting pressure have increased during the last decade and illegal gold mining threatens the future of protected areas (Tweh&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). In Nimba County, north-central Liberia, Bene&#160;<em>et al. </em>(2013a) reported that they did not encounter any hunters carrying carcasses of this species in their market visits, indicating that it has been depleted in most, if not all forests in this area.&#160;<em>C. polykomos</em>&#160;was not observed during a recce survey conducted in November-December 2011 in the forest patches of the Sime Darby concession covering four counties (Gbarpolu, Bomi, Bong and Grand Cape Mount)&#160;(Bene&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013b). During a 2014 biomonitoring survey in the Grebo-Krahn National Park, the species was encountered at a very low rate (0.08 groups/km; WCF 2014). During another survey conducted from January-August 2017 in the Krahn-Bassa National Forest,&#160;<em>C. polykomo</em>s was also encountered at a very low rate (0.03 groups/km; WCF 2017). In Sapo National Park, a 10-month biomonitoring survey conducted in 2002 yielded a mean average sighting rate of 0.13/km, with a decrease in the monthly average recording of this species (Waitkuwait 2003). The species was heard twice in North Loma National Forest and sighted three times in the Grebo National Forest during a Rapid Assessment Program survey conducted from 16 November to 12 December 2005 in North Loma National Forest, Gola National Forest and Grebo National Forest (Barrie&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).<br/><br/>In Sierra Leone<em>,&#160;</em>insufficient data are available to assess the current status of this species. Nevertheless, indications are that it is very rare and its distribution patchy (Brncic&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).

17945814,4229,Cercopithecus sclateri,Endangered,A2cd,2019,2019-01-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Endangered because Sclater’s Monkey is estimated to have undergone a population decline exceeding 50% over the past three generations (about 27 years, assuming a generation length of nine years),&#160;resulting from a decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality, and high levels of exploitation. This decline is projected to continue into the future, and its rate will probably intensify due to continuing widespread habitat loss and degradation and hunting.&#160;Additionally, the species does not occur in any officially gazetted wildlife conservation area. In large part, Sclater’s Monkey persists due to its small size, cryptic nature, adaptability and general non-preferred status among hunters relative to other monkeys. Close population monitoring should take place. However, such monitoring may be hampered by insecurity in the Niger Delta and in other parts of the species’ range and by the lack of an organised national programme in Nigeria focusing on Sclater’s Monkey.","<p>The original habitat of Sclater’s Monkey is moist tropical lowland forest, but due to severe habitat degradation, this species now persists in remnant secondary, gallery/riparian and freshwater swamp forests. The species is also found in marginal forest and farm-bush in communities where monkeys are regarded as sacred (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992, Tooze 1995, Baker 2005). Sclater’s Monkey is likely omnivorous, with a diet similar to other members of the <em>C. cephus</em> group: mostly fruits, insects and young foliage (Oates and Baker 2013).</p>","The rapidly growing human population of Nigeria is expected to be the third largest globally by 2050. This growth has been accompanied by widespread environmental degradation and will continue to negatively affect natural habitats. Across Nigeria, land area devoted to agriculture and plantations (crop and grazing lands, floodplain agriculture, irrigation and livestock projects, and tree and forest plantations) increased by nearly 84,000&#160;km²&#160;between 1976 and 1995. More than half of the country’s undisturbed lowland moist forest was lost during that same time frame (from 25,951 to 12,114                    km²) (Geomatics International <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160;From 1990–2015, net forest loss across Nigeria continued at a rate of 3.5% annually, resulting in a loss of ~4,100&#160;km²&#160;each year – more than any other African nation. During this period, Nigeria lost 59.4% of its forested area and 98.7% of its primary forest (FAO 2015). During the latter part of this period, from 2000–2015, the rate of forest loss across Nigeria accelerated (5%) (FAO 2015), and the percent of forest cover declined from 14.4% to 7.7% (World Bank 2017).&#160;Conversion of forested areas to farmland is a major contributor to this decline; for the decade ending in 2008, Nigeria converted more land to annual crops than did any other tropical nation (Phalan <em>et al.</em> 2013). The southeastern region of Nigeria, where Sclater’s Monkey occurs, has among the highest human population densities in the country and one of the highest in Africa. As a result, most natural forest across this species’ range has been converted to cultivated land; unregulated logging and activities associated with oil exploration and production have added to the destruction (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992, Baker and Olubode 2008). Of particular concern for Sclater’s Monkey is severe habitat fragmentation, resulting in a lack of connectivity among existing populations and associated loss of heterozygosity in population isolates.&#160;Additionally, the species does not occur in any official wildlife conservation area or have any effective protection from exploitation outside of the very few sites where it is protected by local communities owing to social taboos.","<p>Given widespread habitat loss across this species’ range, many of the remaining populations of Sclater’s Monkey are isolated, and most occur in&#160;highly&#160;degraded, unprotected forests. This degradation, combined with hunting pressure and lack of official protection, has led to decline of the population. The species’ persistence in southeastern Nigeria can be attributed to the species’ small size, shy nature and adaptability, and preferential hunting of larger-bodied primate taxa (Baker and Olubode 2008). Until the 1990s, Sclater’s Monkey was thought to be very rare, but extensive surveys since then have revealed its presence at a number of formerly unknown sites. In one regional survey, Baker and Olubode (2008) did not encounter any localities of recent extirpation (or sites where local reports indicated that populations of this species had been extirpated even though suitable habitat remains). Nevertheless, encounter rates were low: 0.18 detections per km surveyed.<br/><br/>In the very few sites where it is not hunted, or where hunting is less commonly practised (such as the Niger Delta where some communities rely on fish as their main protein source), this species may fare relatively well compared to larger primates. In the Edumanom Forest Reserve, a comparatively large forest block in the Niger Delta, one study found Sclater’s Monkey to be the most abundant diurnal primate encountered, occurring in an estimated 3.1 groups per&#160;km² (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011). In three village sites where Sclater’s Monkey is protected by social taboos&#160;(i.e. monkeys are not killed), populations appear to increase: 1) Lagwa, Imo State (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a); 2) Akpugoeze community complex, Enugu State (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a, 2018); and 3) Ikot Uso Akpan, Akwa Ibom State (Eniang and Egwali 2011). However, the survival of these populations requires them to adapt to living in heavily deforested, urbanizing environments. Although apparently increasing, these populations are also relatively small: 178 individuals in Ikot Uso Akpan (Eniang and Egwali 2011), 206 individuals in Lagwa (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2014a), and 339 individuals in the Akpugoeze community complex (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to southern Nigeria. It ranges from the eastern Niger Delta in Bayelsa State east to the Cross River, and north to Enugu and Ebonyi States; the most northerly known populations occur in southern Anambra-Enugu States and central Ebonyi State (Baker and Olubode 2008). Sclater’s Monkey was feared extinct until it was sighted southwest of Oguta, Imo State, in 1988 (Oates and Anadu 1989). Additional populations were subsequently discovered in the early to mid-1990s (Oates <em>et al.</em> 1992; Tooze 1995, 1996). In a 2004 regional survey, the species was located in several sites where it had not been previously recorded (Baker 2005, Baker and Olubode 2008). Across its range, this species has generally been recorded in fragmented, degraded forests (Oates <em>et al</em>. 1992, Tooze 1995, Baker and Olubode 2008).","Being the smallest diurnal primate across its range (along with <em>Cercopithecus erythrogaster</em>), Sclater’s Monkey has the lowest economic value as bushmeat relative to other diurnal primates. While it is sought after by hunters, some hunters consider the species more difficult to kill due to its size and cryptic nature, and some do not bother hunting Sclater’s Monkey given the lower profit it brings (Baker and Olubode 2008).",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is currently listed as Class B under the African Convention and under Appendix II of CITES.<br/><br/>There are no formally protected areas in the range of Sclater’s Monkey. Important conservation measures suggested by Baker (2005) include: 1) elevating the species to Schedule I of the Nigerian Endangered Species Act (this change may not be considered unless the species is elevated to CITES Appendix I); 2) raising awareness about the species and its uniquely Nigerian status through publicity and education; and 3) enhancing protection of key forests, including the Edumanom Forest Reserve in Bayelsa State, Upper Orashi Forest Reserve in Rivers State and the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve in Akwa Ibom State.<br/><br/>Communities where Sclater’s Monkey receives cultural protection (through social taboos) are also very important, although forest cover in these sites has been greatly reduced over time.&#160;These include Ikot Uso Akpan and other communities in the Itam region (Akwa Ibom State), Lagwa (Imo State) and the Akpugoeze community complex (Enugu State). In Lagwa and Akpugoeze, previous and existing conservation measures include school-based awareness programmes, stakeholder workshops,&#160;documentation and publishing of folklore and oral histories related to the cultural value of monkeys, and population and forest monitoring (Baker 2013; Baker <em>et al.</em> 2009; 2014a,b; 2018). Forest restoration and conservation awareness efforts have also been conducted in Ikot Uso Akpan (Jacob <em>et al.</em> 2013). Development of small-scale ecotourism in these communities should be explored, given how readily monkeys can be observed at these sites.<br/><br/>Other potential areas for enhanced protection are the Niger floodplain and Osomari Forest Reserve (Oates <em style=""font-family: Georgia; font-size: 12pt;"">et al.</em> 1992), as well as the Blue River (Azumini, Abia State) and Enyong Creek/Ikpa River (Akwa Ibom State) (Tooze 1995).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The species is also threatened from persecution as a pest, and minimally from the pet industry<br/></p><p>More specifically, according to government data, during the 42-year period (1956-1993) the country lost 50% of its forest cover, and more than 70% if the last 22 years to the present are included. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number of macaques (Dittus 1977). Since 2003 a new threat has emerged: it involves translocating animals considered pests to unsuitable habitats where macaque survival is at risk (Dittus 2012a,b). In addition, there has been a loss of at least 15% of natural habitat in the Northern Dry Zone areas, especially since the end of the war in 2009 and further losses are expected (Mattsson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). The large-sized protected areas (as well as unprotected ones) in the dry and arid zones provide suitable ecological habitat in less than 2% of their areas: only along the narrow riverine forests for this water dependent species (Dittus 1977). Therefore, macaque densities in most National Parks and other remaining tracts of the dry zone forests have been estimated to be extremely low: at 0.2–0.5/km² (Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, McKay 1973, Dittus 1977). Wet zone habitats (<em>M. s. aurifrons</em>) are densely populated by humans and macaques are isolated in fragmented patches and are treated as pests (Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In the montane areas,&#160;<em>M. s. opisthomelas</em>&#160;is assessed here as Critically Endangered. This endemic species is threatened also by the fact that it has no legal protection but is managed as a pest species. In human-monkey conflict situations people are at liberty to kill macaque monkeys, and some commercial air-rifle sellers advertise their products with macaques as targets. The overall empirical profile for the species justifies IUCN Endangered status. Notwithstanding, the&#160;public perception of macaque numbers countrywide is highly overblown because macaques are often lured out of the forest towards refuse and crops where they are seen easily. Garbage feeding macaque populations can grow exponentially (Dittus 2012, Dittus&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). These facts, together with macaque-human conflict (Nekaris <em>et al</em>. 2013, Cabral <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dittus <em>et al</em>. 2019), have misled some people to question the species’ overall threatened status, and therefore poses a political challenge for conservation policy and management.&#160;</p>","The species is found in a variety of forest types (Dittus, 1977) at all altitudes up to about 2,100 m (Corbet and Hill 1992).&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">Macaca sinica aurifrons&#160;</em>is found in lowland and midland tropical rainforest and wet zone lowland forests,&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">M. s. opisthomelas&#160;</em>in montane tropical rainforest, and&#160;<em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 12pt;"">M. s. sinica&#160;</em>in the extensive dry evergreen forest near permanent water. The species is mainly arboreal and terrestrial and diurnal. It is frugivorous, but also consumes flowers, new leaf shoots, tubers, insects, and the occasional small vertebrate. It adapts easily to human foods (Hladik and Hladik, 1972, Dittus, 1977). Its local and wider geographic distributions are limited by the availability of free water; in the dry and arid zones this means that its ecological distribution is far less than suggested by the area of occupancy in red lest assessments (Dittus, 2013).","<p>The chief threat to this species is habitat loss owing to the encroachment of plantations, and fuel wood collection. Other threats include shooting, snaring and poisoning of the animals, as they are considered to be crop pests (Dittus 2012, Molur<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>According to government data, during one 42-year period (1956-1993), the country lost 50% of its forest cover and more than 50% if the last 10 years (1994-2003) are included. Over the last 15 years the rate of decline has remained the same with increasing pressures of habitat modification, forest die back, agriculture, plantations, and settlements. There is a 1:1 relationship between loss of critical habitat and population number. Therefore, the species is reduced numerically minimally by 50% (Dittus 2012, Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003). Much of the original forested habitat of&#160;<em>M. s. aurifrons</em>&#160;in the southwest rainforest areas has been converted to agriculture, home gardens and plantations. These habitats are inimical to macaque survival because the animals are not tolerated by humans (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Nekaris&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2013, Cabral&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018). In addition, 80% of hill country forests were lost to tea plantations during the 19th century. The populatoin of <em>Macaca s. opisthomelas</em>&#160;has been reduced by &gt;80% over the last 20 years. This trend is continuing as high elevation natural forests are being converted to agriculture (vegetable plots and dairy pasture) (Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003, Dittus 2013, Gamage&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Wickramanayake and Gunatilleke 2002, Wijesundera 2012); the subspecies is assessed as Critically Endangered. The Mahaweli Development Scheme has destroyed much dry-zone forest habitat of&#160;<em>M. s. sinica&#160;</em>(Molur&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2003) and continues to impact dry zone forests (Mattson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Jayasuriya&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). The protracted civil war in Sri Lanka has had a negative impact on habitat and wildlife in the dry zone (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003).<br/><br/>The species is also persecuted due to increasing human-wildlife negative interactions throughout the range (Dittus&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019, Cabral&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018, Nekaris&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).

In 1994, the area occupied by this species was less 26 km² and the population was <em>ca</em> 1,000–1,200 individuals. Current population is estimated at <em>ca</em> 1,000 individuals. Population reduction is expected to continue, based on a continuing decline in its area of occupancy and extent of occurrence, as a result of the current high rate of habitat degradation, fragmentation and loss due to unsustainable exploitation of forest, woodland, and bushland by people. A future population reduction exceeding 80% over three generations (33 years) is predicted, given the rate of decline in forest cover levels reached in recent years. This is especially likely if the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR) is officially annulled, an action now being considered by national authorities. The entire population lies in a politically insecure area over which there is a low level of conservation activity, and much unplanned, unregulated, and unsustainable exploitation of natural resources.</p>","<em>Cercocebus galeritus </em>is restricted to flood-plain forest, riverine gallery forest, and the adjacent woodland and bushland (Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013). Abundance is highly correlated with the spatial characteristics of the forests (Wahungu <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is a semi-terrestrial monkey that can travel up to 1 km through non-forested habitat between forest patches (Wieczkowski 2010). Mean group size is <em>ca </em>27 individuals (range: 6–62; Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013).<em> Cercocebus galeritus </em>is frugivorous and forages predominantly on the ground and up to 2 m above the ground (Homewood 1978). It feeds on seeds, fruits, stems, leaves, insects and fungi (Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013).","<em>Cercocebus galeritus </em>has declined as a result of several causes including: (a) drastic changes in vegetation due to dam construction, irrigation projects and water diversion, which affect both the water table and the frequency and severity of flooding which, in turn, affect the extent and quality of this species’ forest habitat; (b) forest clearance for agriculture; (c) fires that destroy forests; (d) habitat degradation due to livestock and (e) the unsustainable collection of wood and other forest products; (f) selective felling of fig trees for canoes; (g) exploitation of one of the species’ top food plants,<em> Phoenix reclinata</em>; and (h) corruption, inter-ethnic violence and insecurity. There is also percution of <em>C. galeritus </em>as a crop pest and this is expected to increase as natural foods become less available due to habitat loss (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Wieczkowski and Mbora 2000, de Jong and Butynski 2012, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013, Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013, Butynski and Hamerlynck 2016, Butynski and de Jong 2019). Because all remaining forests inhabited by<em> C. galeritus </em>are small and seriously threatened, the long-term survival of the species is in question.<br/><br/>There has been considerable alteration of river flow volume and the flood cycle by five hydroelectric power dams up-river (Butynski 1995). A sixth dam, the High Grand Falls Dam, is under construction (Hamerlynck <em>et al.</em> 2012; Butynski and Hamerlynck 2016). The High Grand Falls Dam, the second largest dam in Africa, will be accompanied by large-scale irrigation schemes and water transfer to the ‘Lamu Port and Lamu Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor’. The establishment of this dam is expected to have additional negative impacts on the forests of the Lower Tana River and, therefore, on<em> C. galeritus.<br/></em><em></em><br/>One special concern is the rapidly growing human population in the region. Another is the possible annulment of the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR; 169 km²), which the High Court of Kenya ordered in January 2007. According to the Kenya Wildlife Act 2013, Section 37, change of boundaries or revocation of a National Reserve can only be published by the Cabinet Secretary and approved by Parliament. Change or revocation can only be recommended if they do not endanger any species or critical habitat. As such, it seems unlikely that annulment will occur despite the court ruling in 2007.<em><br/></em><br/><em></em><em></em>About 56% of<em> C. galeritus </em>occur in TRPNR. Even with the continued existence of the TRPNR the long-term survival of<em> C. galeritus </em>is not certain as the high level of insecurity and inadequate law enforcement in the region is expected to continue, as is the growth in the human population (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Wieczkowski and Mbora 2000, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013, Butynski and de Jong 2019).","<em></em>  <p><em>Cercocebus galeritus</em> is often relatively common where present (Butynski and Mwangi 1994, 1995; Wieczkowski and Butynski 2013).

18341580,11003,Kinixys homeana,Critically Endangered,A2bcd+4bcd,2021,2019-02-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Kinixys homeana</em> is experiencing a very serious decline over much of its range, due mainly to extensive habitat loss, intensive harvesting for subsistence and traditional medicine (""<em>ju-ju</em>""), and exploitation for the international pet trade, leading to markedly decreased tortoise densities in severely decreased remaining habitat. At many sites, tortoise populations are impacted by two or three of the above concurrent threats, causing catastrophic population declines. It is more than likely that these threats will continue to grow in the next several years, due to continuing rates of deforestation, human population density and growth, and industrial development in some crucial areas (e.g., southern Nigeria, southern Cote d’Ivoire). Although there are no specific data on the decline of global populations of <em>K. homeana</em>, we can extrapolate global population declines using data from Nigeria as a benchmark. Assuming that: 1) the density of tortoises has remained constant in remaining suitable habitats (however, this is unlikely in view of hunting pressures), 2) local hunting pressures have remained constant over the years (also unlikely in view of human population growth from about 35 million in 1959 to approximately 120 million in 2001), and 3) that the suitable habitat for <em>K. homeana</em> has declined by at least 90% in the last 45 years based on known habitat loss, then it can be estimated that in 1960 there were at least 5,000,000 tortoises in Nigeria compared to an estimate of about 500,000 today. Using these estimates (i.e., a <em>ca</em>. 90% decline in suitable habitat in the past <em>ca</em>. 45 years or about three tortoise generations, translating to a decline of roughly 30% per generation of <em>ca</em>. 15 years), <em>K. homeana</em> can be classified as Critically Endangered according to IUCN criteria CR A2bcd. Assuming that rates of deforestation and human population growth will continue into the future, we can also estimate that the ongoing population reductions of <em>K. homeana</em> would be 30% for each of the past two generation times (30 years) and 30% for the future one generation time of 15 yrs, indicating that the species can also be assessed as CR A4bcd. As noted, this assessment is specific for Nigeria, not range-wide, but there is no indication that Nigeria represents an exceptional case of decline (apart from its high human population size), but more of a best-studied case and indicative for most of the region. Ghana and Togo have among of the highest deforestation rates in Africa, with the former, for instance, at 2% (135,000 ha) loss per year. Thus, approximately 1,931,000 ha (26%) of <em>K. homeana</em> habitat was lost between 1990 and 2005. Recent field searches indicate populations in Ghana have suffered significant loss or have been extirpated, and the same has also occurred in Togo and Cote d’Ivoire. Similar extrapolations can be performed for other range countries as well, and all these calculations lead to the conclusion that: 1) population declines have been very rapid for <em>K. homeana</em>, and 2) there is no reason to predict that this trend will be reversed or slowed. <em>Kinixys homeana</em> was previously assessed as Data Deficient on the Red List in 1996 and reassessed as Vulnerable in 2006.","<em>Kinixys homeana</em> is a small to medium-sized forest tortoise (with a carapace length of up to about 23 cm), with an omnivorous diet and specialized habitat-selection for rainforest and swamp forest patches. It is diurnal or crepuscular, and particularly active above-ground after rains, during the wet season.<br/><br/>The species prefers moist forests that provide closed canopy and shady microhabitats (Luiselli 2005; Luiselli and Diagne 2013; Mifsud and Stapleton 2014), however it has also been associated with streams and swampy areas (Maran and Serpol 2006; Branch 2007). According to some sources, it generally inhabits forests that are drier than those inhabited by the similar species, <em>K. erosa</em> (Broadley 1989; Ernst and Barbour 1989; Lawson 1993, 2006), but in Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire and Nigeria the opposite has also been observed (Chirio and LeBreton 2007, Luiselli and Diagne 2013). In most sites, this species occurs syntopically with <em>K. erosa</em> (for instance, in Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria and Togo), and in the Togo hills bordering Ghana and in a few sites in the Niger Delta also with <em>K. nogueyi</em> (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Overlap in range between these species may be a limiting factor in habitat occupancy due to interspecific competition for local resources (Luiselli 2003b). Research in the River Niger Delta in southern Nigeria has shown populations of <em>K. homeana</em> to be habitat specialists associated with mature secondary forests around mangroves and mature secondary swamp forests (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000). In all of this area, primary forests are totally extirpated, and hence these tortoises inhabit the closest and more mature secondary forests. In general, many populations of this species are severely fragmented and isolated inside remnant patches of holy forests (Akani, Eniang, Luiselli, Ebere, Petrozzi, unpubl. data). Lawson (2000, 2006) found this species to be sympatric with <em>K. erosa</em> in neighboring Cameroon, with adult specimens of both sexes of both species with overlapping home ranges. Multiple specimens of both species have been observed feeding on ephemeral mushrooms at the same time (Lawson, unpubl. data). Within the eastern region of the Niger Delta, Luiselli (2003a) demonstrated the type of treatment&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;receives by local communities may play a large role in habitat selection. In communities that treat&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;as a holy animal, individuals can be found in diverse habitats such as dense brush, sparse brush, swamps, and plantations. In contrast, communities where&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;is actively hunted, observations are limited to dense brushy areas.&#160;<br/><br/>The species has an omnivorous diet that includes plant matter, seeds, fungi, worms, snails, slugs, and various arthropods that can vary slightly between habitat type (Luiselli 2006b). It may forage on small amphibians, fish, and carrion (Branch 2007) and has a more carnivorous diet than other testudinids (Luiselli 2006c) and forages for food by following olfactory paths with straight, darting jabs of its head (Eglis 1962). In captivity,&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;relishes plantain and banana tree piths (E. Eniang pers. obs.).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Kinixys homeana</em> is primarily more active during the wet season and is known to use floods as a way to disperse by floating rather than swimming. In areas where seasonal flooding occurs, this type of movement is common (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2016 and unpubl. obs.). At least occasionally, the species has been observed to mate in water bodies (Luiselli, Akani and Eniang, unpubl. data). Field studies that investigated homing patterns in Cameroon (Lawson 2006) and Nigeria (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data) tracked individuals through habitats that differed regionally and environmentally. Data from these studies show similar results in that males tend to be highly territorial, driving out other males from home ranges that may exceed 0.5 sq. km. These results indicate that the density of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;is likely to be low even in areas with highly suitable habitat.&#160;<br/><br/>Luiselli and Akani (upubl. data) report mating events in the wild from mid-March to the end of May, and also in September, in southern Nigeria. Females oviposit one to two times per year, typically between December and January during the dry season (Blackwell 1968; George 1994). Eggs are brittle, oval to nearly spherical, and measure approximately 46 x 35 mm (Branch 2007). Nests contain 2–4 eggs and are typically deposited in forest litter and excavated burrows (Blackwell 1968). In captivity clutches of as many as six eggs have been reported (Mifsud and Thompson, unpubl. data). Incubation time in the wild is unknown; however, in captivity eggs will hatch 89–102 days after being incubated at 28–30°C (Koehler 1997). It is suspected that this species has temperature-dependent sex determination (D. Mifsud pers. comm.). Hatchlings generally measure about 42–47 mm CL (Branch 2007) but are known to reach up to 50 mm CL (Farkas and Satorhelyi 2006).&#160;Based on experiences in captivity and by analogy with other forest tortoises (e.g., <em>Indotestudo</em> spp.), generation time for the species is estimated as 15 yrs, based on estimated maturity at 10 yrs and estimated longevity (in captivity) of 60 yrs.<br/><br/>The most detailed study on the habitat preferences of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;has been done in southern Nigeria. At a landscape scale, a statistical study (based on logistic regression of presence/absence data) revealed that Nigerian populations of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;are habitat specialists, being linked to zones of secondary dry forest around mangroves and in zones with secondary swamp-forest (Luiselli <em>et al.</em> 2000). Considering that in the Delta states these habitat types have declined dramatically during the last decades, falling from 2% of state area in 1976–78 to only 0.2% in 1993–95 (Geomatics 1996) due primarily to petrochemical expansion, it may be inferred that habitat loss represents a very serious reason of decline for these tortoises at a global scale. This supposition is reinforced by evidence that&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;needs closed forest canopy and shady microhabitats to avoid overheating, and shows behavioural thermoregulation in its avoidance of overheating (Luiselli 2005), i.e., allowing only short periods of exposure to the sun during movements between sunlit and shaded areas (Hailey and Coulson 1998, Luiselli 2005). Another potential limitation factor of habitat occupancy by&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;may be a potential for interspecific competition for food with the closely related <em>K. erosa</em>, which exhibits a wide overlap in terms of spatial use (Luiselli 2003b).<br/><br/>At a local scale, Luiselli (2003a) demonstrated that the type of attitude of human communities towards tortoises may have very serious consequences on the habitat preferences of these animals, so that any generalization can be difficult. Luiselli (2003a) studied tortoise population ecology at six study areas with similar habitat characteristics in the eastern axis of the Niger Delta. In three areas, the tortoises had been worshipped by local communities for a long time as holy animals, whereas in three other areas they were actively hunted for subsistence. The habitat use by tortoises varied depending on the type of treatment by the indigenous people (hunting vs. veneration): in the veneration areas the tortoises were frequently found in disparate habitats (i.e., dense dry bush, sparse dry bush, riparian vegetation, swamps, and plantations; Luiselli 2003a). In the hunting areas the tortoises were found almost exclusively inside dense bush, and always avoided plantations. It seems likely that the different habitat usage reflects extirpation from easier hunting areas (Luiselli 2003a). This study may have important global consequences for this species' status, because it demonstrates that wherever they are hunted for subsistence (which is a common occurrence in West and Central Africa, e.g., see Fa <em>et al</em>. 2000, Lawson 2000, Fa and Garcia Juste 2001, Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2003), the habitat in which they are still found is just a fraction of the potential habitat. They are limited to forest patches with very dense vegetation where access for human hunters is difficult. Forest habitat loss is an enormous problem in West Africa because of the rate of destruction (Oates 1999), and concomitant with this, human population growth and increasing hunting pressure (e.g., Luiselli 2003a,c; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2003) means that the long-term viability of these tortoises is at very high risk.","Populations of <em>Kinixys homeana</em> are heavily declining throughout much of its range likely due to multiple factors including habitat loss and exploitation by local people for consumption as well as commercial collection for urban bushmeat markets and the international pet trade (Luiselli and Diagne 2013; Mifsud and Stapleton 2014). According to Luiselli <em>et al</em>. (2021), the estimated percentage involvement of threats driving this tortoise toward extinction is 50% habitat loss, 40% local consumption as bushmeat, and 10% exploitation for the international pet trade.<br/><br/>Habitat loss is the main threat for this species. Deforestation is occurring rapidly in Africa for profitable resources as well as conversion to agriculture and industrial expansion. Southern Nigeria has experienced rampant deforestation due to development of large areas for oil and natural gas production as well as unplanned urbanization in the last 25 years following creation of Akwa Ibom state in 1987. Ghana has one of the highest deforestation rates in Africa at 2% (135,000 hectares) loss per year, and approximately 1,931,000 hectares (26%) of <em>K. homeana</em> habitat was lost between 1990 and 2005 for gold mining, rubber plantations, and palm oil plantations (UNEP 2008). These destructive activities present a significant threat for the loss of high quality habitat. Clearance of forest for cultivation is also considered a cause of decline for&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;in Cameroon (e.g., around Nfainchang; Lawson 1993). In Nigeria, the species has disappeared due to slash-and-burn agricultural practices, persisting only in non-burnt mature forest sites (Akani <em>et al</em>. 2018). Although we do not have quantitative data for other countries it is obvious that the same is happening almost everywhere in the range of this tortoise, since in all these countries human population density is growing, forest loss is rapid, and hunting for subsistence is rampant (e.g., see discussion in Oates 1999).<br/><br/>A recent dangerous trend currently devastating habitats and decimating tortoise and other wildlife species are Fulani cattle herders from the north who have migrated into Akwa Ibom and Cross River states in the hundreds to occupy a majority of the remnant riparian and wetlands forests ecosystems (the last known habitats for tortoises) to carry on indiscriminate cattle grazing with its attendant yearly cultural bush burning to encourage new grass growth, thereby destroying tortoise eggs and live animals, and turning the areas into savannas. Akwa Ibom state has become the centre of cattle trade and consumption following a new culture in which families pride and eulogize themselves for how many cattle are slaughtered during family funeral ceremonies. With this development, more and more cattle herders migrate down and carry on with grazing without restraint. E. Eniang (pers. comm.) predicts that unless protected areas are created and managed effectively in Akwa Ibom state,&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;and other tortoises will be locally extirpated within the next 25 years,<br/><br/>Hunting by locals who have no other means is another crucial factor in tortoise population declines (Lawson 2000, Luiselli 2003c). <em>Kinixys</em> are sold in markets throughout Africa and exported internationally for pet trade, consumption, and medicinal purposes (Luiselli 2003b). Surveys of bushmeat and fetish markets in the Niger Delta, Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, Ghana, and Togo conducted by Luiselli <em>et al</em>. (2008, 2013) over an extended period of time revealed significant declines in the number of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;and other <em>Kinixys</em> tortoises for sale, indicating that the numbers of wild individuals are in serious decline. If we consider the proportion of traded quantity decrease in the bushmeat markets over a 10 yr period as a proxy for equivalent population decreases in the wild, it can be calculated that more than 90% of adult tortoises were extirpated from the Niger Delta territory during this time. Hunters also agreed that their numbers decreased considerably in the Nigerian forests (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2013). For instance, this species is now very rare even inside mature forests in protected areas of Nigeria, where they still occur in narrow portions of territory (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2016). The same clear declining trend was also reported by local hunters in Togo that have collected these tortoises for the international pet trade for the past 30 yrs (Luiselli, Petrozzi, and Segniagbeto, unpubl. data). Most of these tortoises are removed during the wet season, during snail and mushroom gathering (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2019; Luiselli, Akani and Eniang, unpubl. data). Snail hunters in Ghana collect tortoises for the international pet trade but have reported increased difficulty finding individuals, and smaller sizes of those that are found (Allman and Agyekumhene, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The impact of collection/hunting/poaching and/or depredation on annual survival rates of <em>Kinixys</em> species is probably significant. A long-term (14 yrs) demographic study of three <em>Kinixys</em> species (<em>K. homeana, K. erosa</em>, and <em>K. nogueyi</em>) performed in southern Nigeria (Cayuela <em>et al</em>. 2019) suggested that the relationship between mortality rate and age was positive and linear, claiming gradually increasing annual mortality rates over their lifetimes. Mean annual survival probability in a very small study plot (0.24 sq. km) was calculated as 0.70 (95% Confidence Interval 0.62–0.77), with survival probability of 0.95 at 9 years, 0.50 at 12 years, 0.25 at 13 years, and &lt; 0.05 at 16 years. The maximum survival of members of the resident population (based on capture-mark-recapture studies) was about 17 years, but it excluded transient animals (defined as single capture individuals) and did not account for potentially poached or depredated individuals from the population. The low maximum detected age, together with the absence of older and larger individuals, indicated population declines and extirpation of the cohort of larger individuals, likely due to a combination of transience and exploitation loss. Additionally, a long-term (12 yrs) demographic study of a population of <em>K. spekii</em> in a larger study area in Zimbabwe (2 sq. km), yielded similar an annual survival probability of 0.74 and maximum detected survival of about 16 years (Coulson and Hailey 2001), with losses in that population due largely to natural predation as well as possible transience.<br/><br/>Export quotas under CITES in 2000 revealed thousands of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;that were either wild-caught or allegedly ranched being sold in international markets (Anonymous 2000), with about 86,000 total exports documented by CITES from 1990 through 2019 (<a href=""https://trade.cites.org/"">https://trade.cites.org/</a>). The designation ""ranched"" is of dubious validity given enforcement of wildlife laws and regulations throughout West and Central Africa, and we are unaware of any legitimate ranching operations in the region. Research has shown that&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;can be found in more diverse, open habitats in regions where the tortoise is not actively hunted compared to areas of active hunting where they occupy dense brushy areas that are hard for humans to reach. It is likely that the species has been extirpated from areas where they are easily captured. Luiselli (2003a) documented that in areas where&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;is threatened by interaction with local human communities, it occupies only a small portion of available suitable habitat.","According to a suite of field surveys, long-term capture-mark-recapture studies on single populations, examination of bushmeat markets, and interviews with local hunters and sellers, in Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and Cameroon, there is clear evidence that the wild populations of <em>Kinixys homeana</em> are heavily declining and collapsing throughout the species’ range, with cases of extirpation even inside protected areas (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2006; Branch 2007; Chirio and LeBreton 2007; Luiselli and Diagne 2013; Mifsud and Stapleton 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Research by Luiselli (2003a) provided insight into what the rough density of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;may be under natural conditions. After 20 days of field work in southern Nigeria, data showed an average density of 1.4 tortoises/ha at six locations. Density ranged from 0.15 to 0.9 tortoises/ha in harvested areas and from 1.65 to 2.85 tortoises/ha in areas where the species is worshipped. Using a different approach (DISTANCE analysis on transect data), Luiselli <em>et al</em>. (2008) determined the mean density varied between 0.403 tortoises/ha and 1.480 tortoises/ha. Lawson (2000, 2006) extrapolated densities as low as 0.03 tortoises/ha for&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;and <em>K. erosa</em> combined in Cameroon, and annual exploitation rates as high as 0.007 tortoises/ha.&#160;<br/><br/>In Nigeria, where the human population density is expanding rapidly (about 125 million people in 2000 and almost 200 million in 2019) and where the remnant proportion of forests is only about 1% of that found in the 1950s (Geomatics 1996), it is almost certain that the current tortoise range is far less than 10% of its former range; we suggest that a more appropriate estimate of the current range of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;in Nigeria is &lt;5% of that in 1992 (Luiselli and Akani, unpubl. data). A current occupation of &lt;5% of the 1992 range would translate to an assessment, for the Nigerian populations, as Critically Endangered under criteria A2c. It has not been reported anywhere that the species survives significantly better in other countries (Luiselli and Diagne 2013); instead, surveys in Cote d’Ivoire (2020) revealed that the species is (almost certainly) extirpated also from coastal forest sites where it was relatively common in 2010–2012. Based on our calculations, the status of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;is clearly becoming increasingly threatened due to the considerable extent of habitat loss in addition to high levels of subsistence hunting. Although few fieldwork-based data on the current area of occupancy (AOO) exist outside of Nigeria for&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>, we estimate it as representing no more than <em>ca</em>. 10% of the presumed historic indigenous range, based on region-wide loss and degradation of appropriate habitat, yielding an estimate of AOO of <em>ca</em>. 43,500 km².<br/><br/>Interviews of local hunters selling tortoises in bushmeat markets have also reported a decline (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2013). Population sizes of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;are likely markedly reduced in areas where these tortoises are actively hunted. In this regard, it has been recently demonstrated that these tortoises have nearly disappeared from the local bushmeat trade in nine markets of southern Nigeria, thus possibly indicating commercial extinction of wild populations at the local level (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Ebola virus outbreak in Nigeria in 2014 led to a fairly short-term ban on the sale of many mammal species there, while allowing continued trade in tortoises, notably <em>Kinixys</em> spp.; by the time mammal trade returned to pre-Ebola levels, tortoise availability in these markets had decreased markedly (Funk <em>et al</em>. in press), suggesting further depletion of regional subpopulations. Many subpopulations are isolated, and in general, the range of this species is severely fragmented (for instance, the subpopulations inhabiting the central block of the River Niger forests are now totally isolated from those inhabiting the Cross River forests, with a few isolated and very small subpopulations still remaining in holy forests, totally surrounded by unsuitable habitats of the Akwa-Ibom State (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data).&#160;&#160;<br/><br/>In the Niger Delta of southern Nigeria, during 1995–2002, we (Luiselli et al., unpubl. data) radio-tracked 33 adults (20 males and 13 females) for 40 continuous days, and measured mean ”area of activity” (quantified via minimum convex polygon) of 0.37 km² for males and 0.24 km² for females, with some specimens (especially males) exhibiting “areas of activity” as large as 0.46 km². Lawson (2000) also stated that, in western Cameroon, male home range may exceed 0.5 km²; his data were very similar to our own despite the different study regions and environmental conditions. Moreover, both in Nigeria (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data) and in Cameroon (Lawson 2000), male tortoises are highly territorial, and usually drive other males away from their core home ranges. Thus, the density of these tortoises is low in most places, even in highly suitable environments. Luiselli (2003a) presented some data on population structure and abundance of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;that can be useful for calculating a rough density of these tortoises under natural conditions. During 20 consecutive field days of research in southern Nigeria (10 days in the wet season and 10 days in the dry season, from February 2001 to January 2002) ten people independently searching a 20 ha area found an average density of 1.4 tortoises/ha at six localities. The density ranged from 0.15 to 0.9 tortoises/ha in harvest areas, and from 1.65 to 2.85 tortoises/ha in veneration areas (Luiselli 2003a).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Kinixys homeana</em> is known to inhabit similar habitats across its entire range, and data from separate regions (Cameroon and Nigeria) showed a clear similarity also in ”areas of activity” and territoriality. Hence we may use the above population density of approximately 1.4 individuals/ha for&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;in Nigeria to extrapolate estimates for the whole species range. Calculating population size from the population density estimates (Luiselli 2003a), we expect approximately 140 tortoises in an area of 1 km², which would give a figure of about 1,300,900 tortoises in all of Nigeria according to the most optimistic view (i.e., assuming that in 50% of the occupied sites there is veneration, and no hunting pressure). However, since our data show that veneration occurs in less than 1% of the occupied sites, the total tortoise population figure would be much lower. With an average density (calculated from Luiselli 2003a for harvest areas) of 0.53 individuals/ha this gives 53.33 tortoises/km², and about 500,000 tortoises in all of Nigeria. This latter figure is probably a much more accurate population estimate. If we apply the above reasoning to the whole of this species’ range, we calculate an estimated total population size for&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;of at best 4,205,000 tortoises, but probably much less given the current fragmentation and exploitation of the forested patches in West Africa. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the great majority of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;wild populations do occur in flat areas and lowlands, where habitat exploitation is easy and rampant all throughout West Africa.&#160;<br/><br/>Lawson (2000) studied the harvest rates of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;in three protected areas of Cameroon (Korup National Park, Banyang-Mbo Sanctuary, and Nta-Ali Reserve), where poaching on these reptiles was still rampant despite legal protection. He estimated an overall mean annual harvest rate of 0.3 animals/km² in these areas with good habitat conditions and relatively low human density. At that time, if 100% of the species’ range was effectively protected (no poaching) and under relatively low human density, and extrapolating harvest data by Lawson (2000), the expected annual harvest rate would have been 236,532 tortoises, i.e., 5.6% of the total surviving tortoise population. However, the per cent of protected territory is less than 3% of the species’ range, there are mostly no controls against poaching in many protected areas, and the human population density is much higher in several regions of the species’ range than in the three protected areas of Cameroon studied by Lawson (2000), and hence we may conclude that the annual harvest rate is certainly much higher than the calculated 5.6%, but not specifically quantifiable on the basis of current data. Also acknowledging the theoretical limits of our calculations, which are estimates, it is still very likely that the free-ranging populations of this species cannot sustain the current pressure (combination of continuing habitat loss and hunting) for more than 2–3 generations, with each generation being about 15 years.<br/><br/>Field searches and community surveys have been conducted routinely at two sites in Ghana since 2010 (Allman and Agyekumhene, unpubl. data). Snail hunters started collecting&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;because of an increase in demand for pet trade export. The snail hunters indicated a previous harvest rate of 15 tortoises per day within Pra Suhein Forest Reserve, but this had decreased to 2–3 small individuals per day by 2017, and often they did not find any at all. These animals were collected for the sole purpose of export into the pet trade. Field searches indicated that tortoise density was three per hectare in 2012, but this had decreased to 1.4 per hectare by 2017 (Allman and Agyekumhene, unpubl. data).&#160;<br/><br/>Country-specific population data are provided below:<br/><u><br/></u><u>Liberia</u> - No recent survey on the distribution of this species in Liberia has been published; however, Luiselli and Fa (unpubl. data) have examined bushmeat markets and surveyed forest patches of this country in 2018. Several specimens (&gt;50) were found by their research staff in the bushmeat markets of Monrovia, Buchanan, and Gbarnga during July 2000. According to the sellers, the tortoises were captured in the nearby surroundings. They also captured (and marked) 14 specimens in the coastal forest around Greenville, in July 2002, during a period of 8 consecutive days of research (a total of 68 man-hours spent in the field). <em>Kinixys homeana</em> was reported by villagers at that time to be locally common (e.g., around Gbarnga), and the pilot surveys in Greenville established an average sighting frequency of 1.75 tortoises/day by the team, which is intermediate between those observed in southern Nigeria in 1) a harvest area (0.84 tortoises/day) and 2) a non-harvest area (2.98 tortoises/day) (Luiselli 2003a). Based on interviews with local hunters and on our preliminary data, we believe that&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;is still widespread in Liberia, although likely declining due to over-exploitation by people. In particular, the civil war which has raged throughout Liberia in recent years, followed by the Ebola crisis in 2014–2015, has had serious consequences for several populations of this species. <em>Kinixys homeana</em> became a common food item for people displaced into forests or bushlands to escape the fighting. Indeed, several interviewees confirmed that tortoises were one of the main protein sources not only for people escaping war but also for soldiers operating in forested zones. For instance, in January–February 2018, Luiselli, Fa, and Magnusson did not find any&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;during two weeks of field surveys in the mature forests of the Nimba mount region. It is more than likely that the species has recently become increasingly rare throughout Liberia.<br/><u><br/></u><u>Cote d'Ivoire</u> - Recent surveys from 2015 through 2020 have been made sporadically by Luiselli, Gonedele Bi, and associates, and since 2017 by Diagne and associates. Historical records (summarized in Iverson 1992, Luiselli and Diagne 2013, and TTWG 2017) have shown that the species is found only in the south, where it was reported to be locally common by hunters in 2010. The species has been found in some localities in Grand Bereby, Tai National Park, Azagny National Park, and Banco forest National Park and also in the forested areas surrounding Abidjan. In Banco NP and in the forest fragments surrounding Abidjan, however, the species has not been recorded in 2019–2020 despite intense field searching (Gonedele Bi and Luiselli, unpubl. data). Interview surveys with local villagers have suggested that this species may still be relatively widespread in the south of the country, but in decline (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). Since the species was observed very rarely or not at all during our 2019 and 2020 surveys, in the same places in which it appeared relatively common in 2015, we hypothesize that the species is undergoing significant declines also in this country, although no longitudinal monitoring for any specific population is available.&#160;&#160;<br/><u><br/></u><u>Ghana</u> – <em>Kinixys homeana</em> has been found in Onyadze and Ony-Winn (two sites of Muni-Pomadze Lagoon, southern Ghana) in secondary forest and grass/thicket habitats (Raxworthy and Attuquayefio 2000). Luiselli and associates did not capture any free-ranging specimen of this species during pilot surveys conducted in 1995, 1996, and 1998 in the coastal bushland in the Great Accra region, but did capture a single male in a bush-plantation area around Cape Coast (southwestern Ghana). Additional surveys in October–November 2003 in the markets around Accra and Koforidua (southern Ghana) indicated several specimens traded, and very few specimens found in the field, likely indicating very low population density. A long-term study was initiated in 2010 to explore <em>K. homeana</em> populations at Kakum National Park and Pra Suhein Forest Reserve (Allman and Agyekumhene, unpubl. data). Populations of small individuals remain at both sites, but appear to have lost all large adults due to intense poaching and hunting. Collectors report tortoises are found with increasing difficulty. Intensive surveys in 2016 and 2017 failed to relocate any specimens in the Muni-Pomadze Site, indicating this population may no longer exist. Based on data provided by all these studies and from comparisons with other geographic regions such as Liberia and Nigeria, and on interviews with local people, we consider this species to have become increasingly uncommon in Ghana. The numbers of free-ranging tortoises captured for the international pet trade should also be monitored, because it cannot be excluded that, as in Togo (Harris 2002), several traded specimens do not come from tortoise farms. Visitation to two tortoise farms in the Accra region suggest the farms are strictly breeding <em>Centrochelys sulcata</em> (Allman and Agyekumhene, unpubl. data).&#160;<br/><u><br/></u><u>Togo</u> - Found only in a small portion of the country, in the remnant forests around the towns of Kpalime and Badou (hilly rainforest of southwestern Togo) (Harris 2002; Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2014). The species is apparently rare in the mature and altered forests of the country, and is reported to be in decline by turtle hunters and traders (Segniagbeto and Luiselli, unpubl. data). In these hilly areas, the high rates of forest loss are threatening the survival of the species.&#160;<br/><u><br/></u><u>Benin</u> – Although no records are available in Iverson (1992), Luiselli and Diagne (2013), or TTWG (2017), the species is known from Benin Republic, where it has been heavily exploited and also exported to western countries. According to recent interviews and field data collected during 2018 surveys by Diagne (unpubl. data) in the Oueme Region along the southeastern coastal border with Nigeria, the species is almost extinct in Benin (F. Azankpo, pers. comm.).<br/><u><br/></u><u>Nigeria</u> - The current distribution is well known because the species has been studied intensively by ourselves and associates during the last ten years (e.g., Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2003; Luiselli 2003a,b,c, 2005). This species has been observed by our staff in several States:&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160; &#160; &#160;Lagos -- presumably rare; several specimens were only found in the forest fragments and bush around Maryland, and around Lekki Lagoon.&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160; &#160; &#160;Oyo -- presumably declining (according to several interviewees); we found it in the forest patches around Ibadan, where it has been collected also in the past (Blackwell 1968), and is actively hunted (Butler and Shitu 1985).&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160; &#160; &#160;Edo -- locally common in mature forest fragments, but presumably extirpated from the many recently deforested areas. Based on random surveys throughout 13 potential sites of occurrence in 1999–2000, we verified its presence in only 4 sites (30.8%). The species was recorded in Okomu National Park in 2014–2015 by Eniang (unpubl. data).&#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160; &#160; &#160;Delta -- very endangered due to severe habitat loss (potential habitat for tortoises covers approximately 0.1% of the state area) and hunting for subsistence. For instance, it was found along the riverine swamp-forests of the Etiope River in 1982, but not found again in 2001 (Lea <em>et al</em>. 2003). Delta state is the centre of tortoise bushmeat trade in southern Nigeria and tortoises are overexploited and sold along the highways on a regular basis. <em>Kinixys homeana</em> is the least represented in the bushmeat market compared to <em>Pelusios niger</em>.&#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160; &#160; &#160;Bayelsa and Rivers -- found in some swamp-forest patches of both these states (e.g., Powell 1993, Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000) and is locally common in a few areas where it is worshipped by indigenous communities (Luiselli 2003a). However it is actively persecuted for both subsistence and traditional medicine (""ju-ju"") in most areas, where it is very likely to be declining (see data in Luiselli 2003a). In addition, it is severely threatened by habitat loss (deforestation) due to expanding petrochemical development.&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160; &#160; &#160;Anambra -- extremely rare, it is found only in a few riverine forest patches in the southernmost part of this state and surrounding Oguta (in AGIP oilfield forest site). Most of the state landscape is characterized by plantations and cultivations, not suitable habitat for this tortoise.&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160; &#160; &#160;Akwa-Ibom -- severely fragmented populations are found in a few riverine forests (e.g., along the banks of the River Kwa-Ibo), in the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve, and in Ina; many specimens are traded for ""<em>ju-ju</em>"" and food in Uyo market, but it seems that a good proportion of them may have come from the adjacent Cross River State (Eniang, unpubl. data). In addition, it is severely threatened by habitat loss (deforestation) due to petrochemical expansion in coastal areas. More common at the border with Cross River State (surroundings of Itu).&#160;&#160; &#160; &#160;<br/>&#160; &#160; &#160;Cross River -- common in lowland forests (e.g., in the Ikpan Forest block, see Eniang and Luiselli 2002), it is replaced by <em>Kinixys erosa</em> in hilly and mountainous forests. In the Cross River National Park, for instance, it is much less common than <em>K. erosa</em>, but this is probably due to natural ecological constraints. <em>Kinixys homeana</em> has been found in several locations in Cross River during intensive surveys from 2017 to 2918 (Eniang, unpubl. data). Surveys during heavy rains have revealed its continued presence in Esuk Mbat, Akpabuyo Local Government Area (LGA), Ekuri and Rhoko forests, Akamkpa LGA, Mbe Mountains in Boki LGA, Okuku in Yala LGA, and Becheve forest in Obanliku LGA. Overall, populations are declining as more and more forest patches are being cleared for subsistence farming. The Umon forest area in Odukpani LGA adjacent to Itu wetlands is the last stronghold of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;in the area.<br/>&#160; &#160; &#160;Other States -- <em>Kinixys homeana</em> also occurs in Enugu state in the area around Nike lake, Abia state in the area around Arochukwo, and in Benue and Taraba states, especially along riparian forests straddling river channels (Eniang, unpubl. data).<br/><u><br/></u><u>Cameroon</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates. Lawson (2000) reported a very strong hunting pressure on this species in the Western and South-West Provinces. Lawson (1993) recorded its presence in seven different sites (Abat, Mundemba, Baro, Besingi, Ekundu Kundu, Pamol Palm Plantations, Nfainchang). Additional known localities are Bipindi, Dibongo, Jengwe, Kribi, Déhané, Nkolembembe, Nko’olong, and Akom II (van Dijk 1994, LeBreton 1999).&#160;<br/><u><br/></u><u>Equatorial Guinea</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates. The species may have previously occurred in the northern coastal region, as there is a locality recorded on the border with Cameroon.<br/><u><br/></u><u>Gabon</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates, and occurrence in Gabon has not been reported. Its possible presence is unknown but, if found, likely to be extremely reduced (for instance, it was not found during two very extensive field surveys in the Monts de Cristal and in the Massif du Chaillu (Pauwels <em>et al</em>. 2002a,b), although very few specimens were traded and exported. It is very unlikely that this species is found in this country, and it is almost certain that the observed specimens were instead <em>Kinixys erosa</em>.<br/><u><br/></u><u>Central African Republic</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates, but a few purported localities have been recorded. It is very unlikely that this species is found in this country, and it is almost certain that the observed specimens were instead <em>Kinixys erosa</em>.<br/><u><br/></u><u>Democratic Republic of Congo</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates. A few specimens identified as&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;from localities in eastern DRC were recorded and discussed by Loveridge and Williams (1957). Since then, Iverson (1992), Luiselli and Diagne (2013), Mifsud and Stapleton (2014), and TTWG (2017) have continued to list and map these localities, but they remain unverified as to whether they represent&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;or a related species, possibly <em>K. belliana</em> or <em>K. erosa</em>. For this assessment we have treated these as questionable or misidentified.",Decreasing,"<em>Kinixys homeana</em> is a forest tortoise with a considerable former (indigenous) range over the coastal region of the Gulf of Guinea within the continuous Guinea-Congo rainforest belt (Iverson 1992; Vetter 2002; Luiselli and Diagne 2013; Mifsud and Stapleton 2014; TTWG 2017). However, for this species as well as many Afrotropical reptiles, the apparent distribution is based on all historical locality records (i.e., many older records from areas which have been drastically modified by humans during the last decades). As a result, these maps are usually a reflection of a species’ historic indigenous distribution rather than its current area of occupancy (AOO).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Kinixys homeana</em> is found in Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, and Cameroon. Specimens have also been reported from Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but these appear most likely to represent misidentified or trade animals. A record from a degraded area in southern Republic of Congo (ROC) by Jackson and Blackburn (2010) appears to represent either a misidentification or trade specimens. The type locality was originally described as Sierra Leone, but later emended to Ashantee, Gold Coast (= Ghana) by Boulenger (1889) and Loveridge and Williams (1957).&#160;<br/><br/>According to our calculations, based on maps in Luiselli and Diagne (2013) and TTWG (2017) and further significantly adjusted for this assessment (see map), the entire range of <em>K. homeana</em> had a presumed historic indigenous range of about 435,000 sq. km and an extent of occurrence (EOO) of <em>ca</em>. 867,000 sq. km. The country comprising the highest percentage of the indigenous range is Nigeria, followed by Cameroon. Because Nigeria and Cameroon comprise the greatest proportion of this species’ range they are appropriate to assess the current global status of <em>K. homeana</em> in the absence of firm data from other countries.","<em>Kinixys homeana</em> is known to be venerated as a holy animal in some communities of the Niger Delta; in most other areas, it is actively hunted for trade and consumption (Lawson 2000, Luiselli 2003a). This species is heavily exploited in Togo, Ghana and Benin for the international pet trade. However, although there is no way to quantify proportions of animals consumed locally versus animals traded internationally as pets, as fewer than 115,000 animals were officially exported range-wide over 45 years (about 2700/year), which could have been supplied from 4000 sq km of habitat at Lawson’s 0.007 animals extracted per hectare; that is less than 10% of the species' AOO, suggesting that bushmeat consumption use (plus any unrecorded illegal exports) is ten times as large as live pet exports. The exported animals have variously been declared as originating from the wild, from ranching operations, or captive breeding facilities; however, documentation that ranching or captive breeding facilities operate effectively remains unavailable. Mirroring patterns seen in other legal and illegal wildlife trade, some (or most) of these specimens are likely taken from other countries and exported through Togo, Ghana and Benin. CITES records of net export quantities during the years 1975–2018 document that a total of 114,240 live specimens were exported: 30,111 live specimens were exported from Benin, 16,076 from Ghana, 64,876 from Togo, and 3,177 from all other countries combined. Trade volumes have been stable or increasing over the years: about 86,000 individual <em>K. homeana</em> were recorded by CITES in the legal international export trade from 1990 to 2020 (<a href=""https://trade.cites.org"">https://trade.cites.org/</a>). Tortoises in general are brought into Akwa Ibom state of Nigeria from neighbouring Cross River state where trade is more difficult due to enforcement activities by authorities and also greater conservation awareness built over the years. Porous borders between western Cameroon and southeastern Nigeria has allowed more tortoises to enter Akwa Ibom state for the fetish market as there is no enforcement against trade. Traders who bring non-timber forest products (NTFPs) from Cameroon and Central Africa by boats come with bushmeat and live tortoises to local unpoliced ports at Ibaka, Oron, Ishiet, and Iko communities of Akwa Ibom state (Eniang <em>et al</em>., unpubl. data).",Terrestrial,"<p>Beyond standard habitat management in protected forests, there are limited specific conservation actions currently being taken to protect&#160;<em>Kinixys homeana</em>. In Togo, the species is protected under Article 62, Section 2, Chapter II of the law N° 2008-005, regulating the environment and wildlife conservation. In Nigeria exports of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;are also not allowed. However, illegal hunting of tortoises even in protected areas is widespread through West Africa (Lawson 2000).&#160; There are numerous protected areas throughout the range of&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>. However, actual protection efforts (of any form) are often lacking, and in areas where enforcement exists, the protection of tortoises and other reptiles is often ignored. Where functioning protected areas occur, efforts should be undertaken to raise awareness among protected area managers and staff of the importance of enforcing protection of tortoises in those areas. In Ghana, there is now a community by-law in place in some areas that specifically protects this species via traditional means (Allman and Agyekumhene, unpubl. data). Conservation needs for&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;are discussed in detail by Luiselli and Diagne (2013) and Mifsud and Stapleton (2014).<br/><em><br/></em><em>Kinixys homeana</em>&#160;has been listed in CITES Appendix II with all Testudinidae since 1977, which restricts legal international export of specimens, theoretically limiting the type and quantity of specimens permitted for export to levels that are not detrimental to the continued survival of wild populations, although within-country collection and use may remain unregulated. Technically, the volume of domestic use must be taken into account when determining total allowable use, and export can only occur as part of a sustainable overall exploitation level. But this is too rarely implemented, including in the case of <em>K. homeana</em>. At the national and subnational level, it is necessary to include this species among the protected fauna in all the countries of occurrence, including effective enforcement of such protection. At present, it appears that there is virtually no country that can reliably preserve this species. Further legislation should also be developed to protect this species at the international level, for instance a Lacey-act type law for the EU. Illicit and/or unregulated trade among range countries should be investigated to understand the origin and impact of specimens exported for the pet trade.<br/><br/>Current research on the ecology and demography of this species has been ongoing in southern Nigeria for 23 years by Luiselli and associates (Cayuela <em>et al</em>. 2019). Research in western Cameroon has been performed by Dwight Lawson. In Ghana, Agyekumhene and Allman have been conducting population studies at multiple locations since 2010. They have successfully created traditional protection for this species with a community by-law declared by a paramount chief, but this protection is limited in area and is only enforced by a few communities. A population study in Togo was initiated by Segniagbeto, Luiselli, and Petrozzi in 2012. In Cote d'Ivoire, ongoing&#160; translocation and post-release monitoring work of confiscated specimens provided by the Abidjan Zoo has been conducted with the Office Ivoirien des Parcs et Reserves, African Chelonian Institute, and Rare Species Conservatory Foundation (Diagne, unpubl. data), and field studies in the southwestern part of the country have been conducted by Gonedele Bi, Luiselli, Petrozzi, and associates. Great effort must be made to expand research into other countries within the species' range, including focusing on the relationship between humans and tortoises among different communities. Once it is better understood where in the range this species may be less vulnerable to exploitation, protected habitat corridors can create linkages between these communities.&#160;With wild populations of this species declining in a majority of its range, immediate conservation actions are needed to prevent further population declines or eventual collapse. Management should begin by collecting as much information as possible regarding the interactions between local communities and wild tortoise populations. With these data, protected habitats can be linked through communities that traditionally worship tortoises. Cooperative work and active networking, including common data collection and conservation procedures and species action plans, should be promoted with the countries where conservation or research actions have been undertaken. This strategy is certainly possible in some areas; however, since illegal hunting is known to occur even in protected areas, further actions should be taken to better protect against illegal exploitation of the species.<br/><br/>Though this species has a relatively large theoretical range, available suitable habitat within that extent has been reduced over the last 30 years and is expected to continue to decline. In addition, better understanding of the species’ actual distribution is critical; in particular, verifying the basis for its possible occurrence in the eastern Congo Basin needs to be evaluated. Spatial analysis considering landscape factors that reduce&#160;<em>Kinixys</em>&#160;presence should be evaluated to develop more accurate maps of the true potential available habitat and degree of connectivity. Research focused on reproductive behaviour, nesting, incubation, diet at all life stages, habitat selection and seasonal uses are necessary to best manage and protect this genus. Future research should be focused on assessing populations, monitoring habitat loss and how these changes in the environment affect local populations. More ecological studies in the wild are encouraged to gather a better understanding of the species' behaviour in the natural environment. In addition collection of genetic data and better understanding of disease pathology are necessary. Developing reference blood ranges for veterinary and health analysis as well as determining role of stress hormones may be vital in helping protect and conserve these species in the future and should be investigated.<br/><br/>Conservation efforts at the local level are warranted and necessary to engage community members in helping protect and value these tortoises. Engaging local villagers in research opportunities and conservation initiatives such as ecotourism may help minimize the pressures this species is facing. Establishing captive breeding programmes and assurance colonies in range countries may also help promote the conservation value of this declining species. A Species Management Plan should be developed for&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>.<br/><br/><em>Ex situ</em> conservation breeding programs on various&#160;<em>Kinixys</em>&#160;species is ongoing in the USA to establish assurance colonies and to better understand behaviour and husbandry. Captive collections such as these can be beneficial. Assurance colonies have been established since 2013 and a studbook has been developed for this species through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Since 2013 over 150&#160;<em>K. homeana</em>&#160;have been produced and greater understanding of the captive management and husbandry learned (D.

The species is found in 12 sites, with a total area of occupancy less than 2,000 km². Useable habitat changes periodically with monsoon flooding, especially in Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park, and Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary. Populations are severely fragmented, and more than 70% of the population is found in Assam's Kaziranga National Park; a catastrophic event there could have a devastating impact on the species. Habitat loss and degradation due to invasion by alien plants into grasslands, grazing, human encroachment and silting up is occurring in part of the species' range,","The species inhabits the riverine grasslands of the Terai and Brahmaputra Basins (Foose and van Strien 1997). The species prefers these alluvial plain grasslands, but was known to occur in adjacent swamps and forests. The populations are currently restricted to habitats surrounded by human-dominated landscapes, so that the species often occurs in adjacent cultivated areas, pastures, and secondary forests. The diet includes mainly grasses, but also some fruit, leaves, shrub and tree branches, and cultivated crops (Nowak 1999). Greater One-horned Rhinos also regularly utilize mineral licks. Males are solitary, with unstructured, overlapping territories. Females are solitary unless they have a calf. Calves remain with their mother for 3-4 years.<br/><br/>Its life history characteristics are not well known, with longevity estimated at 30-45 years, gestation length of approximately 16 months (as with other rhino species), and age at sexual maturity estimated at 5-7 years for females and 8-10 years for males (Nowak 1999, International Rhino Foundation website 2018).","The Greater One-horned Rhinoceros declined to near extinction in the early 1900s, primarily due to widespread conversion of alluvial plains grasslands to agricultural development, which led to human-rhino conflicts and easier accessibility for hunters. Sport hunting became common in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A reversal of government policies shortly thereafter protected many of the remaining populations. However, poaching, mainly for the use of the horn in Traditional Asian Medicine, has remained a constant threat and the success is precarious without continued support for conservation efforts in India and Nepal. Past poaching led to declines in several important populations, especially those in Chitwan, Manas, Laokhowa, and the Babai Valley area of Bardia, but in the past 5 years, poaching has decreased and the populations in these areas are increasing (except for Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary).<br/><br/>However, not all recent population decreases can be linked to poaching. There have been serious declines in quality of habitat in some areas. This is due to: 1) severe invasion by alien plants into grasslands affecting some populations; 2) demonstrated reductions in the extent of grasslands and wetland habitats due to woodland encroachment and silting up of beels; and 3) grazing by domestic livestock. In Chitwan National Park (the second largest population), poaching alone does not account for the observed level of population decline (R.H. Emslie pers. comm.), and there are trends in a number of reproductive indicators (i.e., decline in the percentage of adult females calving and in the percentage of the population that is calves) that are strongly indicative of negative changes in habitat quality. In Chitwan, there has been severe infestation of some riverine and grassland areas by the climbing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mikania micrantha</span> (which covers over indigenous vegetation), and invasion of <em>Eupatorium</em> in other areas (Murphy, et al., 2013). There is also heavy livestock grazing pressure and disturbance in buffer zone areas as well as some invasion of grasslands by <em>Acacia catechu</em> and <em>Dalbergia sissou</em>.&#160;<br/><br/>In India, there is not yet any evidence that invasion by alien plants has caused any population decreases. However, in Orang National Park, there have been marked habitat changes due to grazing, human encroachment and silting up. In particular, short grass areas have declined by 75% due to silting up and draining of <em>beels, </em>lake-like wetlands with static water&#160;(B.N. Talukdar, pers. comm.). <em>Mimosa</em> is also an alien invader in this area. In the Karnali floodplain area of Bardia there is also some invasion of habitat by the alien <em>Lantana camara</em>. <br/><br/>In Pabitora, there has been an invasion of <em>Ipomoea s</em><em>pp.</em>&#160;""weeds"" and <em>Parthenium spp.</em>&#160;into grassland areas (S. Dutta, pers. comm.). There also has been an invasion of woodland into grassland and siltation and drying up of some water bodies. There also has been some human encroachment and very heavy livestock grazing. With increasing human densities this pressure is unlikely to get any less (S. Dutta pers. comm.). Analysis of satellite imagery has shown that there has a substantial increase in woodland (34.51%) in Pabitora since 1977 accompanied by decline in alluvial grassland (68%)&#160;(Sarma&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). This change of habitat is mostly because of natural succession process, livestock grazing from the nearby villages as well as improper management of the grassland habitat (Sarma <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <br/>The West Bengal populations (Jaldapara and Gorumara) are affected by high levels of grazing from fringe villages, and there have been weed and climber infestations by <em>Mikania cordata</em>, <em>M. scandens</em>, <em>Lantana camara, Christella dentata,</em> and <em>Leea</em> spp. <br/> <br/>The species is inherently at risk because over 70% of its population occurs at a single site, Kaziranga National Park. This area, is subject to poaching and tensions with the surrounding high human population due to human-wildlife conflicts (including conflicts with rhinos). The level of poaching in Kaziranga has generally not been at a level to prevent the ongoing increase in the population, but constant vigilance is required. At least 12 rhinos were lost in the July 2019 monsoon floods, and numerous calves were rescued. Any severe catastrophic event in Kaziranga (such as disease, civil disorder, poaching, habitat loss, etc.) would have a devastating impact on the species.<br/><br/>During surveys carried out in February 2019, Jaldapara and Gorumara reported figures of 231 and 52 rhinos respectively - the highest numbers recorded during the last 100 years. There are suggestions that the two protected areas have reached their carrying capacities and suitable areas need to be found for the West Bengal populations. A male:female:unknown sex ratio of 3.8.1 has been reported in the Gorumara population based on dung DNA analysis (Borkathur, <em>et al</em>. 2016). As a result, fights among bulls are very common and these animals often stray out of the National Park, leading to human-wildlife conflicts (S. S. Bist, pers. comm).<br/><br/>There are suggestions that the small population of rhinos in Jaldapara and Gorumara may be prone to inbreeding depression (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There have been proposals to dam the Bramaphutra River in Arunachal Pradesh, and should this happen in future things could very negatively affect the habitat quality and rhino carrying capacity of major parks like Kaziranga in future (by preventing or reducing the pulse of nutrients brought in by regular large floods). In Jaldapara National Park, the River Torsa no longer overflows as a result of massive flood-control structures. As a result the water table in Jaldapara National Park is receding and the natural water-bodies and wallow-pools used by rhinos are slowly drying up (S.S. Bist, pers. comm).","The total population estimate in August 2018 was estimated to be 3,588 individuals, with estimates of 649 animals in Nepal and 2,939 in India (B. Talukdar pers. comm.). The greater one-horned rhino, with strict protection from Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, has recovered from very low numbers in the early 1900s. Only 12 rhinos remained in Kaziranga National Park in 1905; it is unknown how many animals existed in the combined India-Nepal populations at that time. Although some populations have declined in recent years, overall the species has continued to increase for almost 100 years.<br/><br/><strong>India</strong><br/>The species exists in several protected areas in India: Dudhwa National Park, Manas National Park, Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park, Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary, Jaldapara National Park, and Gorumara National Park. Kaziranga National Park, which was established as a reserve for the last 12 Indian rhinos in Assam in 1905, is home to more than 70% of the global population. A population has been re-established in Manas National Park under the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 program (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2015), where greater one-horned rhinos had extirpated in the late 1990s/early 2000s during a civil conflict. <br/><br/>Poaching rendered the species extinct in Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary by the mid-1990s (Foose and van Strien 1997). Stray animals are occasionally seen in Laokhowa and Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuaries. There also were record from Valmiki Reserve in Bihar, which has habitat contiguity with Chitwan National Park (A.U. Choudhury, pers. comm.). The population in Katerniaghat is best described as transient (S.S. Bist, pers. comm.).<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Nepal</strong><strong><br/></strong>In the late 1960s, an estimated 65 Indian rhinos survived in Nepal, but due to increased conservation efforts, the total population grew to 649 in 2018. During a period of insurgency from 2000-2003, at least 91 animals were poached (Martin 2004) but poaching rates have significantly decreased within the last decade. In Royal Chitwan National Park, the population declined from 544 individuals in 2000 to 372 individuals in 2005 (IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007), but has since rebounded to 592 in 2018. In Royal Bardia National Park (where rhinos were re-introduced) there were approximately 40 individuals in 1997 (Foose and van Strien, 1997) and 37 animals in 2007 (IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007). The population reached a low of 17 animals in the early 2000s, but by 2018 has&#160;grown to roughly 30 individuals, including five animals&#160;translocated&#160;from Royal Chitwan National Park in 2016-2017. In Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (where the species was also re-introduced), the population was only six individuals (Martin 2004, IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group 2007) but by August 2018 had grown to 17, including two rhinos translocated in 2016-2017 from Royal Chitwan National Park. There is a tiny population in Parsa.",Increasing,"Historically, the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros once existed across the entire northern part of the Indian subcontinent, along the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra River basins, from Pakistan to the Indian-Burmese border, including parts of Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan (Foose and van Strien 1997). It may also have existed in Myanmar, southern China, and Indochina, although this is uncertain. The species was common in northwestern India and Pakistan until around 1600, but disappeared from this region shortly after this time (Rookmaker 1984). The species declined sharply in the rest of its range from 1600-1900, until it was on the brink of extinction at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Currently, the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros is found in eight protected areas in India&#160;(Kaziranga, Pabitora, Manas, Orang, Jaldapara, Gorumara, Dudhwa, Katerniaghat)&#160;and in four protected areas in Nepal (Chitwan, Bardia, Suklaphanta, Parsa) (Foose and van Strien 1997, Ellis, <em>et al.</em> 2015, Emslie <em>et al. </em>2016). In India, rhinoceros from Gorumara National Park frequently visit adjoining forests; Nepali rhinos frequently visit adjoining areas in India.",This species is harvested illegally for its horn and other products used in Traditional Asian Medicine and as a status symbol in Vietnam and China. Myanmar has become the transit route for horn coming from India and Nepal.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The species has been included on CITES Appendix I since 1975. The Indian and Nepalese governments have taken major steps towards Greater One-horned Rhinoceros conservation, often with assistance from non-governmental organizations.<br/><br/>Greater One-horned Rhino populations occur almost exclusively within and around Protected Areas. In India, the species occurs in Kaziranga National Park (World Heritage Site), Manas National Park (World Heritage Site), Dudhwa National Park (re-introduced population), Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, Orang National Park, Pabitora Wildlife Sanctuary, Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, and Gorumara National Park. In Nepal, the species occurs in Royal Chitwan National Park, Royal Bardia National Park (re-introduced population), and Royal Suklaphanta Wildife Reserve (a small re-introduced population). Stray rhinos are recorded in Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, Burhachapori Wildlife Sanctuary, and Valmiki Tiger Reserve (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm).<br/><br/>Strict anti-poaching measures are needed to maintain all of these populations. It is also important to reduce human-wildlife conflicts around these areas, and this might involve fencing. Many of the areas also require targeted programmes to control invasive plants, to prevent the spread of woodland, to safeguard wetlands through appropriate water management, and to limit the extent of grazing by domestic livestock. In Pabitora, specific recommendations have been made to increase the quality of feeding habitat of rhino within the sanctuary through meticulous manipulation and checking livestock grazing (Sarma <em>et al</em>., 2009). Water holding mechanisms within the sanctuary during winter are crucial in terms of keeping moist grassland available in winter seasons, thereby reducing the number of rhinos straying out of the sanctuary and thus exposing themselves to poaching (Sarma <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The Indian Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change has embarked on a project to create DNA profiles of all the country's rhinos in collaboration with WWF-India and the Wildlife Institute of India (S.S. Bist pers. comm).<br/><br/>The area of Kaziranga National Park has officially been extended, although animals had access to this area previously as the original park area was not fenced. In West Bengal (Jaldapara and Gorumara), there is a programme of habitat improvement in old teak areas, weed control is being carried out in 50-60 ha annually.<br/><br/>Grasslands in India are being improved through controlled burning and planting of fodder species. Artificial wallow and water conservation structure have been created. Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary had was upgraded to a National Park in 2012. The government of West Bengal has been developing an 21-km<sup>2</sup> site in Coochbehar District to accommodate surplus animals from Jaldapara and Gorumara National Parks, and other sites are being considered (S.S. Bist pers. comm.).<br/><br/>With the support of the IUCN SSC Asian Rhino Specialist Group, Indian Rhino Vision 2020 and a Nepal Rhino Action Plan (Government of Nepal 2006) have been developed. These cover a number of important and specific conservation measures, including translocating rhinos to bolster struggling populations and to start new populations (e.g., Manas National Park); improving security around rhino populations and reducing poaching; assessing habitat status and management needs; expanding available habitat through active management; improving protected area infrastructure; training staff in specific rhino conservation techniques; reducing human-wildlife conflicts; involving local people in rhino conservation; and implementing education and awareness programmes. Overall, there is a need for further reintroductions, thereby reducing the concentration of more than 70% of the individuals in one large population.<br/><br/>To further strengthen rhino protection in Assam, the government amended the Wildlife Protection Act - 1972 in 2009 with increased sentences and fines for poaching rhinos. Further, 12 fast-track courts have been designated in 12 districts of Assam to speed up cases related to wildlife species, specifically rhinos.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

However, evidence from camera trapping and sign surveys indicates that densities are low, particularly in key sites, such as Sapo National Park, Liberia. Large areas of the original forest habitat, especially in Côte d'Ivoire, have been destroyed or degraded by commercial plantations of oil palm and other products, shifting cultivation, mining and logging, and hunting for bushmeat is increasing throughout the range (Mallon <em>et al. </em>2011, FFI and FDA 2013).&#160; Even if the estimate of 2,000-3,000 used previously was doubled to 4,000-6,000, using the lower end of the range (4,000), on a precautionary basis, suggests that the number of mature individuals is still &lt;2,500. A continuing decline of around 20% over two generations (26 years; Pacifici <em>et al. </em>2013) is estimated based on the extent of forest loss across the range in combination with an increase in hunting intensity, hence the species qualifies for listing as Endangered under criterion C1.</p>","The Pygmy Hippo is rarely seen because of its secretive, nocturnal habits and consequently not much is known of its ecology. The most detailed field studies are those by Robinson (1970), Bülow (1988) and Hentschel (1990). A general account of its biology is given by Eltringham (1999) and Robinson (1981b) compiled a detailed bibliography of the species.<br/><br/>The Pygmy Hippo is solitary except when a female is accompanied by young or during the brief association of a breeding pair (Robinson 1970, 1996; Robinson and Suter 1999). They are primarily, but not exclusively, nocturnal. Radio-collaring evidence showed that in Azagny National Park they were active mainly from late afternoon until midnight with peak activity between 16:00h and 23:00h (Bülow 1988). Recent camera trapping in Liberia and Sierra Leone has revealed that they may also be active throughout the night and also during the day. They spend the day hidden in swamps, wallows or hollows under the banks of streams (Robinson 1981a, Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004) or on drier ground within swamps (Bülow 1988). Pygmy Hippos follow well-defined trails or tunnel-like paths through the forest and swamp vegetation, which they mark by spreading dung by vigorously wagging their tail while defecating (Johnston 1906, Robinson 1970, White 1986).<br/><br/>It mainly inhabits lowland primary and secondary forests, close to rivers, streams and <em>Raphia</em> palm tree swamps (Robinson 1970, Bülow 1988, Eltringham 1999), sometimes being found along gallery forests extending into Transitional Woodland and the southern Guinea savanna. The habitat characteristics which appear to be most important are the presence of small streams with submerged trees, root hollows, swampy depressions, and the size and density of ground vegetation (Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Pygmy Hippos feed on terrestrial and semi-aquatic plants. In the wild, they are known to eat ferns, tender roots, grasses, herbs, stems and&#160; leaves of young trees, vegetables and fallen fruit; they have also been observed to&#160; eat sweet potato leaves, okra, pepper plants, cassava and the tender shoots of young rice plants on plantations and farms at the forest edge (Robinson 1970, 1996; Bülow 1988; Hentschel 1990), but are not regarded as crop pests. Robinson (2013) consistently found that a small, recumbent, vine-like forb, widely known as ‘Deewinkon’ (<em>Geophila</em> sp.) is a preferred food throughout Liberia.<br/><br/>Pygmy Hippos have been reported to feed for 5.8-6 hours per day, between mid-afternoon and midnight (Robinson 1981a, Eltringham 1999) but camera trapping has shown they may feed throughout the night. They may defoliate young trees by taking the base of the twig in its mouth, then shaking its head while pulling the twig through the mouth and they have also been observed standing on their hind legs with their front legs against the stem to reach ferns growing within <em>Raphia</em> palms (Bülow 1988). White (1986) recorded Pygmy Hippos taking fish from traps in Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>The stomach has four chambers (Langer 1988). The first three are covered with tough keratinized epithelium, only the last containing glandular epithelial tissue. There is evidence that microbial breakdown of plant material takes place in the first three stomach chambers, no caecum being present in this species. This mode of digestion is usually considered an adaptation to a highly fibrous, generally ""low-quality"" vegetable diet. The droppings are poorly formed and similar to those of the Common Hippo. Heaped dung and tail-splattered excrement are commonly found along trail-side vegetation.<br/><br/>Little is known about Pygmy Hippo ranging patterns, home range size or territoriality. Bülow (1988) radio collared five animals (four females, one male) in Azagny National Park, Côte d’Ivoire, and tracked them for 3-6 months (Bülow 1988). This study found that female home ranges overlapped and estimated that they covered 40-60 ha, while the home range of the male covered 150 ha. Bülow (1988) also found that the male Pygmy Hippo covered a distance of two km per day, whereas the longest recorded distance moved by a female was 900 m. Home ranges seem to depend on the presence of small streams with submerged trees, root hollows, swampy depressions, and size and density of ground vegetation, rather than nutritional factors or proximity of rivers (Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004). During the rainy season (May–September), animals are reported by hunters to disperse over wide areas in the forest zone.<br/><br/>No accurate data on reproduction, including breeding season, have been published for the wild populations. Sexual maturity occurs at about four to five years of age. From studies of captive animals (Lang 1975, Tobler 1991), the oestrous cycle has been shown to average 35.5 days with oestrus itself being 24–48 hours long. The average gestation length is 188 days. A single young is born with a birth-weight of 4.5–6.2 kg. Twins are born very rarely the incidence being approximately one in every 200 births (Hlavacek <em>et al</em>. 2005) The young are born on land and there is no evidence from captive births that a nest is constructed. A survey of over 800 births indicates that these occur throughout the year (Tobler 1991) although Robinson (1970) reports hunters observing newborns more commonly in the early dry season between November and January. Weaning occurs at 6–8 months. Reproductive maturity is reported to be 3–5 years (Lang 1975). Captive adult body size is achieved by three years. Maximum age in captivity is approximately 35–40 years but no while no data exist for wild animals.<br/><br/>In captivity, copulation has been observed on land and in water but, unlike the Common Hippo, birth takes place on land. Young calves do not follow their mothers around but are left ‘parked’ by the mother in secluded pools with the mother returning at intervals to suckle (Galat-Luong 1981). This explains why tracks of young animals are hardly ever found (Hentschel 1990), because young start following their mothers at around 3–5 months of age when they are already quite large.<br/><br/>In general, the range of the Pygmy Hippo does not overlap with that of the Common Hippo but they may once have been sympatric in a few places in Liberia (Schomburgk 1913) and northwest Sierra Leone (Teleki and Baldwin 1980, Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1998). Roth <em>et al</em>. (2004) reported that in Côte d'Ivoire along the Bandama River, almost as far north as the confluence of the Nzi, where they were still found together with the Common Hippo in 1986.<br/><br/>The effects of natural predators on the pygmy hippo are unknown, but the principal carnivores capable of attacking an adult animal of this size are the Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> (Robinson 1970) and Nile Crocodile <em>Crocodylus niloticus</em>. Hentschel (1990) obtained a photograph of a juvenile Pygmy Hippo killed by a Leopard and Roth <em>et al</em>. (2004) saw two animals that had been mauled. Young animals are vulnerable to a wider range of predators, including African Golden Cat <em>Caracal aurata</em>, African Civet <em>Civettictis civetta</em> (Eltringham 1999) and African Rock Python <em>Python sebae</em>.","The range of this species has changed markedly in the past 100 years (Robinson 1970, 1971, 2013), but most acutely in the past 50 years. Deforestation represents the biggest threat to Pygmy Hippos, with forests within their historical range having been steadily logged, farmed, converted to plantations (rubber, coffee and oil palm) and settled (Christie <em>et al</em>. 2007, Norris <em>et al</em>. 2010). An increase in mining and associated infrastructure development in recent years further threatens the remaining forests. What forest that does remain is fragmented, leaving Pygmy Hippo populations isolated, with demographic consequences and the increased susceptibility of small populations to local extinction (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fragmentation has made the forests more accessible for hunters and there is now very little, if any, undisturbed forest in the region safe for wildlife causing the Pygmy Hippo to retreat into the diminishing fragmented parcels of forest (Lewison and Oliver 2008).<br/><br/>We quantified loss of forest in the range of the species using the Hansen <em>et al</em>. (2013) forest cover change maps. We used 300 m resolution maps (resampled from the original 30 m resolution to enable calculations to be computationally tractable). We calculated the approximate area of forest cover within the non-extinct portions of the species range in year 2000 (71,435 km<sup>2</sup>). We then summed the proportional forest loss (negative) and gain (positive) values between 2000-2012, which resulted in an estimate of a 5,010 km<sup>2</sup> reduction in forest cover within the range. Note that this calculation assumes that each loss is a 100% loss and each gain is a 100% gain within a pixel. We then rescaled the net loss to a 26-year period (two generations; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). The result is a conservatively estimated ~15% net loss in forest cover over two generations.<br/><br/>Although Pygmy Hippos are not generally a primary target for subsistence hunting, they are reported to be taken opportunistically by bushmeat hunters. There are also reports from some locations of Pygmy Hippos being by commercial hunters (e.g. Dufour 2002). They are killed predominantly for their meat and, unlike the Common Hippo, their teeth have little trade value, but many of their body parts, including the skull, may be used in rituals or traditional medicine (Robinson 1970, Hentschel 1990).<br/><br/>Whilst Pygmy Hippos are legally protected in all range countries, the level of enforcement is limited due to a lack of capacity in terms of human and financial resources and adequate training.","The total size of the wild population is unknown. The 1993 IUCN Status Survey and Action Plan estimated the population at ""a few thousand at most"" (Eltringham 1993). This estimate was cited as ""2,000-3,000"" in the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment (Lewison and Oliver 2008) who&#160; suggested that even that figure may be too high.<br/><br/>However, some much higher population estimates, originally published in GTZ reports (Hoppe-Dominik 1999) and in university theses (Bülow 1988, Hentschel 1990), have been made for Côte d’Ivoire. These have been assessed and summarised by Roth <em>et al</em>. (2004).<br/><br/>Density estimates were calculated from track and dung counts made along fixed transects during a long-term monitoring programme in Taï National Park. Hentschel (1990) estimated mean densities of 3.6 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> in primary forest, with a maximum of 7.6/km<sup>2</sup> in one locality, and 2.9/km<sup>2</sup> in secondary forest. On the basis of these figures, Roth <em>et al.</em> (2004) concluded that there may have been 10,000 Pygmy Hippos in Taï National Park and 19,000 in Côte d’Ivoire during 1982-1986, but that numbers in Taï had fallen to 5,000 by 1997. Densities in the east of Taï fell to 0.3/km<sup>2</sup> in 1998 and 0.2/km<sup>2</sup> in 2001 and in the west to 0.8/km<sup>2</sup> in 1995 and 1.4/km<sup>2</sup> in 1998; while the latest figures showed densities in the best areas of 1.4-2.5/km<sup>2</sup> (Hoppe-Dominik 1999, Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The present size of the global population is unknown, but it is widely considered to be declining based on the evidence of rate of conversion of forest habitat in the range, reports of poaching and the reduced densities in Taï National Park reported by Roth <em>et al</em>. (2004).",Decreasing,"The nominate subspecies is endemic to the Upper Guinea Forest of West Africa, occurring in four countries, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The second subspecies, <em>C. l. heslopi</em>, formerly occurred some 1,800 km to the east, on the other side of the Dahomey Gap, in Nigeria from the Niger Delta east to the Cross River in Nigeria (Heslop 1945; and see Corbet 1969, Ansell 1972). There have been no reliable reports of this subspecies since 1945, and its continued presence seems unlikely (Robinson 2013).<br/><br/>The historic distribution of the Pygmy Hippo was far more extensive than the distribution today. Populations have disappeared from many sites and become fragmented across the landscape. There are confirmed recent records from localities in each of the four range countries and additional sites that have not been surveyed in recent years may still harbour Pygmy Hippo populations (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). Full details of the current distribution are therefore unknown but a best assessment is provided by Mallon <em>et al</em>. (2011).<br/><br/>Liberia is at the centre of the species’ range and has the most extensive tracts of intact lowland forest in the region (Christie <em>et al</em>. 2007), with occurrence in the other three range countries primarily close to their borders with Liberia: eastern Sierra Leone, south-east Guinea, and south-west Côte d’Ivoire (Eltringham 1993, 1999; Grubb <em>et al</em>. 1998; Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In Sierra Leone, Pygmy Hippo populations are found in the Gola Forest region bordering Liberia, around the Loma Mountains in the north of the country and along the Moa River, including Tiwai Island (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). There are still rumours of Pygmy Hippos in the Outamba-Kilimi National Park in north-west Sierra Leone where it is possible they may survive in sympatry with the Common Hippo but there is no reliable evidence to confirm this.<br/><br/>The Republic of Guinea has a fragmented Pygmy Hippo population occurring in the forest zone of the south-east. There are records since 2000 from the Ziama Biosphere Reserve, Diécké Forest Reserve, Mont Béro Reserve, and also in Tinzou Community Reserve. Pygmy Hippos formerly occurred in Déré Forest in the extreme south on the border with Liberia but a survey carried out by the NGO Sylvatrop in 2009 found no evidence of Pygmy Hippo presence (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). No evidence of Pygmy Hippos has been found in the Guinea part of the Cavally River (Robinson 2013).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire the most important site for Pygmy Hippos is Taï National Park and its adjacent zone of protection including N’Zo Faunal Reserve (Roth <em>et al</em>. 2004). They are also reported to be present in the Goin Débé Classified Forest, Cavally Classified Forest on the border with Liberia and Azagny National Park in the south-centre of the country (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>In Liberia the Pygmy Hippo population is divided between the two large remaining blocks of forest in the southeast and northwest of the country. The population in the southeast is centred on Sapo National Park (Collen <em>et al</em>. 2011) with recent records along the Duobe River to the north of Sapo across to the Grebo National Forest on the border with Côte d'Ivoire, as well as along Kia Creek in Maryland/River Gee counties and within the proposed Grand Kru-River Gee Protected Area (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). Pygmy Hippos are still likely to occur in other forests between the Cestos and Senkwehn rivers, where abundant signs of their presence were found in 1998 (Robinson and Suter 1999). In the northwest, there are recent records along the border with Sierra Leone in the Gola National Forest and in the Wonegizi National Forest on the border with Guinea (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Records of the species from Gambia and Ghana were rejected by Grubb <em>et al</em>. (1998), while another isolated record from Guinea-Bissau (Cristino and Melo 1958) almost certainly refers to the Common Hippo (Robinson 2013).","Although&#160;Pygmy Hippos are not generally a primary target for subsistence hunting, they are reported to be taken opportunistically by bushmeat hunters. There are also reports from some locations of&#160;Pygmy Hippos being&#160;targeted&#160;by commercial hunters (e.g. Dufour 2002). They are killed predominantly for their meat and, unlike the Common Hippo, their teeth have little trade value, but many of their body parts, including the skull, may be used in rituals or traditional medicine (Robinson 1970, Hentschel 1990).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The species is included on Appendix II of CITES (as <em>Hexaprotodon liberiensis</em>). It has full legal protection in all range state countries.<br/><br/>Remaining Pygmy Hippo populations are primarily found inside protected areas (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011). Effective protection and management of protected areas is therefore key to the persistence and conservation of pygmy hippos. The largest protected area containing Pygmy Hippos is Taï National Park and its Zone of Protection in Côte d’Ivoire. Other important sites are Sapo National Park, Grebo National Forest, Gola National Forest and Wonegizi proposed protected area in Liberia, the Gola Rainforest National Park, Tiwai Wildlife Sanctuary and Loma Mountains Forest Reserve in Sierra Leone, and Ziama Biosphere Reserve, Diécké and Mont Béro Reserves in Guinea. Due to the fragmented nature of these remaining populations it will be important to ensure corridors are maintained between sites.<br/><br/>In November 2010 the Pygmy Hippo sub-group of the IUCN SSC Hippo Specialist Group and the Zoological Society of London convened a workshop in Monrovia, Liberia, to develop a Regional Pygmy Hippo Conservation Strategy to guide conservation and research activities related to the Pygmy Hippo. This was attended by representatives from government agencies, local and international NGOs, academic institutions and Pygmy Hippo experts from all the range states and internationally. This strategy, published in 2011, identifies objectives and priority actions needed to address the threats to the pygmy hippos and halt their decline (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In December 2012, the Liberia’s Forestry Development Authority and Fauna &amp; Flora International hosted a national action planning meeting during which an Action Plan for the Conservation of the Pygmy Hippo in Liberia was produced. The action plan adopts the same Vision and Goal as the Regional Pygmy Hippo Conservation Strategy and articulates objectives necessary to attain these in Liberia and necessary actions required to achieve these (FFI and FDA 2013).<br/><br/>There are now conservation and/or research initiatives directly or indirectly targeting Pygmy Hippos in all four range countries. Details of these are found in the Regional Pygmy Hippo Conservation Strategy (Mallon <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/><u>Captive Breeding</u><br/>As of 31 December 2013, the International Studbook for the Pygmy Hippopotamus records 353 living Pygmy Hippopotami kept in 133 institutions (Steck 2014). The age structure is, however, not very healthy. There is a lack of young animals and the sex ratio is skewed (38.53% males and 58.64% females, 2.83% unknown). 30-day mortality in both sexes is high: 33% in both sexes.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
18567364,10103,Hippopotamus amphibius,Vulnerable,A4acd,2017,2016-06-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The 2008&#160;Red List Assessment&#160;described the Common Hippopotamus (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>) populations as Vulnerable, as the population experienced considerable declines in the mid 1990s and early 2000s. The most recent population estimates suggest that, over the 8 years since the last assessment, Common Hippo populations have largely remained stable. The 2008&#160;Red List Assessment&#160;estimated Hippo populations to be approximately 125,000 and 148,000, with half of the 29 countries in which Common Hippos were found reporting declines. Our current assessment yields a lower population estimate, on the order of 115,000-130,000&#160;Hippos. However, we believe that the observed downward shift in total population size likely reflects overestimated population sizes from some countries in the 2008&#160;Red List Assessment&#160;that have now been corrected. Because of this, a change in the Risk Category classification of Common Hippos is not warranted at this time. The conservation status of Hippos remains precarious and the need for direct conservation action to protect Hippos and Hippo habitat across their range is a priority. Although in some countries Hippo populations have stabilized, Hippo population declines are still reported in many countries. The growing and unabated threats of habitat loss and unregulated hunting are major challenges to Hippo population viability and persistence.","As its name suggests, the Common Hippopotamus is an amphibious creature, which spends the day in water and emerges at night to feed. The Hippopotamus uses the water only as a retreat and typically does not eat aquatic vegetation, rather they forage on grass at varying distances from a water source. Hippos rely on a range of water sources – rivers, lakes, and wetlands although seasonally the animal can survive in muddy wallows.&#160; Hippos require some form of permanent water particularly in the dry season as their skin must remain moist and will crack if exposed to the air for long periods. The skin physiology is complex and not fully understood but is clearly adapted for an amphibious existence. Hippos secrete a red liquid from subdermal glands which is thought to function as both a sunscreen and antibiotic (Saikawa&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2004). <br/><br/>Common Hippos are gregarious, social, polygymous animals when resting in water by day, with herd sizes ranging from the tens to a hundred. The social habits of the species have been studied by Klingel (1991), who found that the ""schools"" are groups of females and juveniles. The social system is based on mating territoriality. Females become sexually mature between the ages of 7–9, and males 9–11. Females typically bear a single offspring every other year as lactation can extend for 18 months or longer. In captivity, reproductive activity and sexual maturity occurs in younger individuals. Territorial males monopolize a length of the shoreline of the river or lake but tolerate bachelors within the territory provided they behave submissively. Non-breeding males also settle outside territorial areas, especially seasonal wallows. Fights for the possession of a territory can be fierce and the animals may inflict considerable damage on each other with their huge canines but minor conflicts are usually settled by threat displays, of which the ""yawn"" is the most conspicuous. Territorial males do not normally fight each other and severe fights usually occur only when a bachelor challenges a territorial male for control of its territory. There is little association between animals when they are feeding at night, except between females and their dependent young, and the males do not then behave in a territorial fashion. <br/><br/>The male Common Hippo, rarely the female, spreads its dung by wagging its tail vigorously while defecating, both in the water and on land, where it is thought to have a signalling rather than a territorial function. The dung piles may serve to orient Hippos or may mark territories.<br/><br/>Vocalizations take the form of complex bellows and grunts, which presumably have a signalling function. Sounds may be made either on land or in the water and may be transmitted simultaneously through air and water. This is the only known case of amphibious calls in a mammal.<br/><br/>It is likely that thermoregulation has determined the nocturnal feeding habits of the animal. Hippos typically leave wallow or pool soon after sunset and spend night hours grazing on short grass swards for up to several kilometres from water. The distance animals travel to grazing areas likely varies seasonally and among different areas. Grazing areas, which are kept short by the activities of the Hippopotamus, are often referred to as Hippo lawns. Although Hippos can graze every night, there are usually animals present in the water all night, as some return after a few hours and others leave later. Mothers with very young calves represent the only apparent social structure at grazing areas&#160; as there is no clear organization at the grazing lawn.The animal feeds by plucking the grass with its wide, muscular lips and passing it to the back of the mouth to be ground up by the molars. The front teeth (incisors and canines) play no part in feeding. The amount of food ingested is small relative to the size of the animal but its resting habits by day reduce its energetic demands and food may be retained in the gut longer than most large herbivores. The stomach is a complex four-chambered structure with ruminant-type digestion although Hippos are not true ruminants and do not chew the cud.The ecological requirements for Hippopotamus, therefore, include a supply of permanent or seasonal water, and adequate grazing on open grassland within a few kilometres of the aquatic habitat.","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">The primary threats to Common Hippos are habitat loss or degradation and illegal and unregulated hunting for meat and ivory (found in the canine teeth).</p><p>Habitat loss and conflict with agricultural development and farming are a major problem for hippo conservation in many countries (Brugière <em>et al.</em> 2006, Kanga 2013, Kendall 2013, Brugière and Scholte 2013). Common Hippo’s reliance on fresh water habitats appears to put them at odds with human populations and adds to their vulnerability, given the growing pressure on fresh water resources across Africa (WWC 2004). Habitat loss stems from water diversion related to agricultural development (Cole 1992, Jacobsen and Kleynhaus 1993, Viljoen 1995, Viljoen and Biggs 1998) as well as larger-scale development in and around wetland areas (Jacobsen and Kleynhaus 1993, Harrison<em> et al. </em>2007). In many West and Central African countries, habitat loss has contributed to a growing regional threat of population fragmentation, as isolated and small populations of hippos are confined to protected areas, with poor or even no management and increasing pressure from local communities (Brugière and Scholte 2013).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">&#160;</span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Reports of human mortalities from Common Hippo interactions have also increased in recent years, another indication of habitat loss. In some agricultural areas, hippo population increases in restricted habitat has also fueled conflict (Kanga 2013). Ten countries reported growing numbers of hippo-human conflicts, in several cases exacerbated by drought conditions. Conflicts with fishermen and gold miners have also been reported (Mackie <em>et al.</em> 2013, Mozambique).&#160; In many countries where Common Hippos are found, populations are not confined to protected areas. Although it is likely that the majority of the overall Common Hippo population reside in some form of protected area (national park, biosphere, game or forest reserve, sanctuary, conservation area), the proportion of protected Hippos likely varies among countries. For countries with a high proportion of Hippo populations outside protected areas, the likelihood of persistence is much lower as there is no impediment to hunting or incentive for habitat protection.<br/> <br/> </p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Illegal or unregulated hippo hunting has been found to be particularly high in areas of civil unrest (Kayanja 1989, Shoumatoff 2000, Hillman Smith <em>et al</em>. 2003). At the beginning of 21st century, field surveys found that Common Hippo populations in DR Congo have declined more than 95% as a result of intense hunting pressure, during more than eight years of civil unrest and fighting (Hillman Smith <em>et al</em>. 2003). Similarly, hippo hunting by military forces during civil war in Mozambique during 1980-1992 resulted in decline of more than 70% of the hippo population in the country (Mackie <em>et al</em>. 2013). Widespread poaching for meat has also been reported from Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ivory Coast, and South Sudan (Associated Press 2003, Dibloni 2010, H. Rainey pers. comm.) as well as from politically stable countries like Zambia (Wilbroad and Milanzi 2010). Estimates of the amount of Hippo ivory illegally exported were found to be increasing in the 2008 RLA. A 1994 assessment by TRAFFIC, the monitoring agency of international trade for the IUCN, reported that illegal trade in Hippo ivory increased sharply following the international elephant ivory ban in 1989. Between 1991-1992, approximately 27,000 kg of hippo canine teeth were exported, an increase of 15,000 kg from 1989–1990 estimates (Weiler <em>et al</em>. 1994). In 1997, more than 1,700 Hippo teeth en route from Uganda to Hong Kong were seized by customs officials in France (TRAFFIC 1997). Five thousand kilos of Hippo teeth (from an estimated 2,000 Hippos) of unknown origins were exported from Uganda in 2002 (New Vision 2002). Seizure records of illegal ivory in 2007 and 2008 corroborate that this trend continues as Hippo teeth and products from Hippo teeth have been consistently found with seized ivory and ivory products from elephant tusks. </span></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB""><br/> Although there are several ongoing research projects in captive facilities and with wild populations, little research has focused directly on common hippo conservation. Muwanika <em>et al</em>. (2003) considered the genetic consequences of the intense unregulated hunting that occurred in Uganda in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Based on both nuclear and mitochondrial data, they conclude that although populations were reduced to 70% of initial population size, their current levels of genetic diversity are substantial and not a cause for concern. This suggests that for some populations, once the hunting disturbance is removed, recovery from intense hunting is likely and may not result in detrimental long-term population effects. More recent findings comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA suggests that the remaining hippo population currently faces genetic isolation and urges the need for specific protection and regional restoration programmes (Stoffel <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/> <br/> Lewison (2007) evaluates the relative impacts of the known threats to persistence—habitat loss (from agricultural or larger-scale development) and hunting pressure—on a model population. While accounting for rainfall variability and demographic stochasticity, the model results suggest that combinations of habitat loss and even moderate levels of adult mortality from hunting (1% of adults) can lead to relatively high probabilities of population declines over the next 30–40 years.</p>","Our current assessment suggests that across their range, there are on the order of 115,000-130,000 Common Hippos extant today. There are clear regional differences in population size and distribution across the range. Eastern and Southern African countries represent the conservation stronghold for this species and are the regions where the largest numbers of Common Hippos occur. Although Common Hippos are found in many West African nations, overall population sizes tend to be much smaller, either because of less available habitat or the higher density of human populations. Existing genetic research has suggested putative subpopulation designations among the regions (Okello <em>et al. </em>2005,&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">Stoffel <em>et al. </em>2015) and future research on this is needed.<br/><br/><u><strong>Western Africa</strong></u><br/>The species is less widely distributed and typically occurs at low densities in West Africa. Common Hippos in West Africa are absent from the rain forests except near large rivers. They are most abundant in estuarine habitats and on the lower reaches of rivers. Current data suggests that Hippo populations in this region are at the highest level of risk due to the fragmented nature of their distribution and the high frequency of Hippo-human conflicts. Common Hippo population in this region is estimated to be approximately 7,500 spread over 19 countries. Within the region, Common Hippos are most abundant in Cameroon and Burkino Faso.<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Hippos are still present in Nzo Reserve, Mont Sangbe National Park, Haut Bandama and maybe Marahoue. Scattered small populations still remain in the lower parts of Sassandra, Bandama and Comoe Rivers (Roth <em>et al.</em> 2004). The largest populations in the country are found in Comoe National Park, with a total population over 100. Large numbers of Hippos were reportedly killed during recent civil unrest, up to 2012, with abundant hippo bones still evident. The estimate for Côte d’Ivoire puts the Hippo population at 500.<br/><br/>No formal country-level Hippo census has been conducted recently in Ghana. Hippos are thought to reside in Bui, Digya and Mole National Park, with Bui National Park as the most populated, supporting hundreds of Hippos at one point. Recent hydroelectric development in this area may have comprised this population.&#160; A well-monitored population of Hippos also reside in Wechiau Community Hippo Sanctuary (Sheppard <em>et al.</em> 2010). The current Hippo population in Ghana is likely 150-200 individuals.<br/><br/>Extremely limited population information is available for Hippos in Togo. Keran National Park, Togodo Game Reserve and Nangbeto Lake are reported to have resident Hippo population but recent counts have not been reported. Rough estimates for Togo put the population at 200-500.<br/><br/>In Benin, the largest number of Hippos reside in the Mono River Basin, in small, isolated groups and larger aggregations, and in Pendjari National Park in the north, with an estimated 100 and 350 Hippos respectively&#160; (Amoussou<em> et al.</em> 2006). In Benin, Hippos are also likely to be found in the Oueme, Niger River and Sota Rivers. Annual census counts are conducted in Pendjari National Park and support a country-wide estimate of 500.<br/><br/>Burkina Faso has a number of large protected areas where Hippos reside, including “W” National Park which extends into Niger, and Benin,&#160; Arly and Deux Bales Forest reserves, Bala Biological Reserve (Dibloni <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012). Hippo have also been reported in Soula, Bagre, Tengrela and Sikorola Banzon Lakes, Comoé-Léraba, Sourou, and Bougouriba Rivers. Estimates for Hippos in Burkina Faso suggest 1,500-2,000 Hippos.<br/><br/>Although small in area, Guinea Bissau is thought to support a substantial Common Hippo population, particularly on the islands of the Bijagos Archipelago and along the numerous inland rivers. Local scientist estimate 100 Hippos based on behavioural research in the Orango complex, Bijagos Islands. Corubal River and Rio Cacheu National Park are also reported to have resident Hippo populations.&#160; The estimate of Hippos in Guinea Bissau is roughly between 200-500 individuals.<br/><br/>The species is also found on many of the rivers in Guinea. Haut Niger National Park has been estimated to have the largest Hippo population in Guinea (Brugiere <em>et al.</em> 2006) with around 100 individuals in the wet season. Badiar National Park and Niger River also have resident Hippos. Guinea may have a Hippo population on the order of 500 individuals.<br/><br/>Senegal has been reported to have a similar sized population (approximately 500 individuals) with the majority of Hippos found in Niokolo-Koba National Park, with widespread reports of hippo crop-raiding.<br/><br/>Low density and isolated Hippo populations are also found in the Gambia in Gambia River National Park, likely home to about 40 animals.<br/>In Mali, approximately 100 Hippos are reported to reside in Boucle du Baoule National Park.<br/><br/>Sierra Leone has an estimated 150 Hippo across several protected areas including Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Gola Rainforest National Park and Loma Mountains Forest Reserve. Hippos may also be present in Outamba-Killmi National Park and Kambui Hills South Forest Reserve.<br/><br/>Hippos are reported to reside in one national park in Equatorial Guinea in Monte Alen National Park. There are likely 50-100 Hippos there.<br/><br/>In Gabon, Hippos are reported to reside in Wonga-Wongue National Park, Sette-Cama and Moukalaba Forest Reserves. They have also been recently surveyed in the Gamba Complex (Reitmann 2012), a network of protected areas in south-western Gabon which includes Moukalaba-Doudou National Park and a series of lagoons, lakes and rivers. Based on this information, there are an estimated 250 Hippos in Gabon.<br/><br/>Another important regional stronghold for Common Hippos is Cameroon and recent census information has been collected in many parts of the country (Scholte and Iyah 2016). The larger populations of Hippos have been reported in Benoue, Kalamaloue, and Faro National Parks.&#160; Faro National Park has the largest numbers, with a 2016 census estimating nearly 1,000 individuals. Hippos have also been reported in Lakes Lagdo, Maga, Fianga, and Mbam et Djerem National Parks. The current estimates for Cameroon suggests a country-wide Hippo population of 1,500-2,000.<br/><br/>In Niger, 150-200 Hippos are reported to reside in W National Park , the Tapoa and Mekrou Rivers and along the Niger.<br/><br/>No recent census information is available for Nigeria, although Hippos have been reported in low numbers across a number of locations including Kainji Lake and Okumu National Parks, and Kwiambana, Sambisa and Yankari Game Reserves, and Hippos may still occur in the Niger Delta. An estimate 100 Hippos remain in Nigeria.<br/><br/>The majority of Hippos in Chad are reported to occur in Lake Chad and the Chari River including Mandelia and Manda National Parks. They are rarely found in Bahr Salamat, a river that crosses Zakouma National Park and&#160; Salamat Wildlife Game Reserve, but they inhabit Lake Iro in the latter. Hippos are no longer present in Lake Fitri. Restricted distirbutions of Hippos have been reported&#160; in Binder Leré Faunal Reserve (Brugiere and Scholte 2012). In some areas, Hippos are locally abundant and damage to crops and human casualties are increasing (Malachie Dolmia pers. comm.) . The current estimates for Chad suggests a country-wide Hippo population of 500.<br/><br/>Limited information is available on Hippos in Central African Republic (CAR), but Hippos are reported from a number of national parks and forest reserves at low densities. The best estimates are available for the Chinko protected area which is thought to be home to 200 Hippos. According to local experts, Hippos are still found around villages in eastern CAR where they hide in major rivers like Mbari but enter into rice fields where they are regarded as pest and crop raid. Hippos still&#160; likely reside in low numbers in Andre Felix, Bamimgui-Bangoran&#160; and Manovo-Gounda-Saint Floris National Parks and a number of forest reserves (Yata-Ngaya, Gribingui, Koukourou, Dzanga-Sangha). Country estimates put the population at 200-500 individuals.<br/><br/>No formal counts have been made in the Congo recently, but the species presence was confirmed in&#160; Odzala and Conkouati-Douili National Parks, and the Nyanga Nord, Lefini and Tsoulous&#160; Forest Reserves. Local experts put the Congo Hippo population at 50 individuals.<br/><br/><u><strong>Eastern Africa</strong></u><br/>Historically East Africa has been home to the largest populations of Common Hippos and despite some dramatic declines in particular countries in this region, populations number in the tens of thousands regionally, with an estimated total for Eastern Africa as a whole at about 50,000. Regionally, the largest populations of Common Hippos are found in Tanzania.<br/><br/>In Sudan, Hippos previously have been reported in Dinder National Park, however the current population size or status there is unknown.<br/><br/>In South Sudan, no recent Hippo censuses have been conducted, however, Hippos are reported in several areas. Most Hippo populations in the country are on the White Nile river except those in Southern National Parks (rivers Tonj and Sue) and Boma National Park and some other isolated small populations in North-western South Sudan.&#160; The largest aggregation of Common Hippos in South Sudan is reported to be in Nimule National Park,with an estimated population size of 2,000, but Hippos also occur in Badingilo National Park (including former Mongalla Game Reserve), in Zeraf and Shambe National Parks, Juba Game Reserve and Fanykang Game Reserves (Markéta Antonínová pers. comm). Common Hippos populations are reported to be declining and the regulation of hunting is limited due to military actions in this country. A rough estimate for South Sudan puts current Hippo populations at approximately 2,500.<br/><br/>Recent estimates from Ethiopia suggest that Hippos occur from the Djibouti border through the highlands&#160; to the south and south west, with the main threat reported to be habitat loss, degradation, and unregulated hunting. Earlier Hippo census efforts&#160; found the main strongholds to be the Omo, Awash and Great Abbi (Blue Nile), Gibe Rivers. Hippos are also found in many of the larger lakes (Lake Abaya, Lake Hawassa, Lake Langano, Lake Ziway, Lake Chamo) and isolated populations in smaller swamps and pools. The northern limit of the species is the Setit River. One of largest hippo populations are found in Dhati-Welel National Park, a newly gazetted area in May 2012. Very few animals remain in neighbouring Somalia (<em>ca</em>. 50) although some small groups have been reported on the lower Shebeli River and along the Juba River. No common hippos have been reported from Djibouti. Current estimates for Ethiopia are 2,500.<br/><br/>Although hippos were found in Eritrea in the mid 1960s and 70s, it is likely they are no longer present in the country.<br/><br/>The species occurs in a number of reserves and parks throughout Kenya. The most recent census information is available for the Masai Mara National Reserve (4,200, Kanga <em>et al.</em> 2011). Other locations where Hippos have been reported, but not recently confirmed, in Kenya include Amboseli , Lake Nakuru, Meru, Nairobi, and Tsavo National Parks and several National Reserves&#160; - Buffalo Springs, Kora, Lake Bogoria, Mwea, North Kitui and Samburu. Hippos are also found in Lake Victoria. Although recent censuses are not available, best estimates for Kenya put the Hippo population at 6,500 for the country.<br/><br/>In Tanzania, the most recent census information are from 2001 (TAWIRI 2001). In September 2001 (dry season), a total of approximately 20,000 Hippos were counted with the largest concentrations of Hippos observed in Kilombero, Rufiji and Great Ruaha Rivers. Although this direct census likely presented an underestimate because of uncounted or undetected animals, we use this value because the census effort is not current. The census effort found that a large proportion of Hippos (80%) counted were found inside protected areas, highlighting the importance of the the protected area networks to Hippos in Tanzania. Most Hippos were found in southern Tanzania and especially in the Selous Game Reserve and its immediate vicinity. Other important localities for Hippos were the Katavi-Rukwa protected area complex. The Ugalla and Malagarassi Rivers and the Serengeti and Mara Rivers.<br/>Lack of Hippo population information in Uganda is surprising given the historical prevalence of Hippo populations and Hippo research in this country. The principal concentrations of the species in Uganda in the past were in two large national parks, Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth. At one time the population in Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) reached 21,000, but this was reduced to about 14,000 in a culling programme of the 1950s. Counts in the early 1970s returned about 11,000 but heavy poaching during the Amin years had left only a couple of thousand by 1989 when 2,172 were estimated from an aerial sample count. Since then, Hippo populations&#160; have recovered. Current estimate for QENP are from 5,000 to 6,000 Hippos (Andrew Plumpter pers. comm). In addition, Hippos inhabit several other national parks and wildlife reserves as Kibale National Park, Katonga and Kabwoya, East Madi Wildlife Reserves, and Lake Mburo National Park as well as Semliki River and Lakes Victoria and Kyoga. Most Hippo populations in Uganda are reported as stable or slightly increasing. The overall estimate for the country is 10,000 individuals.<br/><br/>Common Hippos have a wide distribution in DR Congo including some in the north-west of the country although the bulk is in the east, where they occur around Epulu and Wamba and along some of the larger rivers in the Ituri Forest. Other populations occur on the Zaire River (Yangabi), Bomu River, Rusizi River and elsewhere in several national parks including Garamba, Kundelungu, Salonga, Upemba and Virunga as well as Luama Hunting Reserve. At one point in the mid 1980s, there was an estimated 26,000 Hippos across the country. However, these numbers declined dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s as a function of widespread civil unrest and associated rampant unregulated hunting. The most dramatic declines were observed in the Virunga National Park. Since 2002, Hippo population have increased slightly in most protected areas as reported for Garamba National Park where 2,600 Hippos in main rivers – Aka, Dungu, Garamba - and the neighbouring hunting areas were counted (Schapira and Antonínová 2011). Estimates from a 2014 UNESCO mission in Virunga area reported 1,500 hippos with current estimates&#160; at 2,000 individuals (Deo Kujirakwinja pers. comm). This suggests current country-wide estimates for DR Congo are likely approximately 5,000.<br/><br/>Census information is available for Rwanda as an aerial survey in Rwanda, conducted in 2013, found some 800-1,000 Hippos in Akagera National Park (MacPherson 2013), which has historically been an area where hippos have been abundant. Their distribution is widespread along the wetland fringes with focal points in Lakes Rwanyakizinga and Hago.<br/><br/>Common Hippos in Burundi have been reported on the Malagarazi, Ruvubu and Rusizi Rivers but there are conflicting reports over numbers. The largest populations appear to be in Rusizi Reserve, with an estimated population of 500 Hippos. Both earlier and current reports suggest that unregulated hunting is widespread. The estimated Hippo populations in Rwanda is 1,000 Hippos and 750 in Burundi.<br/>&#160;<br/><u><strong>Southern Africa</strong></u><br/>Southern Africa is also home to large populations of Common Hippos. This region has also experienced Hippo population declines related to civil unrest and war. The coarse estimate for the region is 60,000. Regionally, the largest populations of Common Hippos are found in Zambia.<br/><br/>Zambia has historically been a stronghold for Common Hippo populations and recent country-wide estimates suggests Zambia continues to serve as a stronghold for the species. The population is widely distributed, with the key Hippo areas in order of importance based on population size as Luangwa River (25,000), Zambezi River (6,500), Kafue River (4,000) and the Lufupa River tributary of Kafue River (1,600). The Luangwa, Zambezi and Kafue Rivers hold 87 % of the Hippo population in Zambia. As with Hippo populations in other countries, the Hippo populations in Zambia fluctuates in response&#160; to changing rainfall conditions and available forage (Chomba 2013). The densities of Hippos range across these areas with densities highest in the Luangwa River reaching as high as 42 Hippos/per km of river stretch in some areas. Generally the national population is stable, although there is concern of Hippo viability particularly outside protected areas where human settlements and fishing activities have increased leading to increased human-Hippo conflicts from crop raiding or Hippo attacks.<br/><br/>Malawi also has areas densely populated with Hippos with most populations confined to national parks and other protected area. The largest and potentially increasing population of more than 2,000 individuals inhabits Liwonde National Park. More than 300 Hippos were reported in Vwaza Marshes National Park, with smaller populations in Majete and Kasungu National Parks of no more than 100 individuals. All these popualtions are stable or increasing. Hippos disapeared from Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve, although the suitable habitat remains there (Samuel Kamoto, Craig Raid, Craig Hay, Patricio Ndadzela pers. comm.). Dozens of individuals persist in Lake Malawi and the shire rivers (Johnathan Vaughan pers. comm.), areas where Hippos had been previously abundant. Whereas the conservation&#160; in protected areas is good, in other areas, hippos are illegally hunted for bushmeat and teeth. The total population estimate for Malawi is 3,000.<br/><br/>In Zimbabwe, Common Hippos are found in areas that border the Zambesi river in the north and the Limpopo river in the south. Hippos are also found on privately owned game farms, conservancies, recreational lands and other unprotected areas throughout the country.&#160; As a result of intensive agricultural development, Zimbabwe has more than 50,000 small to medium-sized dams which could provide habitat for hippos. The most recent population information on Common Hippos in Zimbabwe is from 2007-2010 (Zisadra <em>et al.</em> 2010) and suggests that Zimbabwe’s Hippo population is stable at approximately 5,000 individuals.<br/><br/>In 1986, Mozambique was thought to have an estimated population of approximately 20,000 Common Hippos. However more recent surveys have found this estimated population to be a gross overestimation (Mackie <em>et al</em>. 2013). Populations of Common Hippos were surveyed in 2010 during a national crocodile survey (and corrected to account for under-counting). Unregulated hunting and poaching of Hippo has drastically reduced Common Hippo numbers and the trend continues (Anderson and Pariela 2005). In 2013, the CITES Standing Committee suspended all Hippo trade or export from Mozambique due to the lack of information on the abundance, distribution and hunting permits of Hippos in the country. There are now estimated to be approximately 3,000 Hippos in Mozambique with the majority of the Hippos found in Lake Cabora Bassa and the Zambesi river. Other areas with sizeable Hippo populations included the Niassa National Reserve, Maputo River and Reserve, and Save, Pungwe and Ruvuma Rivers.<br/><br/>In the 1960s, Hippos were reported as widespread in Angola. There is limited information on current distribution and population sizes. Hippos have been reported to occur in Cunene, Cubango, Cuando, Cuanza, Cuvo, Longa and Zambesi rivers, in Bicuar, Cameia, Mupa, and Quiçama National Parks and in Luando Game Reserve. The population numbers in Quiçama NP and Luando GR are estimated as less than 30 and 100 individuals, respectively. The main threat to Hippos in Angola is poaching and human develepoment along the rivers (Pedro Vaz Pinto pers. comm.).&#160; Although no census information is available, based on this information, an estimated 500 Hippos likely remain in Angola.<br/><br/>Hippo abundance and distribution in Namibia is based on recent censuses by the Wildlife Research and Monitoring, Ministry of Environment &amp; Tourism, and puts the population at approximately 3,300. Namibia supports Common Hippos largely&#160; in two areas: Okavango, including Bwabwata National Park, and Kwando, where the majority of Hippos are found, including Bwabwata National Park, Mudumu National Park and Nkasa Rupara National Park.&#160; Some Common Hippos can also be found in the Linyanti, Chobe and Zambesi Rivers.<br/><br/>Hippos in Botswana are centred in the Okavango Delta and also in the Chobe, Linyati River systems. Outside this area, a small population may still exist near Ghanzi although some observers think this is unlikely. The most recent estimated total for northern Botswana where Hippos reside is 1,600 in the wet season and 500 in the dry.<br/><br/>South Africa has country-wide information on Common Hippos&#160; as a national assessment for the species has recently been completed (National Red List Assessment in review). There are two major subpopulations in South Africa, occurring in the lowveld of north-eastern South Africa and that of northern Kwa-Zulu Natal. Most other populations across the country are fragmented by fences or other barriers that limit movement. Water quality and quantity has declined, which has possibly led to fragmentation too. Kruger National Park is believed to be home&#160; to 3,000 individuals, which represents an increase for the park. The current Hippo population in Mpumalanga is estimated at 1,000 animals, where 575 animals occur in provincial and private nature reserves, with an estimated 430 Hippos in the neighbouring river systems. Most of the hippo subpopulation in the protected areas and rivers close to the KNP show strong positive growth trends, in spite of significant Hippo removals through damage-causing animal complaints and pro-active Hippo capture operations In Limpopo, there is an estimated 700 animals, with another 700 residing in the Olifants and Letaba Rivers. Hippo in KwaZulu-Natal are mainly confined to the large rivers, coastal lakes and estuaries of north eastern Zululand and Maputaland regions of the province.&#160; Recent population estimates for the province of KZN suggests approximately 2,000 animals in 10 formally protected areas and on 22 private and communal protected areas. Currently the largest single populations are found in the St Lucia Game Reserve component of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park (1,000 individuals) and Ndumo Game Reserve (200 individuals). In the North-West Province, there are approximately 100 individuals on formally protected areas and on private lands. In Swaziland, the population is currently estimated at about 120 animals. These estimates suggest that there are 7,000 Common Hippos in South Africa.",Stable,"Common Hippopotamus (referred to as Common Hippos or Hippos hereafter) are found in many countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa in suitable wetland habitats. The species still occupies much of its former range from 1959, although population sizes have declined. Common Hippos occur in rivers throughout the savanna zone of Africa, and main rivers of forest zone in Central Africa, in Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Swaziland, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>Common Hippos were already rare in Egypt by the time of the Renaissance. From the end of the Roman Empire up until towards 1700 at the latest, the Hippo was still present in two well disjunct zones in the Nile Delta and in the upper Nile. Through the 1700s, records become increasingly scarce, and the latest definite records are from the early 1800s (Manlius 2000).","This species is used as food by humans and for making jewellery, handicraft etc.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.<br/>There are numerous protected areas across the countries where Common Hippos are found.

It was collected from four sites but is only known from eight specimens. It is tagged as 'Possibly Extinct' because it has not been seen since 1932 despite extensive surveys across its historical range. Further surveys are needed to determine if this species should be listed as Extinct, particularly on smaller offshore islands. If it is relocated, the establishment and management of new protected areas should be a high priority along with other conservation measures to ensure the continued survival of this species.","This species is reported on branches high in trees in <em>Bursera</em> and <em>Ficus</em> forest, most commonly when they were feeding on the ripe fig fruits (Dodd and Campbell 1982). These reports are consistent with the species being an ecological analogue of Puerto Rican <em>Anolis cuvieri</em>, i.e. a ""crown-giant"" ecomorph, but occurring in a dryer area with a more xeric-adapted vegetation (Mayer 1989).","The reasons for the species' decline and possible extinction are unknown. Deforestation, suggested as a reason by Campbell and Dodd (1982), has occurred on all four islands, and no primary forests remain (Ojeda Kessler 2010). Livestock grazing was widespread on Culebra before the island was turned into a military zone; after the departure of the military, housing and tourism development took over, often infringing on potential habitat for the species (Ojeda Kessler 2010). However, on some of the islands the amount of land under cultivation peaked prior to the second half of the 19th Century (Mayer 1989).<br/><br/>Predation on eggs and adults by introduced species (rats and mongoose) may also have been a factor in the species' decline.","No specimens have been collected since 1932. Although there is a report of this species from as recently as 1978 (Dodd and Campbell 1982), the observations have been questioned (Ojeda Kessler 2010). Several searches on Culebra have been unsuccessful, and some verbal reports of giant anoles have turned out to refer to green iguanas (Dodd and Campbell 1982, Campbell and Dodd 1982, USFWS 1986, Ojeda Kessler 2010, R. Thomas and K. de Queiroz pers. comm.). Unsuccessful searches have also been made on Vieques (R. Crombie, J.B. Losos, L. Mahler, K. de Queiroz pers. comm.), St. John (L. Mahler pers. comm.)&#160;and Tortola (G.C. Mayer, J.D. Lazell, K. de Queiroz pers. comm.). Some (e.g., Williams 1983) consider the species probably extinct, although further investigation is warranted on some smaller islands (Ojeda Kessler 2010).",Unknown,"This species is endemic to the smaller islands of the eastern portion of the Puerto Rican Bank, and is known historically from Vieques and Culebra (part of Puerto Rico), St. John (part of the US Virgin Islands), and Tortola (part of the British Virgin Islands) (Mayer 1989). Eight specimens are known to have been collected, six of them around the early 1860s, one in 1931, and the last in 1932. Both of the 1930s specimens came from Culebra (Mayer 1989).

There was a sharp decline between 1950 and 1970. Then the population was stable until 1999, however, drought (in 1999) resulted in the riverine habitat disappearing and the population declined almost to extinction. The last remaining individuals were taken from the remnants of the river and bred in captivity. In 2006 the fish was reintroduced to 12 rehabilitated natural sites and artificial ponds within its previous natural range. During the period 2007 to 2013, most of these stocked habitats, monitored by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, revealed large populations of assorted sizes and ages. Many of the juveniles found in 2012/2013 are thus fifth-generation offspring. The species still requires some continued conservation management, such as maintaining sufficient hard substrate for spawning and shelter for the juveniles, however these measures are not thought to be a ‘direct intervention’ and it is expected that the species would still be viable without this management (therefore the species is deemed to be 'wild' and can be assessed against a threatened category).<br/><br/>The area of occupancy (AOO) for this species is still highly restricted (9-13 km²) and it is found in seven locations (12 sites in seven separate basins). It is potentially threatened by pollution or damage due to long term wars; if these threats were to occur then the species would quickly become Critically Endangered it species would quickly become extirpated from many of the sites. Drought caused by water abstraction (the reason for its near extirpation in 1999) is no longer deemed a major threat as Israel now relies heavily on desalination plants for its freshwater (this capacity is growing). The species was previously (2006) assessed as Extinct in the Wild, but due to conservation actions and reintroductions the species has undergone successful breeding in the wild since 2007; it has therefore undergone a genuine improvement in conservation status.</p>","This is a coastal river species, now only existing in 10-12&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">rehabilitated natural habitats (including ponds), most of them artificial and semi natural.",Drought caused by extraction of ground water and changing climate (reduced rainfall) was the primary threat to the species (the reason it became extirpated from its natural habitat).

Within five years, the captive population was 14,000.<br/><br/>Around 5,000 adult fish were re-introduced into to the Yarqon River in the winter of 2002/2003. However, surveys carried out in 2004 could not find a single juvenile. This led to the species being assessed as Extinct in the Wild in 2006. Following further research into the fish's life cycle, a semi-natural habitat was created (400 m² small pond fed by the Yarqon River), where reintroduced laboratory born fish successfully produced thousands of juveniles. Following this model,&#160;in 2006, 9,000 fish were re-introduced into 12 rehabilitated natural sites and artificial ponds.

Its habitat has declined and is projected to  continue declining due to continuing threats from the loss of older  trees upon which the species depends and habitat loss and degradation  resulting from war in the region. Further, the two populations, one in  Crete and one in Libya, are likely to be highly isolated as this bat has  a small home range radius of <em>ca </em>3-4 km.","In Libya, the species appears to be restricted to Mediterranean coastal  habitats and has been recorded in Mediterranean forest, shrubland,  mosaics of shrubland and agricultural land (including pastures and  fields) (Aulagnier and Benda 2013, Aulagnier and Palmeirim 2008). It is  found in valleys or ravines with flowing water in the wet season and  also highlands (Aulagnier and Benda 2013). In Libya, females were  recorded as heavily pregnant in late May, suggesting reproductive  synchrony (Aulagnier and Benda 2013).<br/><br/>On Crete <em>Pipistrellus hanaki</em> uses a  range of roost types, including rock crevices, trees and buildings. In  shrublands, they are only found roosting in rock crevices or buildings.  The biggest known colony (<em>ca</em> 15 individuals) was located in a house  roof, under the tiles. Radiotracking showed that Quercus forest stands  and old tree cultivations are largely preferred for foraging, while open  areas, young Cypress stands and Mediterranean maquis are avoided.  Although it has been found roosting inside villages, they are used as  foraging grounds only if they maintain a high number of old trees. On  Crete, lactating females were trapped in late June and flying young were  recorded in early July, placing births in June.","Approximately half of this bat's global distribution is in a war zone.  How this may affect this species is unknown. On Crete, it roosts in  buildings and other man-made structures are threatened by demolition,  renovation works etc. Roosts in trees are threatened by logging for  firewood, expansion of cultivations and replacement of old olive trees,  residential and commercial development and fire. Foraging sites are  degrading due to similar reasons plus overgrazing. The proposed future  mass expansion of Wind farms all over Crete is expected to affect the  species population.","Although the data are very limited, the global population is suspected to  be declining due to habitat loss.

Further, introduced species directly and indirectly impact  roosts and foraging areas.<br/><u><br/></u>The <em style="""">E. s. semicaudata </em>subspecies has  suffered dramatic losses throughout its range. The subspecies appears to  have suffered local extinctions in Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, and  Vanuatu. Fiji appears to be its last bastion and even there, most of the  large historic colonies have been lost and the subspecies is feared to  have been extirpated from many islands where it was previously found.  The current status of the species is not well understood as there have  been no recent assessments.&#160;Similar to <em style="""">E. s. semicaudata</em>, the <em style="""">E. s.  rotensis</em> subspecies has experienced dramatic losses throughout its  distribution on Guam and throughout the Marianna Islands, and it is  currently only known from Aguiguan Island. The status of <em style="""">E. s.  palauensis</em> and <em style="""">E. s. sulcata</em> is uncertain as there have been no recent  assessments. There is little reason to believe these two subspecies are  faring better than their counterparts.","<em><em>Emballonura </em>semicaudata</em> is a small (five gram) cave-obligate bat that roosts in a  range of cave types, including limestone caves, lava tubes,  shelter-caves on overhanging cliffs, and rock crevices (Flannery 1995;  Watling and Pernetta 1978; Grant <em>et al.</em> 1994; Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001; Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2007; Wiles <em>et al.</em>  2011). Relatively large colonies appear common in the Palau subspecies  while smaller colonies may be more representative of the other  subspecies (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wiles and Worthington 2002). Basic  information on roost microclimate and habitat preferences are lacking  for all subspecies (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001). It is important to note  that subspecies that have undergone dramatic declines may be persisting  in caves in sub-optimal conditions, after exclusion from their  historical roosts. Pacific sheath-tailed bats are commonly found sharing  caves with swiftlets (<em>Aerodramus </em>spp.) across their range (Watling and Pernetta 1978, Lemke 1986, Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001, Tarburton 2002, Wiles and Worthington 2002, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>Although  the species has occasionally been recorded flying in daylight under  forest canopy it normally emerges at dusk to forage. While details of  its diet are limited (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001), <em>E. s. rotensis</em> have been documented to primarily forage on Hymenopterans and Lepidopterans (Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>The  four subspecies are thought to prefer to forage in well-structured  mature forest (native and non-native) with a high and dense canopy and  relatively near to their roosting caves (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Gorreson <em>et al.</em> 2009, Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011, Welch <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Palau and Chuuk, the subspecies has occasionally been  observed foraging over town streets (Bruner and Pratt 1979). Recent work  has documented lower bat activity over introduced lantana shrub  habitats (Welch <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Despite the long-term global population decline of <em>E. semicaudata </em> throughout much of its range, especially the <em>E. s. rotensis</em> and <em>E. s.  semicaudata</em> subspecies, there is no definitive explanation for the of  precipitous declines. Losses have been reported as far back as 1945. All  the subspecies are at high risk of extinction because they occur in  isolated oceanic island systems and are subject to stochastic events,  including the threat from more frequent and stronger major cyclones that  may defoliate forests, reduce the abundance of insect prey or even  cause the direct loss of roosts when storms flood caves or landslides  close cave entrances, exacerbating other threats (Grant <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994).<br/>Significant  threats include the disturbance of roosting sites from local uses,  vandalism and ecotourism, the loss and degradation of native forests  from timber harvesting and conversion to agricultural lands, mining and  quarrying adjacent to cave roosts and guano mining within roosts,  invasive species (plants and animals (e.g., goats), fire in proximity to  roosts (Grant <em>et al.</em> 1994; Wiles <em>et al</em>. 1997; Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2007; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011; Scanlon <em>et al.</em> 2014; Welch <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Further, loss of genetic variation has been recorded for <em>E. s. rotensis </em>(Oyler-McCance <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2013). Recent genetic analysis also supports the separation and  elevation of at least three of the subspecies to full species status.  Specifically, Oyler-McCance <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2013) report that  their “data fully support the separation of these 3 subspecies for  conservation and management purposes”, the fourth subspecies was not  included in their analysis and needs genetic appraisal as well. Although  genetic differentiation exists, the species are yet to be described.  Meanwhile, the subspecies status limits their elevation in conservation  status to Critically Endangered (primarily because the four subspecies  together occur across a vast area), which also impacts the opportunities  for host countries to promote their conservation (Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Loss of genetic diversity is a key threat to all subspecies given their increasing isolation and low population levels.<br/><br/>Grant <em><em>et al.</em></em>  (1994) concluded that pesticide contamination was unlikely to be  implicated in the significant decline of <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> in America  Samoa because co-roosting swiftlets did not experience similar losses.  However, it is important to note that bats and swiftlets have different  ecological niches and therefore may be differentially exposed to and/or  susceptible to pesticides. In the Mariana Islands for example, <em>E. s.  rotensis</em> primarily consumed nocturnal Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and  Hymenoptera, while the swiftlet (Aerodramus bartschi) preferred  Hymenopteran prey (Valdez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Even within  Hymenoptera, bats primarily fed on Ichneumoideans whereas swiftlets ate  more formicidalates and chalicidoideans (Valdez <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2011). It is unclear if or how pesticides have impacted the Pacific  sheath-tailed bat through bioaccumulation and biomagnification for  example. It is premature to dismiss pesticide contamination as a threat  to <em>E. semicaudata</em> until explicit research has been completed in this  area.","<em>Emballonura semicaudata </em>likely represented a large metapopulation where  each species was previously relatively common over much of their  respective ranges and there was some level of genetic connectedness due  to infrequent movements and successful breeding. Unfortunately, due to  the dramatic declines of the <em>E. s. rotensis </em>and <em>E. s. semicaudata </em> subspecies, the metapopulation structure appears to have broken down as  subpopulations have been and are continuing to be extirpated. While  there still may be subspecies-level metapopulations for <em>E. s. sulcata </em> and <em>E. s. palauensis</em>, that of <em>E. s. rotensis</em> appears to be lost as only  one subpopulation remains and the <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> subpopulation is  greatly reduced due to likely extirpation from several countries.<br/><br/><em><em>Emballonura </em>s. rotensis</em> was last observed on Guam in 1972 and was thought to have  been extirpated from the Northern Mariana Islands after 1932 until the  discovery of a small population on Aguiguan Island (approximately 7 km²  in size) in 1984 (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). In 2008, there were an estimated 359-466 bats in total using 3 caves; over 70% of the bats used a single cave (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). As late as 2013, the subspecies was still known from the three caves (Welch <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). A recent, but limited survey effort at those three caves  confirmed the continued use of two of the caves, one with an estimated  308-382 bats (Liske-Clark <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>The decline of  <em>E. s. semicaudata</em>, while not as extensive as that documented for<em> E. s.  rotensis</em>, is just as alarming as the subspecies appears to have been  extirpated from Tonga, Samoa, America Samoa, and Vanuatu (Helgen and  Flannery 2002, Uyehara and Wiles 2009, Tarburton 2011, M. Pennay pers.  comm. in Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Fiji is the last stronghold  for <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> and its populations are estimated to have  declined by &gt;80% (Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014); the subspecies  is feared to have been extirpated from Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and the  Yasawa archipelago (Flannery 1995; Palmierim <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, 2007; Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2014). A new roost found on Taveuni in 2018 with a reported 2,000 bats  appeared to have only a couple of hundred bats in 2019, perhaps due to  the conversion of forest habitat to agriculture lands  (NatureFiji-MareqetiViti, unpublished data). The loss of historic  colonies continues and in 2018, the subspecies was not detected on  Rotuma and experts have proposed it has been extirpated from the island  (Cibois <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press).<br/><br/>The<em> E. s. sulcata</em> and <em>E. s. palauensis</em> subspecies were thought to be relatively stable in the 1990s (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Hutson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001) and were reported to be doing relatively well within portions of their range as late as 2005 (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em>  1997, G. Wiles pers. comm. 2019). Unfortunately, their current status  are unknown as there have been no recent surveys. Given the dramatic  decline of the <em>E. s. rotensis</em> and <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> subspecies  throughout their range, a precautionary view should be taken on their  status until reliable data are obtained.",Decreasing,"<em>Emballonura semicaudata</em> is the only species of Emballonura found in the  Pacific outside of the Solomon Island chain (Koopman 1993, 1997; Helgen  and Flannery 2002).

22145942,3786,Capra aegagrus,Near Threatened,A2cd,2020,2020-03-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Wild Goat is listed as a precautionary Near Threatened because of past population decline, which had been estimated to be close to 30% over the last three generations (21 years), inferred from over-exploitation, shrinkage in distribution, and habitat destruction and degradation. Recent information suggests that the population in range states with the major numbers is stable or even increasing, but over large areas reliable information is lacking. Since the end of the 1990s, the population across most of the range looks at least stable and in many  areas it has been increasing. It is likely that the Vulnerable threshold for criterion A2 has not been met for at least five years; if the positive population trend continues, it may warrant this species being moved into Least Concern, however, applying the precautionary principle, for now we assess the species as Near Threatened.</p>","<p>The wild goat inhabits mountainous areas, where there is a mixture of rocky outcrops (including scree slopes) and vegetation (shrubby thickets (maquis) or conifer forests). It is a mixed forest species in the Caucasus, especially in the Greater Caucasus (Magomedov et al. 2014; Weinberg 1999), though it usually inhabits relatively arid habitats in most of its range and may depend upon water sources there (Korshunov 1994, Morovati <em>et al</em>. 2014, Shams <em>et al</em>. 2010). Choice of topography, steepness and exposure of the slopes depend upon season, threats and peculiarities of climate and vegetation, but all sources underline principal importance of ruggedness and steepness of slopes at all elevations (Korshunov 1986; Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014; Shams <em>et al</em>. 2010; Weinberg 1999). However, in the Greater Caucasus, males tend to choose higher elevations than females outside the rut (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014; Weinberg 1999). South slopes are avoided only in summer and preferred in winter and spring, even in Iran (Shams <em>et al</em>. 2010). In general, distinctive seasonal migrations are not typical for the animals in the Caucasus, except maybe males who can dwell rather far away from females outside the rut in the Caucasus Minor (Magomedov <em>et al. </em>2014; Weinberg 1999; Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011, 2017). <br/><br/>It is herbivorous, feeding on grasses, herbaceous plants and shrubs, and can climb not very tall trees like junipers and oaks and certainly surpass tur in this respect (Weinberg 1984, 1999). Diet varies geographically and seasonally, being greatly affected by precipitation and availability of green vegetation. In Turkmenistan, grasses and herbs dominate in the spring diet, but later significance of maple <em>Acer turcomanicum</em> increases and in winter juniper may dominate (Korshunov 1994).<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, females reach maturity at the age of one year (more precisely 1.5 year) but most females mate only at the age of 2 years (Korshunov 1994), while in Daghestan most of yearling females mate (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014). Yearling males may court females during the rut and at two-year age almost invariably leave female groups (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011). Rut lasts from early November to mid-December in Turkmenistan (Korshunov 1994), from mid-November to the second decade of December in Daghestan in the Greater Caucasus and is some two weeks late compared to that of sympatric tur (Magomedov <em>et al. </em>2014, Weinberg 1999). First newborns have been observed in the beginning of June there (Magomedov et al. 2014). However, due to huge species range, reproductive periods vary in different areas. Thus in Karchat Mountains in southern Pakistan, rut may take place, in different years, from August until mid-October, and newborns appear from mid-January to April.&#160; Such variations in timing may depend upon precipitation influencing nutritional condition of the animals, primarily females (Edge and Olson-Edge 1990; Schaller 1977). Fecundity is high, twinning being frequent and triplets have been observed all over the range (Gunoglu and Ogurlu 2009, Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts 1977, Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011). Post-parturition period kid/female index varies from 0.46 in Pakistan (Edge and Olson-Edge 1990) to 0.5 in Turkmenistan (Korshunov 1994), to 1.0 in Armenia (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011) and to 1.26 in one year in Daghestan (Magomedov <em>et al. </em>2014). Yearlings make 9.8% to17.1% during the rut in different areas in Armenia (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011), and 16-18% in Daghestan (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014), but probably the lower figure is more typical to the rest of the species range.<br/><br/>Wild goat is a principal prey for leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> in Iran (Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2018) but also an important prey for Cheetah <em>Acinonyx jubatus</em> in central Iran (Farhadinia and Hemami 2010), while wolf <em>Canis lupus</em> rarely hunts wild goat in Iran (Hosseini-Zavarei <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Greater Caucasus, impact of predators upon wild goat is generally considered non-significant (Magomadov <em>et al.</em> 2014, Weinberg 1999), though Eurasian lynx <em>Lynx lynx</em>, wolf and even brown bear <em>Ursus arctos</em> can catch, at least, juveniles (Weinberg, 2013) and golden eagles <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em> scan cliffs intermittently in summer and try to hunt kids (Weinberg 1999). Mortality caused by snow avalanches has not been recorded, even in the Greater Caucasus, unlike tur <em>Capra caucasica</em> and <em>Capra cylindricornis</em>&#160; (Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Daghestan in the North Greater Caucasus, females may live up to 18 years but usually less, while males can reach the age of 14 (Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Turkmenistan, males live up to 11 years (Korshunov 1994). Mortality among juveniles varies from 40% to 75% in different areas and years in Armenia (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011). In Daghestan, this index is about 35%, while among adults it is about 3-6%, higher in males (Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In the Greater Caucasus in Daghestan and Chechnya, wild goat is sympatric with the Eastern tur <em>Capra cylindricornis</em> that dominates above timberline but may be less numerous than wild goat in the forest (Weinberg 1999). In Chechnya, wild goat is sympatric, but much less numerous, with Caucasian chamois <em>Rupicapra r. caucasica</em>, particularly on the limestone Rocky Range (Lukarevsky 2018). However, main wild goat distribution on the northern slope of the Eastern Greater Caucasus is on the Side Range, where chamois is very rare (Weinberg 1999). Where wild goat does occur on the north slope of the Main Range, it is a forest dweller as usual in the Greater Caucasus, while chamois mostly stays above timberline (Babaev <em>et al</em>. 2016). Roe deer <em>Capreolus capreolus</em> also shares habitat with the wild goat, not only in the Greater Caucasus (Weinberg 1999), but also in several locations in South-East Armenia (Weinberg, 2011). In the Caucasus Minor and the rest of the vast range, it often is sympatric with various wild sheep: mouflon <em>Ovis gmelini, </em>urial <em>Ovis vignei</em> etc. (sheep preferring less precipitous terrain). Thus, though being sympatric with several other ungulate species, wild goat is usually ecologically more or less separated from them.</p>","<p>The major threats to this species are poaching, competition for food with domestic livestock, and disturbance and habitat loss from logging and land clearing.<br/><br/><strong>Afghanistan<br/></strong>Overhunting and colonisation of their habitat by livestock resulted in depleted numbers prior to 1979, with small bands of Wild Goats forced into the most inaccessible parts of the mountain ranges. Currently, hunting is legally banned, but poaching likely continues to be a threat.<br/><br/><strong>Caucasus<br/></strong>Main threats in the Greater Caucasus are poaching and logging, since animals are mostly confined to forested areas. In the Caucasus Minor, there is also competition with livestock, but poaching is the worst. The state of war between Azerbaijan and Armenia has a negative impact upon the main local populations of the Wild Goat.<br/><br/><strong>Iran<br/></strong>Poaching, competition for food with domestic livestock, and disturbance and habitat loss from logging and land clearing, are major threats.<br/><br/><strong>Iraq<br/></strong>Poaching and habitat degradation (H. Raza, pers. comm. 2020) as well as intentional hybridizing with domestic goats in some areas (K. Ararat, pers. comm. 2020) are the main threats.<br/><br/><strong>Lebanon<br/></strong>The extinction of wild goat in Lebanon was caused by large scale habitat destruction and the disregard of hunting regulations.<br/><br/><strong>Pakistan<br/></strong>Within its range, the species is only locally abundant and under successful protection only in a few areas (e.g., in Sind Province). Most of the animals are in scattered populations on mountain ranges isolated from each other by lowlands. Consequently, they are at risk, especially because local people and nomadic tribes graze their domestic stock on most of the mountain ranges used by wild goats, and because hunting is still widespread.<br/><br/><strong>Syria<br/></strong>Extinction of this species from Syria was probably caused by habitat destruction and hunting.<br/><br/><strong>Turkey<br/></strong>Poaching is the principal threat, because it surpasses legal hunting by 10 times, about 500 animals annually but even such loss is insubstantial, considering total numbers in Turkey (less than 0.1% of the mature individuals).</p>","<p>The global population of wild goat is difficult to estimate, because there are no total data from Pakistan and any data from Afghanistan (see below). Although the species ranges very widely, it is probably extremely rare or absent in much of its mapped range. In some places it is clearly decreasing rapidly. However, there is also evidence of localised population recovery when adequate protection is in place. The population over most of the range looks at least stable and in many areas it has been increasing since the end of the 1990s. There is an urgent need for updated information on the status of this species. Specific information on country-level abundance is as follows:<br/><br/><strong>Afghanistan<br/></strong>No estimate of numbers available, but the species is probably now very rare in this country.<br/><br/><strong>Caucasus<br/></strong>It inhabits mainly forested habitat, so accurate censuses are difficult to make. The total population estimate for the Wild Goat was between 3,500 and 4,000 individuals in the late 1980s, with 1,500 in the Greater Caucasus (Arabuli 1989, Bathiyev 1989, Prilutskaya and Pishvanov 1989) and the rest in the Caucasus Minor, where more than half (1,000 to 1,250) lived in the southern half of the Zangezur range (Kuliyev 1981). At the end of 1990s, 2,500 animals were estimated for Daghestan alone, but numbers were declining rapidly, by 50% in three years (Magomedov, Omarov and Nasrulayev 2001, Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014). Latest estimates are 1,200-1,500 animals in Daghestan (Babaev <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Georgia, recent counts came up with 50 animals in Khevsureti and 250 in Tusheti, (NACRES 2011, Ilia State University 2013). Also, there might be more than 300 animals in Chechnya (Lukarevsky 2018). Thus, the overall numbers in the Greater Caucasus amount to 1,800, maybe 2,000. The general population trend for this subspecies is negative, and in recent years the rate of decline may have increased, at least in certain areas. In Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan, for the beginning of 2000s the population was estimated at 800-1,200 animals, again almost all of it in Nakhchivan (Guliyev 2013), and for 2006-2007, 1,000 goats were estimated for Nakhchivan (Talibov <em>et al.</em> 2009). More than 500 animals have been counted during latest surveys in 2018 in the south-eastern part of Nakhchivan. Results indicate definite growth of Wild Goat population in Nakhchivan if compared to 2006-2007, so there are undoubtedly more than 1,200 animals there (Weinberg 2019). In Armenia, there were 400-700 animals counted in the 1970s (Ayrumyan and Gasparyan 1976), which was definitely an underestimate. Surveys carried out in 2006-2007 showed much higher numbers and the total population was estimated at 1,000-1,500 animals (Khorozyan, Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2009). In 2009-2013, 1,134 goats have been counted in 10 areas (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011, 2013). These areas make just a small proportion of the whole Bezoar Goat range in Armenia, so total numbers definitely exceed 2,000 animals. In total, no less than 3,200 animals inhabit the Caucasus Minor, and thus about 5,000 occur in the whole of the Caucasian Isthmus.<br/><br/><strong>Iran<br/></strong>Wild goat is the second most abundant wild ungulate in the country after wild sheep <em>Ovis</em> spp., but according to widespread opinion, it’s numbers had declined significantly almost everywhere in the second part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Annual census is being carried out in 120 protected areas of different ranking and in no-hunting areas. And these data show stable growth of wild goat numbers: from 39,500 in 2010, to 52,800 in 2015, to 67,400 in 2018 (Department of Environment Reports 2010, 2015, 2018). Since no unmanaged areas are covered by census, total population may even be larger, though animal densities outside protected and no-hunting areas are probably much lower. Nevertheless, Iran undoubtedly harbours the main share of wild goat world population.<br/><br/><strong>Iraq<br/></strong>Population estimates are rather vague, but they suggest more than 2000 animals now (K. Ararat, pers. comment, 2019) and it looks like increasing since 1990s, at least in some locations (K. Ararat, pers. comment 2019; H.Raza, pers. comment 2019). <br/><br/><strong>Pakistan<br/></strong>For <em>Capra aegagrus blythi</em> there is no overall population estimate. Most survive in small inaccessible areas in isolated populations (Virk 1991). However, reasonable numbers are reported for the Dhrun and Hingol areas (Ahmad and Beg 1989). Kirthar National Park probably contains the largest population of Sind wild goat in the country. In the Karchat Mountains, which are within Kirthar National Park, the population has increased from between 400 and 500 when the establishment park was established in 1973 (Schaller and Laurie 1974) to around 950 to 1,050 (Bollmann 1989). For the whole Park, Mirza and Asghar (1980) estimated a total of 1,480 goats, while Kermani and Khan (1985) gave an optimistic number of 4,000 animals. According to Bollmann's (unpubl. data) observations in 1987, the total population inhabiting the Park was between 1,500 and 2,000 goats. The adjacent Surjan-Sumbak-Eri-Hothiano Game Reserves contained another 900 to 1,100 (Mirza and Asghar 1980), resulting in a total estimate of 2,400 to 3,100 wild goat for Sind Province. Depending on the study area, densities ranged between 0.5 to 0.65 animals/km² (over 3,087 km² in Kirthar National Park; Bollmann, unpubl. data) and 11.8 to 16.3 animals/km² (over 60 km² in Karchat Mountains; Edge and Olsen-Edge 1990). Right now there is information just on 5 protected areas with exact year unknown, but presumably after 2015. Estimated numbers for Hingol NP are 2,500-3,000, in Dureji Community Game Reserve 2,000-2,500, in Shakh Noorani Community Game Reserve 1,000-1,500 and in Talo Band Community Game Reserve&#160; just 300-350 (Javed Ahmed Mahar, pers. comment). There are no recent data for the most important Khirthar Protected Areas Complex, but surveys carried out in 2010-2011 sighted just 1200 wild goats there (Khan et al. 2013). However, it was not a census. The overall density within the species' distribution area in Pakistan is probably well below 0.5 wild goat/km². For <em>C. a. chialtanensis</em> the single population totaled ca. 168 animals in 1975 (Mirza 1975), rose to 480 animals by 1990 due to strict protection (Baluchistan Forest Dept. Records, cited in Virk 1991), and is estimated at 1,500 animals now (J. Ahmed Mahar, pers. comment). However, these protected areas comprise just a small portion of the species distribution in Pakistan and the total numbers have not even been estimated. There is an urgent need to update information on the abundance of the wild goat in Pakistan.<br/><br/><strong>Turkey<br/></strong>Official population size in Wildlife development areas is above 18,500 animals (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 2019) and some 15,000 more inhabit State hunting areas (Ambarlı 2016), so total numbers should be no less than 33,000. The last assessment (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 2008) stated that the population is declining in Turkey throughout its range, and the total population is believed to be less than 10,000 mature individuals, with no subpopulation larger than 1,000 mature individuals. If these figures were correct the numbers might have at least stabilized since.<br/><br/><strong>Turkmenistan<br/></strong>Korshunov (1986), whose data were the most reliable, estimated that the total population in central Kopet-Dagh was up to 7,000 animals and supposed that overall numbers in Turkmenistan might have been about 8,000 then. Earlier, in the 1970s, 30-40 animals had been counted on Small Balkhan, and just singular animals were seen on Begarslan (Atayev and Gulbatyrov 2011). At the same time, 140 animals had been counted in one small site of the Large Balkhan (Zarkhidze 1980), which meant that at least several hundred could have occurred on the whole massive. No current data are available for Turkmenistan. </p>  <p>Overall, the current population should be no less than 110,000, plus populations in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>",Stable,"<p>The Wild Goat (<em>Capra aegagrus</em>) ranges discontinuously from central Afghanistan and southern Pakistan, west through Iran, southern and western Turkmenistan, northern Iraq, the Caucasus region (Armenia, Azerbaijan, northeastern Georgia, and southern Russia), as far as southwestern Turkey. It once occurred in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, but is now extinct in these countries (Grubb 2005). It also occurred in Israel before 10,000 years ago (Dayan <em>et al</em>. 1986).<br/><br/><strong>Afghanistan<br/></strong>It is probably confined to the Hazarajat and Uruzgan mountains in central Afghanistan, including the arid Feroz Koh and Siyah Koh in the headwaters of the Hari Rud, Farah Rud, Helmand and Arghandab rivers. However, no animals were observed by FAO or WWF survey teams in the 1970s, but horns and skulls were occasionally seen at shrines and grave sites. One captive animal seen in 1975 in a private zoo in Kandahar, was reputedly caught in the nearby mountains (Habibi 2003). Hassinger (1973) also reported hunting wild goat in Kandahar. The most recent record about wild goat in Afghanistan is limited to some skulls and horns recorded at a shrine&#160;(34°05' N 61°33' E) in Herat Province in northwestern Afghanistan in 2007 (Z. Moheb, pers. comm.). The species had probably been reduced to a small portion of its former range by the late 1970s (Habibi 2003). Its current distribution in the country is unknown, but it may stretch westwards along the mountain ranges to the border with Iran and northwards, closer to Turkmenistan.<br/><br/><strong>Caucasus<br/></strong>The distribution of <em>C. a. aegagrus</em> is in two major separate parts. The first, consists of several locations in forested areas along northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains from the Upper Argun river, in Khevsureti, Georgia (approx. 42<sup>0</sup>37’ N 45<sup>0</sup>07’ E) and lower parts of the same river basin in Chechnya, Russia; in Andi Koisu River basin in Daghestan and Tusheti, Georgia; in Avar Koisu riverbasin in Daghestan, also in several isolated locations, up to the headwaters of Jurmut river (around 41°57'N, 46°31'E) (NACRES 2010, 2013; Ilia State University 2013; Lukarevsky 2018; Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014; Weinberg 1999) an isolated far away population in Chiraghchai River basin (approx. 41<sup>0</sup>43’ N 47<sup>0</sup>50’ E) (Babaev <em>et al</em>. 2017). Probably more thorough surveys will produce more locations in this latter area. Previously indicated population on the southern slopes of Mount Babadagh, Azerbaijan (Vereshchagin 1959) doesn’t exist, and probably didn’t exist in the nearest past. The second is in the Caucasus Minor mountains, where wild goat occurs in both Azerbaijan and Armenia, south and east of Sevang lake, namely the Gegam, Vardenis, Ayoydzor, Zangezur, Megri, Mrovdagh, Karabakh ranges, and on the Delidagh massif, in three main separate parts (39°45'N&#160; 45°09'E, 39°08'N 45° 46°09'E and 40°19'N 46° 01'E) (Ayrumyan and Gasparyan 1976; Dahl 1954; Guliyev 2013; Kuliyev 1981; Vereshchagin 1959; Khorozyan <em>et al</em>. 2009; Weinberg and Malkhasyan, 2011, 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Iran<br/></strong>The Wild Goat is widely distributed throughout Iran wherever large areas of rocky terrain are available. This includes not only mountainous areas, but also cliffs along the seashore, deciduous forested areas of the north, and in areas of the central desert. Only several large depressions in the central part of the country and certain flat major river valleys lack it (Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Iraq<br/></strong>Current data indicate&#160; occurrence of Wild Goat in several isolated patches in Sulaymanyah, Erbil and Nineveh in north-east Iraq along the border with Turkey and, mainly, with Iran where animals inhabit Zagros Mountains with oak forests (Raza <em>et al</em>. 2012, Raza 2013, Al-Barazengy <em>et al</em>. 2015, H. Raza, pers. comm. 2020, K. Ararat, pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Lebanon<br/></strong>The Wild Goat used to be relatively common in Barouk, the Ammiq mountains and on Mount Harmon, northern Lebanon. However, by the early 1900s it was extinct in Lebanon (Kumerloeve 1975, Harrison 1968).<br/><br/><strong>Pakistan<br/></strong>The present range of Sind wild goat (<em>C. a. blythi</em>) is the Baluchistan plateau and its foothills in south-western Pakistan. Populations are scattered on arid mountain ranges that are isolated by lowlands of southern Baluchistan and Sind. The range includes the low Mekran coastal range (District Gwadar), areas up to 3,250 m asl in the Koh-i-Maran range south of Quetta (District Kalat), and also the Kirthar range (Districts of Dadu and Las Bela) (Roberts 1977, Schaller 1977, Bollmann 1989). A second subspecies, the Chiltan goat (<em>C. a. chialtanensis</em>) was restricted in the early 1970s to four or five populations in the accessible mountain ranges (Chiltan, Murdar, Koh-i-Maran and Koh-i-Gishk ranges) south of Quetta (Roberts 1977, Schaller 1977). Today, these have been reduced, principally by uncontrolled hunting, to only one surviving population in the Hazarganji-Chiltan National Park (Districts of Quetta and Kalat).<br/><br/><strong>Syria<br/></strong>Wild Goat was reported in northern Syria, in the mountains north of Dimasq, and must once have occurred in the western mountains as well. However, it is now believed to be extinct (Harrison 1968).<br/><br/><strong>Turkey<br/></strong>The Wild Goat ranges widely in Turkey, east from the Datca peninsula, through the Taurus and Anti-Taurus mountains in the mountainous regions of southeastern, eastern and northeastern Anatolia up to Iranian border (Ambarlı 2016, Kence 1987).<br/><br/><strong>Turkmenistan<br/></strong>The Turkmen Wild Goat (<em>C. a. blythi</em> [= <em>turcmenica</em>]), occurs in scattered populations in the central Kopet Dagh (38°32'N 45°09'E to 37°41'N 58° 49'E) and eastern Kopet Dagh (37°18'N, 59°27'E and 36°N, 39'E) along the border between Turkmenistan and Iran, in the Large Balkhan (Bolshye) north of Nebit Dagh about 39°38'N, 54°41'E. It is not known whether this subspecies still inhabits the Small Balkhan (Malye) 39°17'N 54° 53'E and Begarslan 39°11'N 55° 32'E, but both these locations are mentioned in The Red Data Book of Turkmenistan (Atayev and Gulbatyrov 2011). A small isolated population existed on Gyaz-Gedyk Range near the border with Iran (35°49'N, 61°18'E), but it isn’t mentioned in latest publications (Atayev and Gulbatyrov 2011).</p>","This species is hunted mostly for food and sport, though the hides and other body parts may also be used.",Terrestrial,"<p><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br/>Reconnaissance surveys were conducted to evaluate the species' distribution patterns in the mid 1970s. The work was discontinued after the start of the civil war. Surveys to determine the current status and distribution of the species in the country and to develop conservation strategies. Hunting is banned since 2006.</p><p><strong>Former Soviet Union</strong><br/><em>Capra aegagrus aegagrus</em> is protected by law, and was included in Category II in the Red Data Book of the USSR (Borodin 1984), and later as ‘diminishing and being on the periphery of the distribution’ in the Red Data Book of Russia (Danilov-Danilyan 2000). It is Vulnerable in the proposed latest version of the Red List of Russia. However, it doesn’t occur in any strict nature reserve or national park in Russia, just in one federal and two local sanctuaries (zakaznik) in Daghestan. Protected areas of higher ranking are definitely needed in Daghestan. Currently, a project was proposed of merging the existing three sanctuaries into a national park.<br/><br/>The species is listed in the Red List of Georgia as Critically Endangered (Ordinance of the Government of Georgia on Adoption of Georgian “Red List” 2014). Consequently hunting wild goat is totally prohibited in Georgia and it is being protected in Tusheti Protected Areas which encompass Tusheti Strict Nature Reserve, Tusheti National Park and Tusheti Protected Landscape probably harboring the majority of the species and its habitat in Georgia.<br/><br/>In the Caucasus Minor, it is listed Vulnerable VU B2ab; C2a in Red Book of Armenia (Malkhasyan, 2010a), where most of counted animals occur in Arevik National Park and Zangezur Sanctuary, in Community-governed Arpa Protected Landscape and in Khosrov Forest Nature Reserve, but also inhabit Shikakhokh Nature Reserve. There are also NGO-governed protected areas and private game reserves on Urts Range and in Gnishik. In Azerbaijan wild goat is listed Vulnerable VU A2cd&#160;in Red Book of Azerbaijan (Guliev, 2013d) where at least 50% of the whole Nakhchivan population is protected in Zangezur National Park and Ordubad Sanctuary. It also occurs in Geigel Nature Reserve. In general, most essential wild goat locations are being protected in the Caucasus Minor. Throughout its range in the former Soviet Union, more strict and effective measures are needed to control poaching. Most local people in the Caucasus consider wild goats and other species as a source of meat, hides and horns, so stricter prohibition measures alone will not be sufficient. Public awareness programmes are also needed. It is essential to protect the forest habitat of this species in Daghestan and elsewhere in the Caucasus.<br/><br/>Turkmen wild goat (<em>C. a. blythi</em> [= <em>turcmenica</em>]) is also protected. It is listed as Vulnerable in the Red Data Book of Turkmenistan but Kopet Dagh Nature Reserve is the only protected area with this subspecies (Atayev and Gulbatyrov 2011). Hunting is banned in Turkmenistan. The wild goat should be re-introduced into the Siunt-Khasardag Nature Reserve in the western Kopet Dagh, and into the Badkhyz Nature Reserve in the Gyaz-Gedyk range, and protected areas should be created in, at least, Large Balkhan. Also, probably artificial water sources are needed in the latter site.<br/><br/><strong>Iran<br/></strong>The wild goat occurs in several protected areas where hunting is prohibited and livestock grazing is strictly controlled. It is found in 120 protected areas of different ranking and no-hunting areas (NHA). Areas with largest wild goat numbers are Taleqan NHA (&gt;3,000), Kolahghazi National Park (3,000), Marakan Protected Area, Moute Wildlife Refuge, Kalmand va Bahadoran Protected Area and Dena National Park and Protected Area (about 2,500 each) (Department of Environment Report 2018). They can be hunted under licence outside protected areas between September and February each year, but more strict enforcement of hunting regulations is needed. <br/><br/><strong>Iraq<br/></strong>Wild goat is protected by Kurdistan Region's Decree No.1 of 2015 on Hunting and Protection of Wild Animals and Birds and hunting is banned. The implementation is bad and completely reliant on the forest police awareness and capacity in each of those areas. Further surveys are needed to determine the status and distribution of this species more precisely.<br/><br/><strong>Lebanon<br/></strong>A captive breeding plan and subsequent re-introduction program has been proposed, in conjunction with one in Syria.<br/><br/><strong>Pakistan<br/></strong>Of 28 national parks in Pakistan, just 3 are located within wild goat range there: Hingol, Kirthar and Hazarganji, and quite numerous sanctuaries and community game reserves. The total area of protected territories may be quite large, but even national parks are used for livestock pasturing and other activities contradicting with wildlife conservation. Wild goats have to compete with livestock not just for pastures, but what is more serious, for freshwater sources (Khan 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Syria</strong><br/>The proposed joint re-introduction project with Lebanon should be implemented.<br/><br/><strong>Turkey<br/></strong>Much stricter conservation measures are needed to prevent poaching, and especially to secure the future of the larger populations.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Their suitable habitat contains hills, undulating terrain and gentle slopes but also cliffs. Mouflon may also live and forage on crop fields. The ecology of the species is widely unknown but Mouflon are gregarious. Herds are smaller and often sexually segregated during spring and summer. They are sexually dimorphic, non-territorial and promiscuous. Main predators are Leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>) and Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>), Feral Dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>) and in much less extent Eurasian Lynx (<em>Lynx lynx</em>).</p>","<p>Overall, this species is threatened mainly by poaching and competition with livestock (Bleyhl <em>et al</em>. 2019). Specific threats to particular subspecies are:<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini gmelini</em></strong><br/>In the southern Caucasus, in Armenia, Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran, Bleyhl <em>et al</em>. (2019) found that Mouflon were affected by domestic sheep through forage competition and displacement, including through disturbance by herders and dogs, which may be more detrimental for Mouflon than forage competition. Disease transmitted by livestock could also be a threat. In 2014-2016, 30 Mouflon in Haftad Golleh Protected Area, Iran suffered losses due to Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (Marashi <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>In Iraq, the biggest and perhaps most noticeable threat to the Mouflon population is poaching for their meat. Since there is no clear historical evidence, it is therefore difficult to know what other threats led to their decline. Maybe many years of war and instability that the region went through has facilitated heavy poaching as a replacement for livestock meat, which the local people could not afford during the sanction and the economic recession of the 1980s (H. Raza, pers. comm. 2020). After 2003, most of the villagers went back to their villages, which had been destroyed during the regime of Saddam Hussain. There was an economical blooming in the region for a while, which led to the construction of new roads. These roads eased the accessibility for poachers. This is one of the major factors, which caused the decline of many species in the region. Habitat is destroyed by livestock grazing and urbanization (K. Ararat, pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/>In Turkey, the Bozdağ population in Central Anatolia is (almost) completely restricted to a fenced area, where the threat factors of poaching, predation and most relevant forage competition and habitat degradation by domestic sheep are excluded. Outside the fenced area these factors still limit the numbers of Mouflon (Özüt 2009). The reintroduced population in Sarıyar (northwestern Anatolia) is affected by the lack of opportunities for dispersal and seasonal migration due to Sarıyar Reservoir. Hence, it cannot spatially avoid anthropogenic disturbance, high amount of parasites, and predation pressure by wild and domestic dogs, altogether preventing an expansion of this population (Mengüllüoğlu <em>et al</em>. 2019). All captive and reintroduced wild sheep populations in central Turkey suffer from paratuberculosis and feral dog depredation. Poaching is a serious threat in eastern Turkey (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini ophion</em></strong><br/>The biggest threat affecting the Mouflon population in Cyprus is livestock intrusion into Mouflon range in the forest periphery and recently even within state forest boundaries through competition, displacement and disease transmission. Feral dogs cause substantial predation mortality and disturbance. Poaching is another important mortality factor. Road construction causes habitat fragmentation and collisions with vehicles. Reforestation of burned areas and/or planting of pine monocultures with terracing make habitat unsuitable for Mouflon. Plans for future development of solar plants and large quarries within the Mouflon range threaten large parts of its habitat (N. Kassinis, pers. comm. 2016 and presentation at the WCMU 2016 in Nicosia).</p>","<p>The global population of this species may be about 26,500 (16,000 mature individuals). The population numbers do not include suspected species hybrids between <em>Ovis gmelini </em>and <em>O. vignei</em>, occurring in Iran. Hereby we considered entire provinces if not otherwise indicated. The population trend across its range is difficult to assess. While officially reported overall numbers in the main range state, Iran, suggest stable or increasing trend (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016), local studies suggest decreases.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini gmelini</em></strong><br/> By the end of the 1960s, there were 1,750 in Azerbaijan and Armenia. The first population census was conducted in the 1970s  with 350-400 animals for Armenia and Nakhchivan together (Yavruyan, 1975), while Alekperov and Kuliev (1981) reported that the population in the Nakhichevan ASSR alone numbered 1,000 to 1,200 animals. In 1993, 1,200-1,500 animals were estimated for Nakhchivan (Guliyev, 2000). Then numbers declined, but the latest counts in Nakhchivan in December 2018 found the largest Mouflon numbers since beginning of surveys in 2006: 119 on Negramdagh Plateau and 90 on Darydagh Massif and foothills; the estimates are 150 and 120, respectively (Weinberg, 2019). In Armenia, during the surveys conducted during the rut, 50 animals have been found on Urts Range, and 104 on Zangezur and Bargushat Ranges; the total numbers in Armenia were estimated at no less than 250 (Weinberg and Malkhasyan, 2010). A<span lang=""EN-US""> conservative estimate might be about 400, maybe even 500 Mouflon in Zangezur Range of Armenia and Azerbaijan (Nakhchivan). Mouflon are supposedly less numerous now in the areas of Armenia and despite that more recent counts showed a larger number of animals than in the 1960s-70s, the population has declined since then, as considered by interviewed zoologists, hunters, shepherds, etc. (Weinberg, pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>In Iran, recent population estimates from protected areas do not distinguish between Urial, Mouflon and hybrids. The total of figures from surveys by Department of Environment for the protected areas in the provinces Eastern Azerbaijan, Western Azerbaijan, Zanjan, Ilam, Hamedan, Kermanshah and Kurdistan, where likely <em>Ovis g. gmelini</em> only occurs, was approx. 4,200 in 2007 and around 5,200 individuals in 2016 (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016). However, reported numbers fluctuated between the years with only approx. 2,300 reported in 2012. Valdez (2008) provided no population size for Iran. <br/><br/><span style="""">No current total population estimate is available in Iraq. Villagers interviewed in 2018 in the area south of Darbandikhan Reservoir reported seeing between 2-12 individuals in one encounter, except the local from Lime, which reported only seeing one (H. Raza, pers. comm. 2020). The total population in this area might be in the range of 100-200 individuals. Numbers seen by local people further to the south, near Khanaqin are not known. Generally, Mouflon populations have declined and have disappeared in many areas in Iraq (K. Ararat, pers. comm. 2020). </span><br/><br/>In Turkey, there were around 50-100 Anatolian Mouflon in the Konya-Bozdağ area in 1967 (Özüt 2009). In 1989, a fenced area of 4,000 ha had been established. The size of the semi-captive population increased to 850 in 2000, while outside the fence the population size was estimated to be 50-100. By 2007, the fenced population had declined to 700 due to high mortality from paratuberculosis <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> and translocation of 200 animals (Özüt 2009). Distance sampling in early 2009 yielded an estimate of 947 (Özdirek 2009). However, the 2019 autumn inventory resulted in 530 semi-captive and 150 free-ranging individuals (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020). The reintroduced population in Ankara-Sarıyar despite several re-stockings has not increased and has been oscillating around 40–80 sheep between 2005 and 2017 (Mengüllüoğlu 2019), and the 2019 inventory count was 46 individuals. Although the reintroduced population in Karaman-Karadağ has experienced a sharp decline in the first few years, it steadily increased after 2010 and the 2019 inventory indicated 100 individuals. In central Turkey, by Autumn 2019 there are in total around 600 captive or semi-captive and 320 free-ranging (including reintroduced) Mouflons (unpubl. report, Wildlife Department of Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2019). Since 2001, in spite of captive breeding, reintroduction and protection efforts total number is not increasing but decreasing; around 900 individuals are left in several separate populations, most of which are captive or semi-captive and even in captivity numbers are decreasing or stable. In addition, probably only one third of this number is breeding and except for the Bozdağ and Karadağ populations all others can easily get extinct within the next several years if not supported by new releases (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020). Population numbers of Mouflon in southeastern Turkey are unknown. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini isphahanica</em><br/></strong>Numbers of wild sheep reported by the Department of Environment for the protected areas in Isfahan, Chahrmahal &amp; Bakhtiari, Lorestan and Markazi provinces fluctuated largely between 2007 (ca. 6,000) and 2016 (ca. 18,300). Large inter-annual differences suggest at least partly inconsistency in the population estimates and/or reporting. <br/></p>  <p><strong><em>Ovis gmelini laristanica</em><br/></strong>Mouflon numbers in Hormozgan Province, reported by the Department of Environment increased from 138 in 2007 to 239 in 2016, but fluctuated between 112 (2008) and 370 (2009). In Hormod Protected Area in Fars Province, which encompasses the largest population of Laristan sheep, the reported estimate in 2019 was 1,040 (M. Ansari, pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis gmelini ophion</em></strong><br/>The population estimate in 1999 was 3072 +/- 691 animals (Kassinis and Papageorgiou, 2000). Between the years of 2001-2003 there was an outbreak of Infectious Keratoconjuctivitis (IKC) with a Mouflon population decline of 20% in 2003 (Kassinis 2005). The 2010 fall population estimate was 2,574 +/- 599 animals (Kassinis <em>et al. </em>2012). For the years after no estimates are available, but the directly recorded numbers continuously declined from 581 in 2010 to 407 in 2015 (N. Kassinis, pers. comm. 2016 and presentation at the WCMU 2016 in Nicosia).</p>",Unknown,"<p>Mouflon are found in Armenia, southern Azerbaijan, Cyprus, northern Iraq, southern and western Iran, and eastern Turkey, with several isolated populations in central Turkey. In Iran, following Rezaei <em>et al</em>. (2010) (and unlike Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016 or Yusefi <em>et al</em>. 2019, which assigned the <em>Ovis </em>in all areas to either of the two species) we considered a zone of occurrence of hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em>. The exact extent of this hybrid zone and the status of certain populations of wild sheep there are uncertain. Therefore, we opted for the most conservative scenario at the province level (due to data limitations) and delineate the species boundaries accordingly. We considered the western and southern provinces (i.e., East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan, Zanjan, Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Hamedan, Markazi, Lorestan, Ilam, Khuzestan, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Bushehr) as the 'confirmed' Mouflon range as we had higher certainty about mouflon presence. Additionally, we considered western Isfahan, western Hormozgan and southern Fars in mouflon range. We did not consider other provinces with Ovis population for being more conservative as higher phenotypic diversity in wild sheep in these provinces is observable. Our tentative hybrid zone is also included in the description of the geographic range in this assessment and mapped as 'Presence Uncertain' with a note that there is a higher possibility of hybridization in this area.<br/><br/><strong>Armenian Mouflon<em style=""""> - Ovis gmelini gmelini </em>(including<em style=""""> </em>Anatolian Mouflon<em style=""""> O. g. anatolica</em>)</strong><br/>In the southern Caucasus the sheep inhabits the Zangezur range in Armenia and Azerbaijan (Nakhchivan), further in Armenia in the Aiotsdzor Ridge, Bargushat Ridge and the Urts Ridge and possibly, but currently unconfirmed, just into Kalbajar-Lachin region of Azerbaijan. This subspecies is a resident of the mountain foothills and rolling steppe of northwest and west of Iran. <em>O. g. gmelini</em> are found in western Alborz Mts., northern Zagros Mts., and specifically in Marakan Protected Area, Kiamaky Wildlife Refuge, Urmiyeh Lake National Park (Kabudan Island, where it has been introduced), Sahand Protected Area, Angouran Protected Area, and Bijar Protected Area in Iran.<br/><br/>In Iraq, populations occurred in the extreme northern region in the Zagros Mountains and along the northeastern border with Iran (Valdez 2008). Mouflon presence has been confirmed in 2018 from an area in Suleimaniyah Governorate, south of Darbandikhan Reservoir, at the border with Iran by video record and reliable local reports (H. Raza and K. Ararat, pers comm. 2020). Another local report exists from the border with Iran near Khanaqin in Diyala Governorate (K. Ararat, pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>In Turkey, <em>O. gmelini gmelini</em> occurs in the southeast of the country. Its distribution is described as south of Mount Ağrı, east of Lake Van and northern and eastern territories of Hakkari and anecdotal knowledge suggests a migratory behavior between southeastern Turkey and Iran. A field study carried out at southeastern Anatolia by a group of researchers revealed that a very small number of animals were left in the previously mentioned parts of Eastern Anatolia (Weinberg and Özüt 2007). However, after 2010 no sighting record for this small population was registered; the last record was in 2005, with 10 individuals at Lesser Ağri Mountain (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020). Further to the west Anatolian mouflon <em>O. g. gmelini [anatolica]</em> exist in four small areas, one in Bozdağ east of Konya in central Anatolia, the second one further south in Karaman-Karadağ, a third one in Aksaray-Ekecik and a fourth one in northwestern Anatolia, in <span class=""fontstyle01"">Ankara-Sarıyar between Ankara and Eskişehir. In the past, small and isolated populations were spread to Nallıhan and Polatlı in Ankara, Sivrihisar-Eskişehir, Emirdağı-Afyon, and Ereğli, Karapınar, Karadağ and Bozdağ in Konya. All these populations except the one in Konya-Bozdağ vanished by mid-1960s. The majority of the Bozdağ population is under semi-wild conditions in a 4,000 ha enclosure. Reintroductions occurred during 2004-2005 in Karaman-Karadağ and Ankara-Sarıyar (Özüt 2009), and in 2016 in Aksaray-Ekecik (unpubl. report, Wildlife Department of Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Isfahan Mouflon<em><em style=""""> - </em>Ovis gmelini isphahanica</em></strong><br/>The subspecies is restricted to east-central Iran in areas such as Ghamishlou National Park, Mouteh Protected Area, Haftad Gholleh Protected Area, Oshtorankouh Protected Area, and Tang Sayyad National Park.<br/><br/><strong>Laristan Mouflon<em><em style=""""> - </em>Ovis gmelini laristanica</em></strong><br/>This subspecies is a resident of southern Iran. The Laristan sheep is found in Hormod Protected Area and Keshar Protected Area, other populations, e.g., in Fars, might be at least partly hybrids with <em>Ovis vignei</em>. There is much uncertainty about the extent of the species and subspecies of wild sheep in Iran and further data and analysis are required for determining the taxonomic status.<br/><br/><strong>Cyprus Mouflon -<em> Ovis gmelini ophion</em><br/></strong>The Cyprus Mouflon is restricted to the 620 km² Pafos Forest in Cyprus (Hadjisterkotis 2001).<br/><br/><strong><em>Hybrid populations</em><br/></strong>Alborz Red Sheep - <em>Ovis gmelini gmelini</em> x <em>Ovis vignei arkal/cycloceros</em> (Valdez <em>et al</em>. 1978) occurs in north-central Iran in the Alborz Mountains in Tehran and Alborz provinces (Varjin Protected Area, Central Alborz Protected Area, Khojir National Park, Sorkheh Hesar National Park), east to the Parvar Protected Area and south into the Kavir National Park. The exact western, eastern and southern limits of its distribution are undetermined, but generally sheep in central Alborz Mountains are considered as belonging to this hybrid form.<br/><br/>The Kerman Sheep occurring east of 55°E in the Khabr National Park and Baft mountains in Kerman Province has been suggested to be a hybrid population (<em>Ovis vignei cycloceros </em>[<em>blanfordti</em>] x <em>Ovis gmelini laristanica</em>) (Valdez 2008).<br/><br/>Hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em> may occur also in other areas of Iran, including the provinces in central and northern Fars, eastern Hormozgan, eastern Isfahan, Qom, eastern Semnan, and Yazd.</p>",,Terrestrial,"<em>Ovis gmelini</em> is listed on CITES Appendix I (Only the population of Cyprus; no other population is included in the Appendices). <em>Ovis g. ophion</em> is listed in Annexes II and IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive.<br/><br/>The Mouflon is legally protected in Armenia since 1936 and became protected in the Soviet Union by listing in Category I of the USSR Red Data Book (Borodin, 1984). In Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Mouflon is nowadays a protected species. A ban on hunting in Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan, has let to recovery of Mouflon population in this area (P. Fatullaev, pers. comm. 2019). Mouflon is found in both sides of Zangezur Ridge in Zangezur National Park and Ordubad Sanctuary (Nakhichevan, Azerbaijan) and Arevik National Park, Zangezur State Sanctuary and community-governed Arpa Protected Landscape (Armenia). Bleyhl et al. (2019) suggest for the southern Caucausus that conservation planning should consider competition with livestock both reactively (lessening livestock pressure in suitable ungulate habitat) and proactively (reintroduction in areas with low competition potential). Conservation efforts should focus on (a) lessening conflict with livestock, particularly in key Mouflon patches; and (b) improving connectivity among priority habitat patches and between seasonal habitat through protection of stepping stones and/or translocations. Promoting private or community-based reserves with small-scale livestock production may help establish Mouflon populations with local landowners potentially co-benefiting from wildlife (e.g., tourism, trophy hunting once populations are viable) while reducing poaching risk for Mouflon.<br/><br/>In Cyprus, the Game and Fauna Service of the Ministry of Interior is responsible for Mouflon conservation. Mouflon is a strictly protected species both through its inclusion in the European Union Habitats Directive 92/43 (Annexes ΙΙ and IV) but also through the national legislation (Law 152(Ι) of 2003-2015). A species management plan has been in place since 1996 and has been updated in 2011. Key activities include: 1. Law enforcement (regular patrols to prevent and combat poaching), 2. Habitat improvements through 150 artificial watering points, food plots with winter cereals and forest clearings, 3. Population monitoring (fall counts and lamb surveys), 4. Inspection of agricultural damage and provision of advice to decrease it, and 5. Health monitoring in close cooperation with Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment (N. Kassinis, pers. comm. 2016 and presentation at the WCMU 2016 in Nikosia). The Cyprus Mouflon is listed in CITES Appendix I (valid from 26 November 2019) as “Ovis gmelini (only the population of Cyprus; no other population is included in the Appendices)”. Guerrini <em>et al</em>. (2015) suggest that until definitive light can be shed on taxonomically heterogeneous Near Eastern Mouflons, the Mouflon of Cyprus should be unvaryingly acknowledged as subspecies <em>ophion </em>not to impair conservation in the country where it resides. In the light of the genetic divergence disclosed between Cypriot and European Mouflon, they furthermore recommended banning importation of any Mouflon into Cyprus to preserve the integrity of the island population.<br/><br/>In Iran, Mouflon is a Protected Species but it can be hunted under licences issued by the Department of the Environment. Hunting is permitted in protected areas but requires a Special Licence. Unfortunately, the exact numbers of Mouflons shot each year by hunters are not available and differ substantially from year to year due to contrasting policies of promoting trophy hunting and blanket bans on all hunting. Mouflon occurs in numerous protected areas. However, poaching and livestock grazing are not fully prevented in these areas (Bleyhl <em>et al</em>. 2019). Poaching Mouflon results in a fine of around 1,785 Euro (i.e., 250,000,000 IRR; 1 Euro ~ 140,000 IRR 2020).<br/><br/>In Iraq, the most urgent conservation measure that could potentially lead to an increase in their population is declaring their habitat as a protected area and establishing ranger patrols against poaching. But this seems currently not a priority for the Kurdistan Regional Government due to the remoteness of Mouflon habitat and probably to avoid military clashes due to the proximity to the Iranian border (H. Raza, pers. comm. 2020). There might be a potential for the development of community-based conservation and hunting management, including income generation from regulated trophy hunting.<br/><br/>In Turkey, Mouflon is legally protected, but strictly regulated hunting has been permitted. Captive populations are annually vaccinated against paratuberculosis and reintroduced populations are supported by vaccinated individuals. After 2010, two more captive populations (Ankara-Nallıhan and Afyon-Şuhut) and one more re-introduced population (Aksaray-Ekecik) were established. Mengüllüoğlu <em>et al</em>. (2019) found the existing reintroduction site of Mouflon in Sarıyar (Northwestern Anatolia) unsuitable due to high anthropogenic disturbance and interruption of migration routes by a reservoir and recommend wild ungulate reintroductions to suitable areas (with lower anthropogenic disturbance and livestock densities) where local ungulate populations went extinct and replaced by livestock. Nallihan Captive breeding Center will be closed in 2021 and additional releases here will not be continued due to low habitat suitability. Instead, two new reintroduction sites are planned for 2020-21 in more suitable habitats, one in Afyon and one in Kahramanmaras (D. Mengüllüoğlu, pers. comm. 2020).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years), but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.</p>","<p>The Siberian Ibex&#160;primarily occupies mountainous regions from 500 to-5,500 m asl in rocky terrain and open alpine meadows and crags, seeking out lower elevations during the winter (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). In the completely snowed in valleys of the Himalaya, however, ibex remain in high elevations during winter to feed on emergent vegetation in the avalanche chutes and windblown crests, and also digging through softer snow of the higher elevations. They descend to the lower valley bottoms to take advantage of the spring thaw, but ascend to the highest ridgelines during the peak of summer (Schaller 1977, Bhatnagar 1997). Ibex occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. Siberian Ibex&#160;can also be found in areas with canyons, rocky outcrops, and steep ‘escape’ terrain far from high mountains (Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007, Peterson 2016, Bragin <em>et al.</em> 2017). The species rarely enters forest zones, but on a hot day does prefer shaded areas, or even small pockets of pastures near glaciers. Ibex tend to remain near steep, escape terrain (Bhatnagar 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Pin Valley National Park in India, over 90% of the over 800 ibex sightings were within 100 m from ‘escape terrain’ (Bhatnagar 1997). Females tend to retreat into the security of cliffs for parturition in May-June (Schaller 1977). </p>  <p>Ibex live in small groups that vary considerably in size, sometimes forming herds of over 100 animals, but more typically averaging 6-30 animals, depending on the region (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1997, 1999b; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Singh <em>et al. </em>2010). They spend the day in alternating periods of activity and rest, having a bimodal pattern through much of the year. In winter, ibex in the Himalaya tend to have a distinct unimodal activity peak towards noon, while resting on or near cliffs from evening until the next morning (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1992, Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). </p>  <p>Ibex shows little sexual segregation throughout the year, except the period between parturition (around June) and autumn (November) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex in an area of rocky outcrops in the Mongolian Gobi Desert displayed no segregation between sexes and similar sized mean annual home ranges using minimum convex polygons (MCPs) of 42 km<sup>2</sup> for females (n = 5) and 39 km<sup>2</sup> for males (n = 4) (Reading <em>et al.</em> 2007). A study on ranging patterns of ibex in the Indian Himalaya (2 adult males and 3 females) shows that the mean annual home range (MCPs) of males (44 km<sup>2</sup>) was almost double that of females (20 km<sup>2</sup>) (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Ibex used extremely small ranges on lower, south facing slopes with early sprout during the spring (&lt;3 km<sup>2</sup>), expanding to larger ranges in summer and autumn, but again confining to small ranges during winter (5-10 km<sup>2</sup>). Daily movements of ibex were highest during the summer flush when they traversed over a km during a day to take advantage of forage quality, but were confined to barely a 300-400 meters during winter and spring due to limited usable patches (Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015).</p>  <p>Ibex are primarily grazers with herbs as well as subshrubs and shrubs such as <em>Eurotia sp</em>., <em>Rosa</em> sp. and <em>Ephedra sp.</em> contributing significantly to their diet (Manjrekar 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Bagchi <em>et al. </em>2004, Tumursukh 2015). </p>  <p>Females gestate for 170-180 days (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961) and usually give birth to one, sometimes two, kids in the spring. The animals reach sexual maturity at 18 months for females and 30 months for males, although usually only older males mate (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Siberian Ibex&#160;can live up to 16-17 years (Heptner <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1961, Fedosenko and Blank 2001).<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>Throughout its range, local people hunt ibex for subsistence use because they traditionally provide an important supplementary food for local people. Poaching also occurs in some areas by military personnel, road maintenance workers, and others, especially in areas accessible by vehicle (Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987). Additional threats to ibex include competition with livestock for food and habitat, and in some areas by predators. As a result of these threats, some populations have declined significantly, especially in regions with dense human populations.<br/> <br/> In 2007, producers of wool products in Nepal began marketing a product they termed “yangir”, which they claimed originated from wild, hunted <em>Capra sibirica</em>. (Some hair fibers from <em>C. sibirica</em> are quite fine, and potentially may be used for high-quality wool). At least one importer based in Germany was marketing these products as high-end, specialty scarves. As of this writing (early 2020), the origin of these products (and whether they indeed came from <em>C. sibirica</em>) had not yet been determined, but were still being advertised on the internet as coming from ibex, stating that annually 1500 kg of the wool are produced world-wide (www.acitac.com/materialien/faserkunde/yangir.html). This would require the harvest of a considerable number of animals. Domestic hunting might provide the raw material. Trophy hunting programs harvest only a few animals/year and are unlikely to be the source of a commercially marketed wool product. However, so far interest in ibex wool at local level is unknown and it seems Central Asia is not (yet) a supplier (Michel unpubl. data). If <em>Capra sibirica</em> were being poached specifically to feed this market, formerly stable populations could quickly become threatened.<br/> <br/> In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan Siberian Ibex&#160;are harvested in trophy hunting programs. Trophy hunting targets only males above a certain age, and so direct impacts on targeted population size likely remain negligible, but poorly regulated trophy hunting can have many negative consequences (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), including an effect on the sex and age composition of populations as reported from Kyrgyzstan (Michel and Rosen 2016). The potential of causing evolutionary effects is low as long as hunter harvest only a minor portion of the males. Bans on trophy hunting and importation of hunting trophies risk removing incentives to prevent poaching and might increase human-caused mortality of ibex.<br/> <br/> Climate change likely poses new threats by altering habitat quality, in particular affecting water availability, vegetation composition and phenology as well as causing changes in land-use. <br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, it seems that prior to the Soviet invasion, Siberian Ibex&#160;was abundant and hunted throughout its range by local tribesmen. The impact of hunting was believed to be limited, in some areas due to customary regulations (Michel unpubl. data, based information from traditional hunters 2009). Currently hunting is formally banned, but poaching is still a major threat to the species, especially where new roads increase accessibility and modern weapons improve efficiency, in particular where military personnel and other armed forces are involved. Poaching became of greater concern in Wakhan National Park (i.e. the district of Wakhan), where border guards and police presence has increased (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2019). <br/> <br/> In China, the species is classified as a Category I Protected Wild Animal Species under the Wild Animal Protection Law (Wang 1998). Poaching might now pose a minor threat, as the government has confiscated most guns from pastoralists living near ibex habitat, although some poaching by police and/or military no doubt continues. Competition with livestock may occur.<br/> <br/> In India, region-wide threat assessments are scarce. Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2015) report illegal hunting by migratory laborers and migratory herders as one of the most important threats across the state of Himachal Pradesh, followed by subsistence hunting by local people and competition with migratory livestock for fodder. Increased grazing and disturbance from livestock are apparent in some areas (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1986, 1994; Pandey, 1993). Livestock grazing may not necessarily indicate competition, as was evident from summer grazing by local herders in Pin Valley; however, large herds of migratory herders were certainly a threat (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2000, Bagchi <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004). The fact that ibex can utilize rugged habitats have probably allowed them to linger precariously in parts of Himachal Pradesh with heavy grazing by migratory herds of livestock (Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>2015). The level of poaching is extremely low in the Buddhist dominated areas of India (Spiti and Ladakh). Heavy military presence along the disputed border between India and Pakistan can cause considerable disturbance to the species on both sides of the border, including the presence of border fencing. In fact, the ‘highest battlefield in the world’ around the Siachen glacier, contested between India and Pakistan, is surrounded by prime ibex habitat of the Karakorum, but is subjected to considerable military activity.</p>  <p>In Pakistan, poaching for food, heavy military presence on the Indian and Afghanistan borders, and competition for food with livestock are threats to Siberian Ibex. <br/> <br/> In Mongolia, transformation of ibex habitat for mining might be one of the most important emerging threats to the conservation of this species (see Tumursukh <em>et al.</em> 2015). The impact of trophy hunting on ibex populations remains uncertain (Lkhagvasuren <em>et al.</em> 2016). Other important threats to the species include grazing competition and disturbance from livestock, and poaching (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). Ibex is probably less affected than argali (<em>Ovis ammon</em>) by poaching and competition with livestock, because of the more precipitous and hence less accessible terrain it occupies, yet both probably negatively affect the species (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). A recent study by Odonjavkhlan (2018) did not find evidence for an impact of livestock grazing on habitat use by ibex in Tost Tosunbumba Nature Reserve. Tumursukh (2013) found evidence for competition between ibex and goats/sheep for forage; however, he did not find any evidence for demographic impacts from this competition. Illegal and unsustainable hunting for meat, trophies and skins remains a threat (Wingard and Zahler 2006), although habitat degradation through grazing by increasing livestock numbers and competition for pasture and water may constitute threats in some areas (Reading <em>et al</em>. 2006b) and increasing resource extraction and mining activities may also result in habitat loss and degradation. Harsh winter weather conditions can also severely affect population sizes locally (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). </p>  <p>In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan the species is hunted by local people based on permit systems, but with a large unreported and illegal take. Informal hunting still seems to exceed official quotas in these countries, although the quotas for domestic hunters have not always appeared sustainable. Kyrgyzstan since 2017 has applied temporary hunting moratoria in several provinces, the effect of which is not yet evident.<br/> <br/> In Russia, although hunted legally under license, many are shot illegally and in large numbers.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","<p>No rigorously derived population estimates exist for Siberian Ibex&#160;in any range state, although Harris <em>et al.</em> (2009) and Lkhagvasuren <em>et al. </em>(2016) provide population estimates for most of Mongolia in 2009. Thus, the total population number provided here is a rough guess. Summarizing all available guestimates for the range states the total population size likely would be in the range of 170,000 to 250,000 animals (102,000 to 150,000 mature individuals).<br/> <br/> In Afghanistan, the Siberian Ibex&#160;was considered abundant throughout its range prior to the late 1970s and a series of wars. Shank <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1977) estimated that around 5,000 animals used the Ajar Valley Reserve seasonally during the 1970s; this population is likely much smaller now (C. Shank pers. comm. 2007). More than 4,000 were believed to inhabit the Pamir alone. Their present status in the Pamir is unknown, but they are known to persist in reasonably large numbers throughout the ranges of the Wakhan Corridor. There in 2011 WCS recorded 2,069 animals in a direct count (1.6 per km²); in 2015, the double observer method yielded an estimate of 740 ±226 (2.2 per km²) (Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017)<span lang=""EN-US""> and 753 ±267 (2.2 per km²) in 2018 (Ostrowski pers. comm. 2020). The Siberian Ibex&#160;occurs along the Panj River across most of Badakhshan Province, but in some districts is exposed to illegal overhunting and population numbers are unknown (Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> There is no overall population estimate in China. The population in the Tian Shan had been guessed at 40,000-50,000 individuals (Wang 1998). Wu <em>et al. </em>(2015) estimate a density of 1.54 (± 0.23) per km² in the Tien Shan mountains south of Urumqi. Densities in other areas are relatively low. Rough guesses of ibex numbers in the Bei Mountains (northern Gansu) are between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals. The species has almost disappeared in the Daqin Mountains (Gao <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species is listed as “Endangered” in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals (Wang 1998).<br/> <br/> In India, earlier population estimates include a minimum of 6,000 in Ladakh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1991a) and perhaps another 4,000 on the south side of the main Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, and in the Pir Panjal range of Himachal Pradesh (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1992). A total of up to 15,000 ibex was estimated by Johnsingh, Mishra and Bhatnagar (1997) in <em>ca</em> 40,000 km² of potential habitat based on rough extrapolations. Counts of ibex in protected areas include 330 in the Kanji-Boodkharbu, 225 in Lungnag, 250 in Rangdum, and 174 in Rizong Wildlife Sanctuaries (Jammu and Kashmir) (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a), and 174 in the Pin Valley National Park (Himachal Pradesh) where Pandey (1993) estimated a density of 2.3 ibex/km² in 1989 and Johnsingh <em>et al.</em> (1997) at a lower value of 1.2 ibex/km². More recently Suryawanshi <em>et al.</em> (2012) estimate a density of 0.37 ibex/km² or 184 (± 40) ibex in 497 km² in Pin Valley National Park; a density of 0.11 ibex/km or 45 (±13) in 411 km² of Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary and a density of 0.14 ibex/km² or 30 (±14) in 219 km² of Lossar area of Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh. Over the past 10 years, these populations have been monitored using similar protocol and the population trends are stable (Suryawanshi, unpublished data). A recent occupancy survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2017) across the state of Himachal Pradesh found that ibex occupy an estimated 8,915 km². They found no evidence of range expansion or contraction in the Himachal Pradesh region between 1992 and 2015. Given these figures, we suspect that total population might not be more than 15,000.<br/> <br/> As reported by Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997), the total number of ibex in the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia (as well as in adjacent Russia) was estimated at between 100,000 to 110,000 animals. Most of these occurred in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (<em>ca</em> 70,000) and Kazakhstan (ca. 17,000) with far fewer (8,000 to 9,000) in southern Siberia (3,000 to 3,500 in the Altai, 2,500 in Tannu Ola mountains of Tuva, 1,500 in Western Sayan and 2,000 to 2,500 in Eastern Sayan) and Uzbekistan (2,400). In Kazakhstan, the official numbers reported by the Provincial Territorial Inspection Services for Forestry and Wildlife of the Ministry of Agriculture (A. Muzbay pers. comm. 2019) during the period 2014-2018 varied between 16,582 and 22,700 (average 20,500). These variations may reflect differences in reporting or methods rather than actual fluctuations of the population size. In Kyrgyzstan, officially reported numbers for the years 2000 – 2013 vary between 34,000 in 2009 and 73,000 in 2000, and are not always fully consistent (summarized information from National Statistics Committee and State Agency for Forestry and Environmental Protection, Z. Kubanychbekov pers. comm. 2019); the most recent official figure was 41,463 in 2018 (Press Service of the State Agency on Forestry and Environmental Protection, 2019 quoted at https://eco.akipress.org/news:1562027). The abundance varies. There are hunting concessions with little livestock grazing and few protected areas (e.g. Ala-Arch National Park and Sarychat-Ertash Strictly Protected Area) with high numbers and densities. In the overall mountain landscape, which is intensively used for livestock grazing and where poaching is widespread, numbers are very low. The population size in the Pamirs and Pamiro-Alay in Tajikistan are unknown, but the species was considered common, especially in the western part of the Pamirs (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997). Numbers had declined during and after the civil war in Tajikistan in the 1990s and recovered only locally. The total potentially suitable area in Tajikistan is approx. 70,000 km²; if applying the lower density margin (0.2/km²) from the site estimates below the total ibex population size might be 14,000 animals (own guess Michel, 2019). Considering that large areas are intensively used for grazing and poaching impact has reduced population sizes, this figure might be more realistic than higher estimates of up to 25,000 (Kh. Karimov pers. comm. 2019). In Uzbekistan, the population might still be in the range of 2,000-2,500 animals, although the southern part of the Hissar Range in Surkhandarya Province has not been surveyed for the last two decades (E. Bykova pers. comm. 2019). Thus, despite local declines the overall population size seems to be still similar as reported in Shackleton (1997) with no detectable overall trend, but possibly declines at least in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. However, it is not clear if this apparently stable or slightly declining population size reflects the real situation or continuity in formal reporting by state agencies and hunting organizations. The continuing prevalence of poaching across Central Asia combined with an increase in the intensity and area covered by livestock grazing in mountainous rangelands over the last two decades leads us to suspect an overall more substantial decline in population size than reflected in official numbers. This suspected decline is also supported by site-level estimates in areas with different management regimes </p>  <p>Few site level estimates exist for the Central Asia region. Jumabay-Uulu (2013) estimated a density of 0.67 ibex/km² in 1,341 km² of Sarychat-Ertash Nature Reserve in Kyrgyzstan. Recent surveys (2018) by Khanyari (unpublished data) using the double-observer survey method put the estimates in this area at 2.26 ibex/km². Numbers in community-based conservancies in the Bartang valley, Wakhan and Northern Alichur range of Tajikistan have been stable or increasing between 2009 and 2019 with densities varying between 0.19 and 1.42 animals per km² conservancy area and an absolute number of up to 2,300 over an area of 2,250 km² (unpublished data of ANCOT, 2019). Michel and Muratov (2010) reported direct counts of 2,476 animals in 8,174 km² surveyed area of the eastern Pamirs of Tajikistan (0.30 ibex per km² surveyed area with substantial variation between areas). Point counts in two sections of this area in 2013 yielded estimates of 0.34 animals per km² in an unmanaged area and 0.57 animals per km² in a game management area (unpublished analysis of data of ANCOT by Michel).&#160; <br/> <br/> The Mongolian Red Data Book 1987 (Shagdarsuren <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1987), stated that 1,000 individuals inhabited western Khövsgöl alone, and a total of 80,000 animals occurred in Mongolia in the mid-1980s (Fedosenko and Blank 2001). Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) stated that ibex numbers declined since that peak estimate of 80,000 due to exploitation, habitat degradation and competition for resources (Schaller 1994, 1995, 1998). Lkhagvasuren et al. (2016) estimated a total of 36,018 (13,840–43,873) ibex across Mongolia. This is much lower than the 80,000 ibex estimated in mid-1980s. In the Khohk Serkh Reserve in the High Altai, the population was estimated at 1,000 in 1979 by Dzieciolowski <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1980) and at 1,200 by des Clers (1985). Tulgat and Schaller (1992) estimated 600 ibex in the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area. In 1989, in a 200 km² study area west of Tsogt in the Altai, Schaller <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1994) counted 337 ibex, and estimated there may have been a total of up to 450 animals. Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> (1997) recorded 1,218 ibex in 623 km² of Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Conservation Park (Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999b). Tumursukh <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate a density of 0.75 ibex/km² or 1,051 (±196) in 1,400 km² of the Tost Mountains of South Gobi, which were later declared Tost-Tosumbumba Nature Reserve. Few other rigorously derived estimates of population numbers exist for other parts of Mongolia. <br/> <br/> Siberian Ibex&#160;is widely distributed over northern Pakistan, but is only locally abundant in the northern part of the country. Hess (1986) found the highest density in northern Pakistan to be in the area along the Barpu Glacier (Gilgit District) with 1.2 to 1.6 animals/km² (n = 194-270 animals, area surveyed = 164 km<sup>2</sup>). Wegge (1988) estimated that &gt;2,000 ibex lived in the Khunjerab NP, at a slightly lower density of <em>ca</em> 1.0 ibex/km². In many areas the species had densities of only 0.1 to 0.3/km² as in the Shinghai Valley, Gilgit District (n = 15-50 animals, area surveyed = 176 km², Hess, 1986). Within the Gilgit District, Siberian ibex was clearly rarer in the southern than in the northern part. The reasons for this may be that compared to northern areas, elevations in the south are generally lower, there are higher densities of humans using alpine pastures, and there are smaller distances between villages. The census of the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP, 1992) gives 2,545 animals for the whole province; in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, a total of 375 were estimated (Qayyum, 1986, 87). Recent surveys by Khan <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a total of 899 ibex in a survey area of 1,895 km² of Khunjerab National Park. They encountered the highest densities of ibex in the Muztagh-Taxkorgan region with an estimated 1.17 ibex per km²<sub>. </sub>Din <sub>et al</sub>. (2011) counted 429 ibex in 1,022 km² of northern Chitral (Torkhow valley). Rahman and Din (2016) in Chipursan Valley (Hunza) recorded 2,085 ibex (0.26/km²). Ali <em>et al</em>. (2007) counted 122 ibex in the Neelum Valley of Azad Kashmir. During 2010-2011 in Nagar Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan Ali <em>et al</em>. (2015) counted 478 in winter and 456 in spring, leading to density estimates of 0.33 and 0.32 per km² respectively. Khan <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported 2,777 ibexes from the whole of Gilgit Baltistan, while annual surveys of ibex in central Karakoram National Park suggest numbers to be around 2,500 ibex.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species inhabits the mountain ranges, isolated mountains, and rocky outcrops of central and northeastern Afghanistan, China (northwestern tip of Gansu, western Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, possibly Tibet on its border with Xinjiang, Schaller 1998), northwestern India (Himalaya of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh), southern and eastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia (Altai, Gobi-Altai, Khangai, and Sayan Mountains, as well as in the southeast), northern Pakistan, Russia (southern Siberia, southern Tuva, and the Altai Mountains), Tajikistan and northeastern Uzbekistan (west Tian Shan) (Shackleton 1997, Grubb 2005, Harris <em>et al. </em>2009). </p>  <p>In Afghanistan, Siberian Ibex were historically found in steep habitat throughout the Afghan Hindu Kush and its outlying ranges (e.g., Spinghar, Kohe Baba, Safed Koh, Feroz Koh, Nuristan), but current distribution is not known. Its occurrence has been confirmed since 2000 in suitable habitat throughout the Afghan Pamir and along the Panj River of north-eastern Badakhshan, in particular in Wakhan, Ishkashem, Zebak, Rushan and Darvaz districts (Simms et al. 2014, Z. Moheb pers. comm. 2017, Moheb <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/> <br/> In China, Siberian Ibex occur primarily in the mountains surrounding Xinjiang, but also in those of extreme northern Gansu, and Inner Mongolia. Populations are relatively widespread in western Xinjiang (Abudoukadi’er 2003) in the mountains around the Dzungarian Basin, including the mountains along the border with Kazakhstan from south of the Irtysh River, through the Kok Shaal Tau Mountains along the border with Kyrgyzstan and into the Pamir along the border with Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also throughout the Tian Shan ranges. Populations occur along the Sino-Mongolia border in the Baytik Mountains (Xinjiang), in the Mazongshan area of northern Gansu, and as far east as the Daqinshan of central Inner Mongolia (Wang 1998). Slightly separated from these are populations in the Altai Mountains in northern Xinjiang, along China’s borders with Mongolia, and Russia. <br/> <br/> The Siberian Ibex has a widespread distribution in northeastern and eastern Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and southern Siberia, where it occupies precipitous habitats in a range of environments from hot deserts, low mountains and foothills, to high mountain ridges. It is found throughout the ranges of the Pamiro-Alay, Pamir, Tian Shan, Dzungarian Alatau, Altai, and Tuva Mountains, as well as the western and eastern Sayan (Weinberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1997; Fedosenko 2001). The species occurs in mountainous areas with sufficient rugged escape terrain and suitable pockets of grazing habitat, but is missing in the wide mountain valleys and plateaus intensively used for livestock grazing.<br/> <br/> In Mongolia, Siberian Ibex are patchily distributed in rugged terrain throughout the western half of the country, and in central and south-central Mongolia to the trans-Siberian railway line (Ulaanbaatar to Sainshand) (Dulamtseren 1970, 1977; Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). More specifically, ibex inhabit the Altai, Hangai, and Gobi Altai Mountain Ranges (Bannikov 1954, Dulamtseren 1970, Sokolov and Orlov 1980, Mallon 1985, Schaller 1994, Mallon <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1997, Fedosenko and Blank 2001, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). They also occur in the Sayan Mountains near the Russian border west of Lake Hovsgol and in scattered populations in the small mountains in the Transaltai Gobi and in canyons, rocky outcrops, and other rugged terrain throughout the Gobi Desert (Bannikov 1954; Dulamtseren 1977; Reading <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1995, 1999a, 1999b; Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997; Fedosenko and Blank 2001; Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006; Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). A small, introduced population survives in the Bogd Uul Mountains just outside of Ulaanbaatar (Mallon <em>et al</em>. 1997, Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006). The largest number of ibex occurs in the Altai and western Hangai Mountains (Harris&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Populations continue to become increasingly fragmented, especially in central and southeastern Mongolia (Schaller 1994, Clark <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006, Harris <em>et al</em>. 2009). A long-term research project on ibex ecology is being conducted in northern Ikh Nart Nature Reserve in northern Dornogobi Aimag (Reading <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006b, 2007; Singh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Peterson 2016; Bragin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017; Otgonbayar&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/> <br/> In India, the Siberian Ibex occurs in the Himalayan regions of Jammu and Kashmir, in the Karakorum, Zanskar and Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh and in the Trans Himalayan and Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh, as far east as the Sutlej river (Fox 1987; Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992; Gaston <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1981; Pandey 1993). The species occurs in the western half of Ladakh, in the Shyok Valley (Nubra region) of northern Ladakh, along the Ladakh Range, and along both sides of the main Himalayan Range eastward to Shingo La (Fox <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1991a, 1992; Mallon 1991; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015). Its occurrence is very sparse east of the Zanskar River, a tributary of the Indus. It is present along the southern side of the Himalaya in Jammu and Kashmir from the Zoji La eastwards to Himachal Pradesh, where it occurs throughout much of Lahul and Spiti, in the upper Beas and Parbati catchments, and Kinnaur in the east, primarily on the right bank of the Sutlej river (Fox <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1992; Pandey 1993; Bhatnagar 2003; Bhatnagar and Manjrekar 2015; Ghoshal&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). </p>  <p>In&#160; Pakistan,&#160; the population of Himalayan Ibex&#160;is currently concentrated within the Karakoram Range, especially in the Districts of Hunza (Gojal Valley), Nagar (Hopper and Hisper), Shigar (Basha and Braldu) and Ghanche (Hushey and Kandey) (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014; Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015; Raza&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). In the Hindu Kush Range, the largest and most stable population occurs in Qurumber National Park and its buffer areas (Khan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). In the Himalayas, ibex habitat is shrinking overall; currently it is confined to Shouter Valley of Neelum Valley within the range that was reported for ibex in Pakistani Kashmir (Ali&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Among the valleys of Gilgit-Balitstan that fall in the Himalayas, ibex exist in the Rupal, Rattu and Darley Valleys of Astore District in Gilgit-Baltistan. In the Hindu Kush Range, the ibex survives in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, especially in the upper Chitral District. It is restricted to the relatively dry mountains between about 3,200 to greater than 5,000 m.<span lang=""EN-US""></p>","Siberian Ibex are harvested by subsistence hunters for their meat and by trophy hunters primarily for their skulls with horns sometimes also the entire skin. Locally the fur is used to produce high-end wool, called “yangir”, but the extent of this use is not known.",Terrestrial,"<p>Within Afghanistan, ibex are nominally protected from human harvest by a nationwide presidential ban on hunting. Ibex populations residing in the Ajar valley (in Bamyan Province) were listed by the Government’s National Environmental Protection Agency as legally protected in 2009, formally banning all hunting and trading of animals from this population within Afghanistan. They are present in the Wakhan National Park (declared in 2014), and the Bamyan Plateau protected area (declared in 2019), which incorporates the Ajar Valley. They are probably very few left in Band-e-Amir National Park (declared in 2009) and their status in Shah Foladi protected area (declared in 2019) is unknown. Conservation measures proposed include surveys to determine the current status and distribution of the species.<br/> <br/> In China, the taxon is listed as Class I in the Wildlife Protection Law. Siberian ibex occur in at least eight nature reserves in Xinjiang (Du and Zhang 2006), including Khanasi and Source of the 2 Altai Rivers (Altai mountains), Tuomur Feng, Bogda Feng, Tianchi, West Tian Shan, and Hami Shan (Tian Shan range) and Taxkorgan (Pamirs). Conservation measures proposed include determining the status of populations throughout their distribution in China, providing additional protection in some areas (e.g., in the Altai), considering others for development of managed, sustainable trophy hunting programs. These latter programs may be useful where ibex numbers are sufficiently abundant, and where removal or reduction of livestock is advised, local people should be provided with compensation. In northern Gansu, livestock should be managed to reduce conflicts with <em>C. sibirica</em>. It has also been suggested that a cross-boundary reserve be developed that would connect to the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia, not only to protect ibex but also other species.<br/> <br/> In India, the Project Snow Leopard, a national level policy for conservation in high elevation area promotes landscape scale participatory approaches within multi-use landscape (PSL 2008). Such a policy facilitates working with local communities to reduce impacts of livestock grazing and illegal hunting on wildlife in the region through the implementation of carefully developed management plans. Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2015) corroborate this by finding that most of the wildlife (including ibex) occur outside protected areas in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Siberian ibex is found in several protected areas in the western Himalayan region (Fox <em>et al</em>. 1986, 1991a, 1994; Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981; Bhatnagar 2003) including: Jammu and Kashmir (undivided) – Kishtwar and Hemis National Parks and Batkal Thajwas, Overa Aru, Kanji, Boodkharbu, Tongri, Rangdum, Karakoram, Lung Nag, Rizong Sabu, and Chukor Wildlife Sanctuaries; Himachal Pradesh - Pin Valley and Great Himalayan (possibly) National Parks and the Daranghati (possibly), Gamgul Siya-Behi, Kanawar, Kugti, Lippa Asrang, Manali, Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah Wildlife Sanctuaries. <br/> <br/> Within ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia ibex are present in several strictly protected areas (<em>zapovedniks</em>) and National Parks. Among these are important areas: Kazakhstan: Aksu-Dzhabagly, Alma-Ata and Markakol, Altyn-Emel National Park; Kyrgyzstan: Besh-Aral, Naryn, Sarychat-Ertash and Sary-Chelek, Ala-Archa National Park, Khan-Tengri National Park; Russia: Sayano-Shushensky and Altai; Tajikistan: Romit, Zorkul, Tajik National Park; Uzbekistan: Chatkal, Gissar and Zaamin, Ugam-Chatkal National Park, Ugam-Chatkal Biosphere Reserve. Hunting by domestic hunters based on permits and hunting seasons exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and in few hunting areas in Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting for ibex exists in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Trophy hunting can be important for conserving the species, as it can provide incentives to prevent poaching, but usually only if implemented as community-based programs. Most such operations in the former Soviet Union involve former poachers and the income they provide encourages these people to refrain from poaching and to prevent others from poaching (Michel and Rosen 2016). Bans of trophy hunting as proposed in Kyrgyzstan in 2018 and 2019 or prohibition of trophy imports would remove such incentives and could result in higher mortality from unregulated illegal use. In Kyrgyzstan (since 2010) and Tajikistan (since 2008) community-based game management led to local recoveries of ibex numbers (Michel and Rosen 2016) in areas where previously poaching had reduced population sizes to low levels (SULi 2019). For instance, in Tajikistan 4 such game management areas with a total area 2,250 km² harbor about 2,300 animals with further community-based areas under development. Hunting and tourism revenues finance the management of these areas, managed by local NGOs created mainly by former poachers. Also in Kyrgyzstan, on several thousand square kilometers community-based organizations prevent poaching and thus support ibex conservation, although so far hunting quotas have not been assigned in any of these areas. Conservation measures proposed include the expansion of community-based hunting management and protection and the increase of protected areas effectiveness with a focus on stopping poaching and regulation of livestock grazing to prevent forage competition and habitat degradation. </p>  <p>In Mongolia, ibex is legally protected as a Rare species under the Mongolian Law on Fauna and the Mongolian Hunting Law (Wingard and Odgerel 2002). No general hunting is allowed, but a limited amount of licensed trophy hunting is permitted. The species is listed as Near Threatened in most recent Mongolian Red List (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006), which represents a change in status from the last 2 Mongolian Red Books, in which the species was listed as Threatened (Shagdarsuren 1987; Shiirevdamba <em>et al</em>. 1997). Approximately 14% of the species’ range is protected (Clark <em>et al</em>. 2006) and it occurs in at least the following protected areas: Altai-Taivan Bogd, Bodgkhan Mountains, Eej Khairkhan Mountain, Great Gobi, Gobi Gurvan Saikhan, Ikh Nart, Khangai Nuruu, Khar-Uvs Lake, Khokh Serkh Mountain, Khovsgol Lake, Otgontenger Mountain, Sharga Natural Reserve, Silkhem Mountain, Tarvagatai Mountain, Tost Mountains, Tsambagarav, Uvs Lake, and Yoliin Valley. Khokh Serkh Nature Reserve in the Altai region was established specifically for the conservation of this species. A long-term research project on ibex in Ikh Nart has been established for several years now, and several hundred are estimated to be living within this protected area (R. Reading pers. comm.). Conservation measures proposed include: 1) Undertake more rigorous population surveys of all populations; 2) Study the ecology, particularly habitat requirements and movement patterns, and the impacts of livestock grazing on ibex; 3) Hire, train, and equip law enforcement agents, especially for protected areas; 4) Begin using the money generated from trophy hunting to pay for conservation and management of the species, ideally using community-based approaches (Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016); 5) Establish new protected areas to conserve additional populations of ibex; and 6) Collaborate better with Russia and China to protect populations that live in border regions. Trophy hunters purchase hunting licenses from which US$800 for Altai ibex and UD$720 for Gobi ibex are theoretically allocated to the government for a quota of 260 animals per year (MNE 2005). Little to none of this money is used specifically for conservation or management of the species (Amgalanbaatar <em>et al</em>. 2002, Reading and Amgalanbaatar 2016), although a small percentage of the money goes toward general conservation activities, such as the budgets of regional protected areas administrations. <br/> <br/> Within Pakistan, Shackleton (1997) reported numerous protected areas providing differing levels of protection to ibex. These include: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Agram-Basti Wildlife Sanctuary (WS), Goleen Gol Game Reserve (GR); Swat District: Giddar Baik WS, Mahu Dand GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987). Gilgit-Baltistan - Gilgit District: Khunjerab NP, Kargah WS, Naltar WS, Kilik-Mintaka GR, Danyore GR, Sherqillah GR, Pakura Nallah GR, Chassi-Bowshdar GR, Nazbar Nallah GR (Rasool no date); Diamir District: Astor WS (Rasool n. d.); Baltistan District: Baltistan WS, Satpara WS, Nar Nallah GR, Askor Nallah GR (Rasool no date). Azad Jammu and Kashmir – Muzaffarabad District: Ghamot GR, Machiara GR (Qayyum 1986, 1987; Zool. Survey Dept. 1986). Mahu Dand GR was created for ibex in 1992. WWF-Pakistan began a hunting program in 1990 at the Bar village near Gilgit (Johnson 1997, Arshad 2002). In 1991, IUCN-Pakistan, with support from UNDP, in co-operation with local people and the Aga Khan Rural Support Program, initiated a planning process to survey protected areas and to prepare an overall sustainable-use wildlife management plan for ibex populations. The program involves hunting by both local and foreign hunters. Conservation measures include: 1) Provide complete legal protection for the species and 2) Establish a proper hunting system involving a management plan for locals, as well as for foreigners. Hunting occurs in areas with healthy populations. This trophy hunting program has benefited the ibex population in Pakistan, and helped many populations to recover in several valleys of northern Pakistan (Ali <em>et al</em>. 2014).</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
22152905,9919,Hemitragus jemlahicus,Near Threatened,A2bcde,2020,2020-01-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Himalayan Tahr is listed as Near Threatened in view of the general prevalence of ‘old’ and ‘new’ threats, often increasing in intensity. There are small pockets with reasonable densities of tahr but vast areas devoid of them. Overall, tahr populations are on the decline, as indicated by sharp drops and disappearance in some areas, and declining habitat quality, ongoing poaching and impact of livestock as competitor, in other areas. It is possible that the decline approaches the threshold of 30% over three generations (set at 21 years) and the species nearly meets the criteria A2bcde for Vulnerable, but available data are of insufficient reliability and area coverage.","<p>Since Burrard’s (1925) hunting account, Himalayan Tahr has been known to traverse the steepest precipices. In general, they inhabit steep rocky mountain slopes, between 3,000–4,000 m asl, with woods and rhododendron <em>Rhodondendron</em> sp. scrub (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008). <br/></p>  <p>In Nepal, various surveys—like those in Kang Chu area (Schaller 1973), Everest National Park (Ale 2007), Langtang National Park (Green, 1979) and Annapurna Conservation Area (Gurung 1995)—reported that tahr occupy various habitat types from open alpine grassland and subalpine scrubland to sparse or even dense forests (tahr winter habitat). Precipitous cliffs break the continuity of these habitats. The best tahr habitat in the Everest region can be described as cliff faces broken by ledges supporting grasses, forbs and shrub mats at higher altitudes (mean 3,863 m, SE=0.9, range 3,260 m - 4,800 m, n=191) and patches of open pine or birch forest at lower altitude (mean 3,621 m, SE=1.4, range 3,300 m - 4,031 m, n=66). Tahr was reported from as high as 5,200 m (e.g., in Langtang: Fox 1974) and as low as 2,500 m in Kang Chu (Schaller 1977). In these mountains, steep hill slopes and undulating terrains are often characteristically interrupted by abrupt cliffs which act as oasis for these cliff-huggers whose presence is often predictive in these enclaves. This cliff-hugging behaviour of tahr restricts its own distribution (Ale 2007) and perhaps limits its group size as well. </p>  <p>Himalayan Tahr is diurnal, with varying group sizes depending on the degree of habitat ruggedness that characterizes particular localities. Group size of tahr is also influenced by the abundance of food and predation pressure. For instance, in Everest, group size ranged from 1-46 (average of ca. 8, n=277), during 2004 to 2006 (Lovari 1992, Ale 2007). The average group size increased over the decade in Everest perhaps in response to the return of snow leopards to the region (Ale 2007). Tahr formed comparatively larger groups in Annapurna Base Camp, Annapurna Conservation Area (13.8, range 1-57, n=134: Gurung 1995) and Langtang (average 15, largest group 77: Green 1979). Both Annapurna and Langtang lacked large predator, such as the snow leopard, in alpine and subalpine habitat, but most of these areas were characterized by undulating grasslands and scrublands thereby providing more plant forages for herbivores. <br/></p>  <p>The prevalence of local hunting may also influence the average group size. In Himachal Pradesh, western Himalaya (India), group size was very small (ca. 1.7, n = 7) with severe hunting in the past (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1983). This may have been reflected in the overall density reported from different study sites. In Everest, the tahr density was ca. 3.4/km<sup>2</sup> (with no human hunting but presence of large predator). Gurung (1995) reported tahr at the density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup> from Annapurna, with no human hunting and no large predator. In the absence of local hunting or natural predation, food can be the principle factor liming the size of populations. In overall Langtang (with no large predator and no human hunting), Tiwari (2006) reported 8.72 tahr/km<sup>2</sup> (8 herds, 218 individuals, in an area of 25 square kilometre). In the Langtang region of Langtang National Park, local density of tahr reached as high as 24/km<sup>2</sup> (Green 1979: 170 in 7 km<sup>2</sup>), where tahr was neither hunted nor its habitat grazed by livestock. On the other hand, Yala region of Langtang National Park, with ten times more domestic sheep and eight times more cattle than Langtang region, reached low tahr density (6/km<sup>2</sup>). In the absence of hunting in parts of New Zealand, tahr attained densities of &gt;30/km<sup>2 </sup>(Tustin and Challies, 1978). Female groups can reach very high densities in New Zealand, with groups of 100–150 commonly observed in areas that have not been hunted (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data). With regular hunting their population, however, maintained a density of ca. 5/km<sup>2</sup> (Tustin and Challies 1978)</p>  <p>Mating occurs from October to January, with it peaking around the first half of December (Lovari, S., unpubl. data). One or occasionally two kids are born in June and July after a gestation of 180-242 days. The age at sexual maturity is 1.5 years, with captive animals living up to 22 years (Smith <em>et al</em>., 2008). Females have home ranges of about 2 km<sup>2</sup> centred on rock bluffs. Males appear to be highly mobile, and outside of the rut are segregated from females (D. Forsyth, unpubl. data).</p>    <p>Himalayan Tahr is known to eat grass, herbs and some fruits. On Mt. Everest, tahr’s diets consisted typically of such grasses and sedges as <em>Carex, Avena</em>, <em>Poa</em>, <em>Trisetum</em>, <em>Cyperaceae</em> and <em>Imperata</em>. (Shrestha et al. 2002): overall, the diets were composed of 47% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 28% grasses and 25% sedges. This was similar to that Green (1979) reported for tahr in Langtang valley (38% herbaceous plants and shrubs, 34% grasses, 21% sedges, 4% ferns and 4% mosses). Green (1979) found in winter tahr supplemented its diet with small amounts of mosses and ferns, presumably because other food is less readily available. The diets of livestock and tahr were similar in the Everest region, but the proportion of woody plants (<em>Rhododendron</em> and <em>Cotoneaster</em>) was higher and that of grasses and sedges were lower in the diet of livestock than tahr. </p>","<p>The major threats in China are uncontrolled hunting and deforestation. In India, Himalayan Tahr is hunted for meat, and there is apparently significant competition with livestock for summer grazing in some areas. <span lang=""EN-IN"">Tahr possibly survive in small patches of steep, rugged forests around the sub-alpine zone, while much of its habitat is lost due to heavy pressure from local people and from developmental pressures. In Nepal, threats come from an expanding human population and accompanying increases in livestock, habitat loss, and poaching. As a result of these factors, tahr populations are becoming increasingly isolated. Besides threats related to anthropogenic activities, avalanches during winters with high snowfall also can be a significant mortality factor for tahr.</p>","<p>No global population estimate of Himalayan Tahr is currently available. The rate of its population change is unknown.<br/><br/>Only a few Himalayan Tahr have been observed in China (Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986). Perhaps, between 400 and 500 tahr, all located in southern Tibet, may exist in China (Wang 1998).<br/><br/>No estimate of tahr population in India is available, however, a number of sporadic counts of tahr are available from across the range. In Himachal Pradesh, for instance, approximately 130 in Kanawar Wildlife Sanctuary, and over 100 in Great Himalayan National Park (S. Pandey, pers. comm.) were reported. Population estimates have also been reported from parts of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary: 70 in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1994), and 110 in the Tungnath region of Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Kittur <em>et al</em>. 2006). One survey between 1996 and 1998 indicated 50 tahr inhabiting Tirthan valley of the Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). Kandpal and Sathyakumar (2010) reported tahr from the Pindari glacier area. A recent high altitude ungulate survey in 2016 estimated 297 tahr (range: 222–565, 0.32 animals/sq. km) from Uttarakhand (Habib <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest several local extinctions of tahr in India (Sathyakumar, S., unpubl. data). They may be close to extirpation from western parts of Jammu and Kashmir. The entire population reported earlier from north of the Chenab River (between Kisthwar and the Banihal pass) is believed to be locally extinct now. Small populations of tahr survive in Bani-Sarthal (Kathua) and Kisthwar National Park (Kisthwar-Doda) (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Density estimates ranging from as high as 19.6 to 25.7<span lang=""EN-IN""> per km² (Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttarakhand) (Sathyakumar 1994) and from as low as 1.4 to 4.6 <span lang=""EN-IN"">per km² (Great Himalayan National Park, Himachal Pradesh) (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999) have been reported from different parts of Western Himalaya.<br/><br/></span>A different abundance index, that is, encounter rates (number/km walked) indicated tahr was less abundant in Nanda Devi National Park than Tungnath in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (Sathyakumar 1993, 1994). Also, the tahr population was denser in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary than Great Himalayan National Park (Vinod and Sathyakumar 1999). A camera trap survey (trap nights/100 days) from the upper catchment of Bhagirathi River revealed higher abundance of tahr in temperate habitat (4.4 ± 2.62) than alpine habitat (0.6 ± 0.34) (Pal <em>et al</em>., in press). In Sikkim, an intensive study in Prek Chu Catchment found the presence of Himalayan Tahr in subalpine and alpine zone, but they were rare compared to other ungulates such as blue sheep (Bhattacharya 2013).<br/><br/>No total population size estimates of tahr are available for Nepal, but there have been several sporadic surveys from different parts of the country over the decades. Bauer (1988) estimated 1,000 tahr for Sagamartha, Makalu-Barun and Langtang National Parks. These three regions obviously support more tahr than Bauer’s estimates, as revealed by relatively recent studies (see below).<br/><br/>Sagarmatha (Everest) National Park can easily support 700-800 tahr, at least half of them occurring in Namche, Phorste, Thame and Gokyo valleys, in an area of <em>ca</em> 160 km². The overall mean group size was 8.5, from 2004 to 2006, with an overall density of 3.4/km2 (Lovari et al. 2009, Ale 2007). Between 1989 and 2010, there was a decrease of tahr by some 2/3, from ca 350 to <em>ca</em> 100 tahr, in the core area of Sagarmatha National Park because of increased predation following the return of the snow leopard (Lovari &amp; Mishra 2016). The recent data are lacking but numbers of predator and prey may have estabilised by now in Everest (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The most recent survey, in 2012, revealed a minimum of 394 tahr from Langtang in ca. 79.3 km² (density 5.3 tahr/km²: Thapa 2012). Green’s (1978) density estimates in Langtang National Park were similar in some localities (6.8 per sq. km) but in other localities they reached as high as s 25.0 per square kilometre.<br/><br/>Tahr has been reported from all of Nepal’s mountain protected areas but there have been no systematic surveys in these parks. No data on tahr are available from Gaurishankar Conservation Area, but in 2010 a short survey on the status of snow leopards also revealed the presence of tahr in Rolwaling valley in Gaurishankar. Their numbers, however, were dwindling (just 12 individuals observed, although with a decent kid-to-female ratio of 0.7: Ale <em>et al</em>. 2010). A recent survey (Devkota <em>et al</em>. 2017) in an area of 124.2 km<sup>2</sup> in the upper reaches of Tsum valley, in Manaslu Conservation Area, revealed 223 tahr (nine herds, average group size of 25, range 2 to 74 individuals; a density of 1.8 animals per km<sup>2</sup>). Earlier in 2012, just two-day observations yielded at least 400 in the Tsum Valley and a similar number from the Budhi Gandhaki Valley in Manaslu (Sandro Lovari and Madhu Chettri, unpubl. data). The recent status of tahr in Annapurna Conservation Area is lacking but Gurung (1995) counted over 500 tahr in Annapurna Base Camp (density of 7.7/km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>A total of 285 tahr were reported from Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve by Kandel <em>et al</em>. (2011). Tahr has been sighted in Shey Phoksundo, Khaptad, and Rara National Parks, in western Nepal. Even though there have been no formal surveys, each of these parks were reported to support at least 50 tahr, according to local experts (quoted in Gurung, 1995). Many districts that fall outside of protected areas, such as Dolpo, Jumla, Humla and Jajarkot, have been reported to contain sparse populations of tahr (Raju Acharya, Karan B. Shah, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>A number of anecdotal evidences suggest that considerable local extinctions of tahr have taken place in Nepal. Overall, conservative estimates of tahr population for entire Nepal may not exceed 10,000 (Som B. Ale, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The potential habitat of Himalayan Tahr, worldwide, between 2,200 m and 4,200 m elevation, is estimated at <em>c.</em> 44,200 km<sup>2</sup> with most areas being in Nepal (that is, 22,455 km<sup>2</sup>), followed by India (20,248 km<sup>2</sup>) and China (1,465 km<sup>2</sup>). Suitable tahr habitat occurs in Himachal Pradesh (8,903 km<sup>2</sup>), Uttarakhand (6,500 km<sup>2</sup>) and Sikkim (865 km<sup>2</sup>), and Jammu and Kashmir (3,979 km<sup>2</sup>).<br/><br/>The current global population of Himalayan Tahr in its native range (that is, China, India and Nepal) is difficult to estimate due to the paucity of data, but it may not exceed the size of introduced populations in New Zealand, South Africa, United States of America, and Argentina (likely extinct). No attempts to census tahr populations have been made from the other countries except from New Zealand. The total abundance of tahr in New Zealand alone, from 2016 to 2018, was placed between 24,777 and 47,461, with average density ranging from 0.06 to 9.2 tahr/km<sup>2</sup>.</p>",Decreasing,"Himalayan Tahr is found in the Himalaya of China, India and Nepal spread over an estimated 44,200 km², however the actual area of occurrence may be much smaller given extirpation and currently unsuitable habitats in between. Outside the Himalayas, tahr was introduced to the South Island of New Zealand and Western Cape Province in South Africa (Grubb 2005). They were accidentally released in Cibola National Forest Mountain (New Mexico, USA) from a game ranch, and in Neuquén province and Parque Diana ranch of Argentina perhaps illegally by ranchers (Flueck 2010), and possibly now extinct from Neuquén (Guichon <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In China, Himalayan Tahr was discovered in 1974 in Quxiang of Buoqu Valley (aka Zhangmu Valley) in southern Tibet (Beijing Natural History Museum and Qinghai Institute of Biology 1977). Since then, there has been no additional information pertaining to its occurrence or status. A confirmed report of species presence came from Tibet’s Geelong-Buoqu Valleys (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1984, Feng <em>et al</em>. 1986, Wang 1998, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014) and Qomolangma Nature Reserve (pers. comm., Labaciren) where numbers of tahr have been sighted regularly in the Rongxia and Chentang valleys.<br/><br/>In India, Himalayan Tahr occurs along subalpine regions across southern forested slopes in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Sikkim (Sathyakmuar 2002). Populations are patchily distributed from south-central Kashmir through the southern part of Kullu (Himachal Pradesh) between c. 2,000 and 3,300 m (Gaston et al. 1981, 1983). They are widely present at similar elevations from northern Uttarakhand all the way to the border of Nepal. Small numbers of tahr also inhabit east Sikkim (nearby India-Nepal border) and west Sikkim (close to India-Bhutan border).<br/><br/>In Nepal, Himalayan Tahr formerly had a continuous distribution between 1,500 m and 5,200 m, but this has been increasingly disrupted by human activities such as livestock-grazing and subsistence hunting (Green 1978, 1979, Ale, S. B. unpubl. data). Overall, in Nepal, tahr inhabits temperate to sub-alpine forests and alpine meadows, mainly between <em>ca</em> 2,500 m and 4,000 m, but individuals at times venture up to 5,200 m. Schaller (1977) mapped fourteen locations of tahr in Nepal, but there are undoubtedly more.<br/><br/>In Bhutan, tahr is reported from the Jigme Khesar Strict Nature Reserve (Tshewang <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Bhutan Government’s Nature Conservation Division of the Department of Forest and Park Services has not confirmed its presence in the country (Sonam Wangdi, December 2019, pers. comm.).","<p>In New Zealand, there is occasional commercial harvesting of tahr for meat. There is a substantial recreational hunt of this species, and adult males (≥4.5 years old) are highly sought after as trophies by recreational and trophy hunters.</p>  In Nepal’s only in one hunting reserve, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Himalayan Tahr is harvested for trophy (blue sheep, <em>Pseudois nayaur</em>, were more sought after than Himalayan Tahr). The income thus generated has been used for conservation and local income generation activities (Karki and Thapa 2011). Two types of revenue have been generated through trophy hunting: the revenue collected by the Nepal’s government’s wildlife department, and money collected by local communities (although not substantiated on a legal basis, so monetary figures are not known: the charge to hunters may have varied from $533–1,333 for a Himalayan Tahr (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015). Locals used the money collected from tahr and blue sheep trophy-hunting for community development activities, for example, upgrading facilities of the local health post, constructing trails, and maintaining a bridge. Government revenue collected from 2007 to 2012 totalled $184,372, a portion of which went to conservation activities (Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Terrestrial,"<p>Himalayan Tahr is not listed under threatened category of CITES. </p>  <p>It is listed as Category I species in China. Conservation measures proposed for China included undertaking surveys to determine the species’ distribution and status in Qomolangma Nature Reserve&#160;(Hu <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Qomolangma&#160;Nature Reserve started the snow leopard program in 2015 funded by Vanke Foundation. The program undertook a large-scale wildlife survey and subsequent conservation projects that included educating local communities about tahr and other wildlife. </p>  <p>In India, protected areas with Himalayan Tahr include: Jammu and Kashmir – Kishtwar National Park (locally threatened); Himachal Pradesh - Great Himalayan National Park (confirmed), and Daranghati (locally threatened), Gamgul Siahbehi, Kanawar, Khokhan, Kugti, Manali (locally threatened or extinct), Rupi Bhaba, Sechu Tuan Nala, Tirthan and Tundah (locally threatened) Wildlife Sanctuaries; Uttarakhand -Nanda Devi and (probably) Valley of Flowers National Parks, Govind Pashu Vihar and Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuaries; and Sikkim - Khangchendzonga National Park (Gaston <em>et al</em>. 1981, 1983, Green 1987; Kathayat and Mathur 2002). Tahr uses rugged forested slopes with temperate oak and pine forests, well below the subalpine areas where it is often currently located. This suggests that its current range distribution may reflect displacement from formerly used lower elevation areas. Conservation measures proposed for India include: 1) extend the Great Himalayan National Park as proposed, 2) establish the proposed Srikhand National Park (Himachal Pradesh), 3) devise innovative community based reserves for the species outside protected areas (these need to include community based protection, tourism, awareness, etc.), and 4) include areas with tahr in the innovative, participatory, landscape level planning and action under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Project Snow Leopard. Overall, the country’s conservation strategy clearly states conserving species in and outside protected areas.</p>  <p>A significant proportion of Nepal’s tahr occurs within protected areas, but its population is widespread in areas outside of protected areas (e.g., the region that lies between Manaslu and Langtang, Bhimthang valley between Manalsu and Annapurna, and Dolpo, Jumla, Mugu and Humla districts). The species occurs in all mountain protected areas of Nepal: Langtang, Rara, Sagamartha (Everest), Makalu-Barun and Shey-Phoksundo National Parks; Api Nampa, Annapurna, Manalsu, Gaurishankar and Kanchanjunga Conservation Areas, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, and Khaptad National Park. </p>  <p>Conservation measures proposed for Nepal: 1) maintain the current, closely controlled, legal hunting program in Dhorpatan, 2) consider a regulated program of low-level subsistence hunting by local villagers, and 3) undertake surveys to understand the increasing fragmentation of tahr populations and offer mitigation measures. The first steps to address this issue would be to begin in selected areas by mapping tahr habitat features such as cliffs (using 1:50,000 topographic maps), followed by ground surveys to validate the species’ presence/absence.</p>  <p>Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is the only reserve in Nepal that allows trophy hunting of Himalayan Tahr along with blue sheep. From 2008 to 2011, Karki and Thapa (2011) reported 34 Himalayan Tahr were harvested: 18 in 2008/09 (100% harvest; quota set by the government), 11 (61% in 2009/10) and 5 (28 % in 2010/11). A quick glance on the numbers harvested indicates they were not so small numbers if adult males have been the only target. It would mean some 10-15 % of the adult male (trophy) population (Sandro Lovari, pers. comm). Perhaps the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation – Nepal should consider revaluating the trophy hunting of tahr on a sustainable basis.</p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
22158006,41783,Axis axis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-11-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Chital is listed as Least Concern because it occurs over a very wide range within which there are many large subpopulations. Although it is still declining in some sites (particularly outside protected areas), at the species level any such declines are at nowhere near the rate required to qualify for listing even as Near Threatened. Historical declines may have been higher, but these occurred outside of the three generation window (&lt;30 years) used for purposes of applying Red List Criteria. Listing as Least Concern recognizes that there are two significant conservation issues with this species. Firstly, current densities are mostly well below what the habitat could support (and have been for decades), and secondly, the long-term persistence of nearly all subpopulations is dependent upon well secured protected areas: anything which caused the breakdown of current effective protection would allow a rapid rise in hunting levels and perhaps of domestic stock-grazing. These are the factors with which current Chital numbers are in an uneasy and fragile relationship. If such changes were to occur across a significant part of the range, reassessment of Red List status would be required: without effective protection, Chital’s population trend would emulate that of Eld's Deer <em>Rucervus eldii</em>, another herding deer of rather open forests, but with a geographic range covering areas without long-standing effective protected areas. Regular monitoring of the status of Chital subpopulations would be prudent for this species.","Chital thrive in a variety of habitats, but avoid extremes such as dense moist (evergreen) forests and open semi-desert or desert. Moist and dry deciduous forest areas, especially adjoining dry thorn scrub or grasslands, appear to be optimal, and highest densities of Chital are reported from these habitats. Short grasslands of the terai, swampy meadows and glades adjoining forest areas, coastal dry evergreen forests, mixed forests or plantations with Teak Tectona grandis and Sal Shorea robusta are also used, and indeed over much of northern and southern India, its distribution closely matches that of Sal and Teak, respectively (Raman 2013). Chital is particularly frequent in grassland–forest interface, edge, and other ecotones (Krishnan 1972). Eisenberg and Seidensticker (1976) opined that dry deciduous habitats with scrub is the favoured habitat, while Karanth and Sunquist (1992) found mixed forests with teak plantations, moist deciduous patches and swampy grasslands to support high abundance of Chital. Kumar (2010) found that well-watered and well-protected moist deciduous forest patches in gently undulating terrain supported high Chital densities. Short grasslands are important because they provide little cover for predators such as Tiger <em>Panthera tigris</em> (Moe and Wegge 1994). The introduced subpopulation in Andaman Islands inhabits evergreen forests (Sankar and Acharya 2004) but native subpopulations are absent from the rainforest areas of the mainland. They tend to be only visitors to dense forests, to those adjoining more open habitats. Riverine forests within the Bardia National Park in lowland Nepal are highly used by the deer for shade and cover during the dry season. The forest also provides good foraging with regard to fallen fruit and leaves that are high in nutrients needed by the deer. Four factors were identified by Schaller (1967) as delineating Chital’s distribution: (1) the need for water; (2) the need for shade; (3) an avoidance of high, rugged terrain; and (4) a preference for grass as forage. Although several observers have noted that Chital occurs mostly in flat areas and avoids hills and slopes (Schaller 1967, Khan 1996), this may not hold in areas where preferred habitats or forage is also available on slopes (Raman 2013, Kumar 2010). It occurs in both hilly and flatter terrain, mainly the latter, in the Terai Arc Landscape of India (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Siwalik hills, Bhat and Rawat (1995) found that Chital preferred slopes of 11–30°, while slopes exceeding 30° were used less. Also, use of south, southeast, and east aspects was higher than of north, northeast, northwest, and west aspects, reflecting the warmer environment of the former aspects. There was no difference in average Chital density in the hills and plains (Bhat and Rawat 1995). A study of coffee estates around Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary, India, recorded Chital widely, including in coffee areas up to 14 km of the sanctuary’s boundary (Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Habitat use varies seasonally, reflecting food availability. Chital uses more wooded habitat during the cool-dry season and early summer (November to May), where fallen fruit, leaf litter, and browse are available. In open grassland and tropical dry thorn forest, Chital density increases with the onset of monsoon rains and flush of plant growth (Mishra 1982, Moe and Wegge 1994, Khan 1996, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). In areas of their distribution with a mosaic of forest and grassland habitats, seasonal patterns in habitat use may be complex. In the Himalayan terai, Chital use of habitats with high grass availability increased substantially in the weeks following cutting and burning of grasses in January–February, attributed to fresh flush of grass growth after the burns and with the onset pre-monsoon and monsoon rains nearly two months later (Mishra 1982; Moe and Wegge 1994, 1997). Similar behaviour has been reported from the grasslands of Bandipur Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh 1983).<br/><br/>Chital easily habituates to human presence, and herds often congregate in open areas near habitation or forest camps to spend the night, possibly due to greater safety from predators and poachers that shy away from these areas (Raman 2013).<br/><br/>Chital eats a wide variety of plants: about 160–190 have been recorded from across the species' range. It is predominantly a grazer but consumes more fallen leaves, flowers and fruits in winter/dry season (Sankar 1994, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Raman 2013). In addition to plant soft matter, crabs (in the Sunderbans; Stanford 1951), mushrooms (in Nepal; Moe and Wegge 1994) and rarely, bark (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996) are eaten. Close to human habitation, rubbish and even human faeces are occasionally taken (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Antler and bone chewing is also common. In Wilpattu, Sri Lanka, all age and sex classes are osteophagous, but such feeding was more common in velvet-antlered males, doubtless reflecting mineral needs during antler growth and mineralisation (Barrette 1985). Chital usually drinks water once a day, more frequently in summer. This restricts them to forest tracts with assured presence of water, even if only widely scattered.<br/><br/>In lowland Nepal, an individual’s total range incorporates a core area of about 32 hectares surrounded by foraging and cover areas of about 140 ha for females and 195 ha for males (Moe and Wegge 1994). Variation in range size occurs with site, season, sex and age of the animal. The basic social unit is a matriarchal family group, normally consisting of an adult female, her offspring from the previous year, and a fawn (Ables 1974). The usual herd is composed of two or more such family units and is often accompanied by individual deer of mixed sex and age-classes. Chital exhibits a fission-fusion system, or fluid group formation and dissolution (Schaller 1967, Mishra 1982, Barette 1991). Group composition changes frequently during feeding periods, during the rut when males frequently join groups of females (Schaller 1967), and while fleeing from predators (Dinerstein 1980). These social groupings of Chital do not remain permanent (Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972). Groups may number up to 150 or more individuals (De and Spillit 1966, Schaller 1967, Eisenberg and Lockhart 1972, Krishnan 1972, Fuchs 1977, Karanth and Sunquist 1992), sometimes even more: N.S. Kumar (pers. comm. 2008) counted 211 in one group during rainy season in Nagarahole and 203 in one group at Pench-Maharashtra near a water reservoir in summer. Measured sex ratios have all been biased towards females (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Pariwakam (2006) observed nearly 10,500 Chital in Bandipur and estimated the proportion of Chital in different age and sex classes as stags 27%, does 57% and fawns 16%. In neighbouring Nagarahole, age-sex categories of Chital were adult stags 26%, adult does 36%, yearling males 8%, yearling females 9% and young 21% (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). Breeding can occur at any time of year but there is some peaking at any given locality (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Heavy mortality of fawns in early weeks has been observed by several workers and fawn survival appears to be a key determinant of Chital population growth (Schaller 1967). Schaller (1967) estimated an annual fawn mortality of 48% in Kanha, Sharathchandra, and Gadgil (1975) estimated a constant monthly mortality of 26% over first nine months in Bandipur, Raman (1996) estimated a mean monthly mortality of 9.7% in Guindy. Pariwakam (2006) for the first time used a rigorous photographic capture-recapture approach to estimate the fawn mortality rate, and found it to be 66% over a six week study period in Bandipur. Further information on sociality and breeding is synthesised by Sankar and Acharya (2004) and by Raman (2013). Over a 10-year time period, Karanth and Kumar (unpublished data) have observed annual fluctuations in the Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole and Bandipur ranging between population densities of 10 to 40 animals per km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>Chital is a prolific breeder, as documented by several empirical studies of the speed of increase by newly introduced subpopulations or in those where a factor restraining subpopulations was removed (Raman 2013 and references therein). In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole. This and its diverse diet and habitats allow high density where threats are controlled. It is even considered to be a pest in the Andamans (Banerji 1955).<br/><br/>The main causes of death are predation, diseases and accidents. Occasionally, stags kill each other when fighting (Sankar and Acharya 2004 and references therein). Predation is by far the major cause of Chital mortality. Older Chital stags are more susceptible to it than are younger stags (Johnsingh 1983, Patel 1992, Karanth and Sunquist 1995). This may be due to their being less vigilant during rut, to their separation from the group after the rut, or to weakening from injuries from conflicts. In Kanha, Chital remains were found in about 52% of Tiger faeces and 59% of Leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> faeces analysed (Schaller 1967). In Bandipur, Chital is the most important prey in terms of the biomass taken by Dhole (78%), Leopard (55%) and Tiger (19%; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). Even in terms of the relative number of individuals taken, Chital is the predominant prey among the three large sympatric predators (Tigers about 33%, Leopards about 39% and Dholes about 73% in Bandipur; Andheria <em>et al</em>. 2007). In adjoining Nagarahole remains were found in about 31% of Tiger faeces, 44% of Leopard faeces, and 50% of Dhole faeces (Karanth and Sunquist 1995). In Sariska, around 54% of the faeces of Tiger and 21% of Leopard faeces contained Chital remains (Sankar 1994). Chital remains were found in about 53% of Tiger faeces in Pench (Biswas and Sankar 2002) and 61% of Tiger faeces in Ranthambore (Bagchi <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Each Chital spends a major portion of its life in foraging, resting, and wandering within its range, with the relative extent of these activities determined by season (Schaller 1967). In a day, peak feeding times are around dawn and dusk. There are usually two major resting periods, before dawn and mid-day (Sankar and Acharya 2004).<br/><br/>Considerable further detail on ecology, drawn from the relative wealth of studies on the species, with each item precisely referenced to source, is provided by Raman (2013).","There are presently no major global-level threats to Chital, although densities are widely below ecological carrying capacity, through hunting and competition with domestic livestock. There were substantial declines and local extinctions, driven by hunting for meat, extermination as an agricultural pest, and habitat conversion, particularly during British rule of India and adjacent countries, and immediately after independence (Raman 2013). Fewer than 20 years after independence, Schaller (1967) wrote that ""...the species has declined drastically throughout its range in India, and is now only locally abundant in some sanctuaries and forest tracts. The remaining populations are highly vulnerable to poaching, habitat destruction, and other forms of decimation"". The habitat loss of the past few centuries means that subpopulations are now rather fragmented. Now, in India, most subpopulations appear secure within the modern protected area network (Raman 2013), but those outside (now highly localised) are under rapid decline due to habitat conversion and extensive hunting (N.S. Kumar pers. comm. 2008). A relaxation of protection can lead to rapid decreases. For example, Chital used to be numerically the most abundant large herbivore in the Wilpattu National Park (Sri Lanka), but numbers declined significantly due to poaching which increased during management breakdown during the civil war, when its meat was even being sold next to the park. Poaching has also risen, for the same reason, in several other national parks in Sri Lanka (Santiapillai and Wijeyamohan 2003). Where not prevented by effective conservation measures (active protection through patrolling and law enforcement, backed up by adequate awareness), people avidly hunt and poach Chital throughout their Indian range (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000,&#160;Madhusudan and Karanth&#160;2002, Sankar and Acharya 2004, Bali <em>et al</em>. 2007) and there are occasional cases in even the best secured protected areas such as Corbett Tiger Reserve (Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Many protected areas are well enough secured that the species has thrived well and, is now locally abundant (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and in such areas poaching of Chital is a more serious conservation problem for the large predators (every deer poached reduces predators’ food base; Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004) than it is for Chital itself. In many other protected areas (especially those with a lower public profile) and for areas outside the conservation system, subpopulations are severely restrained by hunting. For example, densities in Bhadra Tiger Reserve are very low by comparison with what the habitat should support because of poaching with snares, dogs and shotguns, and also grazing competition with domestic stock (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the density was 87% lower in a heavily hunted area of Nagarahole National Park than in a well secured area (Madhusudan and Karanth 2000, 2002). Even though all hunting is illegal in this protected area, protection efficacy is uneven across the area. The Chital is one of the two most commonly hunted mammal species in the national park, partly because various facets of its behaviour and ecology such as herding behaviour and attachment to open habitat allow its ready detection and killing, and quick entry and exit by poachers. It is therefore exposed to far higher hunting pressure than are the ungulates which are solitary and spend much time in dense cover (Madhusudan and Karanth 2002). Poaching is probably operative to a greater or lesser extent in most subpopulations, but at low enough levels that recent decades have not seen, with Chital, the frequent local extirpations from areas of prime habitat of earlier decades.<br/><br/>The most serious threat, in areas where poaching and habitat conversion are well controlled, is the reduction in carrying capacity through competition with livestock, especially during the pinch season as observed in Sariska (Sankar 1994); Chital and livestock are known to have dietary overlap (Raman 2013). The problem has been documented almost throughout Chital’s range but awareness that it is a problem at all remains so low that it is not even recognised as a key conservation issue in many protected areas (e.g. Mathai 1999). In Gir Lion Sanctuary and National Park, Chital population density increased 14-fold from 3.57 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in 1970–1971 (Berwick 1974) to 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1989 (Khan 1996, Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). This was attributed to the rapid and complete removal of pastoral settlements, their livestock, and a total ban on several thousand migratory livestock. Dung densities of Chital and livestock were also negatively correlated in Gir, indicating avoidance and possible competitive interaction between the species. With removal of human impact and increase in forage availability, Chital subpopulations increased, as testified by higher Chital densities in the vicinity of abandoned settlements (nesses; Sharma and Johnsingh 1995). Similarly, in Bardia National Park (Nepal), protection from livestock grazing (and logging) in 1975 increased measured Chital subpopulations from 30–34 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in 1977 (Dinerstein 1980) to over 200 per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in the early 1990s (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994). In Bandipur Tiger Reserve, mean densities of Chital were 11 times higher in livestock-free areas than in adjacent livestock-grazed areas. In shared grazing areas, these Chital densities declined sharply with increasing livestock densities. In the studied grazed area, halving the livestock density allowed an increase in Chital density by a factor of five (Madhusudan 2004). Threats to southern India’s forest ungulates by competition with domestic stock grazing within protected areas are exacerbated where dung is collected for export to adjacent coffee areas. Fuel wood removal may also be at levels sufficient to disrupt nutrient cycles of the habitat (Madhusudan 2005). All these pressures interact to have, overall, a major depression of Chital densities. In Bhadra, following the departure from the park of human settlements and consequent removal of anthropogenic pressures on Chital and habitats, Chital subpopulations bounced back by nearly seven times in fewer than four years (Karanth and Kumar unpublished data). Karanth <em>et al</em>. (1999) earlier documented their empirical observations of the recovery of Chital subpopulations in Nagarahole.<br/><br/>Chital are susceptible to livestock-borne diseases such as rinderpest (Schaller 1967) and foot-and-mouth disease (Sankar 1994) but the current population is too widespread for these to rank as potential global-level threats. Accidents, especially from speeding vehicles, are a cause of Chital mortality but occur rarely within protected areas and cannot be significant at the global level. Many Indian forest areas are severely encroached by exotics such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, <em>Parthenium</em> spp. and <em>Chromolaena odorata</em> (= <em>Eupatorium odoratum</em>), and these are suspected to effect major changes to forest structure (Hiremath and Sundaram 2005): but their effects on Chital warrants further study. Wild-ranging domestic dogs are also likely to be a problem (Raman 2013), but no study quantifying their effects has been traced. There are no predictable threats to the Sundarbans subpopulation of Bangladesh, but as a low-lying area extreme weather events might cause episodic major population removal, as happened with hurricane Sidr in November 2007 (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).","Chital declined drastically throughout its range up until the first two-thirds of the 20th century (see under Major Threats). Karanth<em> et al. </em>(2010) documented an estimated average extinction rate of 45% over the last 50 years in the Indian sub-continent. It is however ""locally"" abundant in well protected parts of its range in mixes deciduous habitats. In India it occurs in 123 protected areas and forest tracts (National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India in Sankar and Acharya 2004). There are some large subpopulations in Nepal (e.g. Moe and Wegge 1994) where the population is probably currently stable and is anticipated to remain so in the immediate future (Hem Sagar Baral <em>in litt</em>. 2008). Thousands survive in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh, and there are a few introducedsub populations on coastal islands in the south (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The reported ecological densities of Chital mostly fall within three to 50 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in India: Bhadra Tiger Reserve, 4.51 +/- 1.05 (SE) per&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003); Madhya Pradesh Pench National Park dry deciduous forest, 51.3 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Kanha moist deciduous forest, 49.7 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Nagarahole moist deciduous forest, 50.6 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Sunquist 1992); Bandipur dry deciduous forest, 20.1 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Nichols 2000); Tadoba-Andhari dry deciduous forest, 3.2 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Maharashtra Pench dry deciduous forest, 5.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth and Kumar 2005); Ranthambore semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 38.4 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2000); BRT mixed deciduous forest, 9.4 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Dandeli-Anshi mix of evergreen and deciduous forest, 0.6 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Karanth 2012); Panna dry deciduous forest, 10.2 animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Chundawat and Karanth unpublished data); Kawal dry deciduous forset two animals per km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Siddique 2010),&#160;and Gir semi-arid dry deciduous forest, 50.8 animals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Khan <em>et al</em>. 1996). Some parts of the well-protected areas in Nagarahole and Bandipur are known to harbour densities as high as 80–100 Chital per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kumar 2010). Humar (2010) observed high spatial variation in the abundance of Chital in the 1,500 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of Nagarahole-Bandipur National Parks, which ranged between zero to 100 animals per km<sup>2</sup>. Kumar (2010) also found that Chital densities positively responded to higher levels of protection, forage quality, flat terrain and water availability.&#160;The highest population densities, of around 200 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, are reported for the Bardia National Park, Nepal (Naess and Andersen 1993, Moe and Wegge 1994) and for the reintroducedsub population in Guindy National Park, southern India (Menon 1982, Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). These high densities reflect habitat and food availability in the former area (Moe and Wegge 1994), and supplementary feeding and low predation in the latter (Raman <em>et al</em>. 1996). Population densities in marginal habitats tend to be lower (Raman 2013; K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). Chital is the most abundant ungulate in Nagarahole, and reaches higher densities in moist than in dry deciduous forests (Karanth and Sunquist 1992). The recorded Bhadra density is low, reflecting poaching and livestock grazing (Jathanna <em>et al</em>. 2003), and the population density is steadily increasing following removal of these pressures in 2003 (K.U. Karanth and N.S. Kumar unpublished data). A study at Nagarahole National Park compared an area which was only moderately hunted with a heavily hunted site. This found respective densities of 65 and 10 Chitals per&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Madhusudan and Karanth 2002).<br/><br/>The Chital is almost completely dependent on active protection. Were this to be removed, the species' status in the 1970s suggests that rapid declines would occur. Even now, a very large proportion of its range supports subpopulations at significantly lower densities than the habitat could support.<br/><br/>The only subpopulation in Europe is on the islands of Brijuni (off Istria, Croatia), but B. Krystufek (pers. comm. 2008) has traced no information on its current status. Information has not been sought for this account on introduced subpopulations elsewhere, because they do not contribute to assessing the species’ Red List status.",Unknown,"The Chital occurs over 8–30°N in India (including Sikkim), Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka (Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). The western distribution boundary is formed by eastern Rajasthan (e.g. Sariska, Ranthambore and Keoladeo Ghana) and Gujarat (e.g. Sasan Gir). The northern boundary runs along the bhabar-terai belt of the foothills of the Himalaya from Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal through Nepal, northern West Bengal and Sikkim to western Assam and the forested valleys of Bhutan below 1,100 m asl. The eastern boundary runs through western Assam (Golapara and Kamrup district as far east as the Dhunsiri River in Darrang district) to the Sunderbans of West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is the southern limit (Gee 1964, Schaller 1967, Raman 2013). Chital occur throughout the rest of peninsular India sporadically in the forested areas (Sankar and Acharya 2004), but in Bangladesh, it now occurs only in the Sundarbans, having vanished from the central, northeast and southeast regions (Md Anwarul Islam in litt. 2008).<br/><br/>Chital has been introduced to the Andaman Islands (India, during 1925–1930; Banerji 1955), Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Croatia (islands of Brijuni; Mitchell-Jones <em>et al</em>. 1999), Moldova, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Ukraine, Uruguay and the USA (California, Florida, Hawaiian Islands and Texas; Grubb 2005, Raman 2013). These introduced subpopulations have not been mapped. Not all introductions have succeeded: for example, some were introduced to west-central Slovenia (from the Brijuni islands) in the late 1940s or in 1950, but this introduction failed and is now therefore frequently reported as having been of Fallow Deer <em>Dama dama</em>. One male, shot on 12 October 1950 and now in the Natural History Museum of Slovenia, proves the identification (Krystufek 1999). Managed herds occur in parks throughout the native and introduced range and in many other areas.","Chital are hunted for food, sport, and a variety of other purposes. It is unclear as to the numbers of captive animals kept within the native range and even if such animals are used to supply the same markets as wild caught animals. Introduced subpopulations almost certainly do not supply the same markets as wild caught animals from the species native range.",Terrestrial,"Chital is protected under Schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) (Sankar and Acharya 2004) and under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh (Md Anwarul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2008). It occurs in many protected areas. Legal protection as a species and a network of functioning protected areas are the two cornerstones of its current healthy conservation status. Subpopulations exceeding 20,000 Chital probably occur in and around a handful of conservation areas within India: the belt of about 3,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;between Koh river and Haldwani including the Corbett Tiger Reserve; the Gir Protected Area (about 1,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); Kanha Tiger Reserve (about 2,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>); and the Nilgiris–Western Ghats sector including Nagarahole, Bandipur, and Mudumalai (about 5,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>;&#160;Raman 2013). Protected areas support more Chitals than do non-protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape of India, although there is not currently such a great difference in densities as with the grassland species (Barasingha <em>Rucervus duvaucelii</em> and Hog Deer <em>Axis porcinus</em>;<em>&#160;</em>Johnsingh <em>et al</em>. 2004). Ongoing habitat conversion trends outside protected areas will continue to increase the relative proportion of the total Chital population that they hold, and the maintenance of an extensive network of functional protected areas will remain the foundation of this species’ healthy conservation status.

Some recent cases have involved high-profile public role models, such as actors, poaching Chital and these warrant heavy court penalties.

By 2000, the marshes had been all but destroyed (Richardson and Hussain 2006). This has included agricultural expansion. However, by September 2005 the high volume of good-quality water entering the marshes from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, a result of two record years of snowpack melt in Turkey and Iran, allowed 39% of the former marshes to be reflooded (Richardson and Hussain 2006). Although reflooding does not guarantee restoration success, field surveys found a remarkable rate of re-establishment of native macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, fish, and birds in reflooded marshes (Richardson and Hussain 2006). However, the future availability of water for restoration is in question, which suggests that only a portion of the former marshes may be restored (Richardson and Hussain 2006).

According to the Red List Guidelines (IUCN 2019), this assessment focuses primarily on free-living (wild) subpopulations that are larger than Minimum Viable Population (MVP) size (150 mature animals), and finds a genuine increasing change in the past five years and since the most recent Red List assessment (Olech 2008); so that the species no longer qualifies for threatened status (Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable) under Red List Criteria A-E per below (IUCN 2019). In 2019, there were only eight subpopulations greater than MVP that included 2,518 mature animals, with no subpopulation including greater than 500 mature animals; thus making this species nearly qualify for Vulnerable C2a(i). Additional consideration of free-living subpopulations that are less  than MVP, indicates that this species warrants Near Threatened status in  light of its dependence on ongoing conservation programmes to persist  beyond the next five years, a very limited number of viable free-living  subpopulations (eight), and a large number of small isolated  free-living subpopulations less than MVP (39). While the number of  conservation herds and individuals in subpopulations managed for  species conservation and ecological restoration is increasing, all  free-living mature individuals occur within active management programmes  which, if ceased, would result in the species qualifying for a threatened  status. The species is not currently in decline but the overall free-living population size of wild mature individuals could decline or suffer extreme fluctuation if current protections are reduced or removed. This is a conservation dependent species and several exacerbating factors described below are anticipated to continue across the current and next generation unless there are substantial multi-national adjustments in management of free-living European Bison.&#160; </p>    <p></p><ol><li><u><strong>Population viability</strong>.</u> There are very few viable subpopulations (only eight out of 47 free-living subpopulations are greater than MVP). Most free-living bison subpopulations are very small (e.g. ~34% <u>&lt;</u> 25 mature animals, ~51% <u>&lt;</u>50 mature individuals, and ~83% include less than MVP of 150 mature animals), indicating that natural selection dynamics are not operating adequately. Quantitative population viability analyses of the eight free-living populations greater than MVP have not been completed.</li><li><u><strong>Genetics</strong>.</u> Mean expected heterozygosity, calculated on the basis of microsatellite data, has been estimated as 0.29 (29%) for the Lowland line and 0.35 (35%) for the Lowland-Caucasian line (Tokarska unpublished). This low genetic variability negatively influences effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>). For example, the largest subpopulation is the Polish part of the Białowieża Forest (462 mature animals), yet the effective population size is calculated as less than 30 (Tokarska <em>et al. </em>2009). Based on the extremely limited number of founder animals, this tremendous disparity between subpopulation number of mature animals and N<sub>e</sub> can be reliably inferred for other free-ranging subpopulations.</li><li><u><strong>Fragmentation</strong>.</u>&#160;Approximately 77% of 43 free living subpopulations for which information is available are functionally isolated by distance or an impermeable barrier. Approximately 30% of free-living subpopulations are isolated by an impermeable barrier (man-made or natural) from the nearest neighbour subpopulation. For subpopulations not isolated by a natural or man-made barrier, 60% are at least 60 km from the nearest-neighbour subpopulation (range 60–530 km). It can be expected that subpopulations at a greater distance from a nearest neighbour are much less likely to see successful natural dispersal or exchange of cows (and their genetics) between subpopulations across multiple generations, thus we can infer further genetic drift of inherently low genetic diversity to be amplified through long-term isolation.</li><li><u><strong>Supplemental feeding and selective culling</strong>.</u> The majority of free-living European Bison subpopulations were restored into forest habitats, which often do not provide sufficient food resources year round for this large herbivore. Supplemental feeding occurs at all eight subpopulations greater than MVP, and is reported for 34 out 46 free living subpopulations for which information is available. Selective culling is reported for six out of eight subpopulations greater than MVP. While supplemental feeding and selective culling are well-intentioned to manage subpopulation distribution and abundance to protect bison from poaching and to reduce conflicts with surrounding land uses, there is concern that long-term reliance on these management techniques could lead to unintended consequences, including unsustainable expense, reduced subpopulation viability, and disruption of the species evolved natural life history.</li><li><u><strong>Conservation dependence</strong>.</u> Free-living European Bison are a conservation dependent species. Though the total mature population size for the eight subpopulations greater than MVP has been increasing for the past generation, there have also been recent incidents of local extinction of other subpopulations (see WWF 2019). While the species is not currently in decline, the abundance of wild mature individuals could be reduced if there are significant perturbations such as a major disease outbreak, or current management regimes are negatively changed or removed. Such major perturbations have occurred previously leading to the species changing from Vulnerable to Endangered status in Red List Assessments conducted in 1996 and 2000. Progress in recovery of the European Bison through large-scale ecological restoration projects will depend on significant changes in its legal status and management as wildlife by governments, harmonisation of policies and activities among agencies at multiple levels, cooperation with environmental organisations, and public tolerance and support of free-living bison managed as wildlife on large landscapes. Cooperation and coordination are particularly important where different nations and organisations have separate management jurisdiction for adjacent land areas within an ecosystem unit in which ecological restoration of bison is possible.</li></ol><u><br/><strong>Red List Criterion A</strong></u><strong> </strong>– Population Size Reduction.&#160;Not applicable.&#160;Over three generations (36 years, 1983–2019), the number of free-living mature animals in subpopulations greater than MVP has increased from several hundred to over 2,500.<br/><br/><strong><u>Red List Criterion B</u> </strong>– Geographic Range.&#160;Not applicable.&#160;The minimum-maximum AOO of the eight subpopulations &gt;MVP is 13,236-22,100 km², and exceeds the Criteria B threshold of 2,000 km².

Quantitative population viability analyses of the eight free-living subpopulations greater than MVP have not been completed.","<p>The majority of European Bison subpopulations were (re)introduced to forest habitats (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, patterns of habitat use strongly vary between different population and are strongly shaped by habitat structure (forest cover) and management actions (Hofman-Kamińska <em>et al.</em> 2018). Preference towards open habitats such as meadows, river valleys, abandoned farmland, forest gaps and clearing is observed (Kuemmerle <em>et al.</em> 2011, Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2019, Zielke <em>et al</em>. 2019). European Bison are mixed feeders or browsers (Gębczyńska <em>et al.</em> 1991; Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2019; Bocherens <em>et al.</em> 2015, Merceron <em>et al.</em> 2015), which continuously adjust their diet with seasonal availability of easily digestible non-grass vegetation (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2019). In winter, bison foraging ecology can be strongly influenced by supplementary feeding (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2011). Non-fed populations usually utilise open habitats and agriculture areas. Farm crops depredation is compensated in some countries. European bison are not territorial and their spatial organisation and population density are influenced by habitat quality and food abundance (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2020). Home ranges of bison covers from several dozen to two hundred km<sup>2</sup>, in relation to habitat structure and seasonal migrations (Kowalczyk and Plumb 2020). Home range sizes of mixed groups are influenced by the distribution and availability of forage resources, while home range of mature males is more related to reproductive behaviour and activity than food-related factors. In many populations seasonal migrations are observed, driven by supplementary feeding or access to food resources out of forest habitats, or having altitudinal character to avoid harsh winter conditions (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2013, Perzanowski <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; Dispersal by male bison has occured up to several hundred km (Krasińska and Krasiński 2013). Dispersal by mixed groups is beginning to be observed in expanding populations, as the result of density-dependent intra-specific competition (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2013, Krasińska <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160; The European Bison exhibits a well-developed and dynamic social organisation (Krasińska <em>et al.</em> 2014). Mixed groups of up to 20 individuals generally, including adult cows, 2–3-year-old sub-adults and calves are the basic social units. Males remain solitary or form bachelor groups of two to eight animals. The size and composition of mixed groups are dynamic and change seasonally, being the largest during rut and winter aggregations (Krasińska and Krasiński 2013). Daily activity is typical of large ruminants and includes foraging bouts (up to five hours) alternating with resting bouts (up to four hours) devoted primarily to rumination (Caboń-Raczyńska <em>et al.</em> 1987).&#160; <br/></p>","<p><u><strong>Genetics</strong><br/></u>Contemporary genetic variability of European Bison is relatively low, being an effect of population bottleneck due to species extirpation in the wild in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century and subsequent restoration from limited number of captive survivors. The entire contemporary species population derives from only 12 individual genotypes (Pucek <em>et al.</em> 2004, Wójcik <em>et al.</em> 2009, Tokarska <em>et al.</em> 2011). Mean expected heterozygosity, calculated on the basis of microsatellite data, has been estimated as 0.29 (29%) for the Lowland line and 0.35 (35%) for the Lowland-Caucasian line (Tokarska, unpublished). This low genetic variability negatively influences effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>). For example, the largest subpopulation is the Polish part of the Białowieża Forest (462 mature animals), yet the effective population size is likely less than 30 (Tokarska <em>et al. </em>2009). Based on the extremely limited number of founder animals, this tremendous disparity between subpopulation number of mature animals and N<sub>e</sub> can be reliably inferred for other free-ranging subpopulations.<br/><br/><u><strong>Fragmentation and small population size</strong><br/></u>Approximately 77% of free-living subpopulations for which information is available are functionally isolated and fragmented from nearest neighbour populations by distance or barriers (man-made or natural). There are only eight subpopulations that exceed MVP, and ~34% of all free-living subpopulations include 25 or fewer mature animals, ~51% include 50 or fewer mature individuals, and ~83% of the populations include less than MVP. Given the small size of most free-living subpopulations, those at a greater distance from a nearest neighbour are much less likely to see successful natural dispersal or exchange of cows (and their genetics) between subpopulations across multiple generations, and thus we can infer further genetic drift of inherently low genetic diversity to be amplified through long-term isolation.<br/><br/><u><strong>Refugee Species</strong><br/></u>When restoration into the wild began in 1952, the European Bison was characterised as a forest specialist and thus the species was restored in forest habitats. Increasing scientific evidence demonstrates that the European Bison is also adapted to effective use of open and mixed habitats (Mendoza and Palmqvist 2008, Kerley <em>et al. 2012</em>, Bocherens <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hofman-Kamińska <em>et al. </em>2019). Recently, the species has been recharacterized as a refugee species, that can no longer access optimal habitat, but is confined to sub-optimal habitats, with consequences of decreased fitness and density, and attendant conservation risks (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012). The process of becoming a refugee species likely started after the last glaciation due to increasing human pressure related to human spread and development of Neolithic agriculture, and was reinforced during species restoration (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012, Hofman-Kamińska 2019). Confinement of an open-habitat adapted species to forest habitats may act against natural selection pressures, entails supplementary feeding, intensifies management complexity, increases management expense, increases vulnerability to disease and parasites, and may increase risks of human-wildlife conflicts when bison attempt to move out of forests (Hofman-Kamińska and Kowalczyk 2012; Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012; Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2013; Kołodziej-Sobocińska <em>et al.</em> 2016a, b, c; Samojlik <em>et al.</em> 2019). Contemporary habitat selection indicates the species’ preference for open and wet/open habitats and abandoned fields over the forests, especially coniferous ones (Kuemmerle <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2018, Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2019, Zielke <em>et al.</em> 2019). As a large and potentially conflicting species, European Bison require large spaces of mosaic habitats supporting the populations year round, with lower human densities and agricultural activities, to reduce potential conflicts. Such areas are limited in Europe. Increasing land abandonment in Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine) creates potentially suitable conditions for species restoration (Alcantra <em>et al. </em>2013), however instability of nature conservation in those countries makes these areas risky. Forest introductions are still continuing (e.g. Bad Berleburg, Germany and Augustów Forest, NE Poland), though recent reintroduction in Romania and Bulgaria in suitable remote mountainous areas may lead to subpopulation growth with less conflict.<br/><br/><u><strong>Disease</strong><br/></u>Knowledge on health status of European Bison comes from limited number of populations, mainly in Poland. While several diseases are known to occur in European Bison, including blue tongue virus, foot-and-mouth disease, respiratory viruses, and bovine tuberculosis (Larska and Krzysiak 2019), they are not as broadly distributed within or across free-ranging populations as the infectious parasites. Nearly 90 species of parasites in European Bison were identified (Karbowiak <em>et al.</em> 2014a, b), with species richness, prevalence and intensity of infections increasing in multiple populations (Drożdż 1998). It was documented that supplementary feeding and unnatural aggregation of bison in winter at fixed locations lead to increased parasitic load (Radwan <em>et al. </em>2010, Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012, Karbowiak <em>et al.</em> 2014b, Kołodziej-Sobocińska <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Adaptive management has proven effective in reducing parasite transmission and risk of diseases (Kołodziej-Sobocińska <em>et al.</em> 2016b).<br/><br/><u><strong>Culling, hunting, poaching</strong><br/></u>Paradoxically for a species with low numbers, some free-living subpopulations (including small ones) are subjected to culling to reduce number, regulate sex-age structure or even for commercial hunting purposes. This policy contrasts strongly with the management of other large mammals which have undergone similar population declines as the European Bison and for which populations are now increasing in response to conservation management, such as the rhinoceros or the Cape Mountain Zebra (Emslie 2008, IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group 2008, Hrabar and Kerley 2013). Poaching plays locally important role especially in small populations exposed to high stochasticity. In the 1990s, uncontrolled hunting and poaching in Ukraine during democratic transformation resulted in a strong decline or extirpation of bison herds (WWF 2019).<br/><br/><u><strong>Policy inconsistency</strong><br/></u>Though this issue was identified in the 2004 <em>European Bison Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan</em> (Pucek <em>et al. </em>2004), it still remains an important concern. The European Bison is generally a protected species in the countries where it occurs. It is covered by EU legislation in frame of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, and included in the Annex 2 (animal and plant species of community interest whose conservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation) as priority species, and Annex 4 (animal and plant species of community interest in need of strict protection). However, across the historic range, there are inconsistent national policies regarding management and conservation procedures, that can concede to habitat degradation, population restriction, and selective culling. Following political transformations in Eastern Europe, uncontrolled hunting and poaching in Russia and Ukraine lead to population decline (Pucek <em>et al</em>. 2004, WWF 2019). Such inconsistency not only impacts existing populations, but also limits the possibility of restoration and population expansion. Large areas of abandoned fields in eastern Europe in recent decades (especially in Russia and Ukraine) (Alcantara <em>et al.</em> 2013) may now be suitable for the introduction of the bison, but cannot currently be considered due to insufficient protection.</p>","<p>This assessment adheres to the IUCN Red List Guidelines and utilises IUCN terminology intended for consistency across taxa (IUCN 2019). For this assessment, ‘subpopulation’ does not infer a meta-population. The Red List term ‘wild’ equates to the ‘free-living’ animals as reported in the EBPB, and does not include the EBPB “captivity” or “semi-free living (e.g. large enclosures)” categories. This assessment also refers to the term ‘minimum viable population (MVP)' as an <strong></strong>ecological threshold <span lang=""IT"">that specifies the smallest number of individuals in a subpopulation capable of persisting at a specific statistical probability level for a predetermined amount of time. This Red List assessment (RLA) uses the occupied grid cell approach to estimate ‘area of occupancy (AOO)’; by counting the number of occupied cells in a uniform grid that covers the entire range of distribution, and then tallying the total area (km²) of all occupied cells; so that AOO = number of occupied cells × area of an individual cell (IUCN 2019). Though the Red List Guidelines recommend using a uniform 2 x 2 km grid for consistency across taxon, we also used a comparative 10 x 10 km grid that better aligns to the spatial scale of the landscape ecology of the European Bison (see Kowalczyk <em>et al. </em>2013, Kuemmerle <em>et al.</em> 2018, J.A. Hernandez-Blanco pers. comm. 2020, G. Wilson pers. comm. 2020), in order to generate comparative minimum and maximum AOO estimates. <span lang=""EN-GB"">The term ‘extent of occurrence (EOO)’ is the calculated minimum convex polygon area size (km²) for a set of subpopulations (IUCN 2019).<br/><br/>In addition to information from the European Bison Pedigree Book, this assessment also considers subpopulation-specific information to assess whether a subpopulation is deemed to contribute to the number of mature individuals considered in a Red List Assessment. A key consideration is whether a free-living subpopulation includes sufficient mature animals to maintain the potential for ecological adaption through the effects of natural selection operating on viable populations. While there is variation in age-class demography between subpopulations, this information is not uniformly monitored or reported to EBPB. As reported in the detailed species monograph by Krasińska and Krasiński (2013), the mature age class generally accounts for approximately 60% of a subpopulation. Thus, for this assessment, the 60% mature age class was applied uniformly to each subpopulation. Taking into account the levels of inbreeding of the European Bison population (described below), Brook <em>et&#160;al.</em> (2002)<span class=""MsoHyperlink""> calculated the MVP of a subpopulation as 250 individuals for a 95% probability of subpopulation survival for 100 years; thus yielding a generalized MVP of 150 mature animals (250 * 0.60). Subpopulation size trend (increasing, decreasing, stable) was assessed between 2015–2019 (as reported in the 2016 and 2020 EBPB). The Red List Guidelines prescribe analyses to be conducted for the recent 10 years, or three generations, whichever is longer (IUCN 2019). For this assessment, generation length is calculated as 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction (IUCN 2019), wherein the age of first reproduction is set at 4 years and adult mortality set at 13% (Krasińska and Krasiński 2013), so that generation length = 4+ 1/.13 = 11.7 rounded up to 12 years. Thus, for the analyses herein, three generations equal 36 years. Fragmentation is considered through measurements of distance (km) to nearest neighbour subpopulation and whether there are natural or man-made barriers to dispersal movement between subpopulations. Additional consideration is given to whether subpopulation resources are naturally limited or if the subpopulation otherwise receives supplemental feeding; and whether a subpopulation is subject to selective culling. Belarus has indicated that, while the&#160;Nacional’nyjj Park Pripjatskijj is reported to the EBPB as one subpopulation, there are actually two free living herds that are isolated from each other (P. Veligurov pers. comm.); and are reported herein as two distinct subpopulations. Russia has indicated that, while the Kaluzhskije Zaseki Zapovednik plus Nacional’nyjj Park Ugra and the Orlovskoe Poles’e Nacional'nyjj Park are reported to EBPB as two units under separate management, there is natural movement exchange of mature animals between the two management units (J.A Blanco-Hernandez pers. comm.), and so they have been combined into one subpopulation for this assessment. Ukraine has reported that, while the Forest Range “Storozhynetske” (Chernivtsi Region) and the Forest Hunting Range “Beregometske” (Chernivtsi Region) are reported to EPBP as separate management units, there is natural movement exchange of mature animals between the two management units, so they are combined in this assessment. This is also the case for the Ukraine Hunting Range “Zvirivske” (Volyn Region) and the Limited Liability Company “Maidan Myslyvskyi” (Volyn Regioin), so these are also combined into one subpopulation (V. Smagol pers. comm.).<br/><br/><span lang=""IT""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span class=""MsoHyperlink""><span lang=""IT""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span class=""MsoHyperlink"">In 2019,  only eight free-living subpopulations exceeded MVP (range 166–462 mature  animals) with a total of 2,518 mature animals (see Table 1 in Supplementary Information).

Lowland Bison were distributed across western and eastern Europe (Węcek <em>et al.</em> 2016, Pucek <em>et al.</em> 2004), while the Caucasian Bison occurred only in the northern Caucasus mountains and foothills (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1966). As a generalist quadruped, the European Bison evolved to utilise open or mixed habitats; and with relatively high mobility in response to environmental drivers, there was likely substantial variation in local abundance and density, including extended absences at local to regional scales while the species was still distributed across the historic range. In short, the European Bison was likely patchily distributed and did not occur everywhere all the time within suitable habitat within its historic range. Extensive forest expansion occurred 12,000–8,000 Before Present (BP) concomitant with reduced open habitats available for large herbivores such as Bison and Aurochs. Humans expanded with the development of Neolithic agriculture (7,000-5,000 years BP) resulting in pressures on bison including hunting and land use conversion to agriculture. The species became absent from most of Europe between 9,500 and 7,000 years BP,&#160; and after this period, recovered or recolonised, probably from east (see Hofman-Kamińska <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the 16<sup>th</sup> century, European Bison persisted in the wild only through royal protection. By the 19<sup>th</sup> century, free-living European Bison were limited to only the Białowieża Forest of northeast Poland and western Belarus, and Caucasus mountains (Pucek <em>et a</em>l. 2004). By the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the species was increasingly imperilled in the wild, with the Lowland Bison becoming Extinct in the Wild in 1919, and the Caucasian Bison Extinct in the Wild by 1927 (Pucek <em>et al. </em>2004).<br/>&#160; <br/></p><strong></strong>","In general, free-living European bison are not subject to extensive trade and use. All free-living subpopulations exist at locations where management emphasis is primarily on protection of the species; with some locations utilizing supplemental feeding and selective culling to manage local distribution and abundance in order to mitigate potential poaching and conflicts with surrounding land uses.",Terrestrial,"<p><u><strong>Population Viability</strong><br/></u>While the European Bison is no longer threatened by extinction, most free-living subpopulations are small and isolated. Small, isolated subpopulations are at risk from random catastrophic events, and also lose genetic diversity more quickly than large subpopulations through the process of genetic drift, which in turn can decrease the viability of populations through an accumulation of inbreeding and loss of adaptive capacity. To mitigate the loss of genetic diversity in these isolated subpopulations, bison population viability analyses have suggested increasing subpopulation size where possible, and otherwise restoring effective gene flow among subpopulations and managing under a meta-population framework, where gene flow can be restored either through the restoration of natural movements between populations or through the translocation of animals (or gametes) among populations (Daleszczyk and Bunevich 2009, Hartway <em>et al. </em>2019).<br/><br/><u><strong>Conservation planning</strong><br/></u>In 2004, the IUCN-SSC-BSG published a report entitled “<em>European Bison Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan</em>” (CAP, Pucek <em>et al.</em> 2004). With the free-living population growing from 1,848 in 2003 to 6,244 in 2019, it is clearly time for undertaking a new collaborative multi-stakeholder conservation planning process to produce an update to the 2004 CAP that includes a long-term conservation action plan with a very strong scientific basis and actionable consensus. Key issues needing to be examined include climate and environmental change, science advances and needs, increased interest in restoration programs involving large mammals, meta-population dynamics, conservation genetics (including the prevailing emphasis on separation of the Lowland (<em>B. b. bonasus</em>) and Caucasian (<em>Bison bonasus bonasus</em> x <em>B. b. caucasicus</em>) genetic lines amongst free-living subpopulations), disease ecology, habitat availability and shifting land use practices, restoration and translocation priorities, human dimensions, integrated <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> management, and European Union and variable national and legal and policy status. The IUCN-SSC-BSG is formally partnering with the IUCN-SSC-Conservation Planning Specialist Group and multiple European wildlife conservation organisations to undertake collaborative conservation planning to produce an updated IUCN CAP that will serve as an innovative, efficient and effective milestone for its potential to empower new initiatives and result in better alignment of multi-national conservation strategies and actions.<br/><br/><u><strong>Science needs</strong><br/></u>There is a critical need to enhance levels of collaborative and comparative science. Enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of restoration activities should include testing of alternative hypotheses about landscape ecology, analysing habitat availability and suitability for optimal restoration designs, and comparative analyses of population viability and potential meta-population management strategies (see Daleszczyk and Bunevich 2009, Hartway <em>et al.</em> 2020, <em>Kerley et al</em> 2012, 2020). Comparative analyses of the effects of selective culling and supplemental feeding will be important for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local conservation management. Also needed are comparative analyses of bison ecology across the historic range (e.g. population ecology, metapopulation macrophysiology, foraging ecology, competition with sympatric wild ungulates, ecological cascades, ethology, etc.), comprehensive disease and parasitology monitoring, and innovative social science that addresses the human dimensions of bison recovery.<br/><br/><u><strong>Adaptive Management</strong><br/></u>Achieving the full ecological recovery of the European Bison conservation will require collaboration of researchers, managers, and policymakers to develop and implement science-based adaptive management (Kerley and Knight 2010). There is a need to institutionalise evidence-based capacity to learn and adjust management as needed to restore bison to optimal habitats that secure the needs of the species throughout the year and spacious enough to maintain viable populations (Samojlik <em>et al. </em>2019). It is very important to adaptively manage for an effective and efficient balance of supplementary feeding and culling with conservation of the full extent of the species naturally evolved ecology. Adaptive management can also serve as a framework to restore large heterogeneous landscapes that include forests, meadows and open habitats for both existing and future bison herds, thereby potentially lowering the expense of supplementary feeding when introducing to suitable habitats; to gain and employ improved understanding of the human dimensions of bison recovery and thereby enhance active social support that includes financial and habitat commitments; and to strive for effective long-term genetic conservation and population viability by establishing sufficiently large meta-populations that link smaller isolated populations across regional geographic ranges.&#160;</p><p><strong></strong></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The species may also meet the threshold for Critically Endangered under D, as there may be less than 50 mature individuals in the wild.</p>","The primary habitat is arid and semi-arid bushland and grassland. In Eritrea and Ethiopia, the African Wild Ass lives in volcanic landscape of the Great Rift Valley where they range from below sea level in the Dalool Depression to 2,000 m (Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Eritrea and Ethiopia, limited observations indicate that African Wild Asses are primarily grazers, but that they will also utilize browse. Typical of arid habitat equids, the only stable groups are composed of a female and her offspring. Females do associate with other females or with males, but even temporary groups are small. Low density and low sociability may be due to low forage quality and availability. In the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve the preferred forage is <em>Aristida</em> sp., <em>Chrysopogon plumulosus</em>, <em>Dactyloctenium schindicum</em>, <em>Digitaria</em> sp., <em>Lasiurus scindicus</em>, and <em>Sporobolus iocladus</em> (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013).  In Eritrea, <em>Pannicum turgidium</em> is an important forage species (Teclai 2006).","<p>The major threat to the African Wild Ass is hunting for food and medicinal purposes; for example, body parts and soup made from bones are used for treating tuberculosis, constipation, rheumatism, backache, and bone ache (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). Limited access to drinking water and forage (largely due to competition with livestock) is also a major constraint, with reproductive females and foals less than three-months old most at risk. Hence, it will continue to be important to determine critical water supplies and basic forage requirements, allowing management authorities to determine (in consultation with local pastoralists) how to conserve the African Wild Ass (Kebede 1999, 2007; Moehlman 2002; Teclai 2006; Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). The third possible threat to the survival of the African Wild Ass is potential interbreeding with the domestic donkey (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). However, there is no scientific evidence that indicates hybridization of <em>Equus africanus somaliensis </em>with domestic donkeys (Kebede 2013). &#160;</p>","In Ethiopia, there has been a severe population decline since the early 1970s. Klingel (1977) recorded group sizes of 10-30 individuals in the Danakil, and he estimated a density of 18.6 wild asses per 100 km<sup>2</sup> in an area of approximately 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. During that survey, Yangudi-Rassa National Park (NP) had the highest density (30 wild asses per 100 km<sup>2</sup>). In 1994, Moehlman and Kebede did a ground survey of the Yangudi-Rassa NP, but no wild asses were seen, although local Issa pastoralists reported that they were present but rare and occurred at an approximate density well below one animal per 100 km2 (Moehlman 1994, Kebede 1995, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998). Surveys conducted from 1994-1998 in an area of 2,000 km2 indicated that there were approximately 0.5 wild ass per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Moehlman 2002). In 2007, Kebede surveyed the historic range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2007) and determined that they have been extirpated from the Yangudi-Rassa NP and the Somali Region and that the only remaining population is in the northeastern Afar Region. The total number of wild ass observed during this survey was 25 in an area of 4,000 km<sup>2</sup> yielding a density of 0.625 animals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. In 2009 and 2010, Kebede (2013) did quarterly ground surveys in the African Wild Ass range and sampled 17% of the total African Wild Ass range in Ethiopia (12,300 km<sup>2</sup>). The density estimate was computed applying D=N/A where D=density, N total number of individuals recorded, A= sample area (km<sup>2</sup>). Then the result obtained was extrapolated to the suitable habitat determined using the Maxent model to estimate the population (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2014). The 2009-2010 survey results indicated that the species’ distribution is restricted to few localities in the Danakil. The current population estimate indicated that this species occurs in low density, approximately one African Wild Ass per 100 km<sup>2</sup>. Current population estimates indicate that the population size has declined significantly (~94%) since the 1970’s and 112±4 individuals of African Wild Asses are estimated to survive in the Danakil desert (Kebede 2013).<br/><br/>In Eritrea, there are limited long-term data. The first successful survey was made in 1996 (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998) and there has been a research and conservation programme with the Ministry of Agriculture and Hamelmalo Agricultural College. The main study site in the Northern Red Sea Zone has had a population of roughly 47 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 1998, Moehlman 2002). This is the highest population density found anywhere in the present range of the species and is similar to population densities recorded in Ethiopia in the early 1970s (Klingel 1977). This is a limited study area (100 km<sup>2</sup>), but recent research indicates that African Wild Ass currently inhabit approximately 11,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the Denkelia desert (Teclai 2006). Surveys and Maxent analyses of suitable habitat are needed to determine the distribution and density of African Wild Ass in this larger area. A rough estimate of African Wild Ass in Eritrea would yield a total of possibly 400 individuals.<br/><br/>In 1978-1980, Watson (1982) did aerial surveys in northern Somalia and estimated that there was a population of 4,000-6,000 African wild ass in the area from the Nugaal Valley to the Djibouti border. Given the area covered by the survey, this would indicate approximately six African wild ass per 100 sq km.&#160; In 1979/82 Simonetta and Simonetta (1983) estimated that there were about 250 African Wild Ass in the northwestern Nugaal Valley and that there were about 50 African Wild Ass near Meit, with scattered groups along the coast in the Erigavo region. In 1989 (Moehlman 1998) a ground survey with limited aerial reconnaissance in the Nugaal Valley yielded population estimates of roughly 135 to 205 wild asses or approximately 2.7 to 4.1 asses per 100 km2. This indicates that there perhaps has been a significant reduction in the African wild ass population during the decade between those surveys. In 1997, Moehlman returned to the Nugaal Valley but was not able to survey the entire area. Local pastoralists said that there was less than ten African wild ass left in the Nugaal Valley (Moehlman et al. 2013). Some animals may remain near Meit and Erigavo, but this area has not been surveyed since the 1970s (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is not known if African Wild Ass currently persists in Somalia.<br/><br/>In summary, the total number of observed African Wild Ass in Eritrea and Ethiopia is roughly 70 individuals; there may be as many as 600 individuals in these two countries, but this figure is a very rough extrapolation from more intensely studied areas. The number of mature individuals is approximately one-third of the population (Feh <em>et al</em>. 2001), hence the minimum number of mature individuals is 23 and the maximum might be 200. In Ethiopia, in the last 35 years there has been a greater that 95% population decline and in the last 12 years the African Wild Ass has been extirpated from roughly 50% of its range (Kebede <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Eritrea, the population is stable and slowly increasing. However, it is difficult to predict population trends into the future. The desert habitat of the African Wild Ass in both Eritrea and Ethiopia suffers from recurrent and extreme droughts (Kebede 1999).",Decreasing,"The African Wild Ass occurs in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and some animals may persist in Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and Egypt, but there is no recent information available (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). Yalden <em>et al</em>. (1996) recorded them to 1,500 m in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Two subspecies are recognized. The Nubian Wild Ass, <em>E. a. africanus</em>, lived in the Nubian desert of north-eastern Sudan, from east of the Nile River to the shores of the Red Sea, and south to the Atbara River and into northern Eritrea (Watson 1982). During aerial flights in the 1970s, wild asses were seen in the Barka Valley of Eritrea and in the border area between Eritrea and the Sudan (Watson 1982). The Somali Wild Ass, <em>E. a. somaliensis</em>, was found in the Denkelia region of Eritrea, the Danakil Desert and the Awash River Valley in the Afar region of north-eastern Ethiopia, western Djibouti, and into the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia. In Somalia, they ranged from Meit and Erigavo in the north to the Nugaal Valley, and as far south as the Shebele River (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The current range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia and Eritrea is approximately 23,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Kebede 2013, Teclai 2006). DNA extracted from faecal samples collected from animals in Eritrea and Ethiopia resulted in the identification of five mitochondrial DNA haplotypes: one haplotype (group of polymorphisms) is specific to the Eritrean population (haplotype D); one haplotype specific to the Ethiopian population (haplotype E); and three shared haplotypes (A, B, and C). These results suggest that there is and/or has been gene flow between the subpopulations (Afrera, Serdo) in Ethiopia and the population in Eritrea (Oakenfull <em>et al</em>. 2002).",The African Wild Ass is hunted for food and medicinal products. It is only hunted at the subsistence level.,Terrestrial,"In Ethiopia, the Yangudi-Rassa National Park (4,731 km<sup>2)</sup> and the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve (8,766 km<sup>2</sup>) were established in 1969. However, the former has never been formally gazetted, and both areas are utilized by large numbers of pastoralists and their livestock. These areas are remote and extremely arid, and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority (EWCA) has not had sufficient funds or personnel for appropriate management (Kebede 1999). In Eritrea, the government designated the African wild ass area between the Buri Peninsula and the Dalool Depression as a high-priority area for conservation protection as a nature reserve. In both Eritrea and Ethiopia, research and conservation programs (Ministry of Agriculture and EWCA) have been critical for sustaining African Wild Ass populations by involving local pastoralists in their conservation. There are no protected areas in the range of the species in Somalia.<br/><br/>The African Wild Ass is listed as CITES Appendix I in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. Populations of Somali Wild Ass are maintained in captivity (Moehlman 2002, Kebede 2013). <br/><br/>Recommended research and conservation actions, include:<br/><ul><li>Ecosystems based and population dynamics research on the African Wild Ass in Eritrea and Ethiopia</li><li>Research on interactions among pastoralists, livestock, wildlife and the environment</li><li>Awareness campaign with local communities in Ethiopia on medicine/veterinary care</li><li>Continued employment and training of local pastoralists as scouts</li><li>Continued education and awareness campaigns on the ecological and cultural roles of wildlife</li><li>Continued workshops and active involvement of local pastoralists in the preparation of management plans</li><li>Post-graduate training of personnel in Eritrea and Ethiopia</li><li>Surveys in Eritrea, Djibouti, Sudan and Egypt to determine current distribution of African Wild Ass</li><li>Genetic research on the African Wild Ass and local domestic donkey populations to clarify the genetic status of the two subspecies.</li></ul><p></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Total population across the species’ range is estimated at over 500,000 animals; if 30% to 50% of animals are mature (based on maturity rates in other zebra species) this gives a population of 150,000 to 250,000 mature individuals. However there has been a population reduction of 24% since 2002, and a 25% decline since 1992 (about 2.5 generations, as generation length is about 10 years). Total numbers were estimated at about 660,000 in 2002 (Hack <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002), roughly the same as they were in 1992 (671,000 animals; Duncan and Gakahu 1992). It is very likely that 3 generations ago (in 1985) that the population was similar in size, so it is a fair assumption that the population reduction has occurred within the last 3 generations. Although it is problematic to compare survey data conducted across time, there is no reason to think that error has changed drastically as the methods used remain roughly the same. Should the population reduction increase at the time of the next assessment it is possible that the species will qualify as VU under Criterion A.<br/><br/>There has been a population reduction in 10 out of the 17 range states since the 1992 and 2002 IUCN Red List assessments. In many countries Plains Zebra are only found in protected areas, with little or no individuals outside them. Lack of surveys outside protected areas makes assessing trends and population sizes difficult across most of the species’ range, but for a species that is considered common and widespread the observed decline is worrying.","Plains Zebra live in all habitats in Africa from sea level to 4,300 m on Mount Kenya, with the exception of rain forests, deserts, dune forests, and Cape Sclerophyllous vegetation (Duncan 1992).<br/><br/>Plains Zebra live in family groups of a stallion with mares and their juvenile offspring. While each of these groups have a home range, the groups join together and move as herds in some or all parts of the year (Klingel 1969, Rubenstein 2010). The home range of Plains Zebras varies across the continent, being determined by seasonal vegetation changes and habitat quality (Smuts 1975). In East Africa, home ranges in Ngorongoro were 80-250 km² in different parts of the crater (Klingel 1969), whereas they were larger in the Serengeti: 3-400 km² in the wet season and 4-600 km² in the dry season (Klingel 1969). Combined with a migration route of 100 to 150 km in each direction, Serengeti zebras cover at least 1000 km² in a year. This can be compared with annual home ranges of 49-566 km² in Kruger National Park (Smuts 1975). In some areas the herds form discrete subpopulations, separated by natural barriers or marginal habitats (Smuts 1974). These subpopulations cover areas from 28-136 km² in Zululand (Brooks 1982) to 1530-1560 km² in Kruger National Park (Smuts 1974). In areas where resources are scarce or patchily distributed, zebras daily cover a lot of ground. In the dry season zebras moved up to 34.5 km to forage in Botswana (Brooks and Harris 2008), whereas in Ngorongoro they moved about 6 km (Klingel 1969); in Kruger National Park they tended to move less than 2 km in a day across the year (Owen-Smith 2013). Studies of zebras have shown how their spatial awareness allows them to orient movements towards preferred forage patches or the nearest water source, and thus move efficiently across large distances (Brooks and Harris 2008).<br/><br/>A central feature of Plains Zebra ecology is their migration, tracking resource abundance across the seasons (Young <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005). One of the biggest ungulate migrations in the world occurs in the Serengeti. At a large scale zebras follow the long grass that grows after the rains (Bell 1971), at a finer scale they move to maximize intake of food of sufficient quality, while minimizing time spent in habitats where they may encounter predators (Hopcraft <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Not all zebra herds migrate (e.g., Stelfox <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1986, Georgiadis <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003), with different herds reacting differently to changing conditions (Owen-Smith 2013): in the Okavango Delta of Botswana only about 55% of zebras make the 588 km round trip (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Migration allows zebras to optimize their nutrition by moving to prime grasslands during the wet season (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), selecting higher quality resources rather than absolute abundance of grass (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). The start and pace of migration is controlled by the environment: it is initiated by cumulative precipitation, with daily movement being a function of precipitation rate and NDVI (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Zebras have the flexibility to alter their migration patterns to avoid adverse conditions or to find new resources (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). As fences constrain many populations (Shem <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), this allows them to re-establish migrations once barriers are removed (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>Plains Zebras tend to be found in mid-productive grasslands in areas where there is the highest green standing crop (McNaughton 1985), selecting areas of the highest grass biomass regardless of quality (Groom and Harris 2010). Across studies Plains Zebras were found in open savanna with an abundance of grass and the presence of some trees or open woodland. The Plains Zebra diet consists almost entirely of grasses (Bodenstein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2000), with occasional browse to maintain protein levels (Berry and Louw 1982). Compared to ruminants, zebras are generalist and bulk feeders, spending more time foraging (Seydack <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Owen-Smith and Goodall 2014), and having a diet that is of lower quality (McNaughton 1985, Ben-Shahar 1991) and higher fiber (30-36% of dry matter, Macandza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013) than sympatric bovids of a similar size.","The quagga was driven to extinction in the late 19th century by overhunting and competition with livestock.<br/><br/>While equid meat is often not a preferred choice, Plains Zebra are threatened by hunting through much of their range, especially when they move out of protected areas. Hunting for their skins occurs, particularly in East Africa as these subspecies do not have the shadow stripe present in southern African subspecies (Foley <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Fencing areas can block migration corridors (Foley <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014), although Plains Zebras have been shown to re-establish migration routes if barriers are removed, even if they are blocked for over 30 years (Bartlam-Brooks <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011).","Plains Zebra are considered common and widespread across Africa, but there has been a population decline in 10 out of the 17 range states since the 1992 and 2002 IUCN Red List assessments. In many countries Plains Zebra are only found in protected areas, with little or no individuals outside them. Lack of surveys outside protected areas makes assessing trends and population sizes difficult across most of the species’ range. <br/><br/>Total population across the species’ range is estimated at over 500,000 animals; if 30% to 50% of animals are mature (based on maturity rates in other zebra species) this gives a population of 150,000 to 250,000 mature individuals. Total numbers were estimated at about 660,000 in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002), roughly the same as they were in 1992 (671,000 animals; Duncan and Gakahu 1992). This represents a population reduction of 24% since 2002, and a 25% decline since 1992 (about 2.5 generations, as generation length is about 10 years). It is very likely that 3 generations ago (in 1985) that the population was similar in size to numbers given in 1992, so it is a fair assumption that the population reduction has occurred within the last 3 generations. The exact number of Plains Zebra is unknown due to different survey methods applied across their range, and many areas having no recent survey data. This makes comparison of survey data problematic. In the country specific data below confidence intervals or other range descriptors are given when available, but most accounts do not provide this information. However when comparing data over the past few generations any error in calculating total population size is likely to have remained constant, as intensity and accuracy of surveys are unlikely to have greatly improved. <br/><br/>Overall, populations in Ethiopia, Malawi, and South Africa appear stable; they are possibly stable in Angola (they were considered likely extinct here in the 2002 assessment); in Mozambique they are stable or increasing; in Namibia and Swaziland populations are increasing; but in Botswana, Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe populations are declining (Table 1). Of particular concern is that decline is being seen in Kenya and Tanzania, where the species is most numerous. However the world's largest single Plains Zebra population in Serengeti National Park appears stable. <br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/><br/>The Plains Zebra population in Angola has declined drastically since the 1960s and 1970s and has been extirpated from most of its former range in the country. Plains Zebra has likely been eliminated from Iona National Park (NP), and is probably extinct elsewhere along the coastal plain and neighboring regions of southwestern Angola (Pedro Vaz Pinto and Luis Verissimo pers. comm. 2015). Recent anecdotal reports of the species presence in Bikuar NP need confirmation. Plains Zebra remain extant in small groups in a trans-boundary population in Luengue-Luiana NP, due to animals moving from Bwabwata National Park in Namibia and there is a possibility of its presence elsewhere in southeast Kuando Cubango province (Pedro Vaz Pinto and Luis Verissimo pers. comm. 2015). Population size in the country is unknown.<br/><br/><strong>Botswana</strong><br/><br/>Nationwide total is about 99,500 Plains Zebra from a stratified sample count in 2012 (Botswana DWNP unpublished data). While the population is increasing significantly in Ngamiland and Central Botswana, there is a non-significant decreasing trend in Chobe, with no information on trends for the smaller populations in Ghanzi and the north-east and southern parts of the country. Countrywide the species was considered stable (or increasing non-significantly) in 2012, and has increased from about 35,000 in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong><br/><br/>A 2008 survey recorded 62 Plains Zebra in Upemba NP, but none in Kunedelungu NP (Vanleeuwe 2009). This indicates a decline in the Congo population as &lt;1,000 were reported in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Ethiopia</strong><br/><br/>The 2014 nationwide population was about 7,500 zebra (F. Kebede, EWCA, unpublished data). This population overall appears stable since 2002. The population in Omo NP-Mago NP-Tama WR was estimated as 1,630 from a 1997 aerial survey (F. Kebede pers. comm.<em><em><em><em><em><em></em></em></em></em></em></em>), decreasing to 1,000 in a 2014 informed estimate. The Nechisar NP population remains stable at about 3,000 animals in both 1995 and 2014 (C. Zewdie and G. Wondimu, EWCO, unpublished data), and the Yabello WS (now Borena NP) population increased from 2,840 in a 1995 aerial survey (Thouless 1995) to an informed estimate of 3,500 in 2014 (F. Kebede unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Kenya</strong><br/><br/>While Plains Zebra remain numerous in Kenya the population appears to be declining. In 1995 the population was estimated as 152,490 from aerial surveys (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002); in surveys from 2008-2015 the population is estimated at only 98,820 animals (Kenya Wildlife Service 2015 unpublished data). This represents a decline of 35% in 20 years. Plains Zebra have been extirpated (or nearly so) from some protected areas (e.g. Kora NP and Sibilo NP; Thomas Butynski pers. comm. 2015), while in other areas densities remain high. Only about 10% of Plains Zebra are on protected lands in Kenya (Grunblatt <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1995), meaning that protection for zebras outside these areas is vital.<br/><br/>Plains Zebra populations have declined in Maasai Mara Nature Reserve (MMNR) and nearby ranches from wet season numbers as high as 60,764 ± 18201 in 1978 to 38,560 ± 10,935 in 2007 (Ogutu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011), although 2014 Kenya Wildlife Service aerial survey data indicated a population of 42,126. This represents the largest population in Kenya. Zebra tended not to be resident in MMNR during the wet season (December to May) although they remained in surrounding ranches. Fewer zebra now migrate in to the Mara region during the dry season, despite few changes in the source population in the Serengeti (Ogutu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In 1995 the Laikipia Plains Zebra population was considered to be increasing (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002). Surveys conducted in 2001 and 2012 found a 9.6% reduction from 27,544 to 24,887±5,853 indicating that the population is roughly stable (Kinnaird <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Plains Zebra are the most abundant wildlife species in this area, yet like all wildlife are experiencing a decline since the 1980s.<br/><br/><strong>Malawi</strong><br/><br/>Aerial surveys from 2012 to 2015 report about 748 zebra in protected areas in Malawi. The largest population in Majete WR increased from 262 in 2012 to 571 in 2015 (D. Macpherson pers. comm. 2015). The second largest population in Nyika NP declined from 279 in 2013 to 153 in 2015 (Macpherson 2013 and pers. comm.). Vwaza Marsh WR, Kasungu NP and Liwonde NP each have less than 20 (D. Macpherson pers. comm. 2015). There are also small populations of Plains Zebra at three or four game ranches in Malawi.<br/><br/><strong>Mozambique</strong><br/><br/>Plains Zebra were likely eradicated from south-western Mozambique during 22 years of war (1964-1974; 1980-1992). Between 2002 and 2008, 1361 zebra were (re-)introduced to the western section of the newly created Limpopo National Park (LNP), from the adjoining Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa. Subsequent aerial surveys (2010, 2013) indicate a sharp reduction in zebra abundances in LNP and restriction of zebra distribution to the western boundary. Recent ground surveys (2014) documented natural range expansion of zebra into central LNP. Illegal hunting is widespread in LNP and may explain reduced zebra abundances. Zebra were not detected in Banhine National Park during 2004, 2007, 2009 and 2014 surveys.<br/><br/>The country-wide total is about 3,400 zebras in Mozambique. The population estimate from aerial surveys in Limpopo NP has declined from 494 in 2010 to 183 in 2013 due to illegal hunting (Kristoffer Everatt pers. comm. 2015). The population in Niassa Reserve is stable, with numbers remaining around 3,000 between the aerial survey in 1998 which estimated 2,854 zebras (1852-3855) and in 2014 which estimated 3,197 (2400-3994), although an anomalous survey in 2009 recorded 6,229 (5033-4672) possibly due to better observers that year (Colleen Begg pers. comm. 2015). Plains Zebras are present in Magoe in Tete province, but no longer present in Banhina NP (2004-2014). Fourteen Plains Zebra were reintroduced to Gorongosa NP in 2012, but only one foal had been produced by 2015 (Marcelino Denja pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Namibia</strong><br/><br/>There are about 40,000 Plains Zebras in Namibia, with an estimated increasing trend due to populations on private/freehold land. Legislative changes during the 1960s-1970s in Namibia giving landowners user rights to wildlife has led to an increase in the populations of Hartmann’s mountain zebra, and has benefitted Plains Zebra as well. An aerial survey of Etosha NP in 2012 estimated 16,174 Plains Zebra, with an aerial survey of the north-east (Kavango East and Zambezi) estimating 1,421 Plains Zebras (Kenneth Uiseb, Namibia MET, unpublished data). In 2014, aerial surveys of the Zambezi Region (including Bwabwata, Mudumu and Nkasa Lupara national parks and communal conservancies) and Mangetti NP estimated 5,435 and 140 zebras respectively (Kenneth Uiseb, Namibia MET, unpublished data). It should be noted that the 950-2037 zebras in Bwabwata NP are the same population that has some animals moving in to Angola. The total number of Plains Zebra on private land is unknown, but is between 19,000 and 25,000 (Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Rwanda</strong><br/><br/>The only data on Plains Zebra from Rwanda are from a 2013 aerial survey that estimated 999 Plains Zebra in Akagera National Park (African Parks website). It is unlikely that there are many Plains Zebra outside this protected area.<br/><br/><strong>South Africa</strong><br/><br/>The Plains Zebra was assessed as Least Concern in the South African National Red List as the species remains widespread, common, and there are no major threats resulting in a range-wide population decline (Stears <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015). The population is stable, consisting of at least 46,000 animals; in 2002 there were over 55,000 Plains Zebras estimated in the country (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002). Kruger National Park has around 70% of the free-roaming population in South Africa with 29,000-43,450 individuals in 2012. This is the only South African population that is migratory. Plains Zebras are also present in the northern KwaZulu-Natal, and in Limpopo, North West, Free State and Northern Cape provinces, with large numbers on private land (9,411 individuals and 3,232 individuals on private land in the North West and Free State provinces respectively).<br/><br/><strong>South Sudan</strong><br/><br/>In 1980 there were 24,078 in the wet season and 29,460 in the dry season in Boma NP, and 3,889 in the wet season and 4,533 in the dry season in Jonglei National Park (Fay <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). A 2007 aerial survey saw a small group of Plains Zebra in Boma, and none in Jonglei (Fay <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). In 2007, 2008 and 2009 a few small group of Plains Zebra were seen during aerial surveys, and in 2013 there was an unconfirmed report of Plains Zebra from a charter plane pilot, but otherwise no Plains Zebras have been seen in South Sudan in recent years (Paul Elkan pers. comm. 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Swaziland</strong><br/><br/>There are about 2,900 Plains Zebras in Swaziland (Mickey Reilly unpublished data 2015). In the Kingdom of Swaziland’s Big Game Parks there are about 1,250: 320 recorded from an aerial count in Mkhaya in 2014, 850 estimated in Hlane, and about 80 estimated in Milwane. In Government parks there are about 185, and up to 800 on private land (although this is likely an over-estimate; Mickey Reilly unpublished data 2015). This represents an increase compared to 1000 Plains Zebra reported in Swaziland in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Tanzania</strong><br/><br/>Plains Zebras are still widespread and common in Tanzania with a population of over 260,000 (±20-30%) animals, however all but three populations appear to be declining (TAWIRI/NCAA unpublished data 2015), and the species is restricted to protected areas. The populations in the Serengeti Ecosystem and the Ngorongoro Crater appear stable, with 207,166 ±37,638 in a 2010 aerial survey of the Serengeti, and 4,942 in a total count of Ngorongoro Crater (Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority Ecological Monitoring Program, NEMP). The Serengeti population is the largest within the species’ range, and contains 42% of all wild Plains Zebras. The West Kilimanjaro population is possibly stable, with 1,632 in a 2013 total count. All other populations are declining or have an unknown trend. The Tarangire Manyara ecosystem population dropped from 33,330 ± 1,254 in 2004 to 15,662 ± 5,118 in 2011 (CIMU unpublished data), with other populations having a similar level of decline.<br/><br/><strong>Uganda</strong><br/><br/>There are 425 ± 636 Plains Zebras in Uganda, almost all in the Kidepo landscape (Wanyama <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Of these zebras, 154 are in Kidepo National Park, representing a decline from 651 in 1971 (Wanyama <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Some Plains Zebras are also present in Lake Mburo National Park. It is unlikely that there are any Plains Zebras outside the protected areas (Julian Fennessy pers. comm. 2015). Plains Zebras are now locally extinct in Pian Upe Wildlife Reserve, from over 2,000 in 1968 (Zwick <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998). No Plains Zebras were seen in Murchison Falls or Queen Elizabeth National Parks in a 2014 survey (Wanyama <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This represents a severe decline in this country from over 3,000 in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Zambia</strong><br/><br/>There are between 8,000 and 16,000 Plains Zebra in Zambia, with populations declining in most protected areas (Peter Lindsay pers. comm. 2015). These zebras consist of about 9,400 in the protected area network, and over 2,000 on game ranches (Lindsay <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, 2014). There may have been a decline from over 18,000 Plains Zebra in 2002 (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/><strong>Zimbabwe</strong><br/><br/>There are over 4,000 Plains Zebras in Zimbabwe. In Hwange 2,155 were reported in 1999, and 1,685 ± 26 in Gonarezhou National Park in 2013 (Dunham <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). This latter population is thought to be increasing. Plains Zebra also occur in other protected areas and outside these areas in Zimbabwe, but we do not have the survey data to assess how many.",Decreasing,"Plains Zebra range from South Sudan and southern Ethiopia, east of the Nile River, to southern Angola and northern Namibia and northern South Africa (formerly ranging south of the Orange and Vaal Rivers to the Cape) (Hack <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Klingel 2013). They are now extinct in two countries in which they formerly occurred: Burundi and Lesotho, and are likely to be extinct in Somalia.&#160;<br/><br/>The six morphologically defined subspecies are distributed as follows (following Groves and Bell 2004):<br/><br/><em>E. q. crawshaii&#160;</em>(Crawshay’s Zebra) occurs in Zambia, east of the Luangwa River, Malawi, south-eastern Tanzania from Lake Rukwa east to Mahungoi, and Mozambique as far south as the Gorongoza district; <br/><br/><em>E. q. borensis</em> ranges in north-west Kenya, from Guas ngishu and Lake Baringo, to the Karamoja district of Uganda and south-east South Sudan, east of the Nile River to the northern limit of the species at 32°N; <br/><br/><em>E. q. boehmi</em> (Grant’s Zebra or Boehm's Zebra) is found in Zambia, west of the Luangwa River, west to Kariba, Shaba Province of DR Congo north to Kibanzao Plateau; Tanzania north from Nyangaui and Kibwezi into south-west Uganda, south-west Kenya as far as Sotik, and east Kenya, east of the Rift Valley, into southern Ethiopia and perhaps to the Juba River in Somalia.<br/><br/><em>E. q. chapmani</em> (Chapman's Zebra) ranges from north-east South Africa, from about 24°S, 31°E, north to Zimbabwe, west into Botswana at about 19°S, 24°E, the Caprivi Strip in Namibia, and southeastern Angola (east of the Cubango river);<br/><br/><em>E. q. burchellii</em> (Burchell's Zebra) formerly occurred north of the Vaal/Orange Rivers, extending north-west via southern Botswana to Etosha National Park and the Kaokoveld, south-east to KwaZulu-Natal and Swaziland, and in southwestern Angola. It is now extinct in the middle of its range. <em>E. b. antiquorum</em> is now included in this subspecies;<br/><br/><em>E. q. quagga</em> (Quagga) occurred in the former Cape Province, south of the Orange and Vaal Rivers and west of the Drakensberg.

45173636,21472,Tapirus indicus,Endangered,A2bcd+3bcd; C1,2016,2014-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is listed as Endangered due to a past and ongoing population decline estimated from loss of available habitat, fragmentation of remaining habitat and increasing loss of individuals due to hunting, road-kills and bi-catches by snare hunters. Population declines are estimated to have been greater than 50% in the past three generations (36 years) driven primarily by large scale conversion of tapir habitat to palm oil plantations and other human dominated land-use. The rate of reduction in population is inferred to be proportional to the reduction of the tropical rainforest area in southeast Asia over the same period. However the population decline is estimated to be even higher due to indirect threats (roads, hunting). Furthermore there are estimated to be less than 2,500 mature individuals remaining, with an estimated continuing decline of at least 20% in the next two generations (24 years).<br/><br/>Most remaining populations are isolated in existing protected areas and forest fragments, which are discontinuous and offer little ability for genetic exchange for these browsers. This situation is particularly relevant for the Thai/Myanmar populations and to a lesser extent for the Southern Thailand and Malaysia landscape.<br/><br/>This situation is expected to continue at a slightly diminishing rate in the future as non-protected areas, which are available as logging concessions, become less available. Because hunting seems to be increasing for tapir throughout the range - this could be cause for concern in the future as already reduced and isolated subpopulations would be at great risk for extirpation.<br/><br/>Threats due to habitat destruction and hunting in Myanmar/Thailand appear to be minimal, because most of the population occurs in well protected national parks and reserves. The main threat to the Thailand/Myanmar population is likely related to negative effects of inbreeding in small isolated populations. The situation is similar in Malaysia, although the population sustains a higher risk of habitat fragmentation and, subsequently, inbreeding risks as well as increased changes of mortal displacement. Despite having developed a National Tapir Action Plan (2013) the decline of the Sumatra population has not yet been arrested, and it remains under serious threat from habitat destruction and accidental capture in illegally set snares.</p>","<p><em>T. indicus</em> is restricted to tropical moist forest areas and occurs in both primary and secondary forest and wetland areas. The more seasonal climate in northern Myanmar, northern (= most of non-peninsula) Thailand, Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia and the harsher dry season of the forest (even in evergreen areas, excepting the eastern flanks and adjacent Vietnamese lowlands of the Annamite chain) there is likely to be the main reason this species is not found there. The Malay Tapir is also predominantly found in the lowlands and the lower montane zone in some parts of the range, although it remains common to the highest peaks in its Thai range (Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also recorded frequently above 1,600 m in Taman Negara National Park and Krau Wildlife Reserve, Malaysia, as well as at 2,000 m in Kerinci Sebelat National Park, Sumatra (Holden <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>Malay Tapirs are solitary animals that are usually nocturnal (Traeholt and Sanusi 2009, Traeholt unpubl. data). It is a browser that feeds on more than 380 different species, often breaking 8-10 m tall trees to access the leaves (Simpson <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are not considered good seed disperser because they tend to chew all seeds and browse consumed (Campos-Arceiz <em>et al.</em> 2012, Zainuddin <em>et al.</em> 2000). It gives birth to one calf after 11-13 months gestation period, with the calf remaining with the female for up to two years. The World’s first and only twin-birth record of a Malay tapir took place in Sg Dusun Tapir Conservation Centre, Malaysia, in 2009 (DWNP unpubl. data), however twin birth has never been recorded in the wild. The time between the births of the calves was 12.5 days, which suggests that Malay tapir may have the ability for delayed pregnancy.</p>","<p><em>Tapirus indicus</em> is threatened throughout most of its range. The primary threats to the species are large scale deforestation and increasingly, hunting. Tapir population have declined by well over 50% in Thailand and Malaysia, whereas it is suspected to be slightly less than 50% in Sumatra. The main reason for declines in the past is habitat conversion, with large tracts land being converted into palm oil plantations. However, increasingly as other large 'prey"" species decline in the area hunters are beginning to look towards tapir as a food source.<br/><br/>Destruction of habitat is the main threat to the species throughout its entire range. Whereas recent research suggests that tapirs are not necessarily affected negatively by illegal logging activities (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2012, Traeholt unpubl. data) forest conservation to monocrop plantations such as palm oil has devastating effects on tapirs. Magintan <em>et al.</em> (2012) recorded a strong correlation between the increases in road-kills and plantation development. In Thailand, most remaining intact forest now lies within protected areas, with mostly degraded lands outside. Myanmar's protected areas make up approx. 5% of land area (Shwe) and most tapir habitat lies outside these protected areas. Large-scale habitat destruction has continued in Sumatra, and most remaining habitat in central Sumatra is outside protected areas (Novarino). The population decline in Sumatra is believed to be caused primarily because of the onslaught on suitable habitat. However, the rate of decline seems to diminish during the 2010-2014 period compared to the 2004-2009 period. It is likely correlated with the increasing Global demand for “sustainably” produced palm oil, as well as a US$ 1 Billion REDD-grant provided by&#160; Norway to Indonesia.<br/><br/><em>Tapirus indicus</em> are shy animals and appear to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation.  In Halabala Wildlife Sanctuary on the Thai-Malaysia border, Kaewsirisuk (2001) found that the species does not venture within a few hundred meters of forest-plantation edges.  At Khao Sok National Park, tapirs are interior forest species that avoid forest edges (Lynam 1996). Kawanishi (2002), however, found in Taman Negara, the largest national park in Malaysia, that although the human traffic level was heavier in area closer to the park boundary, tapirs showed no edge effects.  While forest loss continues in Thailand, forests in protected areas remain relatively stable in size and composition to other countries because of a ban on commercial logging that has been in place since 1989.  For this reason, while tapirs may indeed be threatened in general by forest loss, populations in Thailand and Malaysia are probably more stable. <br/><br/>In Malaysia the current forestry trend seems to be stabilized at approx. 43% remaining forest cover (57% lost), of which at least half can be considered tapir habitat. In Thailand, 40% of the remaining forest is outside protected areas and only 5% of Myanmar's land area is protected forest (Lynam pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The species has uncertain status and future in Myanmar due to security issues and forest clearance for rubber and oil palm plantations.  However, two new protected areas have been designated in the Tenasserims: Taninthayi National Park and Lenya River Wildlife Sanctuary.  If these areas can be protected, they will preserve valuable tapir habitat in the future.<br/><br/>Malay Tapirs are generally not hunted for subsistence or commercial trade in Thailand or Myanmar, since their flesh is considered distasteful. Some hill tribes believe that killing a tapir brings bad luck. In Malaysia deliberate hunting of Malay Tapir for consumption is also rare, because consuming the species is considered “forbidden” by the national Islamic authority. However, most illegal poachers apprehended in Malaysia are from Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand (DWNP unpub. report), and it remains unknown to what extent that they hunt tapirs for consumption and/or other reasons. Previous reported practices in Sumatra of live tapirs being traded through several Indonesian zoos, some destined for private collections or for sale as meat in local markets, seems to have been halted with no new known since 2008 (Novarino pers. comm).</p>","<p>The Malay Tapir occurs in three relatively distinct and, in a few cases, isolated populations - two occurring on mainland Southeast Asia (Thailand/Myanmar), Southern Thailand/Malaysia and the other the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. The population on Sumatra continues to decline due to extensive loss of habitat, accidental and deliberate trapping for meat and removal of animals for zoos in Indonesia. To date, there are no reliable population estimates for Sumatra.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Sumatra, Indonesia</strong><br/>In Sumatra, Indonesia, over 50% of the remaining forest is outside Malay Tapir habitat. The concern that illegal logging and forest encroachment would result in the loss of all forest outside conservation areas by 2005 does not seem to hold up, and large tracts of tapir habitat still persists in Sumatra. Yet, Novarino maintains that habitat destruction has continued significantly in the 2008-2014 period in Sumatra, both inside and outside protected areas. Localized hunting in Sumatra also occurs as well as elsewhere in its distribution range, but there is no evidence of systematic activities targeting the species. Most off-take results from accidental snaring, road kills (Magintan <em>et al.</em> 2012) and retaliation killing by local villagers (Novarino pers. comm.). In the past, several Indonesian zoos, especially Pekanbaru, traded in live tapirs for sale to other Indonesian zoos or private collections, or for sale as meat in local markets. Fifty tapirs were reported passing through the Pekanbaru Zoo since 1993 with some of these animals likely to have originated from protected areas. While impossible to confirm, this practice appears to have been greatly reduced, possibly as a result of Indonesia’s economic prosperity and bigger awareness among local communities. In addition, the formation of organizations such as the Round Table for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has resulted in a large portion of the palm oil industry committing to protecting and managing high conservation value areas, rather than to convert it all to agricultural land. This has reduced the speed of habitat conversion, and in some places even reversed it due to RSPO-principles that require members to rehabilitate HCV-areas that were destroyed post 2005. Whereas the threat status for the species has not changed notably in the 2008-2014 period there is far better understanding of what causes the population decline. There exists no accurate population estimate of tapirs in Sumatra, but it is anticipated to be below 400-500 adult individuals.<br/><br/><strong>Thailand and Myanmar</strong><br/>In Thailand, 40% of the remaining forest is outside protected areas and only 5% of Myanmar’s land area is protected forest (Lynam pers. comm.). Lynam’s comments on tapir status and distribution in Thailand and Myanmar remain relevant in 2014. Thailand supports one of the most comprehensive systems of protected areas in Southeast Asia. Over 200 National Parks, Marine National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries and Non-hunting areas cover 17% of land area (Prayurasiddhi <em>et al.</em> 1999).&#160; Almost all-remaining intact forest now lies within protected areas, with mostly degraded lands outside. Since most existing Malay Tapir habitat is already protected, the future for conservation of the species in Thailand is quite positive. In Thailand,<em> Tapirus indicus</em> is recorded from forest areas in the west and south of the country (Lekagul and McNeely 1988), including transboundary forest areas in border areas, and large isolated forest remnants. The transboundary forests represent the most extensive, contiguous habitats for large mammals left in the country (Prayurasiddhi <em>et al.</em> 1999). They include the Western Forest Complex (Thai-Myanmar border), which includes 12 protected areas, and covers over 18,730 km<sup>2</sup> including both dry and wet forests, and the Kaeng Krachan/Chumpol complex which covers 4,373 km<sup>2</sup>, mostly wet evergreen forest on the Thai-Myanmar border. The Halabala Forest is an expanse of 1,850 km<sup>2</sup> of tropical rainforest on the Thai-Malaysia border. All areas are contiguous with larger forest areas on opposite sides of the country border. Past surveys (Lynam 1999, Lynam 2000, WCS 2001, Kaewsirisuk 2001) confirmed that tapirs are present though uncommon in each of these transboundary forest areas.<br/><br/>While the Thai-Myanmar population apparently remains stable (Lynam pers. comm.) it is fragmented with many subpopulations often numbering less than 15 individuals which are not viable populations for the long term. Therefore, Thai populations are fragile with most subpopulations are unlikely to reach more than 50-100 individuals at the most. The smaller fragmented populations with only 10-15 individuals are left with no chance of linking up to other protected areas and suitable habitats. This is not genetically sustainable, but management intervention (e.g. moving individuals to supplement new genes) can suppress the risk of inbreeding. To date, no reliable population estimate exists for the Thailand/Myanmar population, although it is anticipated to be less than 250 adult individuals. Therefore, the long-term survival of Malay Tapirs&#160;in Thailand seems to be dependent primarily by proper meta-population management.<br/><br/>Myanmar’s protected areas make up 5% of land area (Shwe) and most tapir habitat lies outside these protected areas in part of the Thai isthmus. In Myanmar, Malay Tapirs are entirely restricted to rainforests in the Tenasserim Ranges along the Thai-Myanmar border (Yin 1993). The tenure of these lands on the Myanmar side of the border is disputed and due to civil unrest, has been inaccessible for wildlife survey until recently. However, a preliminary survey of the status and threats to Malay Tapirs&#160;were undertaken in Taninthayi nature reserve and tapirs were recorded regularly (Shwe and Lynam 2012). Furthermore, a rapid assessment for Malay Tapir in five townships of the Taninthayi range and vicinity was undertaken too (Shwe unpubl. data). The Taninthayi population forms part of the Thai transboundary population, hence it is not possible to separate the Thai and Myanmar populations into two distinct populations.<br/><br/><strong>Malaysia and Southern Thailand</strong><br/>The tapir population in Malaysia and Southern Thailand is considered the largest and most resilient. To date, it is also the best studied. Despite a significant population “decline” in the previous assessment (from ~20,000 to less than 2,000) several recent studies using various methodologies concur that the population in Malaysia ranges from approximately 1,300-1,700 individuals (Clements <em>et al.</em> 2012, Rayan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Traeholt and Sanusi 2009). This confirms that the previous estimate of approx. 20,000 individuals was a technical overestimate as there has likely never been that many in the past either. Monitoring of the population by the Malaysian Department of Wildlife and National Parks reiterates that the population appears to be stable.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, tapirs are found in virtually all types of forest: primary, logged, disturbed and small pockets. Sometimes it even ventures into plantations and urban areas although this seems to be caused by basic wandering or possibly displaced by rival individuals. Whereas habitat loss to agricultural development is still ongoing, illegal logging and disturbance of primary rainforest does not seem to cause any significant problems to tapirs, because they seem to prefer more open areas with more browse available. The rate of habitat loss has decreased and the current forest coverage (45%) is likely to remain stable for the near future. To date, there is no evidence of targeted hunting activities. First of all, the number of displaced animals (displaced animals are animals that come out of forested areas and into villages, plantations, roads and most often end up dead or severely injured)&#160; from 2006-2010 reached 142 individuals (average of &gt;3 deaths per year) with most being returned to the wild, and 17 died (Magintan <em>et al</em>. 2012). The trend is increasing with 54 recorded displacements with 19 mortalities in the 2011-2013 period (an average of &gt;6 deaths per year). The cause of the increasing “displacements” remains poorly understood. Second, the southern part of the distribution range is effectively isolated and despite the Federal Governments intentions to create a “Central Forest Spine” that connects the main conservation landscapes in the country, all indications suggest that forest complexes in the southern state of Johor are becoming increasingly isolated with diminishing chances of ever forming a part of the Central Forest Spine. In the southern states of Malaysia (Johor, Nengri Sembilan and Southern part of Selangor) there are an increasing number of small forest fragments with only 3-5 individuals - they are functionally extinct. Finally, systematic hunting activities can decimate the population in a very short time, and with the supply of rhino horns running dry, there is a very real risk that hunters will begin targeting Malay tapirs and sold as “placebo rhino”.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Tapirus indicus</em> occurs in southern and central parts of Sumatra (Indonesia), and on the Asian mainland in Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand (along the western border and on the Peninsula south to the Malaysian border, and in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in the north), and Myanmar (south of latitude 18°N). Its occurrence can be divided into three relatively distinct sub-populations:</p><ol><li>Thailand-Myanmar that includes all the trans-boundary forest complexes and protected areas in the western Thailand north to Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuary.</li><li>South Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia that includes the transboundary protected areas complex of Halabala (Thailand) and Royal Belum (Malaysia) and constitutes a relatively cohesive mega population, albeit fragmentation into smaller sub-populations occurs in the southern part of its distribution range in the state of Johor.</li><li>Sumatra including southern and central parts. The Sumatran distribution range is becoming increasingly fragmented.</li></ol><p><br/>The Malay Tapir was also listed as occurring in southern Cambodia and possibly southern Viet Nam by Brooks <em>et al.</em> (1997). It was reported from Hongquan district, eastern Cochin China, Viet Nam, in 1944 (Harper 1945), and there was an authentic-sounding record from Lao PDR in 1902 (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999). It is presumed to be extinct in all three countries. However, further investigation of these historical records and of other indications from Lao, Viet Nam, Cambodia, northern Thailand and even southern China have found none that has any compelling evidence in its support. The species' habitat distribution at the northern edge of its Thai range, where the climate develops a more marked dry season, and the tapir occupancy changes from altitudinal wide-ranging to being restricted to the most humid altitudes, strongly supports a climatic limitation (Lynam <em>et al</em>. 2012, Steinmetz <em>et al.</em> 2008), thereby casting further empirical doubt on the 20th century reports from Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Cambodia. Cranbrook and Piper (2009) reported that Malay Tapirs existed until very recently in Sabah (Borneo) and suggested reintroduction of the species into Sabah should be considered in the future (Cranbrook 2012).<br/></p>",Tapir meat is occasionally eaten and sold in local markets. It is not a popular food. Live animals are caught for local zoos.

The impact of habitat reduction/destruction on the tapir is not fully understood and needs further investigation. It is listed on CITES Appendix I.<br/><br/>Indonesia has already developed a National Tapir Conservation Action Plan (2013), but it is yet to be effectively implemented across its local range.<br/><br/>By November 2014, Malaysia began the process of developing a National Tapir Conservation Action Plan. It is anticipated that the final document will be completed by mid-2015, after which it will be ratified by the Malaysian Government.<br/><br/>Thailand does not have any national action or conservation plan for Malay Tapirs (Lynam).</p><p><br/></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The number of mature individuals in the entire population in 2011 was 632, a reduction of 20.4% from the 795 mature individuals in 1983. Currently the species is still in overall decline with two distinct trajectories between the populations in the NWHI (4.0% per year decline) and the MHI (6.5% per year increase; Caretta <em>et al</em>. 2013). The NWHI decline is mainly due to food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators. The overall decline of more than 20% within two generations (30 years) meets IUCN criterion C1 for Endangered.<br/></p>      <em></em>","Adult Hawaiian Monk Seals reach lengths of about 2.1 to 2.4 m and weigh 170-240 kg. Pups are about 1 m and 16-18 kg at birth and when weaned six weeks later they weigh 50-100 kg (Kenyon 1981, Antonelis <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Female Monk Seals first give birth at 4-10 years old. Births occur during all months of the year, with most occurring during March to August (Johanos <em>et al</em>. 1994). Age specific fecundity rates for mature animals range from 50% to over 80%, and differ among subpopulations (Harting <em>et al</em>. 2007, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011). Males in this polygynous species patrol the water adjacent to rookeries or land near females with pups. Male dominated sex ratios have occurred at some colonies, and that has resulted in mobbing of oestrus females some of which have been severely injured or killed in such events (Johanos <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Monk seals are generally solitary, both on land and at sea. Even when seals gather together on land, they are not normally gregarious and only mothers and pups and recently weaned seals regularly make physical contact. On land, Hawaiian Monk Seals haul-out and breed on substrates of sand, coral, or volcanic rock. Sandy beaches with shallow protected water near shore appear to be preferred for pupping (Westlake and Gilmartin 1990).<br/><br/>At-sea movements and habitat use of Hawaiian Monk Seals have been investigated using satellite-linked dive recorders and animal-borne video cameras. In the NWHI, Monk Seals forage within atolls, in the shallow waters surrounding atolls and islands, and farther offshore at submerged banks and reefs (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the MHI, Monk Seals tend to stay within 50 km of shore and forage almost entirely within the 200 m bathymetric contour of the islands. Seals carrying cameras in both regions searched for and preyed on benthic fish and invertebrates in coral reefs, sand flats, as well as areas of rubble and consolidated bottom material, along areas of transition of benthic habitat types, and also in deepwater coral beds (Parish <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2002; NMFS unpublished data). Most dives that have been recorded have been less than 150 meters deep, although some individuals dived to more than 550 m (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2006, NMFS unpublished data). Hawaiian Monk Seals are known to eat a variety of fishes, eels, cephalopods, and crustaceans (Goodman-Lowe 1998, Iverson <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cahoon <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Recovery of Hawaiian Monk Seals has been affected to an unknown degree by disturbance from military activities in the NWHI including the alteration, development, and occupation of bases on several key islands that started before World War II (Ragen and Lavigne 1999). However, the military no longer has bases in the area and the vast majority of Monk Seals live where they are isolated from most direct human contact. The only permanent structures remaining in the NWHI are US Fish and Wildlife Service facilities at Tern Island and Midway Atoll, and remnants of former Coast Guard facilities at Kure Atoll. Degradation of these structures, particularly at Tern Island, poses a significant entrapment hazard for Monk Seals. There are also concerns about legacy chemicals and contaminants that were left behind.<br/><br/>Current threats to Monk Seals are thoroughly reviewed and analysed in National Marine Fisheries Service (2007). The most crucial threats in the NWHI at this time are: 1) food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators; 2) entanglement in marine debris, largely fragments of net and line discarded by North Pacific fisheries; 3) predation by sharks, especially on pre-weaned and recently weaned pups; and 4) intraspecific aggression by sub-dominant males. An emerging threat in this region may be the loss of terrestrial habitat due to sea level increases resulting from global warming (Baker et al. 2006). The situation in the MHI is different, with the main threats there being: 1) interactions with commercial and non-commercial fishing gear especially hookings and entanglements in gillnets; 2) possible transmission of diseases from feral animals, domestic pets, and livestock to seals; and 3) intentional killing and harassment.","Hawaiian Monk Seals are distributed throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago. Within the Monk Seal’s range, two regions are often distinguished: the NWHI, comprising eight subpopulations located on remote atolls and small islands, and the MHI, comprising eight large high islands and associated small islets. Seals in the MHI are considered to be a single subpopulation. The status of the Hawaiian Monk Seal is assessed annually and updated by the US National Marine Fisheries Service’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. The most recent reliable abundance estimates, from 2011, were used for this assessment.<br/><br/>The generation time for Hawaiian Monk Seals, estimated as the average age of reproducing individuals, is approximately 15 years. The best estimate of the total number of seals of all age classes in 2011 is 1,209. The population is comprised of approximately 632 sexually mature seals with the following distribution across subpopulations: Kure Atoll 58, Midway Atoll 27, Pearl and Hermes Reef 101, Lisianski Island 77, Laysan Island 113, French Frigate Shoals 117,&#160; Necker Island 38, Nihoa Island 43, and the MHI 58 (NMFS unpublished data). <br/><br/>The earliest information on Monk Seal abundance comes from 1958 (Kenyon and Rice 1959, Rice 1960). However, those data consisted of beach counts only and did not include an estimate of total population size. In order to compare total abundance over time, we have used an estimate for NWHI abundance in 1983 (Gerrodette 1985) at which time there were negligible numbers of seals known to exist in the MHI. This number is compared to the 2011 estimate for total abundance for both the NWHI and MHI. The total abundance estimate for 1983 was 1,520. In 2011, total range-wide abundance was estimated to be 1,209. Over this 28 year period the number of mature individuals declined by 20.4%, from 795 to 632. Extrapolating this decline pattern across two generations (30 years: 1984-2014) gives an estimated overall decline of 21.8%.<br/><br/>Overall, the Monk Seal population is still in decline, but with two distinct trajectories between the populations in the NWHI (4.0% per year decline) and the MHI (6.5% per year increase; Caretta <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is expected that species will continue to decline for at least the next 12 years if trends remain the same. At that point the number of animals in the MHI will surpass that in the NWHI and growth in the MHI will offset losses in the NWHI (NMFS unpublished data).",Decreasing,"Hawaiian Monk Seals occur throughout the Hawaiian Island chain. Their six main reproductive sites are in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) at Kure Atoll, Midway Atoll, Pearl and Hermes Reef, Lisianski Island, Laysan Island, and French Frigate Shoals (National Marine Fisheries Service 2007). While sightings were previously rare in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI), Monk Seals are now regularly seen there and births have been documented on all of the major islands (Baker and Johanos 2004). Sightings outside of the main range have occurred at Johnston Atoll, Palmyra Atoll, and Wake Island (Ragen and Lavigne 1999).<br/><br/>Hawaiian Monk Seals are non-migratory, and tend to remain near the atoll where they were born. However, approximately 10% of seals will relocate temporarily or permanently to other sites in the island chain, and long distance wanderers have been recorded.<br/><br/>There are approximately 1,693 km of coastline habitat for Monk Seals in Hawaii (US Census Bureau 2012). However, the terrestrial habitat available for their use in the NWHI is very limited. The total area of emergent land is only about 13.5 km² and only a fraction of that is suitable for use by seals (Ragen and Lavigne 1999).<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence for Hawaiian Monk seals is approximately 1,500,000 km² and the area of occupancy is approximately 293,000 km².<br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"The Hawaiian Monk Seal has been listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act since 1976. That law contains a number of provisions to protect the seals and their critical habitat. They are also covered by a general prohibition against unpermitted taking by the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1973.<br/><br/>Virtually all of the land and waters in the NWHI is included in one or more protected areas (the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands State Marine Refuge, the Kure Atoll State Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, and the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument) where human activities that could effect the seals or their habitats are either prohibited or strictly controlled.<br/><br/>Hawaiian Monk Seals are the focus of one of the most proactive marine mammal recovery programs in the world (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2011). Historically, the primary focus of the species’ recovery program was to increase survival of juvenile and adult female seals in the NWHI. Important recovery efforts include: 1) cleaning up of marine debris and toxic chemicals; 2) minimizing human activities that could disturb seals hauled out on beaches; 3) mitigation of shark predation of young pups through limited shark removals or pup translocations; 4) removal and translocation of adult males to mitigate mortality associated with male aggression towards juveniles and females; and 5) regulating fisheries to reduce the likelihood of direct and indirect interactions. In spite of these efforts the population has continued to decline, however, the efforts have mitigated some of the severity of that decline.&#160; A recent analysis has shown that up to 30% of the current Monk Seal population is alive today due to the small-scale mitigation efforts targeted towards individual seals over the past 30 years (Harting <em>et al</em>. 2014). <br/><br/>Efforts to increase juvenile survival are also being expanded using a variety of translocation strategies. Over the past thirty years, numerous Monk Seal translocations have been conducted with a variety of objectives, including reducing shark predation and conspecific male aggression, stopping human–seal interactions, and taking advantage of different demographic patterns between subpopulations to improve survival. (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014).<br/><br/>Management agencies are currently developing a vaccination plan to guard against a disease outbreak that could decimate the population. Two viruses, <em>Morbillivirus</em> and West Nile Virus, have been identified as infectious agents with a high risk to Hawaiian Monk Seals. Marine <em>Morbillivirus</em> strains have been recently identified in Hawaii and it considered only a matter of time before West Nile Virus makes it to Hawaii (Kilpatrick <em>et al</em>. 2004, West <em>et al</em>. 2013). Background surveys conducted on Hawaiian Monk Seals show that they remain naïve (no detectable antibodies) to both viruses. The vaccination program could begin as early as 2015.<br/><br/>In 2014, a privately funded and managed rehabilitation facility was constructed to support recovery efforts.&#160; This Hawaiian Monk Seal hospital will serve to care for seals from across the archipelago that are sick, injured, emaciated, or otherwise in need of rehabilitation.<br/><br/>With the increase of Monk Seals in the main Hawaiian Islands, the recovery program has had to develop a number of strategies to maintain population growth while mitigating human-seal interactions (Lowry et al. 2011).&#160; The program is currently working on strategies to prevent and modify unwanted seal behaviors including fisheries interactions and animals conditioned to interact with people.&#160; A significant component of this work includes community engagement on how to avoid negative wildlife interactions.",Oceanian,,false,false,Global

The predictable migratory habits of this anadromous species, coupled with its delicacy among the local communities have led to severe population declines (not less than 80% in 10 years) and shrinkage of its extent of occurrence (EOO). Additionally, regression of swamps and wetlands due to agricultural activities, sedimentation due to erosion on watershed&#160;and eutrophication contribute to continuing declines in habitat quality of the spawning grounds. This species is therefore listed as Critically Endangered.","<em>Labeo victorianus</em>&#160;is an potamodromous species. It spends most of its life span in lakes (Eccles 1992), and ascends both large rivers and streams in fairly compact shoals (Whitehead 1959)&#160;during the rainy season (Fryer and Whitehead 1959) to spawn. Spawning grounds are flooded grasslands beside both permanent and temporary streams (Eccles 1992). Submerged rocky cliffs and shelves near the river mouths are favoured by non-reproducing fish prior to migrating upstream to spawn (Rutaisire and Booth 2005). However, Oweke Ojwang <em>et al</em>. (2007) indicate that upstream migrations are virtually gone and reports that this once-migratory species is now possibly a sedentary riverine resident. Permanent river populations indeed exist (Whitehead 1959, Oweke Ojwang <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Lake Victoria this <em>Labeo </em>occurs in shallow, inshore waters and influent rivers (Witte and Winter 1995) and in Lake Kyoga it lives in open waters away from water-lily zones (Greenwood 1966).&#160;<em>Labeo victorianus</em> is a specialized feeder on epilithic and epiphytic algae (Corbet 1961), but mud, plant debris (Greenwood 1966) and rotifers growing on the bodies of other fishes are also taken (Fryer <em>et al</em>. 1955). The maximum size is 41.0 cm SL (Van Oijen 1995).","Intensive and unregulated gill-netting of gravid fishes across rivers or river mouths during the seasonal spawning migration is a threat. Loss of spawning/nursery grounds due to siltation, pollution and water extraction also occurs as a result of agricultural extension in the Lake Victoria catchment.&#160;Regression of swamps and other wetlands around lakes and rivers due to farming extension (rice, sorghum, banana plantations) is a threat in the Bugesera depression. Sedimentation due to excessive soil erosion (mining activities, road and building construction, cultivation on steep slopes, etc.) and pollution occurs in &#160;the&#160;Rweru-Mugesera lakes-wetlands complex with agrochemicals. Loss of riverine migratory routes and&#160;competitive displacement by introduced fish species are also threats.","During the 1950s the catches of this fish in the Lake Victoria basin decreased dramatically as a result of intensive and unregulated gill-net fishing across river mouths (Garrod 1961, Cadwalladr 1965a, Ogutu-Ohwayo 1990). Removing gravid, sexually mature fish at the beginning of their migration resulted in significant population declines. Additionally, large numbers of fry were taken in scoop-traps on their return to the lake (Ogutu-Ohwayo 1990). By the early 1960s <em>L. victorianus</em> had virtually disappeared from the catches of the Lake Victoria (Cadwalladr 1965a).&#160;It is common in commercial fish catches in the Upper and Middle Akagera lakes. It has a wide extent of occurrence but is very rarely encountered.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to the Lake Victoria drainage (Seegers <em>et al</em>. 2003).

It is also found in Lake Katwe and Lake Kubigena in Tanzania (Katunzi and Kishe 2004). The extent of occurrence (EOO) has decreased from a 20 m depth range observed during the 1969–71 survey (Kudhongania and Cordone 1974) to a 10 m range during the 1997–99 surveys (Okaronon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Getabu and Nyaundi 1999, Mkumbo and Ezekiel 1999).

There are now estimated to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and the species is estimated to be declining by at least 10% in three generations (14 years) due to poaching, habitat degradation and drought. Data are very poor, but the latest estimates suggest that there are <em>ca</em> 4,000 individuals (2,800 mature individuals) in the Central Ogaden (Wilhelmi 2013) plus an unknown number in Somalia. It is possible that the species is close to meeting the population threshold for Endangered, but the above figure is likely an underestimate and there is no evidence to show a decline of 20% over the last 9 years (two generations). More accurate information on status may indicate than an uplist is warranted.","Dibatag inhabit semi-arid, dense to scattered bush, low- to medium-height thornbush savannah and plains with thicket/grassland mosaics. They prefer sandy to moderately gravelled, ferrous oxide rich red soils, characterized by numerous termite mounds (Wilhelmi 2013). Their altitudinal range is approximately 200 to 1,200 m (Yalden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1984).","Drought and habitat degradation due to overgrazing affect the whole range of this species. Hunting is a threat, exacerbated by political instability and periodic civil and military conflicts over the past 30 years (and continuing), resulting in a prevalence of weapons and over-exploitation of wildlife. However, the Dibatag’s  alertness, flight distance&#160;and&#160;the difficulty of  hunting it in dense  bush have enabled it to survive locally (Wilhelmi  2013). Local people consider that it is very shy and  more alert than any  other antelope species, and that it is almost  impossible to hunt Dibatag intentionally, even though its meat is  preferred because of its  excellent taste (Wilhelmi  2013). Uncontrolled exploitation of trees and scrub for charcoal, exported in huge quantities to the Gulf states is likely to be negatively affecting the habitat.","Based on the results of a field survey in 1959 (Scott 1965), the population size of Dibatag was estimated at approximately 12,000 individuals with an average density of 1/km² (Schomber 1966). After three decades of political unrest and armed conflicts a cautious estimate assumed a total population in the very low thousands (East 1999). The results of recent field surveys in the Ogaden region (Wilhelmi 1997, Wilhelmi <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006) are somewhat better than expected. Wilhelmi (2013) estimated about 4,000 animals in the central Ogaden (<em>ca</em> 46,000 km²<sup></sup>) and there are an unknown number in Somalia. Dibatags are alert and hard to locate in dense bush, so it likely that numbers are higher than believed (Wilhlemi 2013). More accurate estimates of density and total population size in both range countries are urgently needed once the security situation permits.",Decreasing,"<em>Ammodorcas clarkei</em> (Dibatag) is endemic to the Ogaden region of south-east Ethiopia, and northern and central Somalia. In Ethiopia, Dibatag formerly occurred widely in the vast plains of the Ogaden but an extensive ground survey revealed that the species was now rare or absent in the northern Ogaden but still occured locally within a reasonably large area in the southern Ogaden, where it appears to be quite common in some localities (Wilhelmi 1997). In contrast to the northern Ogaden, which has a relatively high density of settlements and concentrations of armed pastoralists and their herds, the southern Ogaden has lower human densities and extensive areas where the natural flora and fauna appear to be largely intact. The species was seen and photographed in the north-central Ogaden in March 2016 (H. Pohlstrand, <em>in litt</em>.). Dibatag once occurred widely in central Somalia and on the Haud Plateau in the north. By the early 1980s it had disappeared from large parts of its former range but still occurred locally in reasonable numbers in parts of the central coastal hinterland. It seems to have disappeared from Somaliland (northern Somalia) a few decades ago (Mallon and Jama 2015). In Central Somalia, local people indicated that it was still present in the late 1980s, but no more recent information is available. This area has been affected by 30 years of civil and military conflict as well as drought and overgrazing and its status is widely considered to have deteriorated, along with that of other antelope species such as&#160;<em>Nanger soemmerringii</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Oryx beisa</em>&#160;that are easier to monitor (Wilhelmi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).","Hunting for meat is a range-wide threat, exacerbated in places by political instability and prevalence of weapons.",Terrestrial,"There are no protected areas within its range and no Dibatags are known to be held in captivity, except for a few confiscated individuals in Ethiopia.&#160;Therefore there is an urgent need to initiate conservation action in those parts of its range where this may be feasible (e.g., the southern Ogaden).

Moreover lack of effective protection in many parts of the remaining range leaves it vulnerable to poaching. The development of the cattle industry, compounded by rinderpest and drought are continuing threats (East 1999, Butynski 2013). The situation for the Hirola remains grave, given its extremely rapid decline and the severe political and environmental problems that currently prevail over the natural range (Butynski 2013).","In 1979, there were <em>ca</em> 16,000 animals in Kenya (within 17,900 km²).

These recommendations are now part of the current conservation and management plan for the Hirola in Kenya (Hirola Management Committee 2004) and are being acted upon by the Kenya Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Hirola Management Committee and local conservation NGOs. Despite these efforts, Hirola numbers have continued to decline across their range. They are rare or even no longer occur in the Arawale N.R. which has been subjected to scrub encroachment.

In southern Morocco, it was found in areas without any <em>Acacia</em>, but with dense shrub cover (Cuzin 2003).","The main threats to this species include uncontrolled hunting (by nomads, military and others) and habitat loss and degradation due to overgrazing by domestic livestock and the expansion of livestock rearing due to construction of bore wells that allow grazers to remain in a location all year-round. Prolonged drought is also having an impact on pasture quality (Lafontaine <em>et al.</em> 2005, Scholte 2013).","Numbers of Dama Gazelle have declined drastically since the 1950s and 1960s.

Dama Gazelle are now probably extinct from Morocco and Algeria. In Tunisia, they are believed to have occurred in the south and to have disappeared before the 20th century (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2001). There are historical reports of Dama Gazelle from extreme S Libya, which may represent movement of animals northwards from the Tibesti mountains, but no recent evidence (RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014).<br/><br/>South of the Sahara, Dama Gazelle have been recorded across the sahel zone from northern Senegal to Sudan (Scholte 2013, and references therein). They formerly occurred in Senegal during the dry season, or periods of drought, only and are thought to be extinct in Mauritania, and from the Sahel zones of NE Nigeria and N Burkina Faso where they have been previously recorded, albeit rarely (Scholte 2013).

Much of the former range has not been surveyed in recent years due to  political instability and lack of security, and there is a very slight  possibility that small groups may persist elsewhere. Unconfirmed local reports suggest that small populations may exist in  two other locations, but as Dama Gazelles make  long-distance movements, ‘new’ small groups may represent nomads not  separate subpopulations&#160;(RZSS and IUCN Antelope Specialist Group 2014).","Dama Gazelles are subject to direct exploitation, exacerbated by the introduction of modern firearms and 4x4 vehicles. As well as hunting by nomads and military, hunting of Dama Gazelle by Arab hunting parties has been frequent in Sudan (Cloudsley and Thompson 1992) and in 1998 and again in 2001 in Chad, where it was temporarily, halted after publicity by a local NGO (Scholte 2013).

The overall conservation status is unlikely to change, since any further decrease in the free-living population may be compensated by the continued growth of its numbers on private farms and conservancies. The latter should continue in view of this spectacular antelope’s aesthetic appeal and its high value as a trophy animal. Nonetheless, certain subpopulations remain vulnerable, in particular that of the Giant Sable (<em>H. n. variani</em>) in Angola.","A savanna woodland species, very closely associated with the miombo <em>Brachystegia</em> woodland zone. The Sable is an “edge” species that frequents the woodland/grassland ecotone; it spends the wet season in woods open enough to support an understory of grasses no more than 30 cm high on well-drained soils, and in the dry season emerges onto the grasslands in search of green grass and forbs (Estes 2013). They are both gramivorous and folivorous, although grass makes up the bulk of their diet (Estes 2013, and references therein).","Sable have been eliminated from large areas of their former range by hunting and loss of habitat to the expansion of agricultural settlement and livestock. Poaching and armed conflict have been a major threat, specially for the Giant Sable&#160;and Sable populations in Mozambique. Further decline in the distribution and numbers of the Sable Antelope may occur in the more northerly parts of its range in future, unless the expansion of human populations and livestock is countered by the implementation of higher levels of protection and management of wildlife in countries such as Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique (East 1999).<br/><br/>A former stronghold of Sable in N Botswana, near the Caprivi border, has been severely impacted by the construction of the Northern Buffalo Fence, which has affected their access to water, causing significant mortality (Estes 2013). Inbreeding, evidenced by increased calf mortality, is a major risk in many of the smaller, privately owned herds of Sable (Grobler and Van der Bank 1994). The survival of the Giant Sable through the Angolan civil war (1975-2002) is highly encouraging, but its survival remains precarious as many Angolans who fled the Luando Reserve during the mid-1970s flood back to areas they had formerly evacuated. There have been recent incidents of hybridization of Giant Sable with Roan Antelope in the Cangandala NP (Vaz Pinto 2006, Vaz Pinto <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Summation of available population estimates gave a total population of about 54,000 Sable, but this does not allow for undercounting bias in aerial surveys or parts of the species’ range for which estimates of numbers are unavailable. East (1999) estimated the total population at 75,000, of which about half occurs in and around protected areas and one-quarter on private land. The largest populations were in Zimbabwe (&gt;19,690), Tanzania (&gt;10,680), Namibia (7,100) and Mozambique (4,270) (East 1999).

This range reduction has been most marked in Mozambique, where they survive only in good numbers in Niassa in the north, and in the western Gaza province; southeast DR Congo; and north-east Tanzania (East 1999, Estes 2013). Sable have been reintroduced to many parts of their former range, but have also been introduced to areas where they never naturally occurred, including to Swaziland (East 1999).","Sable are subject to hunting for meat and as trophies across their range.

This decline is due to poaching, large-scale slaughter by armed groups (especially from the upsurge in military activity in the Sudd region since late 2013), competition with domestic livestock and habitat degradation caused by cattle grazing in the dry season.",The Nile Lechwe is confined to seasonally flooded swamps and grasslands within the Sudd and Machar-Gambella wetlands of South Sudan and south-western Ethiopia. They are almost always on the edge of deeper swamps where the water is shallow (between 10 and 40 cm deep; Mefit-Babtie 1983).,"The wildlife of the Sudd wetlands has been severely affected by civil war, the displacement and resettlement of human populations, proliferation of firearms, and increased hunting for meat (Falchetti and Kingdon 2013). Nile Lechwe are likely to be very strongly constrained by large numbers of cattle that penetrate deep into the Sudd during the dry season and they are commonly very close to dense herds of cattle during the day, but always in water that is too deep for the latter to graze in (Falchetti and Kingdon 2013).<br/><br/>Fighting in the region has resumed and in a press release on 3rd March 2016, WCS reported an alarming expansion of illegal exploitation and trafficking of wildlife, with all sides in South Sudan's ongoing civil war slaughtering elephants for their ivory and using automatic weapons to kill large numbers of antelopes and giraffes for meat in order to feed the tens of thousands of soldiers and rebels who have been fighting since December 2013.<br/><br/>Plans to resuscitate the construction of the Jonglei canal (intended to increase the flow of water to Egypt) could result in a dramatic deterioration of the Nile Lechwe's status (East 1999). Proposals to introduce  irrigation and exploit oil reserves in the Sudd (Fay <em>et al.</em> 2007), could also have serious implications for Nile Lechwe if realized.","Aerial surveys of the Sudd region conducted in the early and late dry season of the Jonglei area of South Sudan in 1980 yielded estimated counts of <em>ca</em> 12,000 and <em>ca</em> 32,000 animals, respectively. Most animals were concentrated within the swamps on the west bank of the Nile (Mefit-Babtie 1983). Probably less than 1,000 animals were present in Machar-Gambella (Hillman and Fryxell 1988). An aerial survey carried out by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in the early dry season in southern Sudan in 2007 yielded an estimate of 4,291 animals, a mean density of 0.06/km² and identified the Zeraf Game Reserve as the most important protected area for this species (Fay <em>et al.</em> 2007). A resumption of fighting since December 2013 has led to large numbers of antelopes and other species being slaughtered for meat to feed the combatants on all sides.<br/><br/>In November 2009, one herd &gt;100 was seen on an aerial recce and 34 during an aerial survey of Gambella; none were seen on the dry season survey 2010 (Trans Frontier Conservation Initiative (TFCI) Task Force 2010).",Decreasing,"The Nile Lechwe is found only in South Sudan and Ethiopia.

Overall these are not estimated to approach the threshold for Vulnerable. While the status of the Kob will likely not change as long as there is effective protection and management for the various protected areas in which the species can be found, its future is highly dependent upon these conservation measures. The species could easily become threatened if current conservation measures cease to be effective or disappear altogether, or if there are significant changes to the core habitat in the Sudd. There is particular cause for concern over the status of Buffon's Kob.","Typical habitat includes riverine grasslands and floodplains of major rivers; grasslands; seasonal floodplains and grasslands near water within savanna woodlands (East 1999). Kobs are almost exclusively grazers, and confined to regions that have year-round access to water (Fischer 2013). Social organization in the Kob is dependent on density and includes two discrete mating systems, changing from a lek system at high densities (&gt;14 animals/km²) to a resource-defence system at lower densities (Fischer 2013, and references therein).","Although very abundant in the past, Kobs are victims of unsustainable hunting over most of their range (Fischer 2013). Buffon's Kob, in particular, has been eliminated from large parts of its former range by poaching for meat and now survives mainly in and around protected areas. Poaching has caused large-scale declines of key populations of Kob in areas such as Comoé National Park (Côte d'Ivoire) and northern and eastern Central African Republic during the 1990s (East 1999, Fischer 2013).<br/><br/>Loss of habitat to the expansion of settlements, agricultural development and livestock is another major cause of population reduction. For example, the Uganda Kob formerly occurred in south-western Kenya and north-western Tanzania in grasslands alongside Lake Victoria, but was exterminated by the spread of settlement and agricultural development. Droughts, disruption of the natural flooding regime (e.g., the construction of the Maga dam on the Logone floodplain, Cameroon), and outbreaks of rinderpest have also been cited as significant causes of population decline (East 1999, Fischer 2013).","East (1999) estimated 95,000 Buffon's Kob, but populations have undergone significant declines since then. Fay <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated more than 753,572 White-eared Kob in South Sudan. East (1999) estimated 100,000 Uganda Kob and populations in protected areas may be stable (Fischer 2013) but there is no updated estimate available. Overall, numbers of Kobs are declining throughout their range (Fischer 2013).<br/><br/>Kob can reach high densities when well protected in areas of favourable  habitat, ranging from 15-40 animals/km² (Fischer 2013, and references  therein); however, in areas of heavy hunting pressure, densities decline  to less than 1/km² (Fischer 1998). The highest densities of Kob  (1,000/km²) have been reported around drinking sites in the dry season  (Fryxell 1987).",Decreasing,"Kob (<em>Kobus kob</em>) were formerly distributed across the whole West and Central African savanna zone from Senegal and Guinea-Bissau to South Sudan and extreme south-west Ethiopia, extending south into Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. <br/>Current distribution is patchy and the species has undergone extensive declines. <em>K</em><em>. k. kob</em> (Buffon’s or Western Kob) were formerly one of the most abundant antelopes in West and Central Africa but are now largely confined to protected areas, having gone extinct from Gambia and Sierra Leone (and perhaps Mauritania) (Fischer 2013). <em>K. k. leucotis</em> (White-eared Kob) has the smallest range centred around the Sudd in South Sudan and still retains a large population. <em>K. k. thomasi</em> (Uganda Kob) are mainly found in Uganda and surrounding areas; these remaining populations represent less than 1% of its original distribution in East Africa (J. Kingdon pers. comm. in Fischer 2013).","The sedentary nature of Kobs and their tendency to occur in relatively large concentrations in open areas make them highly susceptible to hunting. This has led to high levels of unsustainable hunting over most of their range and therefore large-scale declines (Fischer 2013). However under strict protection Kob numbers can recover quickly, allowing sustainable offtakes of about 7% of the population (Mayaka <em>et al. </em>2004)",Terrestrial,"While the Kob is highly susceptible to hunting, loss of habitat and disruption of the natural flooding regime, it has the ability to recover its numbers rapidly from very low levels with effective protection. For example in Cameroon, the population of Waza National Park decreased from 25,000 in 1962 to 2,000 in 1988-94. This resulted from a general drying out of its habitat caused by droughts and disruption of the natural flooding regime from 1979 by the construction of the Maga dam on the Logone floodplain, which formed Lake Maga. Additional mortality of the Waza population was caused by poaching and the 1982-83 rinderpest outbreak. Since 1994, the Netherlands-funded IUCN/CML Waza-Logone project has investigated rehabilitation of the floodplain by release of excess water from Lake Maga and the Logone River. By 1997, the Kob population was increasing in response to the reflooding activities of this project. While large-scale rehabilitation of the Waza-Logone floodplain is contemplated, this may not be possible unless increasing security problems and a degenerating social climate in the region are overcome (Scholte <em>et al.</em> 2007). <br/><br/>Protected areas important for the survival of Buffon’s Kob, include: Niokolo-Koba (Senegal), Comoé (Côte d’Ivoire), Arly-Singou (Burkina Faso), Mole and Bui (Ghana), Pendjari (Benin), Waza and Benoué and Faro National Parks of the North Province (Cameroon), Zakouma  (Chad), and Manovo-Gounda-St. Floris (Central African Republic) (East 1999, Fischer 2013). Levels of protection within these sites are very variable and poaching is not effectively controlled in some. <br/><br/>Less than 1% of the total population of White-eared Kob occurs in protected areas, such as the Boma and Badingilo National Parks in south-east Sudan (East 1999). <br/><br/>The Uganda Kob survived in good numbers in Murchison Falls-Aswa Lolim, Queen Elizabeth and Tore-Semliki NPs (Uganda) and Garamba and Virunga National Parks (DR Congo) (East 1999), but the protection status of these protected areas in DRC has deteriorated since then due to insecurity.

Such areas currently comprise only a small part of its remaining range. The largest protected population, in Tsavo National Park, has been reduced by rinderpest and drought (East 1999).

There are very  few figures are available for Forest Buffalo, but it is suspected to be  declining across its range due to forest loss and high rates of bushmeat extraction.<br/><br/>African Buffalo numbers  were already declining in the 1990s (East 1999) so the rates of decline  over the last 3 generations (28 years) must have been higher than the  figures shown above, though it is difficult to estimate a precise figure  because the rate of decline pre-1999 is unknown. Buffalo  numbers are predicted to continue to decline because of ongoing poaching  for meat, habitat conversion, and expansion of human and domestic  livestock populations. Extrapolating the current estimated decline  (1999-2014) into the future over 3 generations (1999-2027), and under  three scenarios, produces the following figures:&#160; <br/><ul><li>Savanna buffalo (<em>S. c. caffer, S. c. aequinoctialis, S. c. brachyceros</em>) - 1999: 627,000 individuals; 2014: 513,000 individuals; 2027: predicted 431,000 individuals&#160;= -31.2%.</li><li>Savanna (as above) + forest buffalo&#160;<em>S.c. nanus</em> (assuming -15% for forest buffalo) - 1999: 687,000 individuals; 2014: 569,000 individuals; 2027: predicted 483,000 individuals&#160;= -29.7%.</li><li>Savanna (as above) + forest buffalo (assuming no decline for forest buffalo) - 1999: 687,000 individuals; 2014: 573,000 individuals; 2027: predicted 490,000 individuals&#160;= -28.7%.</li></ul>These  rates of decline are very close to the  threshold for Vulnerable and one of them just exceeds it. Moreover, these calculations assume a  linear rate of decline, whereas the decline may be expected to accelerate, especially in view of the growing threats and projections for human  population growth.<br/><br/>In the longer term, large, healthy  populations of African Buffalo will need to persist in  well protected national parks,  reserves and hunting zones across Africa  to prevent its status from  deteriorating further.<em><br/></em>","African Buffalo inhabit a wide range of habitats, including semi-arid bushland, <em>Acacia</em> woodland, miombo <em>Brachystegia</em> woodland, montane grasslands and forest (to elevations well over 4,000 m asl), coastal savannas, and moist lowland rainforests. They are absent only from deserts and sub-deserts, such as the Namib/Kalahari, the arid Horn of Africa and the Saharan/Sahelian transition zone (Prins and Sinclair 2013, Cornélis<em> <em>et al.</em> </em>2014).","Habitat loss due to expansion of settlements and agriculture, livestock grazing and forest clearance is a major threat outside protected areas (and encroachment occurs where protection is ineffective). Buffalo are favoured target of meat hunters in many countries, and poaching has been a major contributor to the recent decline of many buffalo populations, including in some national parks. War and civil unrest especially in Central Africa over the last 30 years has had – and continues to have – a negative effect. Buffalo are susceptible to drought, which has caused substantial declines in some populations in the Sahel at the end of the 1960s and during the 1990s in Tsavo, Serengeti/Mara, Gonarezhou and Kruger also strongly impacted buffalo populations (East 1999, Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>African Buffalo are susceptible to a range of indigenous and imported infectious diseases. In the past, numbers of African Buffalo suffered their most severe collapse during the great rinderpest epidemic of the 1890s, which, coupled with pleuro-pneumonia, caused mortalities as high as 95% among livestock and wild ungulates (Winterbach 1998). Rinderpest was declared eradicated in Africa in 2011 (Morens&#160;<em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2011).","Aerial counts have been widely used for 60 years to count African Buffalo, but this method is subject to a number of biases (East 1999, Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). East (1999) summed country counts for the three savanna buffalo subspecies and estimated a total of &gt;627,000 (<em>aequinoctialis</em>: &gt;59,000; <em>brachyceros</em>: &gt;20,000; <em>caffer</em>: &gt;548,000). He then applied a correction factor of 1.2 for undercounting in aerial surveys and assumed average densities where no figures were available to produce an estimate of 830,000, while acknowledging the lack of precision and suggesting the population size lay between 500,00 and 1,000,000. Survey data were (and are) unavailable for forest buffalo, and East (1999) estimated average densities of 0.03/km² where known to be common and 0.03 where uncommon and produced a rough estimate of 60,000, a figure he suggested was likely to be conservative. <br/><br/>Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2014) updated the figures for the savanna buffalo by country and protected area according to the latest available data and produced a total estimate of &gt;513,000, representing an overall decline of 18% during 1999-2014 when compared to East’s figure. Subspecies totals were: <em>aequinoctialis</em>&#160;&gt;23,00 (-61% since East 1999); <em>brachyceros</em>: &gt;17,000 (-15%); <em>caffer</em>: &gt;473,000 (-14%). <br/><br/>The same caveats (undercounting bias and unavailability of figures for many areas) also apply to the later figures as they do to the earlier ones, but they have been derived on broadly the same basis and provide an indication of trends. The decline in Central African savanna buffalo is particularly marked and influenced by war and unrest and governance issues in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan (Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). West African savanna buffalo populations show contrasting trends across sites and countries. For example, substantial investments in the WAP complex of protected areas (Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger) appear to have increased the effectiveness of management, while Comoe N.P. (Ivory Coast) and Niokolo N.P. (Senegal) have seen their buffalo populations fall by 90% (Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). <em>Syncerus c. caffer </em>appears stable across much of its range and the lower figure may be due mainly to a decline in Tanzania (Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Very few figures are available for Forest Buffalo but it is suspected to be declining across its range. Forest loss in West Africa has been far higher than in Central Africa (Christie <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Norris <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Hansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013) and rates of bushmeat extraction are high and increasing.<br/><br/>Adding 60,000 Forest Buffalo to the 513,000 estimated by Cornélis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014 gives a total figure of 573,000. If this subspecies (<em>nanus</em>) declined at 15% (i.e., showing similar to declines to those of <em>brachyceros </em>and <em>caffer</em>) in 1999-2014, its population would be roughly 56,000. Thus a very approximate global estimate of the buffalo population is 569,000-573,000 (398,000-401,000 mature individuals).<br/><br/>African Buffalo numbers were already declining in the 1990s (East 1999), so the rates of decline over the last 3 generations (28 years) must have been higher than the figures shown above, though it is difficult to estimate a precise figure because the rate of decline pre-1999 is unknown. <br/><br/>Buffalo numbers are predicted to continue to decline because of ongoing poaching for meat, habitat conversion, and expansion of human and domestic livestock populations.

Moreover, these calculations assume a linear rate of decline, but the decline may be expected to actually accelerate, especially in view of the threats and projections for human population growth.",Decreasing,"The African Buffalo once occurred across most of sub-Saharan Africa. There is no palaeontological evidence of the presence of the species in North Africa or in the Nile Valley north of Khartoum (Prins and Sinclair 2013). In North Africa, aurochs<em> Bos primigenius</em>, the progenitor of domestic cattle, occupied a similar niche and perhaps prevented the buffalo’s spread to the north (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Rainfall is a limiting factor and African Buffalo generally occupy areas with annual rainfall above 250 mm and where herbaceous forage is available (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>African Buffalo populations have undergone a severe reduction in size and geographical distribution since the 19th century, as a result of anthropogenic impacts (land conversion, poaching, disease outbreaks) and climatic events such as droughts (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Around 70% of savanna buffalo populations are confined to a patchwork of protected areas and surrounding hunting zones (East 1999). During the 20th century, the distribution has been actively reduced in several countries by culling and veterinary fences, in efforts to limit the transmission of pathogens, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and trypanosomiasis, to cattle (Taylor and Martin 1987). <br/><br/><strong>Forest Buffalo<em> </em>(<em>S. c. nanus</em>)</strong><br/>This subspecies has a disjunct distribution: one area in the rainforest belt of West Africa and another in Lower Guinea Forest and Congo Basin (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Both areas of distribution are mainly located in areas with an annual rainfall &gt;1,500 mm, in transition zones between dense tropical forests and savanna ecosystems (East 1999). In West Africa, forest buffalo are distributed from Guinea-Bissau to south-west Ghana. In Central Africa, they occur in southern Nigeria, southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, south and south-west Central African Republic, western Uganda, western Rwanda and possibly north-west Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo and Gabon. About 75% of the population lives in and around protected areas in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Republic of Congo. In both areas of distribution, numbers have declined substantially due to poaching and deforestation (East 1999), but their status is generally poorly known (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). They became extinct on Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea) sometime between 1860 and 1910 (Butynski <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997).<br/><br/><strong>West African Savanna Buffalo (<em>S. c. brachyceros</em>)</strong><br/>This subspecies still occurs locally in the Sahelo-Sudanian zone, occupying savannas and gallery forests, from south-eastern Senegal, northern Ivory Coast, southern Burkina Faso, northern Ghana and Benin, extreme south of Niger, Nigeria (very locally), northern Cameroon and a small area of the Central African Republic (East 1999).<br/><br/><strong>Central African Savanna Buffalo (<em>S. c. aequinoctialis</em>)</strong><br/>This subspecies still occurs locally in the Sahelo-Sudanian zone of Central Africa: south-east Chad, northern Central African Republic (East of the Chari River), northern Democratic Republic of Congo, south-east Sudan and western Ethiopia (East 1999). It is now extinct in Eritrea.<br/><br/><strong>Cape Buffalo </strong><strong>(</strong><em><strong>S. c. caffer</strong></em><strong>)</strong><em><br/></em>Cape Buffalo occurs in south-western Ethiopia (particularly Omo N.P.), southern Somalia and northern Kenya southwards to South Africa. It is patchily distributed throughout East Africa, southwards to Zambia, Malawi, some parts of Mozambique (small populations south of the Zambezi river with most in the north of the country), Niassa Reserve and Cabo Delgado areas (Skinner and Chimimba 2005); north-eastern Namibia (mainly eastern and western Caprivi and an introduced population in the Waterberg Plateau Park, central Namibia), Botswana (north of 20°S, Okavango Delta, Moremi Game Reserve and Chobe N.P.), and Zimbabwe (Hwange N.P., Matabeleland, Zambezi Valley, and Gonarezhou National Park; Skinner and Chimimba 2005). Small populations of Cape Buffalo still survive in some areas of south-east Angola (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). In South Africa, Cape buffalo have been reintroduced to some areas from which they were formerly extirpated. They are currently widely distributed in Kruger N.P. and smaller populations persist in KwaZuluNatal and in many private reserves; the current population in Swaziland is a reintroduction (Cornélis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).","African Buffalo is a favoured target for bushmeat hunters. It is also a prized target for trophy hunters, especially in southern Africa. The species is bred on many game farms and traded; large bulls fetch a high price.",Terrestrial,"About 70-75% of buffalo populations occur in and around protected areas (East 1999), and the future status of this species is closely linked to effective protected areas and well-managed hunting zones. <br/><br/>In 2012 there were 166 Cape Buffalo and 135 forest buffalo in captivity (Cornélis <em>et al. </em>2014).

There is a continuing decline due to snaring, poaching for bushmeat, encroachment into protected areas (PAs) and expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing. The rate of decline is predicted to exceed 10% over three generations (24 years). Effective protection in PAs and well-managed sustainable trophy hunting programmes play a key role in the conservation of this species and any weakening of these efforts will accelerate the rate of decline.","Giant Eland inhabit woodlands and forested Sudanian to Guinean savannas, never far from hilly/rocky landscapes nor from water (Planton and Michaux 2013). Kingdon (1997) considered that it is quite strictly confined to <em>lsoberlinia doka</em> woodland, but recent studies indicate that its range includes areas of <em>Terminalia-Combretum-Afzelia</em> woodland where there is no <em>Isoberlinia</em>, for example, in parts of Cameroon’s North Province such as Boumedje Hunting Concession (Bro-Jorgensen 1997). Giant Elands feed mostly on leaves, shoots, herbs and fruits (but occasionally on grasses), and will drink daily where water is available (Planton and Michaux 2013).","The distribution of Derby Eland is mainly restricted to PAs and hunting zones. In CAR and South Sudan, political instability and armed conflict are major barriers to the implementation of effective protection and management. Bushmeat hunting, snaring, encroachment by livestock grazers and smallholder cultivation are threats across most of the range. In the past, Giant Eland suffered heavy mortality from rinderpest, to which it is said to be more susceptible than any other antelope. Its demise in The Gambia has been attributed primarily to the devastating effects of this disease (Camara 1990). Populations in the Central African region crashed by 60-80% during and after the 1983-1984 rinderpest outbreak, but later recovered (East 1999).<br/><br/>The Western Giant Eland has been reduced to very low numbers by factors  such as over-hunting for meat and habitat destruction caused by the  expansion of human and livestock populations.","East (1999) estimated that there were probably more than 15,000 Eastern Giant Eland remaining, with over 12,500 in the CAR. Numbers increased in CAR, Cameroon and Chad in the 1990s. The numbers that survive in South Sudan are unknown (165 estimated in Southern NP, South Sudan in 2007; Fay <em>et al</em>. 2007). This suggests a total population of the Eastern Giant Eland at the time of around 15,000-20,000. However, political instability and civil conflict in South Sudan and CAR in the last 10-15 years have greatly disrupted protection and management in PAs and halted trophy hunting operations in many parts of CAR. At the same time, hunting for bushmeat and encroachment into PAs by agriculturalists and livestock herders have increased. Numbers in northern Cameroon may be stable or declining more slowly, but overall the global population is now estimated to be no more than 12,000-14,000 and declining.<br/><br/>Total numbers of the Western Giant Eland are probably 150-200  individuals, with almost all the surviving animals in Senegal (Brandlová <em>et al. </em>2013, Planton and  Michaux 2013).",Decreasing,"In the past, the Giant Eland probably occurred throughout the relatively narrow belt of savanna woodland which extends across West and Central Africa from Senegal to the Nile. The gap in its recent distribution between Mali and eastern Nigeria contains extensive areas of apparently suitable habitat (East 1999).<br/><br/>The Western Giant Eland&#160;(<em>T. d. derbianus</em>)&#160;has been formerly reported from Senegal to Togo, though its occurrence in Togo might have been a mistaken confusion with Bongo (<em>Tragalephaus eurycerus</em>) (Grubb <em>et al.</em> 1998). The subspecies is confirmed in south-eastern Senegal, and may occur seasonally in the far north of Guinea, and south-western Mali and possibly E Guinea-Bissau (East 1999, Darroze 2004, Planton and Michaux 2013).<br/><br/>Eastern Giant Elands&#160;(<em>T. d. gigas</em>)&#160;were formerly distributed from north-eastern Nigeria to north-west Uganda. They now survive mainly in north-east Central African Republic. A separate population lives in northern Cameroon, with herds crossing the Chad border to the east; occasional vagrants may enter Nigerian territory. They still occur in South Sudan, where they were recently recorded in Southern National Park (Fay <em>et al.&#160;</em>2007), from which they may visit north-eastern DR Congo and north-west Uganda (East 1999, Planton and Michaux 2013).","The Giant Eland is hunted for food and sport.&#160;Trophy hunting quotas have been established in parts of the species range and sustainable trophy hunting is a key to the Giant Eland’s future; with mature bulls being one of the world’s most prized big game trophies (East 1999).&#160;Traditionally, the Fulani people did not hunt them, as they believed to transmit diseases and cast spells (Planton and Michaux 2013).",Terrestrial,"Major surviving populations of Eastern Giant Eland occur in Faro, Benoue and Bouba Ndjidda N.P. and most of the 27 surrounding hunting concessions in northern Cameroon, and in Bamingui-Bangoran and Manovo-Gounda-St Floris N.P.s and most of the hunting blocks in CAR, including Chinko (East 1999, Planton and Michaux 2013). However, many of the hunting concessions in CAR are inactive due to political instability and insecurity, factors that also affect PA management.<br/><br/>The only known population of  Western Giant Eland occurs in Senegal’s Niokolo-Koba N.P., but this may number no more than 150-200.<br/><br/>Effective long-term management of national parks and hunting zones in Cameroon and eastern Central African Republic would contribute to the survival of Eastern Giant Eland. Safari hunting is the most likely justification for the long-term preservation of the substantial areas of unmodified savanna woodland which this antelope requires, and sustainable trophy hunting is a key to the Giant Eland’s future. Mature bulls are one of the world’s most prized big game trophies (East 1999).<br/><br/>The survival of the Western Giant Eland depends on continued protection of the Niokolo-Koba population in Senegal.<br/><br/>Individuals of both subspecies are held in captivity (East 1999, Planton and Michaux 2013). A semi-captive breeding group of Western Giant Eland using founders from Niokolo-Koba was established in 2000 in Bandia Reserve, Senegal. There have been 30 births at Bandia between 2000 and 2006 (M. Antonínová and P. Hejcmanová, in Planton and Michaux 2013), and a second enclosure has been built in Fathala Reserve, to which a male-only group (9) and a breeding nucleus (1, 3) were translocated in mid-2006 (Antonínová <em>et al.</em> 2006). The semi-captive populations in Bandia and Fathala reserves totalled 92 animals in 2013 (Brandlová <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>A conservation strategy for Western Giant Eland has been developed (Brandlová <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Numbers in mainland Eritrea are unknown but are probably &lt;1,000. In Ethiopia, numbers in one of the strongholds, the Awash Valley, have reportedly declined, though no precise figures are available. Wilhelmi <em>et al</em>.

In Somalia, numbers have declined in Somaliland in the north, and are almost certainly no more than the low hundreds at most (Mallon and Jama 2015). There are no estimates for other parts of Somalia but the total for the country could be &lt;1,000. Laurent and Laurent (2002) estimated 250-600 in in Djibouti.

Uncontrolled hunting and habitat destruction have most probably eliminated this species from its historic range in Sudan (East 1999). It still occupies substantial parts of its historical range in Djibouti, Somalia, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, but at lower densities and as isolated populations; numbers in the Ogaden are greatly reduced due to uncontrolled hunting (Wilhelmi <em>et al</em>. 2006).

These dolphins appear to favour continental slope habitat but also occur at lower densities in oceanic and continental shelf waters. The sum of existing abundance estimates is about 350,000 individuals, but as these estimates are from only a small fraction of the total distribution range of the species, actual abundance is likely much higher. Threats that may be causing declines include bycatch in offshore gillnets, pelagic longlines, and other fishing gear. There is little quantitative information on bycatch rates, but it is clear that this species is taken in small or moderate numbers in several countries throughout its range. However, given its wide distribution and considerable abundance, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout the species’ extensive range, the Risso’s Dolphin is assessed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern. There is not enough information to rule out the possibility that the global population has declined by 30% or more over three generations (60 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) and if that were the case it would qualify for listing as Vulnerable. Therefore, further monitoring is encouraged and this assessment should be regarded as provisional, pending better information particularly regarding incidental mortality in fisheries.","<p>Risso’s Dolphins inhabit deep oceanic and continental slope waters, generally 400-1,000 m deep (Baumgartner 1997, Hartman 2017, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, 2014). They frequent sub-surface seamounts and escarpments, where they are thought to feed on vertically migrant and mesopelagic cephalopods. In Monterey Bay, California, Risso's Dolphins are concentrated over areas with steep bottom topography (Kruse 1989). Currents and upwelling causing local increases in marine productivity may enhance feeding opportunities, resulting in the patchy distribution and local abundance of this species worldwide (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). Davis <em>et al</em>. (1998) and Baumgartner (1997) reported that in the Gulf of Mexico, Risso's Dolphins were mostly found along the upper continental slope, which may reflect mesopelagic squid distribution. Most records of Risso’s Dolphins&#160;in Britain and Ireland are within 11 km of the coast. They are known to occur during summer in shallow (occasionally &lt;10m in depth) coastal waters where they feed on Common Cuttlefish (<em>Sepia officinalis)</em> along the French coast of the English Channel (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Long-term changes in the occurrence of Risso’s Dolphins in some areas (e.g., off Catalina Island and in central California) have been linked to ocean conditions and movements of spawning squid (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). Risso's Dolphins mostly feed on mesopelagic and benthic cephalopods, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus (Cockroft <em>et al. </em>1993). In the few areas where feeding habits have been studied, they appear to feed mainly at night (Spitz <em>et al. </em>2011, Wang <em>et al. </em>2012). Risso’s Dolphins likely take advantage of the circadian vertical movements of their prey, particularly mesopelagic squid (Soldevilla <em>et al. </em>2010).</p>","<p>In Sri Lanka, Risso's Dolphins were, at least during the 1980s, the third most commonly taken cetacean in fisheries, providing meat for human consumption and fish bait (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Leatherwood 1994). Around 15% of the estimated 9,000 cetaceans landed annually in Sri Lanka between 1984-1986 were Risso’s Dolphins, most of them having been caught in gillnets or harpooned (Leatherwood 1994). In Japan, Risso's Dolphins are taken regularly by hand harpoon and driving, in set nets, and as a limited catch in the small-type whaling industry, with reported catches in recent years ranging from about 250–500 (Kasuya 2018). In 2007/2008, 246 Risso’s Dolphins were reported to have been taken by the harpoon fishery operating off Hokkaido, Sanriku, Boso, and Kii (Kazuya 2018). They are also a major target of artisanal hunting and are taken incidentally in gillnets and other fishing gear in the Philippines and China (Dolar 1994, Dolar <em>et al</em>. 1994, Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005). Off eastern Taiwan, Risso’s Dolphins are taken opportunistically by harpoon and they are caught incidentally in large-mesh driftnets for large pelagic fish (Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005). In 2012, several groups of Risso’s Dolphins were intentionally killed in the Faroe Islands (Bloch <em>et al. </em>2012) where Long-finned Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala melas</em>) and Atlantic White-sided Dolphins (<em>Lagenorhynchus acutus</em>) are the primary targets of the drive hunt for cetaceans.<br/><br/>Bycatch occasionally occurs in pelagic longline fisheries in the southwestern Indian Ocean and along the U.S. Atlantic coast, particularly since Risso’s Dolphins regularly depredate squid used as bait (Garrison 2007, Kiszka 2015). Between 2011 and 2012, several Risso’s Dolphin deaths were recorded in the pelagic longline fishery based in La Reunion (Sabarros <em>et al. </em>2013). In Tanzania, bycatch has been recorded in drift gillnet fisheries targeting tuna, billfish, sharks, and other large pelagic fish off Zanzibar and Pemba (J. Kiszka, unpublished data). Bycatch in gillnets has also been documented in Ghana, the Azores, Peru, and the Solomon Islands (Bearzi <em>et al. </em>2011, Debrah <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reeves <em>et al. </em>2013). Bycatch rates of Risso’s Dolphins in the Swordfish and Thresher Shark gillnet fishery off California are considered relatively low based on observer data (Carretta and Enriquez 2012).<br/><br/>Like beaked whales (Ziphiidae), which are also deep-divers that prey on cephalopods, Risso’s Dolphins are likely susceptible to disturbance by loud anthropogenic sound, such as that generated by military sonar and seismic surveys (Cox <em>et al. </em>2006, Modest 2015, Southall <em>et al</em>. 2016). They are also exposed to disturbance by whale-watching boats (Visser <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Risso’s Dolphins in the Mediterranean carry substantial contaminant burdens (Kim <em>et al</em>. 1996, Marsili and Focardi 1997).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of global abundance for Risso’s Dolphins, but there are estimates for some specific areas. Surveys off California in 1991 and 1992 found estimated abundance to be almost an order of magnitude higher in winter (N=32,376, coefficient of variation (CV)=46%) than in summer (N=3,980, CV=57%) (Forney and Barlow 1998). The current stock assessment for this species along the Pacific coast of the U.S. was calculated from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys to give an abundance estimate of 6,336 (CV=32%) animals (Barlow 2016). Shipboard line-transect surveys of the Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone in 2010 resulted in an abundance estimate of 7,256 (CV=41%) (Bradford <em>et al.</em> 2013, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Based on surveys conducted from 1986 to 1990, 175,800 (CV=38%) Risso’s Dolphins were estimated in the eastern tropical Pacific (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). The best abundance estimate for Risso’s Dolphins in U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic is 18,250 (CV=46%) based on surveys in 2011 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2016), with an additional 1,589 (CV=27%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico based on surveys in 2003 and 2004 (Waring <em>et al. </em>2009). Aerial surveys on the European continental shelf in summer 2016 (SCANS-III) generated an estimate of 11,069 Risso’s Dolphins (CV=51%), with highest densities off eastern Ireland and northwestern Scotland (Hammond <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>In the northern Indian Ocean, Ballance and Pitman (1998) recorded Risso’s Dolphin as the fourth most abundant cetacean species, in Tanzania in the western Indian Ocean it was the second most frequently encountered species after the Spinner Dolphin (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>) (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is one of the most common species in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). Estimates based on indices of relative abundance of Risso’s Dolphins off Sri Lanka from 1980 to 1984 ranged from 5,500 to 13,000 animals (Kruse <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 1991). Recent surveys suggest a possible decline of Risso’s Dolphins off Sri Lanka, particularly along the south coast (Anderson 2013). In the eastern Sulu Sea in 1994-1995, Dolar <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. (2006) estimated abundance at 1,514 (CV=55%). There were estimated to be 83,300 (CV=17%) Risso’s Dolphins in three areas of concentrated occurrence off Japan between 1983 and 1991 (Miyashita 1993). Extensive aerial surveys conducted in the southwestern Indian Ocean in 2009 and 2010 produced abundance estimates for the Seychelles (17,115 individuals, CV=28%), the Mascarene islands (554, CV=86%), and the northern (298, CV=74%), central (3,107, CV=33%), and southern (3,141, CV=33%) Mozambique Channel (Laran <em>et al. </em>2017). The sum of the above abundance estimates is around 350,000, however, as these surveys covered only a small proportion of the total range of the species, total range-wide abundance is likely to be substantially higher.<br/><br/>There is no information on global trends in abundance. However, decreases may have occurred in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Mullin and Fulling 2004, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009) and along the west coast of the U.S. (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2009). In the late 1950s, Risso's Dolphins were rarely encountered in the Southern California Bight, and between 1975 and 1978 they were still considered to be a minor part of the cetacean fauna, representing only 3% of the cetaceans observed (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). After the El Niño event of 1982/83, however, numbers of Risso's Dolphins increased, especially around Santa Catalina Island where they came to be considered common (Shane 1995). In Sri Lanka, tuna drift gillnet fisheries may have caused a dramatic decline of Risso’s Dolphins (Kruse <em>et al.</em> 1991). The species is currently very rare there, while it was reported as abundant in the 1980s (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Anderson 2013).</p>",Unknown,"The Risso’s Dolphin&#160;is a widely distributed species that primarily inhabits waters of the continental slope and outer shelf (especially areas with steep bottom topography) in the tropics and temperate regions of both hemispheres (Baumgartner 1997, Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999, Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014). It also occurs in oceanic areas (beyond the 2,000 m depth contour) such as in the eastern tropical Pacific, in the northeastern Atlantic (Hammond <em>et al. </em>2017), in the western Indian Ocean and in the northwestern Pacific (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014). In the north of its range, Risso’s Dolphins have also been recorded from Newfoundland, Norway, the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Gulf of Alaska. In the south, they have been recorded off the tip of South Africa, southern Australia, the North Island of New Zealand and to 40-50°S off both coasts of South America (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Their range includes many semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of California, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Sea of Japan, and Mediterranean Sea. In a number of regions, Risso’s Dolphins can be encountered in the shallow waters of the continental shelf, such as in the English Channel (Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2004, 2007) and the Celtic Sea (Reid <em>et al. </em>2003). They are relatively rare along the Atlantic coast of South America (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014).","<p>This species is (or has been) hunted for food in some places around the world, including in the Caribbean, Japan, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. </p>",Marine,"<p>The Risso’s Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

50358152,10831,Inia geoffrensis,Endangered,A2acd+3cd+4acd,2018,2018-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Inia</em> <span class=""apple-converted-space"">was listed on the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable in 1996. This was changed to Data Deficient in 2008 because the information available on threats, ecology, and population numbers and trends was “limited” (Reeves <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2011). However, improved information on all of these aspects is now available and it is clear that the species qualifies for a threatened category.<br/><br/>Although it has long been recognized that <em>Inia</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> die from entanglement (‘bycatch’) in fishing gear over much of their range and that their habitat in many areas has been modified and degraded by human activities in addition to fishing (dam construction, port development, mining, ship traffic, etc.), a relatively new threat has emerged since 2000: the deliberate killing of dolphins for bait in a fishery that expanded rapidly until at least the second decade of this century. That threat has contributed to a precipitous decline in dolphin abundance in the central Brazilian Amazon and a less certain decline in the western Colombian Amazon. These declines, and others inferred or suspected elsewhere in the species’ range, are directly due to human activity, and since the human population in Amazonia, Orinoquia, the Tocantins River basin (which includes the Araguaia River),</span><span class=""st""><sub> </sub><span class=""apple-converted-space"">and the rest of <em>Inia</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">’s range is growing rapidly and fisheries that cause dolphin mortality, either accidentally (bycatch) or deliberately (killing to obtain bait) are likely to continue not only in Brazil but also in the other range states, there is no reason to expect the pressures on the species to diminish unless major changes are made in the political, economic, and human demographic landscape.</span><br/><br/>In a closely monitored index area within the 11,240 km² Mamirauá Reserve (Brazil), the <em>Inia</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> population was estimated to have declined by 70.4% over the last 22 years (da Silva <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2018), a period of slightly less than one generation (24.8 years; Moore <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. 2018). The authors and reviewers of this assessment discussed in detail whether extrapolation of a similar decline rate to other parts of the species range would be justified. The only other area with quantitative data on trend is in the Amazon mainstem near the Colombia-Peru border, where Williams <em>et al</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">. (2016) found evidence suggestive of a decline in abundance between 1993 (well before the direct killing for bait is believed to have begun) and 2007. Although there are no credible estimates of abundance or trend in the vast majority of the species’ range, an overall decline of at least 50% in the total rangewide population over the 75-year (3-generation) period beginning around 2000 is plausible.</span></span></span><br/><br/>The two areas for which trends are available together represent a very small proportion of the species’ total range. However, the likely primary causes of the declines in those areas – directed hunting for bait and as retaliation for perceived competition for fish resources, and accidental mortality due to human fishing practices – are present throughout much of the range of <em>Inia</em>. Other persistent threats that are likely to influence the species' conservation status include habitat fragmentation due to dams and other forms of water basin management, pollution, and a reduction in the availability of prey due to competition with humans.<span class=""apple-converted-space""> Unfortunately, there is no reason to expect documentation of absolute abundance and trends, or the true scale of the threats facing <em>Inia</em>, to become available in the immediate future or even in coming decades, and this makes precautionary reasoning in the assessment of status particularly appropriate.<br/><br/>Based on the above and the other evidence summarized below, it is concluded that <em>Inia</em> is Endangered due to a suspected reduction of 50% or more in total population size over a period of three generations (75 years) that includes the past and the future (from 2000, when directed killing for bait began to proliferate, to 2075): criterion A4. There is evidence of (i) declines in abundance (subcriterion a); (ii) population fragmentation and the deterioration of habitat quality as a result of water basin management (e.g., dam construction), human demographic changes, and economic development (subcriterion c); and (iii) exploitation – i.e., directed hunting to obtain bait and for predator control, together with incidental mortality in fishing gear (subcriterion d). All of the causes of the suspected reduction in population size are continuing and some of them (those related to subcriterion c in particular) may not be reversible due to the increasing human population and the associated increase in demand for resources throughout most of the species’ range.<br/><br/>It is emphasised that if the decline rate estimated for the small part of the central Amazon region (Mamirauá area) were representative of the entire range of <em>Inia</em><span class=""apple-converted-space"">, and if declines were to persist, the species would qualify for Critically Endangered. Because of this possibility, the status should be reconsidered as soon as ongoing research provides improved documentation of trends in population size and extent and severity of threats (e.g., bycatch and killing of dolphins for bait). Also, separate assessments of subspecies and subpopulations, regardless of the clarity of their taxonomic status, is strongly encouraged.</span></p><span class=""apple-converted-space""><p></p>","<p>The biology and ecology of <em>Inia</em> are strongly related to the seasonal variation in water levels (Martin and da Silva 2004b, Martin <em>et al.</em> 2004, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Their physical adaptations allow them to swim into the flooded forests in the high-water season (Layne 1958, Best and da Silva 1989a) in search of prey among the roots and trunks of partially submerged trees (da Silva 1984). Mark/recapture studies have shown that some individuals are resident to specific areas year-round (Martin and da Silva 2004a, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2011), whereas others move several tens to hundreds of kilometres within the rivers, but there does not appear to be any seasonal migration as such (Martin and da Silva 2004a).<br/><br/>The use of habitat by <em>Inia</em> is affected by the water level for all age classes, however habitat preferences differ among age and sex classes (Martin and da Silva 2004b, Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2016). Sexual segregation is common; females with dependent calves spend more time inside the flooded forest and in lakes and small tributaries during the high-water season, while most adult males at any one time occur in the main rivers. The preference of nursing females for lake systems is likely due to factors favourable to calves, such as low current, abundance of small fish, and protection against predation such as by large sharks (Martin and da Silva 2004b). The predominant presence of mother-calf pairs and juveniles in lakes has been observed in much of the species’ range (Trujillo 1997, McGuire and Winemiller 1998, Denkinger 2001). Also, Mintzer <em>et al</em>. (2016) proposed that bays are important habitat for early life stages due to the high productivity, low current, and availability of ample water during the low-water season. Genetic analyses of control region mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites of samples obtained from the Mamirauá Reserve suggested that females have a restricted distribution while males mediate gene flow among groups (Hollatz <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>During the low-water season, <em>Inia</em> are often concentrated below channel confluences (Best and da Silva 1989a,b, Leatherwood 1996, Vidal <em>et al</em>. 1997, McGuire and Winemiller 1998, Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the main rivers they occur most often within 150 m of the banks, with lower densities in the centre of large rivers (Martin <em>et al</em>. 2004a, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2012a). As the water starts rising, their affinity for confluences diminishes, probably because the animals move into appended lakes and flooded forests (Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 2000, Aliaga-Rossel 2002, Martin and da Silva 2004a,b) which become more important habitats during the high-water season due to their high productivity and prey diversity (Martin and da Silva 2004b). When the water is receding, dolphins leave the lakes and the shallow habitats, perhaps in order to avoid getting trapped (Martin and da Silva 2004a,b, Mintzer <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Due to intense intraspecific interactions, <em>Inia</em> bear marks and scars that have potential for being used in photo-identification studies (Martin and da Silva 2006). However, Trujillo (1994), McGuire and Henningsen (2007), and Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> (2014) found that only a small proportion of the population could be identified correctly, not only due to the turbidity of the water, but also because of the behaviour, morphology, and ecological characteristics of the species (McGuire and Henningsen 2007, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2014). Great effort is required to obtain accurate data.<br/><br/><em>Inia</em> feed on more than 43 species of fishes (Best and da Silva 1993, da Silva 2009).</p>","<p>Longstanding threats to <em>Inia</em> include incidental mortality in fishing gear, deliberate killing for fish bait or predator control, damming of rivers, and environmental pollution from organochlorines and heavy metals (see Best and da Silva 1989a,b; da Silva 2009, IWC 2007, Trujillo <em>et al. </em>2010b).<br/><br/> Incidental mortality has not been systematically monitored in most areas but is known to be a major threat throughout the species’ range (Best and da Silva 1989b, Trujillo <em>et al. </em>2010b). Similar to other small cetaceans, <em>Inia</em> are vulnerable to entanglement in a variety of nets (lampara seine nets, fixed gill nets, drifting gill nets) (Best and da Silva 1993, Martin <em>et al</em>. 2004, Siciliano <em>et al.</em> 2016a). They also die in drop traps intended to catch large fish or Amazonian Manatees (<em>Trichechus inunguis</em>) in the flooded forest in Peru (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1999). Carcasses of dolphins with evidence of fishery involvement have been observed in the Japurá and Amazon rivers and in the Orinoco River basin (Iriarte and Marmontel 2013b, Trujillo <em>et al. </em>2010b). The proportion of carcasses found by observers is believed to be very small because most of them would be expected to be taken by scavengers or disposed of by fishermen within hours of death. In Tefé, at least 176 dolphins were estimated to have died in 2010 due to interactions with fisheries (Brum 2011, Brum and da Silva 2016).<br/><br/>The deliberate killing of <em>Inia</em> for use as bait in the Piracatinga fisheries (<span class=""s1"">Estupinan <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2003, da Silva and Martin 2007, 2017; Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2008, Trujillo <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2010b, da Silva <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2011, Mintzer <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2013, Iriarte and Marmontel 2013a, Brum <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2015) is probably the most serious human-caused threat to this species, though incidental drowning in monofilament fishing nets is also likely to cause widespread mortality. The directed hunt, which appears to have begun in Brazil, has been noticed since around 2000 when it was believed to be expanding to other regions. The government of Brazil reported the killing of 354 dolphins in 2006 but this number is thought to be an underestimate because it was solely based on interviews with fishermen (IWC 2007). Estimates of the numbers of dolphins killed are very difficult to obtain, and those that have been attempted have varied between 300 dolphins/year in just one area (Tefé, Brazil) to more than 4,000 dolphins/year for the whole Brazilian state of Amazonas (Serrano <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2007, da Silva <em>et al. </em><span class=""s1"">2011, Brum <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2014). An evaluation of the Piracatinga fishery suggested that almost 1,200 tons of this fish was traded from Brazil to Colombia every year and that a substantial proportion of the catch was made using dolphins for bait. The main market was formerly in Colombia, but for the years 2008-2014 this fish was also sold in the states of Amazonas, São Paulo, Bahia, Minas Gerais, and elsewhere in Brazil under the name of “Douradinha” among others (Flores <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2008, Trujillo <em>et al</em><span class=""s1"">. 2010b,c; Brum <em>et al</em><span class=""s1"">. 2015, Cunha <em>et al</em><span class=""s1"">. 2015). </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br/><br/>Despite a ban on commercial Piracatinga fishing introduced by the Brazilian government in 2015, there is evidence that this activity continues (da Silva and Martin 2017). It is important to emphasize that this directed hunting is in addition to the longstanding problems of bycatch (see above) and control killing (see below) and the directed hunting to obtain bait may be widespread in areas where Piracatinga are common, mainly in areas close to Colombia, the main market center (Trujillo <em>et al. </em>2010b, Brum <em>et al. </em>2015). Killing of dolphins for use as bait has also been confirmed in Venezuela (Aya <em>et al. </em>2010, Diniz 2011) and reported in media and unpublished reports in Peru (F. Trujillo, unpublished data) and Bolivia (M. Escobar-WW, G. Rey Ortiz, C. Coca Mendez, L. Cordova and P.A. Van Damme, pers. comm).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk503964763""><em>Inia</em></a> are also killed deliberately in some areas because they damage fishing nets and are regarded as competitors for fishery resources (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1999, Araújo and Wang 2012, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2016, Siciliano <em>et al.</em> 2016a). At least one dolphin found dead at Tefé Lake, Brazil, had injuries consistent with an intentional human attack (Loch <em>et al. </em>2009). Similar conflicts have been reported in Colombia (Bonilla <em>et al. </em>2008, Trujillo <em>et al.</em> 2010b).<br/><br/>Fishing with explosives, although illegal in most countries, was common in some areas of the Amazon Basin. In Venezuela, this practice is still in use and has been reported as a threat to river dolphins due to the concussive effects (Aya <em>et al. </em>2010). Fishermen also reportedly attempt to kill dolphins that are attracted to fishing operations to prey on stunned or dead fish (Best and da Silva 1989a). At least in Peru, fishermen attempt to kill dolphins by injecting live fish with toxins and tossing them into the water near the animals (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1999, McGuire and Aliaga-Rossel 2010). The killing of 22 <em>Inia</em> in Caballo Cocha, Peru, was reported in 2008 (F. Trujillo, unpub. data).<br/><br/>Water development projects are another major concern and an increasing threat to <em>Inia</em> (Araújo and Wang 2014, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015, Pavanato <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Brazilian Amazon alone, 91 dams are planned that, if constructed, would flood about 10 million hectares, representing approximately 2% of the Legal Amazon region and about 3% of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon forest. Added to these, 74 dams are already in operation and 31 are under construction. Over 400 dams could be constructed in the Amazon basin eventually (Finer and Jenkins 2012). Despite the high number of operating dams and projects in the Amazon region today and knowing that dolphins occur above and below rapids in some rivers, of the 83 rivers with operating hydroelectric dams in Brazil only 13 had any kind of study involving <em>Inia</em> (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015). Most of these studies have shown that the dams fragmented, isolated, and eliminated connectivity of dolphin populations (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 1998, Araújo and Wang, 2014, Pavanato <em>et al</em>. 2016). Dams in the Amazon basin, and the Guri and Tocoma dams in the Caroní, an Orinoco tributary, have probably degraded downstream habitat due to their effects on flow and temperature regimes although in the short term, observations of dolphins feeding on concentrations of fish immediately downstream of some dams may be seen as “beneficial,” especially if protective measures are better enforced there (Araújo and Wang 2014). Additional dams are bound to restrict dolphin movements, contribute to more fragmentation of populations, and continue to alter and degrade the habitat by opening commercialization networks, improving navigability, and increasing road access (Best and da Silva 1989a, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Chemical contamination is another potential threat to <em>Inia</em>. Mercury is often used to separate gold from soil and rock in mining operations along the Amazon. A study of mercury in the sediments and floating plants in the Tucuruí Reservoir in the Tocantins River, Brazil, emphasized the risk of mercury accumulation in the bed of non-flowing waters. Total mercury content in dolphin milk from one individual sampled near the city of Manaus (176 ng/ml = 0.176 ppm) was considered close to the minimum level of methylmercury toxicity in human adults (Rosas and Lehti 1996). Recent evaluations of mercury in river dolphins have been carried out in the Amazon and Orinoco basins. Concentration values <span lang=""EN-CA"">​​of total mercury in river dolphin muscle from the Amazon and Orinoco basins varied from 0.003 to 3.990 mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> Hg, with the highest values found for <em>Inia</em> from the Orinoco (Trujillo <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>High concentrations of organochlorine compounds (DDT, PCB, HCH, HCB, Mirex) and organobrominated compounds (PBDE) were also found in <em>Inia</em> samples from different areas of Brazil, including the Solimões, Japurá, Negro, and Madeira rivers (Torres <em>et al.</em> 2007, José Lailson pers. comm. 2018). All milk samples (n=62) from dolphins in the Mamirauá Reserve contained evidence of organochlorine accumulation (PCBs were present in 100% of the samples, DDT in 64%, HCHs in 95%, HCB in 64%, and Mirex in 66%) (José Lailson pers. comm. 2018). Pesticide concentrations measured in these samples were similar to those verified in the milk of other aquatic mammals and humans, indicating substantial exposure of calves to organochlorines at a critical developmental stage. The effects of bioaccumulation of mercury and other chemical contaminants in dolphins are unknown but the high levels recorded in the Amazon ecosystem are a reason for concern.<br/><br/>The Tocantins-Araguaia Basin has been significantly altered over the past few decades by dams, deforestation for cattle ranching, logging, road building, and the use of Agent Orange to clear pathways for power lines (Siciliano <em>et al.</em> 2016b). In addition, unregulated feeding and touching of wild dolphins by visitors and locals occurs near Mocajuba on the lower Tocantins River (Melo-Santos <em>et al</em>. 2015). Human feeding can be a health risk for the dolphins and also increase their risk to vessel strikes.</p>      <p></p>","<p>There is limited information on population structure of <em>Inia</em> throughout their range. The taxonomy is not completely resolved and the taxonomic status of the currently recognized subspecies <em>I. g. boliviensis</em> and the putative new species <em>I. araguaiaensis</em> needs further evaluation.<br/><br/>There is no range-wide estimate of abundance or trends in abundance. Surveys have been conducted since 1979 in various areas within the species’ range in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. Some of these studies resulted in estimates of abundance for relatively small areas. The estimates varied from a few dozen to a few thousand individuals (e.g., Vidal <em>et al</em>., 1997, Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2012b, Pavanato <em>et al.</em> 2016, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2016) depending on the size of the survey area, but the interpretation of these estimates in the context of this assessment is difficult given potential biases associated with the different survey methods used and the limited understanding of the movements and the population structure of the species across different parts of its range including the entire Amazon system, the Araguaia-Tocantins system, and the Orinoco system. A multi-season survey of dolphins in the 11,240 km² Mamirauá reserve between 1999 and 2001 (i.e., before the rapid decline referred to below) estimated <em>Inia</em> abundance at 13,000 (Martin and da Silva 2004a). A range-wide program to estimate abundance was carried out from 2006 to 2016, involving 26 expeditions and covering nearly 28,000 km of rivers in all range states. Some of the results of this program revealed that density was low in rivers in Ecuador and in parts of the Orinoco River whereas densities were relatively high in rivers such as the Itenez/Guaporé at the border of Brazil and Bolivia and the Samiria River in Peru (Gómez-Salazar <em>et al.</em> 2012a,b; Pavanatto <em>et al</em>. 2016, Williams <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/><br/>Trends in abundance have been assessed in only two small geographical locations (relative to the vast total range of the species), as follows. Standardized transect surveys were conducted in the Amazon River in Colombia in 1993 (covering 259.7 km²) (Vidal <em>et al.</em> 1997), 2002 (276.7 km²) (Gómez-Salazar <em>et al. </em>2012a,b), and 2007 (592.6 km²). In analysing these data, Williams <em>et al</em>. (2016) used a Bayesian framework to estimate the probability of a decline conditional on a range of priors for process variance to accommodate the fact that the data were collected from three independent survey programs rather than from a single coordinated program, and as a way of attempting to account for uncertainty associated with seasonal movements. The probability of a decline was estimated to be greater than 0.75. A bootstrapped regression analysis to estimate the rate of decline revealed “no compelling evidence of population growth or decline for this species using this method.”<br/><br/>Standardized transect surveys conducted monthly since 1994 in the Brazilian Amazon (in and around the 11,240 km²<sup> </sup>Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve) revealed that between 2000 (the year in which a rapidly expanding fishery for the Piracatinga<em> </em>(<em>Calophysus macropterus)</em>, a species of economically valuable catfish, using dolphin carcasses as a source of bait began in Brazil) and January 2017 there was an annual average rate of decline in <em>Inia</em> encounters of 6.7% (95% confidence interval 5.7-7.7%) in the Mamirauá study area, which implies a halving of the population each decade (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2018). Further exploration of these data revealed that the overall decline between 2000 and 2017 was driven primarily by a precipitous decline between 2000 and the following decade.<br/><br/>There is evidence that the survival of <em>Inia</em> that spend at least some of their time in the Mamirauá study area but range more widely may have been affected by the Piracatinga fishery. Time-dependent models estimated that apparent annual survival rate of dolphins after the first reports of directed hunting (0.899; standard error (SE) 0.007) was significantly lower than in years prior to the hunting (0.968; SE 0.009). This decline in apparent survival suggests that current (or at least recent) removal rates exceed conservation limits and are unsustainable (Mintzer <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p><p></p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p><em>Inia</em> occur throughout the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, from the deltas upstream to where impassable rapids, waterfalls, lack of water, and possibly low temperatures block their movement (Best and da Silva 1989a,b). In Brazil, they have been recorded in the central region, in the Araguaia-Tocantins River basin and in several tributaries such as the das Mortes and Verde, Paranã, Vermelho, Peixe, Crixas-Açú, and Água Limpa rivers and the dos Tigres and Rico lakes, all in the state of Goiás. They occur in Lake Montaria in the state of Mato Grosso, the Araguaia-Tocantins River basin, as well as mangrove habitats in Marajó Bay (Araújo and Wang 2012, Araújo and da Silva 2014, Hrbek <em>et al</em>. 2014, Siciliano <em>et al</em>. 2016a,b). <em>Inia</em> have also been observed in the following rivers and tributaries of the Amazon basin in Brazil – Juruá, Purus, Madeira, Tapajós, Xingu (only below Belo Monte falls), Içá, Caquetá-Japurá, Negro-Branco and Trombetas. In addition, in Brazil they have been reported along the Madeira mainstem above and below the Teotônio rapids (Gravena <em>et al.</em> 2014a). In Bolivia, they have been reported from the Beni (and Orton tributaries), Iténez or Guaporé (the Brazilian name) Basin (Verde, Machupo and Iporuporé tributaries), and Mamoré Basin and its tributaries -- Pirai, Grande, Ichilo, Chapare, Ibaré, Matucaré, Tijamuchi, Apere, Yacuma, and Yata (Pilleri and Gihr 1977, Aliaga-Rossel <em>et al.</em> 2006, Aliaga-Rossel 2010). In Colombia, they occur in the Orinoco and Amazon systems – in the Caquetá-Japurá River, from the Araracuara rapids to the mouth of the Apaporis River at the border with Brazil, the Putumayo-Içá River from Puerto Leguizamo to the east, and in the Amazon River. In the Orinoco, they are found in the rivers Meta, Arauca, Casanare, Bita, Vichada, Tomo, Tuparro, Orinoco, Guaviare (and the Guayabero affluent), Inírida, and Atabapo. <em>Inia</em> have been seen crossing the first set of rapids at Puerto Ayacucho (Atures-River Orinoco) during high water<strong> </strong>as well as the Cordoba rapids in the Caquetá River during low water (Trujillo <em>et al.</em> 2010c). In Ecuador, they are widely distributed in the main rivers and some lacustrine systems at elevations below 260 m in the rivers Payamino (near Napo River), Napo, Pastaza, Tigre, and Santiago (Best and da Silva 1993, Trujillo and Diazgranado 2002, Utreras <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Ecuadorian Amazon, the only important river system in which <em>Inia</em> have not been recorded is the Morona River (Utreras 2001). In Peru, they can be found in the Ucayali and Marañon (and Samiria affluent) tributaries flowing generally north, and in the Napo, Tigre, and Pastaza tributaries flowing generally south (partial list from Best and da Silva 1989a,b; Leatherwood 1996, McGuire and Aliaga-Rossel 2010, Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Venezuela, they occur in the Orinoco system – in the delta region upstream at Ciudad Bolivar, Caicara del Orinoco, and near Puerto Ayacucho as well as in the Apure, Portuguesa, Guanare, Guaritico, Capanaparo, Cinaruco, and Caura rivers (Portocarrero-Aya <em>et al.</em> 2010). They occur in the Cassiquiare Canal, which connects the Orinoco with the Negro River (a tributary of the Amazon in Brazil), and also above and below the two sets of rapids at Puerto Ayacucho, which may (or may not) separate the Amazon and Orinoco populations (as summarized in Pilleri and Gihr 1977, Best and da Silva 1989a,b; Meade and Koehnken 1991). </p><p>  The map shows where the species occurs or may occur. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are included in the list of native range states.</p><p></p>","<p>Indigenous people in some parts of the Amazon may have hunted <em>Inia</em> for food in the past but such hunting is not known to have been common or widespread. There is no market for or frequent use of dolphins for human consumption, at least in the Brazilian Amazon (Alves <em>et al.</em> 2012) and in the Orinoco basin (Trujillo <em>et al.</em> 2010b).<br/><br/>Since the 1950s and into at least the 1970s, numerous <em>Inia</em> were live-captured and exported, mostly to the U.S.A. and Europe (Allen and Neill 1957, Layne 1958, Layne and Caldwell 1964, Caldwell and Caldwell 1989). Two animals went to Japan (Tobayama and Kamiya 1989). Some have also been brought into captivity in South America. In Venezuela, the Valencia Aquarium kept wild-caught<em> </em>dolphins in captivity for display from the 1970s and into at least the mid-1990s (Boede 1990, Boede <em>et al.</em> 1998). No live-captures or exports have been reported in recent years. <br/><br/>In markets around Amazonian cities in Brazil, it is possible to find products labeled as being from Botos, such as eyes and genitals, dry or in perfume solutions, to be used as love charms. This is despite the fact that such commercialization of <em>Inia</em> products violates Federal law. Recent molecular studies have revealed that these products are mainly either from domestic animals such as pigs and sheep (Gravena <em>et al.</em> 2008) or from Guiana Dolphins (<em>Sotalia guianensis</em>) from the coasts of Pará and Amapá States that were caught in fishing nets and sold by the fishermen (Santos <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/><em>Inia</em><span class=""s1""> have been used as bait in a fishery for a scavenging catfish, the Piracatinga, in Brazil since 2000 (Estupinan <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2003, da Silva <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2011). In the Japurá River, on the border with the Mamirauá and Amanã Sustainable Development Reserves, Iriarte and Marmontel (2013a) confirmed 114 Piracatinga fishing events in eight communities during one year, from which 32 events (31%) used dolphins as bait. Near Mamirauá Reserve, on the Solimões River, all interviewed Piracatinga fishermen (N=17) confirmed using dolphins as bait for this activity, while on the Purus River, 70% of 40 Piracatinga fishermen interviewed in 24 communities also confirmed using them as bait (Brum <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2015). Records of these practices throughout the Amazon mainstem (between Manaus and Tabatinga) and the widespread sale of Piracatinga in the region (Cunha <em>et al.</em><span class=""s1""> 2015) suggest extensive use of <em>Inia</em><span class=""s1""> as a source of fish bait not only in Brazil but also in other parts of the species range (see the Threats section).</span></span></span></p><span class=""s1""><span class=""s1""><span class=""s1""><span class=""s1""><p></p></span></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>In July 2014, the Federal Government of Brazil published a rule (Normative Interministerial nº 6/2014) establishing a five-year moratorium on the fishing and marketing of <a name=""_Hlk485920902"">the Piracatinga </a>in Brazilian waters, effective from January 2015, intended to reduce the pressure on dolphins and other wild species (especially caimans, <em>Caiman </em>spp.) used for bait in this fishery (ICMBio-CEPAM 2017,&#160;IWC 2016). The report of the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee in 2016 stated the following (IWC 2017:355): “The Ministry of Environment (MMA) is responsible for evaluating the success of the moratorium. A working group was established by the MMA … to define procedures and monitor the fishing and marketing of piracatinga during the moratorium period. … three inspections to assess compliance with the ban were completed in 2016 and included: ‘Routine Operation’ in the municipalities of Iranduba, Itacoatiara, Manacapurú and Manaus in February, ‘Operation Golden Dragon’ in the municipalities of Maraã, Tefé and Fonte Boa in March-April and ‘Operation Federal Rios’ in the municipalities of Jutaí, Tabatinga, Coari, Fonte Boa and Tefé also in March-April.” The report went on to note (IWC 2017:355): “Brazil has established a National Action Plan for the Conservation of Small Cetaceans which lists <em>Inia geoffrensis </em>as an endangered species. This plan is intended to reduce human impacts and increase knowledge on small cetaceans in Brazil. Furthermore, the Brazil Government is cooperating with Colombia and Peru to support sustainable development of fishing activities. Several meetings and workshops involving these countries have included discussions on the catch and sale of piracatinga."" Based on documentation of high levels of mercury in Piracatinga, the government of Colombia announced in August 2017 a permanent ban on the trade of this fish within the country.<br/><br/>The status of<em> </em><em>Inia</em> has been evaluated in different range states during the last 10 years following the IUCN criteria and those national assessments have classified the species as Endangered (Trujillo <em>et al</em>. 2006, Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tirira 2011, Rodríguez and Rojas-Suarez 2015). Additionally, a South American River Dolphins Action Plan (Trujillo <em>et al</em>. 2010a) and national action plans has been produced for Bolivia (2012), Ecuador (Utreras <em>et al.</em> 2013), and Colombia (Trujillo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Action plans for Peru and Venezuela are in preparation. In Colombia, there are also regional action plans for the Orinoco and Amazon basins (Trujillo <em>et al</em>. 2008, Mosquera <em>et al</em>. 2016).

Another recent decline of approximately 70% in a large part of the species’ range (Yellow Sea, Korea) provides an index of decline (subcriterion b) that may apply throughout many unsurveyed portions of the range. Although the rate of decline in such areas can only be inferred, there is no evidence that threats differ substantially. The scale of threats is large enough over enough of the range to suspect and infer a decline of at least 50% over the last three generations (45 years; Moore 2015) (A2), over three generations into the future (A3), and over a three-generation period that includes both the past and the future (A4). The factor most responsible for such decline is incidental mortality in fisheries (subcriterion d), but the loss and degradation of habitat (including chemical pollution; subcriteria c and e) and vessel strikes (at least in the Yangtze River system; Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013) are contributing factors as well. The primary causes of the suspected/inferred decline in population size—bycatch in fishing gear and mortality from vessel strikes (both interpreted here as “exploitation”), decline in habitat quality, and possibly pollution—have not ceased, may not be well understood, and may not all be reversible.<br/><br/>As the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission concluded after a review of the species (at the time with no recognized species-level distinction between <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>) in 2005 (IWC 2006), “human populations adjacent to the Finless Porpoise’s habitat are increasing in size and becoming more industrialised so the expectation should be that anthropogenic pressures will continue and intensify.” None of the threats has been seriously addressed or mitigated in any part of the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise’s range, even though threat levels are likely increasing. Partly because of their small size, phocoenids are exceptionally vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets (e.g., Jefferson and Curry 1994). Incidental mortality in fishing gear is either known or presumed to occur throughout the range of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1997, IWC 2006).<br/><br/>There is clear evidence of a declining trend in three major parts of this species’ range. In the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, a decline of nearly 70% was estimated over a period of 22 years, from 1976-1978 to 1999-2000 (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002, also see Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). There is also evidence of a rapid decline in recent decades in the Yangtze River and adjoining lake systems of China (Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2008, Wang 2009, Zhao <em>et al</em>. 2012) with a 60% decline in the six years between 2006 and 2012 (Mei <em>et al</em>. 2014); the subspecies there (<em>N. a. asiaeorientalis</em>) was classified as Endangered in 1996 and uplisted to Critically Endangered in 2013 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2013). Finally, there is recent evidence suggesting a decline of approximately 70% in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in the Korean portion of the Yellow Sea between the early 2000s and 2011 (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015), and there is no reason to believe this decline has been reversed.<br/><br/>There is sufficient information for separate assessment of at least two threatened subpopulations – the subpopulation in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan, which likely qualifies for Endangered or Critically Endangered (Hashimoto et al. 2015), and the Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Japan) subpopulation, which likely qualifies for at least Vulnerable (Hashimoto et al. 2015).<br/><p></p>","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are found mainly in coastal waters, including shallow bays, possibly mangrove swamps, estuaries, and some large rivers. However, they can also occur in shallow waters (&lt;200 m deep) quite far from shore (up to 240 km). They appear to have a strong preference for waters with a sandy or soft bottom (Jefferson and Hung 2004).<br/> <br/> In Japanese waters, Finless Porpoises prefer shallow depths (&lt;50 m) and close proximity to the shore (&lt;5 km). In the shallow East China Sea, proximity to the shore does not appear to be as important (Amano 2009). </p>  Small fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (mainly demersal species) form the diet of Finless Porpoises (Jefferson and Hung 2004).","<p>Finless Porpoises, like other phocoenids (Jefferson and Curry 1994), are extremely susceptible to entanglement in gillnets, and large numbers have been, and continue to be, killed in many parts of their range.</p>  <p>In Japan, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises become entangled in a variety of types of fishing gear (Amano 2009). Changes in fishing methods and the use of acoustic deterrents may have reduced the incidental catch in some areas such as western Kyushu (Kasuya 1999, Amano <em>et al.</em> 2017), but substantial numbers are still being taken in gillnets and other fishing gear. A total of 114 specimens were collected in Japan during 1985–1992 from western and north-eastern Kyushu including parts of the western Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 1993): 84 (73%) of them had been killed incidentally in fisheries, 25 had been found dead on the beach or in the sea, and there was no information on the other five. Fishing gears that killed the 84 porpoises were bottom-set gillnets (58), surface gillnets (17), trap nets (7), trawl nets (1) and drifting (ghost) nets (1). Such fishing gears are common in Japan and probably kill Finless Porpoises off other coasts, although usually such catches go unreported. Shirakihara and Shirakihara (2013) estimated 238-270 Finless Porpoises are bycaught annually in Ariake Sound and Tachibana Bay.</p>  <p>In Korea (information is available only from the Republic of Korea), an official reporting system implemented in 2011 resulted in a count of 2,107 Finless Porpoises bycaught inshore, mainly along the west coast, in 2012 (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2013). Although reporting apparently has improved, there is still assumed to be substantial under-reporting for the following reasons according to Park <em>et al</em>. (2015): “First, each Finless Porpoise caught in a fish­ing net costs approximately $100 (100,000 Wons) [<em>sic</em>]. Therefore, the dead porpoise can be discarded because it has no signifi­cant value. Second, the bycatch of Finless Porpoises is usually reported only in large harbours, with deaths in smaller ports seldom reported (Kim <em>et al</em>., 2013). Therefore, it is likely that the impact of the bycatch of Finless Porpoises on its population is underestimated.”</p>  <p>Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported that Finless Porpoises were the most frequently captured cetaceans in fishing gear along the Chinese coast and estimated that more than 2,000 were taken in 1994, mainly in trawl, gill, and stow nets. In the waters of western Taiwan, including the Matsu and Chinmen Islands (western Taiwan Strait), a considerable number of Finless Porpoises are taken in trammel nets, trawl nets, stow nets, and other gear (J. Y. Wang unpublished data). Given the numbers and types of net fisheries in Chinese coastal waters (e.g., Zhou and Wang 1994, Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999), there are serious concerns about the level of bycatch of both Finless Porpoise species. Illegal electric fishing became widespread in the Yangtze River during the 1990s, and it may kill porpoises outright and certainly contributes to the depletion of their prey (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2000).</p>  <p>In some parts of their range, there is an aversion to eating Finless Porpoises (Kasuya 1999, J. Y. Wang unpublished data). However, there is a long history of porpoises taken incidentally being sold for human consumption in at least some parts of Japan (e.g., Mizue <em>et al.</em> 1965) and on the Korean peninsula (IWC 2000). According to M. Amano (pers. comm.), consumption of Finless Porpoises no longer occurs in Japan. An analysis of the species composition of odontocete products in Korean markets during 2003–2004 estimated that the true catch of Finless Porpoises in Korean waters during this period was probably about four times the officially reported catch of 142 animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/> <br/> As coastal and riverine animals, Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are also affected by habitat loss and degradation, boat traffic, and pollution. The extensive modification of coastlines for shrimp farming and rampant harbour (and other) development throughout East Asia means that there is less habitat for Finless Porpoises (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Porpoise habitat in the Yangtze River system has been degraded by water development, including the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams and about 1,300 smaller dams in tributaries (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2000, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2000). Sand mining is intensive in Poyang Lake, until recently a stronghold for Yangtze Finless Porpoises (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). Sand mining is also thought to have played a significant role in the severe decline of Finless Porpoises in the central and eastern Seto Inland Sea, Japan (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Although pathology related to contaminant exposure has not been reported in Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises, pollution is considered a potentially serious threat (Kasuya 1999, Kannan <em>et al</em>. 1989, Iwata <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1995; Le <em>et al</em>. 1999, Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). A mass die-off of at least 249 Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises along the Saemangeum dike area of the western Korean Peninsula was reported by Park <em>et al.</em> (2012) who speculated that the cause was unusually low temperatures. However, there have been news reports of large (&gt;100) kills of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in local coastal fisheries, so it may be difficult to rule out human activities as a causal factor in such large-scale die-offs.</p>  <p>A survey of levels and drivers of human-caused mortality carried out in 27 fishing settlements along the middle-lower Yangtze channel identified three main categories of observed porpoise deaths: (1) interaction with fishing gear, (2) vessel strikes, and (3) unknown cause (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2013). A total of 344 dated porpoise mortality events directly observed by informants between 1950 and 2008 were reported, including 75 porpoise deaths from 1989–1998 and 147 from 1999–2008. This apparent increase was said to be driven by the greater number of deaths attributed to vessel strikes (19 to 35) and unknown causes (31 to 94) in the more recent decade. Comparison of the reported mortality with the estimated abundance suggests that the fraction of individuals removed from the declining porpoise population in the Yangtze had quadrupled over the course of two decades. Turvey <em>et al</em>. concluded that entanglement in rolling hook long-lines was probably responsible for the greatest number of porpoise deaths in fishing gear and that vessel strikes and other anthropogenic factors, such as electrofishing, had become the dominant and increasing causes of mortality in the Yangtze.</p>  The causes of an apparent decline in Finless Porpoise numbers in the Seto Inland Sea of Japan are not fully understood, but include incidental mortality in fisheries as well as various forms of habitat degradation (IWC 2000, 2006). Parts of the coastal regions of the Inland Sea are highly developed and industrialized, so the associated threats of habitat loss (e.g., from reclamation and sand mining) and pollution are suspected to have had some (undetermined) level of impact (Kasuya <em>et al.</em> 2002).","<p>Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises are small and cryptic and therefore difficult to survey. Estimates of abundance have been made for only a few areas (IWC 2006). Estimates from the early 2000s are available for five subpopulations in Japanese waters, distinguished on the basis of skull morphology and mtDNA variability (Yoshida <em>et al.</em> 1995, Yoshida 2002), as follows: 3,807 (coefficient of variation (CV) 16%) in Ariake Sound/Tachibana Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 289 (CV 19%) in Omura Bay (Shirakihara and Shirakihara 2002); 3,743 (CV 24%) in Ise/Mikawa Bay (Yoshida 2002); 3,387 (CV 33%) in Chiba/Sendai Bay (Amano <em>et al</em>. 2003); and 7,572 (CV 17%) in the Inland Sea (Shirakihara <em>et al</em>. 2007). Most of the estimates were summarized in IWC (2006). For the Inland Sea subpopulation, Kasuya <em>et al</em>. (2002) recorded a decline in sighting rate of 18-100% for 18 tracklines surveyed in 1976–78 and again in 1999–2000. The declines for 11 of the tracklines were statistically significant. Using abundance indices calculated by multiplying the density indices (no. individuals/cruise distance) and area size of each stratum, an overall decline of 69% is inferred over the 22 years between the two sets of surveys (T. Kasuya pers. comm. 2007, data from Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/> <br/> Surveys in western Korean waters (Yellow Sea) in the early 2000s estimated 21,532 (CV 39%) Finless Porpoises in offshore waters and 5,464 (CV 20%) in inshore waters (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) considered these estimates to be negatively biased (IWC 2006). More recent surveys resulted in density estimates of 0.122 individuals/km<span class=""A78"">² (offshore) and 0.151 ind./km² (inshore), both much lower than the corresponding estimates from surveys in 2004 (offshore, 0.565 ind./km²) and 2005 (inshore, 0.638 ind./km²) (Park <em>et al</em>. 2015). Park <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that these results indicated a decline in abundance of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in this region of approximately 70% between 2004/2005 and 2011.<br/> <br/> Based on surveys from 1984 to 1991, Zhang <em>et al</em>. (1993) estimated that there were about 2,700 porpoises in the Yangtze River, while Zhou <em>et al</em>. (2000) estimated that only 700 remained in the lower reaches between Nanjing and Hukou between 1989 and 1992. Wang <em>et al</em>. (2000) concluded that Finless Porpoise abundance in the Yangtze River had declined considerably and that there could be fewer than 2,000 animals (although this was not based on a rigorous assessment). A two-vessel survey of the Yangtze mainstem in 2006 yielded an estimate of 1,225 (CV 0.13) which, when combined with earlier estimates for Poyang and Dongting Lakes, was interpreted as implying an overall number of about 1,800 in the Yangtze system (Zhao <em>et al. </em>2008). In some portions of the river where porpoises had been reported to be present in the past, none were seen during the 2006 survey (Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2012). Previous estimates of the annual rate of decline of Yangtze Finless Porpoises varied from 5 to 7.3% (see Wang 2009 for a review). However, a survey of the mainstem Yangtze in 2012 determined that only approximately 500 porpoises remained (Mei <em>et al.</em> 2014), indicating a roughly 60% decline in the main river in six years. However, Yangtze River cetacean surveys have been plagued by variable methods and coverage, and therefore decline rates must be viewed with some level of caution.<br/> <br/> There are no abundance estimates for Finless Porpoises in Chinese marine waters other than Hong Kong (IWC 2006), which in any event refer to for <em>N. phocaenoides</em> and not <em>N. asiaeorientalis</em>.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The type specimen was from the Yangtze River, Kiangsu [=Jiangsu] Province, China, ~129 km (80 miles) northwest of Shanghai (Pilleri and Gihr 1972).<br/> <br/> In general, this species occurs in a narrow strip of shallow (usually &lt;50 m deep) coastal water around the western Pacific Ocean from the Taiwan Strait to the waters of northern China, Korea and northern Honshu, Japan.

These estimates are very approximate, and are derived from largely expert assessment and from the extent of known resident Cheetah range multiplied by density, however, they constitute the best available information. The global population estimate can be broken down regionally into an estimated 4,190 adults in Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a, in prep.); 1,960 adults in Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); 440 adults in Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012); and 80 adults in Iran (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). &#160;There is only a single subpopulation with an estimated size of more than 1,000 individuals, and only one additional subpopulation larger than 500, the remaining 27 known subpopulations are estimated to hold less than 500 individuals. Additional areas where Cheetah status is poorly known are unlikely to raise the total to over 10,000.<br/><br/>Generation time for a Cheetah is estimated at 4.9 years using the formula GL = Rspan*z +AFR (Pacifici<em>&#160;et al. </em>2013). AFR =age at first reproduction 2 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004); Rspan = reproductive lifespan, which is the age at last reproduction 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004) - age of first reproduction 2 years = 10 years; z = 0.29, and is a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). Three Cheetah generations are thus approximately 15 years.<br/><br/>Because of the difficulty in estimating density for a wide ranging scarce carnivore like the Cheetah, there is little accurate information on population decline. In Africa we estimate that known resident Cheetah range today occupies 2,709,054 km<sup>2</sup>, while historic range was 25,344,648 km<sup>2</sup> - a decline of 89%. This decline in range is primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation; killing and capture of Cheetahs due to livestock depredation; and loss of prey (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Illegal trade is likely to have a big impact in some areas, notably the Horn of Africa (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>If we assume the bulk of this decline was exponential at a fixed percentage per year and started 100 years ago (at the onset of rapid anthropogenic environmental change), then this amounts to a loss of range of 2.26% per year. This constant rate of decline results in an estimated resident range of 3,643,882 km<sup>2</sup> in 1999, three Cheetah&#160;generations ago (15 years). This results in an estimated decline of 29% resident range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>While some of unknown range and probable range may contain Cheetah, which would increase the estimated resident's range, this is unlikely to make a substantial change. If probable resident range is included with resident range (total 4,804,254 km<sup>2</sup>), this results in a 22% decline from historical range over the last three Cheetah generations.<br/><br/>However, it is unlikely that the rate of decline in Cheetah range has remained constant over the last 100 years. Drivers of decline, such as conflict, loss of prey, habitat change, are likely to have decreased disproportionately with range occupancy (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durant<em> et al.</em> 2014), resulting in a recent acceleration in range collapse. Thus, a decline of at least 30% in abundance and extent of occurrence is strongly suspected over the last three Cheetah generations, and a decline of at least 10% is likely over the next three generations.<br/><br/>Subspecies in Iran (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) and northwest Africa (<em>A. j. heckii</em>) are listed as Critically Endangered. &#160;The Cheetah is also assessed as Critically Endangered in the region of North and West Africa.</p>","In Africa, Cheetahs are found in a wide range of habitats and ecoregions, ranging from dry forest and thick scrub through to grassland and hyperarid deserts, such as the Sahara (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012; Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014). They are only absent from tropical and montane forest, although there are reports of Cheetah at altitudes of 4,000 m on Mt Kenya (Young and Evans 1993). In Iran, Cheetah habitat consists of desert, much of it with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm. There, the terrain in which Cheetah are found ranges from plains and saltpans to eroded foothills, and rugged desert ranges that rise to an elevation of up to 2,000-3,000 m (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c), a landscape not dissimilar to the mountains of the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Cheetah appear to show relatively low habitat selectivity compared with other carnivores (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010a), although there is variation between females of differing reproductive status (Pettorelli<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Cheetahs are the fastest land mammals, and have been documented as reaching speeds up to 103 km per hour (29 meters per second) (Sharp 1997). However, in real hunting situations, where Cheetah may be slowed down because of weaving prey and the need to circumvent obstacles, actual speeds may be much lower than this (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2013a, b). Cheetahs make use of their high speeds to catch their prey, but they are unable to sustain top speeds for much more than a few hundreds of metres. They take a wide variety of prey, principally small- to mid-sized ungulates, especially gazelle, kob and impala. But their prey can range from ground-dwelling birds and small mammals, such as hares, up to large ungulates such as wildebeest, kudu or eland (Purchase and du Toit 2000, Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003, Mills <em>et al. </em>2004, Cooper <em>et al. </em>2007, Hilborn <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Iran opportunistic recovery of Cheetah kills and analysis of scat suggests that gazelle, wild sheep <em>Ovis orientalis</em>, Persian Bbex <em>Capra aegagrus</em> and Cape Hares <em>Lepus capensis</em> are key prey species, although livestock comprises a substantial proportion of the diet (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Cheetahs, unlike many other African predators, rarely scavenge. In areas with high densities of large carnivore competitors, cheetah can lose up to around 10% of their kills to kleptoparasitism, particularly to lions and spotted hyaenas (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007a), and tend not to remain long with their kills, abandoning the carcass once they have eaten their fill (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007b). They also tend to be primarily active during the day, a strategy that may help to reduce competition (Caro 1994). There is some evidence that nocturnal activity is linked to the lunar cycle (Broekhuis <em>et al.</em> 2014), consistent with a hypothesis that the need to use visual cues to avoid competitors is a key driver of diurnal behaviour. In contrast, in areas where competition is less fierce, such as South African farmland and the Sahara, Cheetah have been recorded as being primarily nocturnal (Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015), although it is difficult to know whether this is due to a lower number of competitors or an increase in human activity in these areas.<br/><br/>Cheetahs have a social organization that is unique among felids (Durant <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Females are solitary or accompanied by dependent young, and males are either solitary or live in stable coalitions of two or three (Caro 1994, Broomhall<em> et al. </em>2003, Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2006). Most coalitions consist of brothers, but unrelated males may also be members of the group (Caro and Collins 1987). Unlike the coalitions formed by male lions, where a single male from the coalition will guard and mate with a female throughout oestrus, female Cheetahs appear to mate with as many males as possible, and show no mate fidelity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>In areas where prey is migratory (such as the Serengeti Plains), female Cheetahs follow the herds, while male coalitions establish small territories (average 30 km<sup>2</sup>) which are centred on areas attractive to females (Durant <em>et al.</em> 1988, Caro 1994). However, in areas where prey is non-migratory, male and females may have overlapping ranges that can be more similar in size (Broomhall <em>et al. </em>2003). On Namibian farmlands, where prey is also non-migratory, both Cheetah sexes have very large home ranges (average 1,642 km<sup>2</sup>); however, intensively used core areas were just 14% of the total home range. The reasons for such large home ranges are unclear, and were apparently not the result of reduced prey availability (Marker 2002). It has been hypothesised that the Cheetah’s unique social system and ranging patterns originally evolved as a strategy to remain mobile in the presence of larger and stronger competitors, enabling the species to avoid direct competition in a spatio-temporal heterogeneous landscape (Durant 1998, 2000a, b). This is supported by recent evidence of risk avoidance by cheetah in Botswana and South Africa (Broekhuis <em>et al. </em>2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the wild Cheetah have been recorded as living a maximum of 14 years and five months for females and 10 years for males, however females have not been recorded as having cubs beyond 12 years (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b). Cheetahs give birth to their first litter at two years after a three-month gestation (Caro 1994). The cubs are kept in a lair for the first two months of their life, during which time their mother leaves to hunt every morning and returns at dusk (Laurenson 1994). Cheetah cub mortality can be high. In the Serengeti 95% of cubs died before independence, mostly because of predation (Laurenson 1994, 1995). Most of this mortality happened in the first few months, and mothers were able to conceive quickly after losing their cubs (Laurenson <em>et al.</em> 1992). Elsewhere cub mortality is reported to be nowhere much lower, although information on survivorship during the denning period is rarely available. In the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park cub survival from birth to independence was 35.7%, substantially higher than that found in the Serengeti, but most of the mortality could also be ascribed to predation (Mills and Mills 2014). Lions, Spotted Hyaenas and Leopards are key predators of Cheetah cubs, although smaller predators such as Honey Badgers, jackals and Secretary Birds also play a role.<br/>&#160;<br/>If cubs survive, they will stay with their mother for an average of 18 months, after which they will roam with their littermates for a further six months (Caro 1994). At this time, females split from their siblings and go on to produce their first litter, while surviving males will stay together for life. Single males may meet and join up with unrelated males to form a coalition. In the Serengeti mean annual mortality for females and males is respectively 0.32 and 0.61 for 1-2 year olds; and 0.15 and 0.31 for adults (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2004). On Namibian farmlands, adult mortality is similar to that in the Serengeti, but mortality of juveniles is much lower, probably due to the lack of other large predators (Marker <em>et al. </em>2003c, Durant <em>et al. </em>2004). It is difficult to discern the causes of mortality, but in the Serengeti adult Cheetahs have been killed by Lions; by their prey when hunting; and one individual died from encephalitis (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). Male cheetahs are killed by other males, probably during territorial disputes (Caro 1994).<br/><br/>In comparison with other big cats, Cheetahs occur at relatively low densities (10-30% of typical densities for Lions, Leopards, Tigers and Jaguars in prime habitat: Durant 2007). The highest density recorded for Cheetah, not including small and highly managed fenced reserves in South Africa, is in the Serengeti National Park, where densities range up to 2.5 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011), but seasonally cheetahs can congregate at densities up to 40 per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (Caro 1994), which can give a misleading impression of over-inflated densities. Caro (1994) attributes relatively low Cheetah densities in the herbivore rich Serengeti to interspecific competition (especially with larger species such as Lions and hyenas that can kill Cheetah cubs), but on Namibian farmlands and in the Sahara where there are no competitors, Cheetahs still occur at low densities (0.2 per 100 km<sup>2</sup>) (Marker 2002) and 0.23 per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir<em> et al. </em>2015), respectively. In such environments cheetah may be limited by prey rather than competitors. Clearly, Cheetah can coexist alongside other competitors, and have developed avoidance strategies to minimize the loss of kills and cubs where competitor densities are high (Durant 1998, 2000a, c; Broekhuis<em> et al.</em> 2013, Rostro-Garcia <em>et al.</em> 2015), while in other environments impacts of competitors may be much lower (Mills and Mills 2014).","As a wide ranging carnivore that never attains densities of much more than two individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, Cheetah are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Their low density means that Cheetah populations require much larger areas of land to survive than do those of other carnivore species, and hence they are particularly sensitive to these pressures which, together, represent the over-arching threat to Cheetah (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Conserving viable subpopulations of Cheetah is likely to require areas of land far in excess of 10,000 km<sup>2</sup>. Fortunately, Cheetah can thrive in anthropogenically modified landscapes under the right circumstances; hence the landscapes that Cheetah require for their survival may be protected, unprotected, or a combination of the two. Cheetahs also have excellent dispersal abilities (Boast 2014), making it likely to be comparatively easy to maintain gene flow between populations, and to encourage recolonization of suitable unoccupied habitat by conserving connecting habitat.<br/><br/>Cheetah living outside protected areas are often threatened by conflict with livestock and game farmers (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Inskip and Zimmermann 2009, Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013; Dickman <em>et al.</em> 2014). While Cheetahs tend to prefer wild prey over livestock, they may kill livestock in some circumstances and can be killed by farmers in retaliation (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003a, Dickman <em>et al. </em>2014). Conflict with game farmers is widespread as Cheetahs are seen as competitors for valuable game offtake. These conflicts may involve both subsistence pastoralists and commercial ranchers. In many areas Cheetah survival in the face of this conflict is partly due to the fact that they are difficult to kill. They rarely scavenge (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b), hence they are less susceptible to poisoning than are other carnivores such as hyaenas, leopards and lions.<br/><br/>Cheetah are highly efficient hunters, and are able to survive in areas of comparatively low prey density (Caro 1994, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). Nevertheless, loss of prey due to hunting, high livestock densities and grazing pressure, and/or habitat conversion may directly impact cheetah populations. Prey loss can also have serious indirect effects, since predation on livestock may become more frequent where wild prey are depleted (Marker <em>et al.</em> 2003b), intensifying conflict with livestock farmers.<br/><br/>Cheetah may also become captured in snares set for bushmeat offtake, even though they may not be the primary target (Lindsey <em>et al. </em>2013). While effects on Cheetah populations are not well quantified, snared Cheetah are reported occasionally and snaring may threaten some subpopulations, particularly when subpopulations are small and isolated.<br/><br/>High speed roads also represent a threat to Cheetah populations. This is a particular concern where paved roads cross or adjoin major wildlife areas, such as the Nairobi-Mombasa road which traverses Tsavo National Park in Kenya, and the main road that passes through Khavd Touran Biosphere reserve in Iran. In Iran, out of 27 known Cheetah mortalities between 2005 and 2011 due to various human-causes, at least 11 were killed on roads through Kalmand, Turan, Bafq and Dare Anjir protected areas, making it the major cause of anthropogenic mortality (Iranian Cheetah Society 2013). In separate incidents in 2014 two Cheetahs were hit and terminally injured by cars on the dirt main road through the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, while deaths have also been reported on many other roads including examples in South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. Such mortality could have a significant impact on the viability of small and isolated populations of Cheetah.<br/><br/>Unregulated tourism has the capacity to threaten Cheetah populations (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997). Cheetah are undeniably a key attraction for wildlife tourists from Africa; in Amboseli National Park in Kenya tourists spent 12-15% of their total time spent wildlife viewing observing Cheetah (Roe<em> et al.</em> 1997). Large numbers of tourist vehicles or insensitive tourist behaviour can lead to a number of negative effects such as interference with Cheetahs hunting, scaring Cheetah away from kills to which they are unlikely to return, and separation of mothers from cubs (Henry 1975, 1980; Burney 1980). Cub mortality due to separation from their mother has been reported in the Serengeti National Park and Mara Reserve. A large number of vehicles around a Cheetah can also restrict its view, and there has been an unconfirmed report of a Cheetah being killed by a Lion whose approach was masked by vehicles. There have even been unconfirmed reports of vehicles running over Cheetah cubs in the Mara Reserve in their scramble to get close up photographs. &#160;In contrast, well-regulated tourism can make important contributions to Cheetah conservation, not only by the revenue it generates, but also by raising awareness and increasing political will for conservation (Roe <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Although Cheetah can be affected by infectious disease (notably mange within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, (Caro <em>et al. </em>1987, Gakuya <em>et al.</em> 2012) and anthrax in Etosha (Turnbull <em>et al. </em>2004)), the low density of Cheetah mean that infectious disease is unlikely to present a major threat to free-ranging Cheetah populations.<br/><br/>Cheetah are hunted in some areas for their skins, and also for cultural uses. Additionally, there is a substantial illegal trade in Cheetah cubs to Gulf states (see Use and Trade).<br/><br/>An emerging threat is an increase in resource extraction and extensive infrastructure development, such as mining, oil, pipelines, roads and railways. These developments risk further fragmentation of the remaining Cheetah subpopulations into smaller and smaller subpopulations which may no longer be viable. This has been reported to be a particular problem in Iran (Dehghan 2013).<br/><br/>All these threats play some role in most Cheetah subpopulations across Africa. In Eastern, Southern and Western Africa, habitat loss and fragmentation have been identified as a primary threat (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Because Cheetahs occur at low densities, conservation of viable populations requires large scale land management planning; as most existing protected areas are not large enough to ensure the long term survival of Cheetahs (Durant <em>et al. </em>2010b). In northern Africa and Iran a depleted wild ungulate prey base is a particular concern (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2014, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015). While conflict with livestock farmers due to livestock depredation, either perceived or real, is a widespread and serious problem across Cheetah range.<br/><br/>While the threats outlined above constitute the proximate causes of Cheetah decline, they are a consequence of many ultimate drivers. These include political constraints such as a lack of land use planning, insecurity and political instability and a lack of awareness or political will to foster Cheetah conservation. Many of the range states where Cheetahs occur suffer from a lack of capacity and financial resources to support conservation, and there is a lack of incentives for local people to conserve wildlife. Meanwhile a lack of environmental awareness, rising human populations, and social changes are leading to ever increasing subdivision of land and subsequent habitat fragmentation. These drivers will also need to be addressed if the immediate threats are to be reduced.","Where possible population estimates are based on expert information from in-depth surveys and monitoring. This was particularly the case in the southern Africa estimates (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep). Where expert based information was not available, population estimates were derived from applying density estimates from comparable areas to resident range as mapped during conservation strategy workshops. Density estimates were conservative, since many sites where abundance is unknown are likely to face higher pressures than sites where there is better information on abundance. Four density estimates were used:<br/><br/>1) For well managed protected areas density was estimated at one individual per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, slightly higher than Kruger National Park, but lower than the volcanic savannas of the Serengeti ecosystem (Bowland 1995, Durant <em>et al.</em> 2011);<br/>2) For areas that are largely unprotected or are under threat density was estimated at 0.25 individuals per 100 km<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to the lower bound on the density range found on Namibian farmlands (Marker 2002);<br/>3) For the Sahara density was estimated at one individual per 4,000 km<sup>2</sup>, using the only available estimate in this habitat from the Algerian Sahara (Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015); and<br/>4) For two subpopulations in west and central Africa density was estimated at one individual per 1,000 km<sup>2</sup>, consistent with a density higher than that found in the desert, but lower than that found in Namibian farmlands, in line with elevated pressures and direct threats in these regions.<br/><br/>The population estimates so derived for Cheetah as presented here, including the expert based estimates, should be treated with extreme caution and are provided as an indication only. Density and abundance estimates for Cheetah are imprecise, and a small change in mean density estimation could result in a large overall change in population estimates. Population estimates refer to adults and independent adolescents only, and do not include cubs.<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the Cheetah’s regional stronghold, holding a rough estimate of 4,190 adults and independent adolescents distributed across ten subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007b; Marnewick <em>et al.</em> 2007; Purchase 2007a, b; Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007, Purchase and Purchase 2007; Williams 2007; Chilufya and Purchase 2011; Andresen <em>et al.</em> 2012; IUCN SSC in prep.). The largest of these subpopulations supports an estimated 3,940 individuals, comprising the majority of the regional population, which is spread across a large transboundary landscape covering Botswana, Namibia, northern South Africa, south-western Zambia and south-western Mozambique.<br/><br/>The other nine subpopulations are much smaller: 60 individuals in Kafue National Park, Zambia; 50 in and around Hwange National Park; 46 in Gonarezhou National Park and Save Conservancy; 40 spread across three conservancies in southern Zimbabwe; 20 in Liuwa Plains, Zambia; 12 in Mana Pools; 10 in Bahine National Park; four in Rhino Conservancy Zimbabwe and three in Matusadona, Zimbabwe. The latter subpopulation has decreased substantially after a reintroduction of Cheetah in the mid 1990s and may indicate long term viability of Cheetah populations in small areas (Purchase 1998, Purchase and du Toit 2000, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2006). A large proportion of the estimated subpopulation in the region lives outside protected areas, in lands ranched primarily for livestock but also for wild game (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). Larger competitors, such as Lions and Spotted Hyenas, have been extirpated from much of this range. There are also around 293 Cheetahs in an intensively managed meta-population distributed across small fenced reserves in South Africa (van der Merwe and K. Marnewick pers comms.) that we have excluded from the overall population estimates.<br/><br/>The Eastern Africa Cheetah population is estimated at 2,572 adults and independent adolescents distributed across 15 subpopulations (IUCN SSC 2007a). Only four of these subpopulations are estimated to number 200 animals or more. In descending order of estimated population size the 15 subpopulations are: 710 individuals in the Serengeti/Mara/Tsavo landscape in Kenya and Tanzania; 450 in the Laikipia/Samburu landscape in Kenya; 250 in the Omo Mago/Borena protected areas and buffer zones in Ethiopia; 200 in the Ruaha landscape in Tanzania; 190 in Boma National Park in South Sudan; 150 in the Katavi-Ugalla landscape in Tanzania; 130 in Southern National Park in South Sudan; 110 in the Ogaden landscape in Ethiopia; 100 in the Maasai steppe in Tanzania; 70 in each of the Blen-Afar National Park in Ethiopia and Badingilo National Park in South Sudan; 60 in Radom National Park in South Sudan; 40 in the Afar landscape in Ethiopia; 30 in the Yangudi Rassa landscape in Ethiopia; and 12 in the Kidepo National Park in Uganda and bordering areas in South Sudan (IUCN SSC 2007a). A large proportion of Cheetah range in Eastern Africa is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2007a).<br/><br/>The number of known resident Cheetahs in western, central and northern Africa &#160;is estimated at 446 adults and independent adolescents distributed across four populations (IUCN SSC 2012). These are: 217 individuals in Bahr/Salamat landscape in Chad and CAR; 201 in the Adrar des Ifhogas/Ahaggar/AjjarTassili landscape in Algeria and Mali; 23 in the WAP complex in Benin, Niger and Burkina Faso; 4 in Air et Tenere connected to another 1-2 individuals in the Termit Massiff, both in Niger. As in the other regions, a large proportion of Cheetah range in this region is outside protected areas, on lands that are largely occupied by traditional sedentary and semi-nomadic pastoralist communities (IUCN SSC 2012, Belbachir <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Asia, Cheetahs are now confined to Iran, where the subspecies <em>Acinonyx jubatus venaticus</em> is estimated at 60-100 (Hunter <em>et al.</em> 2007c) and listed as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>The total known Cheetah population is therefore very provisionally estimated at around 6,674 adults and independent adolescents. Thus the population is extremely unlikely to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, meeting the criteria for Vulnerable. The effective population size (the estimated percentage of the population contributing to the gene pool through reproductive success) using data from a long term study population of Cheetah in the Serengeti ecosystem is estimated at &#160;2,937 or, if skewed female heritability is taken into account, this is reduced to 1,001 (Kelly 2001). While Cheetah female reproductive success is highly skewed, genetic analysis showed that female Cheetahs mated with multiple males, many from outside the study area, with 43% of litters having mixed paternity (Gottelli <em>et al.</em> 2007). This suggests that male reproductive success may be less skewed than expected, but it also underscores the importance of Cheetah mobility in their ecology and conservation.<br/><br/>The low density of the Cheetah across their range means they need large areas of connected habitat for their survival. The facts that the majority of known Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands, and that their populations are extremely fragmented are causes for concern.",Decreasing,"Cheetahs have disappeared from vast tracts of their historic range. In Africa they are now known to persist in only 10% of their historic range (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012, in prep.), while their distribution in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran.<br/><br/>In Africa, Southern and Eastern Africa are the species strongholds, but there has been significant range loss across all regions. In Eastern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in only 6% of their historical range in (310,586 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 892,658 km² (IUCN/SSC 2007a). Significant Cheetah range occurs in the transboundary areas between northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. Almost the entire southern boundary of Ethiopia is recorded as resident Cheetah range with connectivity into South Sudan and this population almost certainly extends into northern Kenya. Important subpopulations of Cheetah survive elsewhere in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, as well as in South Sudan and northern Uganda but are notably fragmented across the region. Their status in Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan is unknown.<br/><br/>In southern Africa Cheetahs are known to occur in 22% of their historical range (1,223,388 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 403,627 km<sup>2</sup> (IUCN SSC in prep.). Most of the Cheetahs surviving in this region are in a single transboundary population stretching across Namibia, Botswana, south-western Angola, northern South Africa, south-western Mozambique and southern Zambia. Important populations also survive elsewhere in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (IUCN SSC 2007b, Purchase <em>et al.</em> 2007). There are some reliable observations of cheetah from south-eastern Angola (Anon. 2010), close to the Namibia and Zambia borders. Cheetahs have been extirpated from Malawi (Purchase and Purchase 2007).<br/><br/>Cheetahs have declined particularly markedly in western, central and northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012, Durant<em> et al. </em>2014). The subspecies found in northwest Africa,<em> A. j. hecki,</em> is listed as Critically Endangered; see subspecies account for detailed information. Cheetah now occur in 10% of their historical range (1,053,746 km<sup>2</sup>), and possibly occur in another 920,520 km<sup>2</sup>. Much of this range is within the Sahara, where Cheetah occur at very low densities, estimated as 2.3 individuals per 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015). There are five known Cheetah subpopulations in this region (IUCN SSC 2012): south-central Algeria, stretching through to north-eastern Mali, and possibly into western Libya (Belbachir <em>et al. </em>2015); two connected subpopulations around the Termit massif in Niger; the WAP complex of protected areas in northern Benin, south-eastern Burkina Faso and south-western Niger; and south-eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic (CAR). Cheetah have been extirpated from their historical range in Western Sahara, Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Tunisia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, DRC and Ghana. The last reliable Cheetah sighting in Cameroon was in the 1970s (de Iongh <em>et al</em>. 2011), and no tracks were found in an extensive search of the Benoue Complex in 2007 and 2010, which was their last refuge in the country (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Recent extensive surveys for Lion in the best protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria found no evidence of Cheetah (Henschel<em> et al. </em>2014a, b). It is also unlikely any Cheetah survive in Egypt. Reports from hunters suggest that cheetah may persist in south-western Libya (IUCN SSC 2012), but the status of Cheetah from much of southern Libya, northern Niger, Chad and CAR remains unknown.<br/><br/>In Asia, the Cheetah has been extirpated from nearly all of its range. Its historic range extended from the shores of the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula, north to the northern shores of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Habibi 2003, Mallon 2007). One reason for their extirpation across most of their Asian range is thought to have been the live capture of cheetahs, which were then trained to hunt deer and gazelle as sport for the aristocracy (Divyabhanusingh 1995). Other key causes of the disappearance of Cheetah from the region are likely to have been depletion of wild prey, especially gazelles, the direct killing of Cheetahs, and anthropogenic change and fragmentation of their habitat (Mallon 2007). The Asiatic Cheetah (<em>A. j. venaticus</em>) is now known to survive only in Iran, where it is Critically Endangered. Persistence in Pakistan is unlikely (Husain 2001). Habibi (2003) considers it extinct in Afghanistan, although a Cheetah skin of unknown origin was found in a marketplace in western Afghanistan in 2007 (L. Hunter pers. comm.). More detail can be found in the subspecies account for <em>A. j. venaticus</em>.","Historical capture and trade in live Cheetah has been reported as a key cause of their disappearance from much of their range in Asia. A recent resurgence in an illegal international trade in live Cheetah has been of sufficient global concern to gain the attention of CITES (CITES 2013). Live Cheetah are caught and traded illegally to the pet trade and they are also hunted for their skin. CITES allows a legal quota for “live specimens and trophy hunting” of Cheetah in Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana &#160;(CITES 1992). From 2002-2011, legal trade in wild Cheetah specimens averaged 153 per year (mainly hunting trophies from Namibia), and 88 for captive-bred live animals (mainly from South Africa) (Nowell 2014). Official records show that, on average, only three confiscations of illegally traded live Cheetahs are reported to CITES per year, however, this is an underestimate of the real trade (Nowell 2014). Most of these Cheetahs are destined for the pet trade market in the Gulf States. These consumer countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are Party to CITES and prohibit wild Cheetah imports. Cheetah skins are also traded, often alongside leopard skins, within Africa and to Asia. As most Cheetah subpopulations are small, even a low level of illegal trade could be threatening wild populations.<br/><br/>East Africa is the region where illegal trade in live Cheetahs is likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations. Most countries in East Africa have registered their concerns about illegal trade in their national Cheetah conservation action plans. Trade in live Cheetahs has been ongoing for some time (for example, between 1998-2002, 39 Cheetah cubs smuggled primarily out of Somalia were confiscated by Customs authorities of the United Arab Emirates). Between 2011-13 over 40 Cheetah confiscations were reported, primarily in the semi-autonomous region of Somaliland, with many more observations and second-hand reports of illegal trade in cubs (Nowell 2014). A high mortality rate (70%) has been reported from the known outcomes of confiscations of cubs in Somaliland and Ethiopia. Although the exact origin of Cheetah in the trade is unclear, information from interdictions and interviews with traders suggests that the animals are opportunistically collected from ethnic Somali regions, including parts of Ethiopia and Kenya, and occasionally beyond.<br/><br/>The primary destination of live Cheetahs from this region are the Gulf States, and the primary means of transport is by boat out of the Somali regions, to the coast of Yemen, and then across Yemeni borders by vehicle (Nowell 2014). Dozens of news articles and hundreds of social media images and videos suggest that private ownership of Cheetahs (and other big cats) is popular throughout the Gulf region. However, many of these Cheetahs are likely to be kept in inappropriate conditions, and their survivorship is likely to be low. For instance, one study including 61 captive Cheetahs in the United Arab Emirates has shown that owners have little idea of a Cheetah dietary needs; diets of pure poultry were contributing to ‘Cheetah myelopathy’, i.e. ataxia, hind limb paralysis and paresis due to degenerative lesions in the spinal cord (Kaiser<em> et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>Range states from North, West and Central Africa also consider illegal trade to be a significant threat. Although there are no known confiscations of Cheetahs (live or otherwise) from this region and few observations of illegal trade and possession (but see Djagoun <em>et al. </em>(2013)), it is likely that Cheetah get absorbed into a widespread illegal market for big cat skins used for traditional ceremonial purposes and médico-magiques. Throughout the region, fakes are abundant and are much more commonly observed than genuine big cat parts and items, which may be indicative of a demand for genuine products. In Sudan, traditional men’s shoes (markoob) made of spotted cat fur are sufficiently in demand as luxury items to be considered a threat to Cheetah populations in neighbouring countries (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>Southern Africa is the only region where there is a legal trade in trophies under CITES Appendix I quota from Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana (CITES 1992). South Africa is the only Cheetah range state to have CITES registered commercial captive-breeding operations, and is the world’s largest legal exporter of live Cheetahs. Cheetah experts suspect that some less reputable facilities in South Africa may be illegally trading, nationally and internationally, in live-captured wild animals using the presence of a legal trade as a cover (Nowell 2014). Researchers have interviewed dozens of observers in recent years – primarily farmers and also conservation officials – who have reported illegal international movement of live-captured wild Cheetahs between Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.<br/><br/>In Iran there are occasional reports of capture of live Cheetah (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2008), however there is no evidence of any systematic trade in live cheetah or in Cheetah parts. Nonetheless, even a tiny trade could have an impact on this Critically Endangered subpopulation.",Terrestrial,"The low density of Cheetah throughout their range, means they require conservation action on a scale that is seldom seen in terrestrial conservation. This includes transboundary cooperation, land use planning across large landscapes to maintain habitat connectivity, and human wildlife conflict mitigation (IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). Most Cheetah range (76%) is on unprotected lands where they are often persecuted in retaliation for livestock or game depredation.<br/><br/>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES, Appendix 1 of CMS and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range (Nowell and Jackson 1996; IUCN SSC 2007a, b, 2012). However, a number of countries permit Cheetahs to be killed in defence of life and livestock, as part of their problem animal control regulations (Purchase <em>et al. </em>2007). There is very rarely any systematic monitoring of how many animals are killed in this way. Moreover, in some countries the retention of Cheetah parts, such as skin, may be permitted in these operations, which may provide additional incentives for animal removals.<br/><br/>In Africa, nearly all range states are actively involved with the Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs (RWCP), which has supported them in the development of regional strategies and national conservation action plans using the IUCN SSC strategic planning process (IUCN SSC 2008). Cheetah and Wild Dog are combined in this process because of their similar low densities, large space needs and ecological requirements. This also increases leverage for conservation action by way of delivering impacts for two threatened species for the price of one. There are three regional strategies in place for Africa covering all of Cheetah range: Eastern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007a); Southern Africa (IUCN SSC 2007b); and Western, Central and Northern Africa (IUCN SSC 2012).<br/><br/>As well as providing a regional framework, these strategies also provide a framework for national conservation action planning. They are used within national conservation action planning workshops that allow broad regional commitments to be tailored to the specific policy and legislative environments within each range state. National conservation action plans are in place for most range states (dates of the planning workshop in brackets): Kenya (2007), Botswana (2007), Ethiopia (2010), South Sudan (2009), Zambia (2009), Zimbabwe (2009), South Africa (2009), Benin (2014), Niger (2012); Chad (2015); Tanzania (2013); Mozambique (2010); Namibia (2013). In addition, Cheetah are covered in Uganda’s Large Carnivore National Conservation Action Plan (2010). These 15 action plans cover all or part of 26 of the 27 known Cheetah subpopulations and 67% of known Cheetah range (the majority of remaining range is in Algeria). Each national conservation action plan is published by the range state wildlife authority and represents each state’s commitment to Cheetah (and Wild Dog) conservation.<br/><br/>The strategies and action plans provide a road map for reversing ongoing declines in Cheetah populations using a holistic approach that addresses both the proximate threats as well as the ultimate drivers of these threats (see Threats). While there are some differences between individual plans and strategies, they broadly all address objectives to improve national capacity for Cheetah conservation and management; raise awareness of and political commitment to cheetah conservation; promote human Cheetah coexistence; improve land use planning and reduce habitat fragmentation; improve policy and legislation; and address Cheetah conservation information needs. Local and national projects and NGOs are critical to this process, as well as governments, and the implementation of the plans and strategies is overseen by three regional co-ordinators. There are also a number of different projects and/or NGOs established across southern and eastern Africa that are either dedicated specifically to the conservation and research of Cheetah, or to the guild of large carnivores. Many of these projects carry out important site-based conservation activities that benefit Cheetah, and some also provide support for capacity development of national wildlife authorities. There are no long-term initiatives in northern, western or central Africa, but there are some new developments in this region.<br/><br/>In Iran, the Asiatic Cheetah is completely protected. The main protected areas for this species are Kavir National Park, Khar Touran National Park, Naybandan Wildlife Refuge, Bafgh Protected Area and Dar Anjir Wildlife Refuge (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2007c). The UNDP have established a program of work to support conservation of the Asiatic Cheetah, and a conservation planning workshop took place in 2008, leading to an action plan. In 2009, the Afghan Government placed Cheetah on the country’s Protected Species List, meaning all hunting and trading of this species within Afghanistan is now illegal, although it is thought to be extinct in the country.<br/><br/>The IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group maintains a Cheetah Conservation Compendium with a reference library and detailed country information (<a href=""http://www.catsg.org"">www.catsg.org</a>) which provides a useful resource for publications relating to all aspects of Cheetah ecology and conservation.",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50659951,15955,Panthera tigris,Endangered,A2abcd; C1,2015,2014-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Tiger is listed as Endangered under criterion A2abcd. Comparing a breeding recent range estimate (42 “source sites” totalling 90,000&#160; km² : Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b) to a 2006 total range estimate (1.1 million km² : Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007) suggests a range decline much greater than 50% over the last three generations (7 x 3 = 21 years). As per IUCN guidelines (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2007, IUCN 2013), we calculated generation length at seven years based on approximate age of maturity (four years) plus half the length of the reproductive lifespan (six years) (based on Smith and McDougal 1991 and unpublished information). This decline continues and at least two of the source populations listed in Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010b) have apparently been lost (one from Lao PDR and one from Thailand). In 2006, it was believed that breeding populations existed in 13 countries, but now known breeding Tiger populations occur only in eight (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand and Russia).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). A comparison of these population estimates of the 1990s (many with little scientific rigour) to similar current ones (many of better quality; see Table 1 in attached Supporting Material) suggests a decline of about 50% (taking the upper bound of 7,000 as the number of mature individuals in 1993, using a precautionary approach, declining to approximately 3,500 in 2014), but differences in methodologies and accuracy make such comparisons uncertain. This declining trend is likely to persist in the face of continuing threats such as direct poaching, prey depletion and habitat degradation which continue in all range states. Although several sites in India and Nepal have indeed reported recent recoveries, population reductions may not be reversible in other areas where Tiger habitat itself has been lost. Given the uncertainties about future declines, criterion A4bcd is no longer used.<br/><br/>The Tiger is also listed as Endangered under criterion C1 because the population of mature individuals may be fewer than 2,500 individuals. Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a estimated 2,154 tigers in 42 protected source sites where there is evidence of breeding (two populations are since known to have been lost, as described above), and the numbers in Table 1 (see Supporting material) could be overestimated. Generally Tiger status outside the source sites is poor and large breeding populations are unlikely to exist. To ensure tiger persistence, large population sizes (implying highest possible densities) and high survival rates of breeding adult females are critical. Although well-protected tiger populations may achieve recruitment rates that can sustain annual losses from mortality and emigration of 20% or more (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2006), some theoretical models suggest declines to extinction when annual mortality of breeding females exceeds 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). For the purposes of Red List assessment, the estimated population in Source Sites is a good proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers. This population has declined by over 20% during the last two generations (14 years); the decline continues and may not be reversible in all sites.<br/><br/>Previously, Tigers were also listed under criterion C2a(i), but we have removed this criterion because the population in the Western Ghats in India has increased to &gt;250 adults (Karanth unpublished data). Other subpopulations in Terai, Central India, and Russia may also have &gt;250 adults (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>See attached Supporting Material for alternative depictions of range and population details.","Tigers are found mainly in the forests of tropical Asia, although they historically occurred more widely in drier and colder climes. One subspecies, the Amur Tiger <em>P. t. altaica</em>, persists in the Russian Far East. Photos of Tigers up to 4,500 m have been obtained in Bhutan (Wang 2008).<br/><br/>Availability of a sufficient prey base of large ungulates is the Tiger's major habitat requirement: ""wild pigs and deer of various species are the two prey types that make up the bulk of the Tiger's diet, and in general Tigers require a good population of these species in order to survive and reproduce"" (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Tigers need to kill 50-60 large prey animals per year (Karanth <em>et al</em>. 2004, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2013). Tigers are opportunistic predators, however, and their diet includes birds, fish, rodents, insects, amphibians, reptiles in addition to other mammals such as primates and porcupines. Tigers can also take ungulate prey much larger than themselves, including large bovids (Water Buffalo, Gaur, Banteng), elephants and rhinos (Nowell and Jackson 1996). However, like many large carnivores, preferred prey are key to successful reproduction and are those species that are approximately the same weight as Tigers themselves (Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Tigers are generally solitary, with adults maintaining exclusive territories, or home ranges. Adult female home ranges seldom overlap, whereas male ranges typically overlap from 1–3 females, a common felid pattern of social organization. Tiger home ranges are small where prey is abundant - e.g., female home ranges in Chitwan averaged 20 km², while in the Russian Far East they are much larger at about 400 km² (Goodrich <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Similarly, reported Tiger densities range from a maximum of 17-19 Tigers per 100 km² where prey are abundant (India's Kaziranga and Corbett National Parks) to as low as 0.13–0.45 per 100 km² where prey is more thinly distributed, as in Russia's Sikhote Alin Mountains (Jhala <em>et al</em>. 2011, Soutyrina <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Poaching for illegal trade in high-value Tiger products including skins, bones, meat and tonics is a primary threat to Tigers, which has led to their recent disappearance from broad areas of otherwise suitable habitat, and continues at unsustainable rates. That there are roughly one million square kilometres of unoccupied Tiger habitat is a clear indication that poaching is the greatest threat to Tigers range-wide.<br/><br/>Asia is a densely populated and rapidly developing region, bringing huge pressures to bear on the large wild areas required for viable Tiger populations. Conversion of forest land to agriculture and silviculture, commercial logging, and human settlement are the main drivers of Tiger habitat loss. With their substantial dietary requirements, Tigers require a healthy large ungulate prey base, but these species are also under heavy human subsistence hunting pressure and competition from domestic livestock.<br/><br/>Tiger attacks on livestock and people can lead to intolerance of Tigers by neighbouring communities and presents an ongoing challenge to managers to build local support for Tiger conservation and can lead to high rates of retaliatory killing of Tigers. In some areas there have been many human deaths - for example, about 40 people were killed by Tigers in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh and India 2000-2010 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><p>&#160;</p>  <p>&#160;</p>","The thirteen Tiger Range Countries came together in an unprecedented pledge to double the world’s Tiger population by 2022, the next Year of the Tiger on the Asian lunar calendar, with a goal of achieving at least 6,000 Tigers. This figure was based on a baseline global population of 3,200, agreed upon at a preparatory workshop held in Kathmandu, Nepal in October 2009; 3,200 Tigers was the IUCN Red List population estimate at that time. Since then, Tiger Range Countries have adjusted their baseline national Tiger estimates, finalized in the Global Tiger Recovery Program adopted at the International Tiger Forum in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010 (GTRP 2010).<br/><br/>The global Tiger estimate published in the 2010 Red List assessment of 2,154 tigers was an updated version of the estimate of Tiger numbers in source sites (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a). This was not a complete estimate of global Tiger numbers (for example, most Amur Tigers in Russia are found in unprotected areas), but justified because Tiger status outside the source sites is generally poor and poorly known. IUCN Guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2010) define population as the number of mature individuals, defined as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction.” While in general this refers to all reproductive-age adults in the population, the Guidelines also “stress that the intention of the definition of mature individuals is to allow the estimate of the number of mature individuals to take account of all the factors that may make a taxon more vulnerable than otherwise might be expected.” Tigers require large populations to persist, and the survival rate of breeding adult females is a key parameter, with models suggesting population declines when mortality of breeding females rises over 15% (Chapron <em>et al</em>. 2008). Population declines in recent years have been most pronounced outside protected areas (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b). The IUCN Guidelines advise that “mature individuals that will never produce new recruits should not be counted.” Thus, for the purposes of the Red List assessment in 2010, the estimated population in the Source Sites was used as a proxy for the breeding population of adult Tigers.<br/><br/>Due to extensive surveys using improved methodologies since this analysis, our understanding of tiger distribution and numbers is much improved, e.g., extensive camera trapping in Bhutan has demonstrated significant populations. Further, Walston <em>et al</em>. (2010a) ignored some important Tiger areas, e.g., thousands of square kilometres in Kerinci and Leuser National Parks known to contain breeding Tiger populations.&#160; Hence, the current estimate of 3,159 Tigers (Table 1 in supplementary material) is based on data collected in scientific surveys conducted over the past five years (i.e. since 2009). This is a minimum estimate because some important areas (e.g. the Russian Far East) did not have current estimates. However, because of differences in methodology, this can by no means be interpreted as an increase over the 2010 estimate of 2,154. Rather, it is a more complete counting. While Tiger numbers have increased in some areas in India (e.g. Western Ghats, Central India, and Corbett Landscapes in India), they have also declined in key areas, especially in mainland SE Asia (e.g. Nam Et-Phou Louey in Lao PDR is no longer considered a potential source site).<br/><br/>In 1998, the global Tiger population was estimated, less rigorously, at 5,000 to 7,000 Tigers (Seidensticker <em>et al</em>. 1999). Although to some extent the new numbers represent improved knowledge, it is clear that there have been substantial population declines, with Tigers all but eliminated from much of their recent forest range, particularly in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>See the supplementary material for further information about national Tiger population estimates.",Decreasing,"The Tiger once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Over the past 100 years Tigers have disappeared from southwest and central Asia, from two Indonesian islands (Java and Bali) and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Tigers inhabit less than 6% of their historic range (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006, Walston <em>et al.</em> 2010b), with a 42% decline since 2006. Breeding populations of Tigers are currently found in eight range states: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Russia, and Thailand. There is evidence of breeding in China and Myanmar between 2009 and 2014, though these populations are likely dependent on immigration from neighbouring countries. Tigers may still persist in North Korea, although there has been no recent confirmed evidence.<br/><br/>In 1994, the first comprehensive assessment to delineate Tiger range was carried out (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 1997). Priority areas for Tiger conservation were estimated to total 1.64 million km² in 159 Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs), roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations, not including Russia (later estimated at 270,0000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006) and China. While this was generally considered representative of current distribution, Tiger presence was confirmed in just 47% the TCUs, and 89% were scored as undergoing medium to high levels of poaching of Tigers and their prey.<br/><br/>This exercise was revised and updated ten years later, and in delineating Tiger Conservation Landscapes (TCLs), greater emphasis was placed on actual records of Tiger presence and breeding (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006). TCLs were defined as areas where there is sufficient habitat to conserve at least five Tigers, and Tigers have been confirmed to occur in the past decade. Tiger range was estimated at 1.1 million km² in 76 TCLs (again, roughly equivalent to discrete meta-populations). This represented a 41% decline from the range described a decade earlier (in South and Southeast Asia, a drop from 1.55 million km² to 914,000 km²: Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63), attributed primarily to poaching pressure (Dinerstein <em>et al</em>. 2007). Habitat loss due to deforestation was also to blame, notable particularly in Sumatra and Myanmar (Wikramanayake <em>et al</em>. 2010). In India, landscapes with Tigers found to be much smaller and more fragmented than in the original assessment (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 63 and Figure 4.12).<br/><br/>Records of Tigers were collected over a ten-year period (1995–2004), a period which may have been too liberal for places like Cambodia which underwent a sharp rise in poaching pressure in the 1990s (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Appendix 6). While 53% of the TCU survey respondents reported evidence of Tiger breeding in the time period 1995–2004, out of over 2,500 point records collected in 2005, just 8% had confirmed evidence of breeding Tigers (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: 11-17). Large areas of habitat were defined as Tiger landscapes based on suitability, but given data paucity on Tiger presence there were often few records of breeding and actual Tiger occupancy to substantiate these (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2006: Figures 2.3 and 4.8).<br/><br/>A review of land management within Tiger Conservation Landscapes described the TCLs as “potential habitat for Tigers” and found only 21% of their area to be legally protected.&#160; Management effectiveness was generally poor in the protected areas, with regulatory, budgetary and enforcement constraints, and hunting cited as the main threat. Significant portions of the TCLs are designated concessions for resource extraction (timber, oil and gas, minerals, etc.) (Forrest <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Tiger range was revisited again in 2009, by which time the extent of the Tiger’s range collapse had become evident. “Vast areas of Southeast Asia [were] recently found to be void of Tigers and depleted of prey by hunters” (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010a: 5). The exercise used a different methodology to prioritize areas for Tiger conservation.&#160; Source Sites were defined as areas with confirmed current presence of Tigers and evidence of breeding, population estimates of &gt;25 breeding females, legal protection, and embedded in a larger habitat landscape with the potential to hold &gt;50 breeding females. An extensive review of scientific literature as well as correspondence with Tiger scientists and protected area managers resulted in the identification of just 42 source sites totalling approximately 90,000 km².&#160; Many Southeast Asian countries, previously considered to have large areas with Tigers, were found, on the basis of extensive survey effort over the past decade or more, to have no healthy breeding populations. Since this publication, Lao PDR has lost its only source site, but Bhutan, originally listed as a country not containing source sites, has documented breeding populations. [See Figures 1 and 2 in supplementary material].<br/><br/>The map for this effort (Figure 1 in supplementary material) differentiates areas where breeding has been detected in the past five years (2009-2014), where Tigers, but no breeding have been detected in the past five years, areas surveyed where no Tigers were detected and areas not surveyed.&#160; Data include camera trap photos, DNA, and observations of Tigers and Tiger sign detected during scientific surveys.&#160; Unsurveyed areas were excluded from Tiger range.&#160; Figure 2 (attached Supporting Material)&#160; documents a 42% range decline since 2006, reflecting both real decline and improved knowledge from new and better surveys.","In the early 1990s, it was feared that poaching of Tigers for the use of their bones in traditional Asian medicine would drive the Tiger to extinction (Nowell 2000). Despite strong international action to eliminate it, illegal trade persists (Nowell 2007). Tiger bone has long been considered to hold anti-inflammatory properties, with some support from Chinese medical research, but many consider the effect to be more psychological than pharmacological (Nowell and Xu 2007). Although all countries have banned use and manufacture of Tiger bone, illegal production persists in several Asian countries, especially in China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam (Nowell 2007). In China there are several operations engaged in intensive breeding (""farming"" of Tigers), with the captive population reportedly reaching over 6,000. They are pressuring the government to allow them to produce Tiger products, and several have already engaged in illegal production of Tiger bone wine. Market surveys indicate that medicinal use of Tiger bone has decreased since China banned Tiger bone in 1993. Tiger farming perpetuates and threatens to re-ignite consumer demand (Nowell and Xu 2007). In 2008 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) adopted a Decision stating that “Tigers should not be bred for trade in their parts and derivatives” (CITES 2008).<br/><br/>There are other illegal markets for Tiger products, especially skins, but also teeth and claws (particularly in Sumatra: Ng and Nemora 2007), contributing to poaching pressure. But many Tigers are also killed by people seeking to protect life and livestock. Conflict-killed Tigers can also feed into the illegal trade. Many Tiger products in trade are faked, a legal ""grey area"" in several countries which also perpetuates consumer demand (Nowell 2000).<br/><br/>Tiger poaching is driven by less by poverty and more by wealth (TRAFFIC 2008), which is putting expensive illegal Tiger products within reach of a rapidly growing group of potential consumers. TRAFFIC has documented rising levels of recent illegal trade within the Tiger range countries, with seizures and confiscations in 2007–2009 averaging the equivalent of approximately 150 Tigers per year (Verheij <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). Interdictions represent just a fraction of the true level of illegal trade, indicating that Tigers are gravely imperilled by black market demand.",Terrestrial,"At a “Tiger Summit” held in St Petersburg, Russia in November 2010, the 13 Tiger Range Countries adopted a Global Tiger Recovery Program (GTRP 2010). The goal is to effectively double the number of wild Tigers by 2022 through actions to: <br/>i) effectively preserve, manage, enhance and protect Tiger habitats; <br/>ii) eradicate poaching, smuggling and illegal trade of Tigers, their parts and derivatives; <br/>iii) cooperate in transboundary landscape management and in combating illegal trade; <br/>iv) engage with indigenous and local communities; <br/>v) increase the effectiveness of Tiger and habitat management; and <br/>vi) restore Tigers to their former range. <br/><br/>The Tiger Summit was attended by Heads of State including Russia, China, Lao PDR, Nepal and Bangladesh, and represented significant government commitment to Tiger conservation.<br/><br/>The future of Tiger range depends upon the Asian governments creating effective Tiger landscapes by conserving large areas of suitable habitat. Within these landscapes, the most urgent need is to first secure the source sites—protected areas with viable Tiger populations—where most of the global Tiger population is now clustered, and many of which are currently too threatened to deliver their potential as the demographic sources for species recovery (Walston <em>et al</em>. 2010b).<br/><br/>Countries that do not currently support known breeding populations (Myanmar, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Lao PDR) but still have large landscapes with suitable habitat, Tigers might still be recovered if government commitment to Tigers, staff capacity for law enforcement and legal frameworks for Tiger protection can be established (Lynam 2010), though reintroduction may be needed in some places.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

There have been five attempts to compile national estimates, of varying data quality, to determine global Snow Leopard global population size. Two sets contain estimates largely dating prior to 2003: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). Two sets date from 2008-2010: 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 4,678 to 8,745 (a compilation of individual population estimates for prime habitat covering about 1/3 of likely extant range developed at an expert mapping workshop in 2008 but not available until 2016: McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). The most recent set of national estimates comes from country chapters in the comprehensive book <em>Snow Leopards</em>: 7,463 to 7,980 (McCarthy and Mallon 2016, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016: Table 1 in the Supporting Information). While all these sets of estimates exclude dependent cubs, a population modelling exercise was carried out in 2015 to exclude young adults which may not be capable of breeding (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Model outputs for nine different scenarios were applied to the most conservative possible global population estimate available at the time (4,000), resulting in a number of mature individuals between 2,710 and 3,386. The number of mature individuals would be roughly double if applied to the upper bounds of the more recent estimates published in 2016.<br/><br/>There is virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales; Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others, including recent localized extinctions which may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union. A decline of at least 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction. Although poaching appears to have declined since the late 1990s, Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2016) estimated that 221-450 Snow Leopards were poached annually since 2008 (based on extrapolation of cases known to over 40 surveyed experts); these were attributed to retaliation for actual or perceived livestock depredation, but this supposition is not substantiated by hard evidence. With the average rate of poaching detection estimated by experts at less than 38%, these numbers could be substantially higher. If these poaching estimates are anywhere near accurate, this suggests that roughly 2-10% of the population could be poached annually. While a direct relationship between offtake and a population decline is not clear, even at the magnitude reported by Nowell <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016, it adds to the plausibility of a 10% decline over 3 generations (22.62 years).<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty</strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria are designed to incorporate the use of inference, suspicion and projection, to allow taxa to be assessed in the absence of detailed and complete data, which are rarely available across the entire range of a taxon; the absence of high-quality data should not deter attempts at applying the criteria (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016). Throughout this assessment, we have attempted to show the degree to which we have dealt with uncertainty stemming from the paucity of data for this elusive and secretive species. To ensure this assessment is both “precautionary and credible,"" as specified by IUCN (2012), a range of values as well as best estimates were considered for the critical parameters, including those used in modelling the number of 'mature individuals' (MI) in the population. Specifically, the model dealt with uncertainty by including a variety of scenarios with cats maturing between 2 to 4 years of age, and then applied the resultant MI percent to the lowest published population estimate which, contrary to convention, included dependent yearlings (Appendix 2 in the Supporting Information). Here, even the very lowest bound of the estimated range of mature individuals did not fall within the threshold for the Endangered category.<br/><br/>It is acknowledged that precise and robust estimates of Snow Leopard density are difficult to obtain, are available for only a limited proportion of the global range, and represent small study sites selected for their suitability for the species. Because extrapolation to larger areas or even range-wide would be tenuous, we have avoided doing so in all cases. Estimates of Snow Leopard population size based on rigorous study design and survey methodology are sparse. The national population estimates cited here are considered to be the best available, following advice in the Red List Guidelines: “<strong>The plausible range may be established using.….. the opinion of a single expert, or the consensus view of a group of experts</strong>” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016).<br/><br/>There is also a lack of hard data on overall population trends, which hinders estimates of the magnitude of any decline which rely on fragmentary evidence and are therefore largely speculative. Nonetheless, the evidence considered does not suggest that the situation has deteriorated since 2008, which would be needed to justify an Endangered listing under criterion C1.<br/><br/><strong>Reasons for Change in IUCN Red List Status</strong><br/>The previous assessment in 2008 (Endangered C1) was based on &lt;2,500 mature  individuals and an estimated decline of 20% over 16  years (two generations). However, in that assessment, effective  population size  (Ne) was incorrectly used as a surrogate for ‘mature  individuals’ and  produces a lower figure (50% of the adult population of  4,080).  Therefore, the species should have been listed as Vulnerable in  2008.<br/><br/>Moreover, given the apparent limits to dispersal (Riordan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>   2015), it is questionable whether such a small number of individuals   capable of breeding (and therefore fewer actually breeding) is   demographically viable over such an extensive range. Recent survey   information indicates that Snow Leopard densities in several areas are   higher than previously believed, implying that the overall population   size is also likely to be larger than the minimum estimates (Jackson<em> et  al.</em>  2010, SLSS 2014, McCarthy and Mallon 2016). The revised estimate of   the number of mature individuals addressed the earlier mistake, in   combination with new information, and the change from EN to VU is therefore a non-genuine change.<br/><br/>The   estimated 20% decline over 16 years in 2008 included a documented   upsurge in poaching for skins and body parts in the countries of Central   Asia, following the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1991. While   this threat has since subsided, it is unlikely to have completely   disappeared. The other traditional threats still exist, alongside   emerging potential threats such as mining and other infrastructure   development (roads, railroads, hydro-dams, etc.), some of which will have   intensified in recent years (summaries in Snow Leopard Network 2014,   McCarthy and Mallon 2016).<br/><br/>There have also been very significant   investments in conservation measures to reduce threats or to mitigate   their effects. These include: establishment of new protected areas in   Snow Leopard range; more effective anti-poaching measures; training and   capacity-building of range country conservation professionals; a number   of independent initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g.,   strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and   alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides); community engagement   programmes; the illegalization of guns in China since 1989; and   education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its   habitat (see the <em>Conservation Measures</em> section for more details and  examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008  (Sanderson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em>  2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem  Protection Program (Snow  Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the  revised version of the Snow  Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard  Network 2014) have all enhanced  the global strategic framework.<br/><br/>Although  the Snow Leopard undoubtedly is still threatened, the  measures listed  above are collectively considered to have contributed  to improving the  overall conservation situation for Snow Leopards since  2008. The  generation length of 8 years used in 2008 has been revised to 7.54 years  following Pacifici <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2013).  There is no current evidence to  support a decline of 20% over such a  short period of 15.08 years, as  needed to support a listing as  Endangered, and which would represent a  steeper decline and therefore a  deterioration in the situation since  2008. However, in view of the  existing and emerging threats, a decline  of 10% or more over 22.62  years (three generations) is considered plausible  (starting in 2014). This  change in the estimated rate of decline is the  result of conservation  actions taken, so potentially could qualify as genuine change and  on this basis IUCN's 5-year waiting period would apply, dated from the first  draft of this  assessment (June 2014).&#160;However, since the EN category in 2008  was incorrect, the species should have been listed as VU in 2008, the  change in category is therefore non-genuine.","Snow Leopards inhabit mountainous rangelands at elevations of 3,000 to over 5,000 m in the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, but can occur as low as 500 m in the Altai (Snow Leopard Network 2014). Wild caprids are the principal natural prey of Snow Leopards, especially Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) and Siberian Ibex <em></em>(<em>Capra sibirica</em>), whose distribution coincides closely with Snow Leopard range. Argali (<em>Ovis ammon) </em>and Markhor (<em>Capra</em> <em>falconeri</em>) are also important prey in some areas. Primary productivity in Snow Leopard habitat is relatively low due to low temperatures and high aridity, consequently, the density of ungulate prey also tends to be relatively low, with reports ranging from 0.9 to 10.2 animals per km² (e.g., Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Wild prey abundance is one of the main determinants of Snow Leopard abundance (Suryawanshi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Snow Leopard diet is dominated by wild caprids, reportedly contributing 45% to 98% of the diet, while livestock may contribute 40-70%, though generally more on the order of 15-30% (Schaller <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987, Oli<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>1994, Chundawat and Rawat 1994, Jackson 1996, Bagchi and Mishra 2006, Anwar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Shezad <em>et al<em>.</em></em> 2012, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Mallon<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Smaller prey reported in Snow Leopard diet (approximately 12–25%) include marmots (<em>Marmota </em>spp.), pika (<em>Ochotona </em>spp.), hares (<em>Lepus </em>spp.), small rodents, and birds. It appears that the contribution of small sized prey in Snow Leopard diet may have been overestimated in earlier studies due to inadvertent inclusion of scats of other carnivores such as foxes (<em>Vulpes</em> spp.) in the analyses of Snow Leopard diet. Results of recent studies that have confirmed the identity of scats through faecal DNA (e.g., Anwar <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Jumabay-Uulu <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2014, Suryawanshi<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2013) or examined prey DNA in scats (Shezad<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>2012) report the contribution of small sized prey to be relatively low (2-8%).<br/><br/>Although Snow Leopards may occur in relatively flat or rolling areas such as in parts of Mongolia and the Tibetan Plateau (Schaller 1998, McCarthy 2000), within their habitat, they favour steep, rugged and broken terrain and rocky outcrops (Jackson<em> et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Mountain ridges, cliff edges, and well-defined drainage lines serve as common travel routes and sites for the deposition of signs, including scrapes, scats, and scent marks (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988).<br/><br/>There is substantial variation in the reported home range sizes of Snow Leopards. An earlier study in Nepal based on ground-based very high frequency (VHF) tracking reported home ranges of five individuals between 12 and 39 km², with substantial overlap between individuals and sexes (Jackson and Ahlborn 1989). However, the home range of a single Snow Leopard radio-collared in 2013 in Nepal using a satellite collar was estimated to be &gt; 400 km² (Rinjan Shreshtha, WWF, pers. comm). McCarthy <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em> </em>(2005) reported home range size of four Snow Leopards based on VHF tracking in Mongolia to range between 13 and 141 km², while the satellite-monitored home range of one of these individuals in the same study was at least 15 times higher. In the most current and comprehensive study to have been undertaken, home ranges of 18 individuals monitored between 2008 and 2014 using Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellite telemetry in Mongolia ranged from approximately 100 to &gt;1,000 km² (SLT, Panthera and SLCF, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>A four-year camera trapping study in Mongolia reveals considerable underlying dynamics in an otherwise stable population of Snow Leopards, with the adult sex ratio apparently changing from being male-biased to female-biased during the study period (1.67 to 0.38 males per female, Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This is the first study to estimate vital rates including probabilities of immigration and emigration. The adult survival probability for the study population was estimated at 0.83 (Sharma <em>et al<em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).","Appendix 2 of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) provides a global and country-by-country threat assessment based on the GSLEP-supported exercise drawing loosely on the Threats Reduction Assessment (TRA) protocol of Salafsky and Margoluis (1999) and involving select experts from each range country. McCarthy and Mallon (2016) include several chapters exploring well-known and emerging threats including livestock depredation, prey declines, disease, illegal trade, climate change, and resource extraction. There is considerable variation in the type and extent of threat among countries, especially with respect to large countries such as China or Mongolia where suitable habitat is extensive and split across different administrative regions. The main ongoing threats fall into three broad areas: 1) competition with livestock, habitat degradation and declines in prey; 2) depredation by Snow Leopards on livestock and retaliatory killing; 3) illegal trade in furs, bones and other body parts. New threats have been identified since 2003, including climate change, mining, large scale infrastructure and barriers such as roads or fenced railway lines (Wingard <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Zahler 2016); however, the potential impact of these emerging threats on Snow Leopards or their habitat is as yet difficult to quantify. A further set of threats regarded as less severe at the range-wide level, or at least more localized, include the lack of awareness among local people and policymakers, insufficient institutional capacity and law enforcement, and limited transboundary collaboration.<br/><br/>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below: <br/><br/>Recently Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) found that over 90% of annual Snow Leopard poaching is estimated to occur in five range countries: China (103-236 animals poached per year), Mongolia (34-53), Pakistan (23-53), India (21-45) and Tajikistan (20-25). While the highest levels of poaching and illegal trade are in China, which has the largest share of Snow Leopard range, countries with smaller shares of global range were flagged for having disproportionately high levels of estimated poaching (Nepal and Pakistan) and illegal Snow Leopard trade (Afghanistan and Russia). Afghanistan, Bhutan and Kazakhstan had markedly low levels of seizures compared to observations of poaching and illegal trade, suggesting the need for strengthened law enforcement in these countries (Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","There are no robust estimates of Snow Leopard global population size and the various figures available are best regarded as guesses: 4,080-6,500 (McCarthy and Chapron 2003); 4,500-7,500 (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010), and 3,920-6,390 (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013). There are several difficulties to overcome in making reliable estimates of Snow Leopard population size (Snow Leopard Network 2014), namely this species’ secretive nature, generally low density, sparse (or sporadic) distribution and remote terrain contributing to generally low detection rates and small sample sizes that in turn may make extrapolation problematic. Until recently, most studies were conducted over rather small areas, sometimes smaller than the home range of a single Snow Leopard, rendering the information inadequate to make population and density inferences over larger areas (Appendix 1 in Snow Leopard Network 2014). Furthermore, not all studies report the size of the surveyed area, thus precluding generation of density estimates. These limitations are starting to be addressed, for example through the adoption of more robust methods, such as spatially-explicit recapture models from camera data (e.g., Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015). Additionally, recently published information includes relatively rigorous surveys conducted over larger areas (see below).<br/><br/>Snow Leopards are known to breed at 2 or 3 years of age (Leif Blomqvist, International Snow Leopard Studbook Keeper, Helsinki Zoo, pers. comm., Jay Tetzloff, US Association of Zoos and Aquariums Snow Leopard Species Survival Plan Coordinator, pers. comm., McCarthy and Chapron 2003). Field observations are consistent with Snow Leopards breeding at 2 or 3 years of age. Of two known-age females in a long-term radio-telemetry study of Snow Leopards in Mongolia, one gave birth at the age of 3 years and the other at age 3 or 4 years (O. Johansson, pers. comm. and Panthera/Snow Leopard Trust unpublished data). Since breeding occurs in February/March and birth occurs in May/June, this means that one female definitely bred at age 2 years and the second bred when either 2 or 3 years old. Two other females of estimated age in the same study likely gave birth when 3-4 years old, again indicating successful breeding at 2-3 years old. Sexual maturity and breeding at 2-3 years old appears to be consistent across a range of large wild felids (Berry <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Hunter 1998, Kelly <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1998, Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Hunter <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Miller 2013, Miller and Funston 2014).<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List guidelines (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2016) define 'mature individuals' as individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction. The guidelines also state that age of first reproduction in the wild may be later than the age at which an individual is biologically capable of breeding. Hence, mature individuals in the Red List context are those capable of breeding, not just those actually breeding in any given year. Snow Leopards are capable of breeding beginning at 2 years of age and thus meet the IUCN definition of mature individuals, even if they do not actually start to breed this young.<br/><br/>Estimating the percent of mature individuals (≥  2 years of age) in the wild Snow Leopard population has been historically difficult, but with the extensive application of camera trapping new information is available. In 21 camera trapping studies conducted in 6 countries between 2003 and 2014 and comprising more than 29,165 trap-nights, a mean of 82.3% of Snow Leopards captured in photos were independent animals (Appendix 1 in the Supporting Information). Snow Leopards become independent at between 18 and 26 months old, hence, a small percent of independent cats in camera trap photos may not yet have reached the mature age class (2-year olds).<br/><br/>With few exceptions, published felid population estimates do not include dependent cubs. Camera-trapping derived density estimates are an example where exclusion of cubs applies. The global population estimate of 4,080-6,590 Snow Leopards (McCarthy and Chapron 2003) only includes mature individuals. Similarly, the 2008 Red List assessment (Jackson <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008) for Snow Leopard states that the population estimate is for adults only and the authors calculate effective population size (2,040) as 50% of the estimated total number of adults (4,080), citing Nowell <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2007). Hence, for the purposes of estimating the percent of mature individuals, published Snow Leopard population estimates should be considered to be comprised of adults only.<br/><br/>Population modelling can be used to estimate the percent of individuals in each age class. McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015 (Appendix 2 in supplementary material) employed a stochastic age-structured population model to produce a suite of stable stage population matrices. Vital rate input variables included the age at which Snow Leopards become capable of reproduction (mature), and the percentage of each age class that actually bred. The proportion of yearlings in the population estimate varied in the model from 0% to 50%. The model was run using nine scenarios of various combinations of vital rates and percentages of yearlings in the population. The lowest percentage of mature individuals (MI) was obtained when 2-year old maturity rates were lowest (25%), actual breeding did not begin until age 3, and the proportion of cubs in the population estimate was highest (50%). Yet even in that most precautionary scenario a mean MI of 67.7% (s.d. = 2.07) was obtained. Applying that MI percent to the most conservative global population estimate of 4,000 individuals, yields 2,710 (s.d. = 83) mature individuals. Model outputs for all nine scenarios when applied to this minimum population of 4,000 ranged from 2,710 to 3,386 MI. In no case did MI fall below the threshold required for an Endangered designation for the species.<br/><br/>A population of &lt; 2,500 mature individuals distributed across 1,776,000 km² (taking a relatively conservative estimate of global range size from Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) or a maximum of 3,300,000 km² (Snow Leopard Network 2014) equates to a density of one Snow Leopard capable of reproduction per 710 km² or 1,320 km² respectively. We question how such a scenario would be demographically viable; and in fact, recent best-practice density estimates largely range from 1 to over 3 per 100 km² for areas surveyed to date (see below).<br/><br/>Doubt is also being cast on the lower estimates of the global Snow Leopard population size through the expansion of field surveys in recent years and the application of more sophisticated and reliable survey techniques (such as systematic camera trapping, faecal genotyping and satellite collaring). Recent studies have confirmed the presence of Snow Leopards in new areas or their reappearance in former areas. Snow Leopards returned to the Sagarmatha area, Nepal, in 2002-2003 after an absence of <em>ca</em> 25 years (Lovari <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Ferretti <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Snow Leopard presence in the Vakhan Range of Tajikistan was confirmed by camera-trapping for the first time in 2011 (Diment <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012) and in the Kizilsu area of the Gissar Nature Reserve in Uzbekistan in 2013 (Panthera, unpublished data). In other areas, studies have indicated stable or even circumstantial evidence of increasing populations. In Wakhan District (10,000 km²) in Afghanistan, the National Environmental Protection Agency reports that numbers of Snow Leopards and one of their main prey, argali <em>Ovis ammon</em>, have increased in recent years (www.khaama.org 06 August 2015). The Snow Leopard population in Tost Uul, South Gobi, Mongolia, has been the object of the most intensive (and reliable) research to date using satellite collaring and camera trapping and was reported to be stable during the course of four years of study (Sharma <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This site was completely unprotected until recently.<br/><br/>A review of the majority of camera trap and genetic surveys to date indicate densities in excess of 1.5 adults per 100 km². Densities of 0.87-2.85 and 0.32-1.62 per 100 km² were reported at two sites in the Eastern Pamirs (Kachel 2014). In Bhutan, there is a “bright future for Snow Leopards” (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016) and density in Wangchuk Centennial Park, Bhutan was estimated at 2.39/100 km² by Shrestha <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2013). Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2014) found even higher densities in Bhutan’s Jigme Dorji National Park (6.2/100 km²) and estimated that the protected area could harbour as many as 192 Snow Leopards, which is nearly equal to the high end of the estimate for the entire country (200). At six sites in Ladakh-Spiti, India, densities were 0.45, 0.74, 1.17, 1.66, 1.94, and 3.3 per 100 km² (Suryawanshi <em>et al</em>. 2013). Density in Sarychat-Ertash State Reserve, Kyrgyzstan, was 1.38 per 100 km² (Jumabay-uulu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which is a reserve that Koshkarev and Vyrypaev (2000) pointed to as having been ‘absolutely trapped out’, with surveys in 1999 finding no sign of Snow Leopards after the post-Soviet declines earlier that decade.<br/><br/>In China, Snow Leopard presence has been confirmed at numerous locations across all parts of the range, including areas where the species was thought to have disappeared such as Inner Mongolia (Riordan and Shi 2016). The Second National Biodiversity Survey of China being undertaken by the State Forestry Administration suggests that there have been improvements for Snow Leopard and their ecosystems across the country since the first assessment reported in 1995. Snow Leopard populations in the Sanjiangyuan region are believed to have increased in the last 20 years along with those of a major prey species, Blue Sheep (<em>Pseudois nayaur</em>) (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Camera-trap surveys in Suojia (also in Sanjiangyuan) indicated densities of 3.1/100 km² (Li 2012). Alexander <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015), using spatially-explicit recapture models, reported 3.31 Snow Leopards/100 km² in the Qilian Shan range, where surveys in the 1980s suggested densities &lt; 1/100 km². Schaller (2014) resurveyed portions of the Qilian Shan range in Qinghai 29 years after he first surveyed the area and although direct comparisons were not made they saw more Snow Leopard sign and more Blue Sheep in their recent surveys. Qinghai Forestry Department recently increased their estimate for the province to at least 1,000 individuals based on camera trapping surveys (Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Riordan and Shi (2016) estimate Snow Leopard populations for each province in China, totalling at least 4,500 for the whole country. Since China contains c. 60% of the overall range this figure implies that the global population may possibly reach 7,500, broadly in line with the upper estimates described above. The current situation for Snow Leopard in China is a result of new information emerging as survey effort improves, as well as positive effects of the illegalization of firearms in China in 1989, along with hunting bans in key provinces, and greater awareness of the national importance of Snow Leopards.<br/><br/>Some, but not all, of the recent studies have been in protected areas or locations thought to have good populations of Snow Leopards, so densities might be higher there than elsewhere, and thus these figures are not easily extrapolated to the entire range. However, taken together, and considering the widely spread localities within the overall distribution of Snow Leopards, these figures do seem to suggest that the global population size is closer to the upper end of the estimates cited above, rather than the lower end.<br/><br/>Two sets of global population estimates published in 2015, after the modelling exercise in Appendix 2 (in the Supporting Information) was carried out, also suggest that Snow Leopard numbers are higher than previously estimated in 2003. In 2008, an expert knowledge process was used to map current Snow Leopard range and identify important Snow Leopard Conservation Units (SLCUs) within that range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Experts from all range states and global experts participated and identified 69 SLCUs. Adequate information was available to estimate Snow Leopard population size in 56 SLCUs, placing it at 4,678 to 8,745 adults and large sub-adults within an area of 875,818 km², or about 31.5% of currently occupied range. The population trend was considered to be stable or increasing in 33 (48%) of SLCUs and decreasing in only 15 (22%), while no information on trend was reported by experts in 11 (30%) of the units. Notably, experts indicated that most population and trend estimates they provided came from recent research as opposed to previous ‘guesstimates’ lacking field-based evidence.<br/><br/>With the recent publication of the first ever comprehensive book on the species (McCarthy and Mallon 2016), additional light has been shed on current Snow Leopard population estimates in most of the 12 range countries. National experts authored individual chapters providing updates on the status of the species in their home countries. With the exception of Bhutan those chapters included current population estimates; taking the high and low values of the population ranges provided (Table 1 in the Supporting Information) a range-wide population of 7,367-7,884 is indicated. If the results of the 2014-2016 Bhutan Snow Leopard census are added in (79-112: Thinley <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016), the global population would then be estimated at 7,446 to 7,996. This indicates that Snow Leopards are likely more numerous than historic estimates suggest, perhaps substantially so. It should be noted that this represents better knowledge and not necessarily a population increase.<br/><br/>There is little evidence to indicate that small-scale fragmentation and lack of connectivity are significant issues, despite the typically insular nature of mountain habitat and the species’ preference for steep or broken terrain. Most of Snow Leopard range is more or less contiguous and it is difficult to delimit separate subpopulations (Jackson, unpub. data; Janecka, unpub. data); furthermore, other than major rivers along the periphery of Snow Leopard range, some border fences, and short sections of railroads or major highways, there currently appear to be few major barriers to restrict movement. The Mongolia telemetry study has confirmed that Snow Leopards are capable of crossing open habitat (desert plains) in excess of 100 km (Panthera/SLT unpublished data) and Snow Leopards have been encountered attempting to cross the Chinese Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia on at least three occasions (Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2015, Nei Mongol Wildlife Division, pers. comm). Riordan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2015) used resistant kernel modelling to assess connectivity and predicted two regional populations, in the north and south of the species range, and identified several potentially important connecting areas. Snow Leopard range in Nepal lies in five “relatively contiguous habitat blocks” (Ale <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); in Pakistan, there is “confirmed presence over large landscapes” (Ud-Din and Nawaz<em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016); the range in Bhutan is virtually contiguous across the whole of the north of the country (Wangchuk and Tharchen 2016); in Sanjiangyuan region, a key Snow Leopard habitat in China, “there are abundant connections between important habitats” (Li 2012, Liu <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Current Population Trend</strong>:<br/>Snow Leopard numbers are reportedly stable or modestly increasing in some areas, but are likely to be declining in others. Recent localized extinctions may have occurred in some areas of the former Soviet Union (Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016). Evidence of increased or re-established populations described above may in some cases be a consequence of enhanced survey effort in previously unsurveyed areas, although conservation actions and policies will have no doubt helped. However, there remains a lack of sufficiently longitudinal surveys, except in very few sites, and thus we have virtually no substantiated documentation of population trends over appropriate time scales. This is an information gap that urgently needs to be filled in order to validate this and all future Red List assessments and provide a reliable basis from which to evaluate conservation actions and measure their impact.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Past </strong><br/>Population reductions in the Central Asian republics—which represent only 7% of the global occupied range (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016)—following the collapse of the Soviet Union are thought to have been as high as 40-75% during the 1990s. There is no evidence to indicate such high rates of decline continued beyond the late 1990s.<br/><br/><strong>Population Reduction - Future</strong> <br/>Recent surveys in Pakistan suggest that Snow Leopard numbers in parts of the country may be lower than previously thought (Snow Leopard Foundation, unpublished reports, Nawaz and Hameed 2015) and may experience further decline in the future. Localized extinctions, such as those documented by Taubmann <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> (2016) in parts of the Alay region of Kyrgyzstan, may be expected in other isolated sites in Central Asia. There are also growing threats from extractive industries across the species’ range and potential impacts from climate change which may influence population trends. Despite positive conditions described previously, a decline of 10% over the next 3 generations (22.62 years) is estimated in light of localized declines given the growing threat related to increasing livestock numbers in some countries or emerging threats like intensified road construction and mineral extraction (see below). However, projecting rural development more than 3-5 years into the future is difficult, even in countries with well-articulated 5-10 year Development Plans, environmental impact laws or robust protocols for forecasting economic growth.<br/>&#160;<br/><strong>Population Reduction - Ongoing</strong> <br/>Current reductions appear to be modest and local, likely driven by a declining natural prey base, localized poaching for skins, and sporadic but apparently increasing human-wildlife conflict resulting from depredation of livestock. Growing flocks of sheep and goats and a thriving meat (e.g., Nepal and Pakistan) and cashmere trade (China and Mongolia) appear to lie at the root of these inter-connected threats (Berger <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). However, where not mitigated, the mix of livestock-wild ungulate competition, associated rangeland degradation, declining natural prey numbers and Snow Leopard predation of livestock would likely accelerate retributive killing by herders, who could also be expected to offset their economic losses by funnelling Snow Leopard body parts into the illegal trade network.",Decreasing,"The range of the Snow Leopard extends from the Himalaya in the south, across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the mountains of Central Asia to the mountains of southern Siberia in the north. It occurs in the Altai, Sayan, Tien Shan, Kunlun, Pamir, Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and outer Himalayan ranges and in smaller isolated mountains in the Gobi region. It occurs in 12 countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. A small area of potential range occurs in northern Myanmar but recent Snow Leopard presence has not been confirmed. The area of occupied range was recently estimated to be about 2.8 million km² (McCarthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2016).","Poaching and illegal trade has been a traditional threat and continues in many parts of the range. Currently, the demand for rugs, luxury décor, and taxidermy, especially from China and Eastern Europe appears on the increase (EIA 2012). In China, that holds the largest Snow Leopard population, trade in Snow Leopard pelt and bones, which was earlier restricted to Snow Leopard range provinces, is reported to also be emerging in the wealthier coastal cities since 2010 (Li and Lu 2014). The extent of illegal trade was reviewed by Maheshwari and Von Meibom (2016).",Terrestrial,"Very significant investments in conservation have been made. These include: establishment of new protected areas within the Snow Leopard range; anti-poaching measures; training and capacity-building; initiatives to reduce conflict with herders (e.g. strengthening livestock corrals, vaccination, handicrafts and alternative livelihoods, grazing set-asides), community engagement programmes; illegalization and confiscation of firearms across China, and education programmes to raise awareness of the Snow Leopard and its habitat (see Conservation Measures section for more details and examples). The Rangewide Priority Setting workshop in Beijing in 2008 (Sanderson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (Snow Leopard Working Secretariat 2013) and the revised version of the Snow Leopard Survival Strategy (Snow Leopard Network 2014) have all enhanced the global strategic framework for conservation of the species.<br/><br/>Illegal poaching, the main threat to Russia's Snow Leopard population, was recently alleviated, at least in several important areas, by concerted removal of wire-snares and the recruitment of former poachers as protected area rangers (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Anti-poaching efforts in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have also been strengthened, thus addressing the main underlying threat that led to the drastic decline in numbers in several Central Asia states following the break-up of the Soviet Union 25 years ago.<br/><br/>In terms of protected area establishment and enhancement, the whole of Wakhan District Afghanistan (&gt;10,000 km²) has been declared the country’s second national park (Moheb and Paley 2016). Sarychat Ertash State Reserve, a key site in Kyrgyzstan, has recently been enlarged by 150 km² and mining concessions withdrawn (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015), and several projects have worked on management planning, training and monitoring and/ or provided substantial amounts of equipment (Hotham <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Tost Uul, a key site in Mongolia’s South Gobi, was declared a local nature reserve in 2010 (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a>, 4 October 2015). Capacity building in Zorkul State Reserve in the Eastern Pamir of Tajikistan includes development of a new management plan, training programmes, and substantial donations of equipment (Mallon and Diment 2013). The role of Buddhist monasteries in providing effective protection around monasteries was highlighted by Li <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2014). The GSLEP initiative, along with conservation practitioners have been highlighting customary beliefs of Snow Leopards as important totem animals for select traditional communities across this species' range.<br/><br/>A number of transboundary projects provide important conservation benefits to Snow Leopards across their range (Rosen and Zahler 2016). Two transboundary or landscape-level projects are currently operating in Central Asia (Mallon and Kulikov 2015): The Khan Tengri nature conservation park (3,257 km²) has been designated in eastern Kyrgyzstan that will link Naryn Reserve, Sarychat Ertash Reserve, and two others in Kyrgyzstan with Tomur Nature Reserve in China; a transboundary project is currently operating in the northern Tien Shan (Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan) with Snow Leopard as a focal species and with the aim of developing cooperation and enhancing protected areas. The UNDP/GEF Altai-Sayan Project (2007-2012) also identified the Snow Leopard as one of its focal species and carried out a series of transboundary projects including camera trapping, and training (WWF 2012).<br/><br/>Many incentive programs have been initiated (reviewed in Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003 and see chapters in McCarthy and Mallon 2016). One oft-cited threat is the killing of Snow Leopards by herders in retaliation for predation on livestock, exacerbated by occasions when many sheep or goats are killed in a single attack by a Snow Leopard gaining entry to poorly constructed or maintained night-time corrals. Remedial measures have involved strengthening corrals to make them predator-proof. To date, over 260 corrals have been strengthened in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Tajikistan with the result that no subsequent livestock predation occurred (Mohammad <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016, Moheb and Paley 2016). A similar programme in Western Tyva, Russia protected corrals in 46 herder camps, and since 2008 no predation occurred in any of them and annual losses of livestock fell by 50-60% (Paltsyn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>Innovative community programmes have been established in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with new governance structures created (over 65 in Pakistan) aimed at local natural resource management, and with over 50 rangers in the Afghan Wakhan and over 100 rangers in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan monitoring wildlife and enforcing local and national regulations against poaching and other resource extraction activities (Zahler and Paley 2016). A programme has been pioneered by the Snow Leopard Trust in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan to increase local incomes by providing training in the manufacture of handicrafts and access for the finished products to international markets in return for a commitment to prevent poaching of Snow Leopards and their prey and to engage in environmental education and other activities. These programmes have proved successful and have had additional benefits (Bayarjargal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). In Kyrgyzstan, no Snow Leopards or prey were poached during 2014 in any of the partner communities (<a href=""www.snowleopard.org"">www.snowleopard.org</a> 3 June 2015). Incentives related to ecotourism have led to a surge in Snow Leopard sightings in Hemis National Park, Ladakh (India), attributed to a combination of corral predator-proofing and meaningful income generation associated with community-managed homestays first initiated in 2007 (Jackson and Wangchuk 2004, Wangchuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Jackson 2015, Namgail and Dadul 2016). With these local communities now perceiving Snow Leopards positively instead of pests to be killed or chased away, this notoriously elusive big cat is now being regularly observed from distances as close as 50-200 meters, especially during its mating season in winter.<br/><br/>In addition to these programmes, other conservation initiatives include grazing set-asides (village reserves; Mishra <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock vaccination (Nawaz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016), livestock insurance (Kunkel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016) and a range of education and awareness projects (Hillard <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). Conservation initiatives that blend conservation science with traditional knowledge, and which mitigate Snow Leopard-related human-wildlife conflict, improve household incomes for households dependent upon livestock, and that highlight the cultural and ecological importance of Snow Leopards are also most likely to be embraced by local people who likely represent the effective and cost-efficient stewards for this felid's remote mountain landscapes (Jackson and Brewer-Lama 2016).",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
51140517,15188,Okapia johnstoni,Endangered,A2abcd+4abcd,2015,2015-07-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Okapi have been undergoing a decline since at least 1995 that is ongoing and projected to continue, in the face of severe, intensifying threats and lack of effective conservation action which is hindered by the lack of security. The rate of decline is estimated to have exceeded 50% over three generations (24 years), based on figures from surveys in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (Réserve de Faune à Okapis; RFO) suggesting a 43% decline over the period 1995-2007, which some reports suggest continued in the period thereafter. The RFO remains the best protected site and it is inferred that the rate of decline here is at least equalled in other parts of the Okapi range. Although monitoring is only available to support estimates of declines in RFO since 1995, reports of declines or extirpations in other parts of the range and loss and degradation of habitat have been ongoing since 1980. The species is confirmed to be Endangered under criterion A2abcd+4abcd.","Okapi are limited to closed, high canopy forests between about 450 m asl and 1,500 m asl and they occur in a wide range of primary and older secondary forest types. They do not extend into gallery forests or the forest-savannah ecotone and do not persist in disturbed habitats surrounding larger settlements. Okapi will use seasonally inundated areas when the substrate is still wet, but they do not occur in truly inundated sites or extensive swamp forest. Tree fall gaps are selected as foraging sites for Okapi during the early stages of regeneration (Hart 2013). Okapi are unique in being the only species of forest ungulate to depend on understorey foliage and they are known to feed on over 100 species. They are mainly diurnal but have also been recorded feeding at night (Nixon and Lusenge 2008). Okapi have defined but non-exclusive home ranges, averaging 3-5 km<sup>2</sup> for adult females and up to 13 km<sup>2</sup> for adult males. Okapi are mainly solitary (Hart 2013). Generation length is broadly estimated at around eight years, based on calculations made for the global captive population (S. Hofman and K. Leus pers. comm. 2013).","Okapi can coexist with small-scale, low-level human occupation of the forest, but disappear in areas of active settlement or disturbance, and the major threat to this species is habitat loss due to logging and human settlement including illegal occupation of protected areas (Hart 2013, Kümpel <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;According to Hart (2013) approximately one-third of the Okapi’s known distribution is likely to be at risk by major incursions during the first quarter of this century. Areas at high risk include the southeastern Ituri Forest, the Kisangani area, Rubi-Tele, and the western and eastern limits of the species' range in the Ebola River basin and Virunga-Hoyo region respectively.<br/><br/>Hunting for meat and skins is also a threat and Okapi decline rapidly in areas where there is persistent use of snares. In some areas, Okapi are targeted for bushmeat whereas in others they are taken only incidentally (Hart 2013, Kümpel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The most prominent current threat to Okapi is the presence of illegal armed groups in and around key protected areas. These groups prevent effective conservation action, even surveys and monitoring in most sites, and engage in and facilitate elephant poaching, bushmeat hunting, illegal mining (gold, coltan and diamonds), illegal logging, charcoal production and agricultural encroachment. In a notorious incident in June 2012, armed rebels attacked the RFO HQ and killed seven people and all 14 captive Okapi.","East (1999) estimated that the total population may be over 10,000 and Hart (2013) estimated 35,000-50,000, though both sets of figures are perhaps better regarded as ‘guesstimates’ as they rely on extrapolation of a limited number of patchily distributed, dung-based surveys. Individual Okapi are rarely encountered and in much of their range they are uncommon or dispersed in localized areas, with dung found at low densities, commonly resulting in inadequate sample sizes for statistical analysis. Current numbers are believed to be lower and declining, but there is no reliable estimate of current population size. <br/><br/>It is widely considered that there was a decline in the Okapi population, along with other species, following the decade-long civil war which ended in the early 2000s. Population estimates were made in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve (Réserve de Faune à Okapis; RFO) in 1993-1995 and repeated in 2005-2007 using the same ‘monitoring’ transects and distance sampling methodology, though individual transects were not necessarily carried out at the same time of year due to insecurity limiting access to parts of the Reserve (Hart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). These surveys showed a decline in dung density of 43% between the two survey periods. A second set of transects in 2005-2007 used an improved spatial design (systematic placement of transects covering the entire reserve), but were also conducted across seasons for the reasons above. Further analysis is required to determine whether comparison of these ‘systematic’ transects with the 1995-1997 and 2005-2007 monitoring transects, and a further set of transects conducted in 2000-2002 over part of the reserve under the MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants) program, supports the observed decline in dung density, and to specifically investigate seasonality as a variable. The same type of systematic design was used again in 2010-2011, but implemented over the three month dry season to reduce the effects of seasonality. While an overall comparison between the two systematic surveys (2005-2007 and 2010-2011) appeared to show an increase in Okapi dung density (Vosper <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), a comparison between transects undertaken at the same time of year (the dry season only), in the same area of the reserve, showed no significant difference in Okapi dung density (F. Maisels pers. comm. 2014). Seasonal differences in dung decay rates therefore complicate comparisons between these various sets of surveys.<br/><br/>Supporting evidence for RFO is available from Law Enforcement Monitoring (LEM) patrols from 2008 to 2013. These patrols covered distances of 10,125–25,467 km annually and showed an apparent decline in Okapi dung encounter rates between 2008 and 2013 (ICCN RFO unpubl. data). However, because the patrols were focused on anti-poaching and wildlife recording was secondary, patrol routes were not randomly located, and patrol timings and locations varied among years because of security and logistical issues, the data must be interpreted with caution.<br/><br/>Since the rebel attack on the RFO headquarters in June 2012 (see ‘Threats’ below), the presence of armed groups and an influx of illegal miners and poachers has reduced the ability of the reserve authorities to protect the reserve and this is likely to have ongoing implications for resident wildlife populations. RFO is still the most effectively protected Okapi site with resident rangers and an active conservation programme and the overall rate of decline here is inferred to have been equalled or exceeded elsewhere.<br/><br/>In the Twabinga-Mundo region, anecdotal evidence suggests that Okapi are targeted for their skins and meat, and have undergone a drastic decline in numbers over the past two decades with local people reporting that Okapi is the most prized bushmeat available (Nixon&#160;2010). Okapi had been present south of the town of Aketi and near the town of Buta but no signs were found on recent field surveys and locals said they had recently been hunted out by Bangalema nomadic hunters (Hicks 2010).",Decreasing,"Okapi distribution extends across parts of central, northern and eastern DR Congo. North and east of the Congo River, Okapi range from Maiko Forest north to the Ituri Forest, then west through the Rubi, Tele and Ebola river basins, extending north towards the Ubangi River. Okapi have a much smaller range to the west and south of the Congo River, extending from the west bank of the Lomami River west to the upper Lomela and Tshuapa basins (Hart 2013). In the fairly recent past, Okapi occurred occasionally in the adjoining Semliki forest of western Uganda (Kingdon 1979).<br/><br/>Recorded presence is concentrated in and around protected areas, mainly reflecting survey effort. The remoteness and inaccessibility of much Okapi habitat make field work logistically difficult, and insecurity in DRC over the past two decades has further restricted survey activity. As a consequence, extensive parts of potential Okapi range are poorly studied. Furthermore, Okapi are secretive and their occurrence can easily go undetected, especially at low densities.<br/><br/>The known strongholds of the Okapi are the Ituri and Maiko landscapes, the forests of the upper Lindi, Maiko and Tshopo basins and the Rubi-Tele region in Bas Uele (Hart 2013). There are confirmed recent (2013) records of Okapi in the Abumonbanzi Reserve in Gbadolite district of North Ubangi at the northwest end of the distribution (Ngbolua <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Since 1980, expansion of human settlement, deforestation and forest degradation have eliminated important portions of the Okapi range, in particular in the southern and eastern Ituri Forest where the species was at one time abundant (Hart 2013).<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence (EOO) is 383,190 km<sup>2</sup>, but this includes unsuitable habitat such as degraded forest, swamp forest and urban areas. Excluding all these gives in an area of 244,405 km<sup>2</sup> for the suitable or hypothesised range (Kümpel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). The area of occupancy (AOO) is 14,112 km<sup>2</sup>, based on a grid of 5.6 x 5.6 km, the size used by most reported surveys and 450 (3.5%) of 12,764 grid squares with confirmed presence Kümpel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015). The AOO figure is however considered likely to be a substantial underestimate, surveys have been conducted in only 1,994 (15.6%) out of 12,764 grid squares so far.",Okapi are hunted for meat and skins.,Terrestrial,"<p>This species is not included in the CITES Appendices. The Okapi is a fully protected species under Congolese law and the species is a national symbol, appearing on the insignia of the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (ICCN) and on Congolese banknotes. <br/> <br/> The RFO (14,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and Maiko National Park (10,800 km<sup>2</sup>) support significant populations, but numbers in both sites have declined owing to the threats listed above. Strengthening protection of these two protected areas is the single most important means to ensure long-term survival of Okapi (East 1999, Hart 2013). A small population of Okapi still occurs in the Watalinga Forest (1,100 km<sup>2</sup>) in the northern sector of Virunga National Park, but currently receives no protection due to the presence of armed groups, though a new forest corridor project connecting Watalinga to the Mt Hoyo Reserve (200 km<sup>2</sup>), where Okapi have also been recorded, is due to start in 2015. Okapi occur in Rubi-Tele Hunting Reserve (c. 9,000 km<sup>2</sup>), though its precise legal status is unclear, in Abumonbanzi Reserve in the far west of the range, and on the west bank of the Congo River, where the proposed Lomami National Park within the Tshuapa-Lomami-Lualaba landscape (9,500 km<sup>2</sup>) is undergoing the process of official gazettement (Kümpel <em>et al.</em> 2015). A number of community reserves are located around Maiko National Park. </p>  <p>Many captive Okapi are held in international collections. In November 2011, representatives of the North American and European captive populations, including the Okapi Species Survival Plan (SSP) and the Okapi European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), met to discuss the role of the captive population in Okapi conservation and agreed to maintain a sustainable, cooperatively managed global <em>ex situ</em> Okapi population that contributes to a viable <em>in situ</em> population (Petric 2012). The zoo community is a major supporter of Okapi conservation work, in 2010 donating USD 225,000 to the Okapi Conservation Project, 33% of its budget (Gilman International Conservation, 2010). </p>    <p>ICCN is the government agency responsible for protected area management but is under-staffed and under-funded. The Okapi Conservation Project was established in 1987 and works within the RFO to protect Okapi and their habitat, as well as the culture of the indigenous Mbuti pygmies. Project activities include capacity building, agroforestry and community support (Gilman International Conservation 2010). The Wildlife Conservation Society started field surveys and research on Okapi in RFO and elsewhere in DRC in the 1980s. Several other international NGOs have also conducted Okapi-related work in DRC, including Fauna &amp; Flora International, Frankfurt Zoological Society, the Lukuru Foundation, and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). The first-ever species-wide Okapi conservation strategy was developed at a workshop held in DRC in May 2013 that was organised by ZSL in partnership with ICCN (Kümpel<em> et al.</em> 2015). In March 2013 a new IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group was established, co-hosted by ZSL, with the aim of coordinating research and conservation on both giraffid species and supporting implementation of the Okapi conservation strategy.</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The habitat at the type locality has been completely degraded (G. Gonzalez Duran pers. comm. 2016). Its breeding ecology is unknown.,"In the past, habitat at the type locality was degraded by guerrilla activities and smallholder farming. However civil unrest has now ceased and is no longer a threat, but agriculture continues to be the main threat to this species (Colombia Red List Assessment Workshop August 2016).","This species is only known from three specimens. Since its first description, it has not been seen and at least a dozen surveys in the type locality have failed to record it. Recent surveys (2014–2015) in the area of the type locality also failed to record the species (C. Marin pers. comm. August 2016). Due to ongoing decline in the extent and quality of habitat, the population is suspected to be decreasing.",Decreasing,"This species is only known from the region of the type locality, 8 km east of Sonsón in the Cordillera Central, in the department of Antioquia, Colombia, at 2,780 m Asl.

89624491,7950,Equus grevyi,Endangered,A2acd,2016,2016-08-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Grevy's Zebra has been assessed as Endangered under criterion A2acd. There was a population reduction of 54% over the past three generations (30 years) from an estimated 5,800 in the late 1980s to a current population of about 2,680 individuals. The species also qualifies as Vulnerable under Criterion C1+2a(i)&#160;as there are &lt;2,000 mature individuals.&#160;This number consists of approximately 2,350 individuals in Kenya (1,716 mature animals) in 2016 and about 230 individuals in Ethiopia (168 mature animals) in 2011. There is an estimated continuing decline of 10% over the next three generations if the population in Ethiopia declines severely, and additionally the largest subpopulation of Grevy's Zebra has &lt;1,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>The population has been roughly stable over the past 10 years. It is considered stable or increasing in Kenya, but may be stable or declining in Ethiopia.&#160;In Kenya the proportion of foals and juveniles in the population has grown (Kenya Wildlife Service 2016). If this trend continues, it bodes well for the population in this country. In Ethiopia, estimates based on transect counts and some ‘sight-resight’ analyses suggest that in 2009-2010 the total population size was 228 +/- 53 (F. Kebede pers. comm. 2012), with the largest population numbering 196 individuals.","Grevy’s Zebras live in arid and semi-arid grass/shrubland where they can gain access to permanent water (Klingel 1974; Rubenstein 1986; Rowen and Ginsberg 1992; Williams 2002, 2013; Kebede 2013). They are predominantly grazers, although browse can comprise up to 30% of their diet during times of drought or in those areas that have been highly transformed through overgrazing (Kartzinel <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015). Breeding males defend resource territories (water and food being the key resources) of 2–12 km²; the home range size of non-territorial individuals can be as large as 10,000&#160;km² (Williams 2013). They are extremely mobile and individuals have been recorded to move distances of greater than 80&#160;km, with movements determined by the availability of resources; lactating females, for example, can only tolerate one or two days away from water (Klingel 1974; Rubenstein 1986; Rowen and Ginsberg 1992; Williams 2002, 2013). Hence when pastoral livestock monopolize water, Grevy’s Zebras suffer. They often mill around watering points in the late afternoon waiting to drink, thus reducing foraging time. By drinking predictably at night they are prone to predation by lions and in some areas when co-habiting with plains Zebras, they are preferentially attacked (Rubenstein 2010).&#160;During the dry season, when they are dependent on permanent water, Grevy’s Zebra may stay nearer to water and tend to be more concentrated. However, in the Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve in Ethiopia, they are more concentrated during the wet season in order to avoid the pastoralists and livestock that move into the area&#160;during that&#160;season (Kebede <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).<br/><br/>Between 2010 and 2014 the population of Grevy’s Zebras inhabiting the Mpala, Ol Jogi and Pyramid Conservancies in central Laikipia County, was monitored three times per year. During this period on average the population consisted of: 33% adult males of which 17% were territorial and 16% were bachelors; 40% adult females; 8% juveniles, half males and half females; and 19% infants of which 8% were males, 8% were females and 3% were of undetermined sex (Rubenstein and Brown pers. obs.). Therefore 33% adult males + 40% adult females gives 73% of the population as mature. Given that population projection models show population stability is maintained when the percentage of recruits (juveniles and foals) reach 30% (Rubenstein 2010), the Laikipia Grev’s Zebra population appears to be in relatively good demographic health (between 2004 and 2014).&#160;A decade of data on sightings of Grevy's Zebra numbers as well as age and sex class from scouts in the Meibae, Westgate, Sessia, Laisamas, Ngili West and Kalama Conservancies show an that the percentage of recruits (foals and juveniles) has increased from 9% to 22% of the population, with the 2016 Great Grevy's Rally showing a Kenya-wide age structure of 28% recruits. This indicates that this population is approaching sustainability.","Kenya’s Grevy’s Zebra Technical Committee recently assessed and ranked the threats to Grevy’s Zebras. In decreasing order they include: 1) Habitat degradation and loss induced by extremely heavy grazing by livestock (Rubenstein 2010, Low <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009); 2) Competition with livestock, especially over access to water and high quality rangeland (Rowen and Ginsberg 1992; Williams 2002, 2013); 3) Local hunting for meat as well as medicinal and cultural purpose; 4) Disease from contact with unvaccinated livestock, especially with respect to anthrax and babesiosis (Hawkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015); 5) Hybridization with plains Zebras, although genes currently only flow from Grevy’s to plains Zebras (Cordingley <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009); 6) Predation (Rubenstein 2010); 7) Anticipated land conversion for resort development and other large-scale initiatives for economic expansion.<br/><br/>In Kenya, hunting for skins in the late 1970s was the likely cause of the initial precipitous decline in numbers. Recent data suggest that numbers continued to decline because recruitment was limited by low levels of infant and juvenile survival. This was a result of competition for resources – both food and water – with pastoral people and their domestic livestock (Williams 1998). However, a low level of hunting of Grevy’s Zebra for food and, in some areas, medicinal uses continues (Williams pers. comm. 2002). Furthermore, access to existing water sources continues to decline in some regions and the water supply in critical perennial rivers has been reduced, most notably in the Ewaso Ng’iro River where over-abstraction of water for irrigation schemes has reduced dry season river flow by 90% over the past three decades (Williams pers. comm. 2002).<br/><br/>In Ethiopia, the Grevy’s Zebra population was in a declining trend during the last 30 years, due to habitat loss/fragmentation, drought, poaching and potential competition with livestock. Habitat loss, drought and poaching were considered to be the major threats. Illegal killing of Grevy’s Zebra was the primary cause of the decline (Kebede 2013). The Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve population is small and genetically isolated. Initial population genetics research on the mtDNA control region revealed two new haplotypes that so far are not found in any other Grevy’s Zebra populations. The nucleotide diversity levels for both the Alledeghi and the southern Ethiopian populations were extremely low (Kebede <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Recently, Muoria <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2007) recorded an outbreak of anthrax in the Wamba area of southern Samburu, Kenya, during which more than 50 animals succumbed to the disease. Further research on disease prevalence is revealing that Grevy’s Zebra are a reservoir for Theileria and Babesia (tick borne disease), and the first case of West Nile Virus has been found in one individual; the first detected in a wild equid (Hawkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Disease represents a significant potential threat to fragmented and small populations of endangered species.","Grevy's Zebra suffered a severe population reduction between the late 1970s/early 1980s and the early 2000s, declining from a global population of around 15,600 individuals in the late 1970s/early 1980s (Williams 2002) to around 2,000 individuals in 2004. Since then there have been some signs of population recovery, with the population remaining roughly stable over the last 10 years. Over the last three generations (a generation is approximately 10 years) there has been a population reduction of about 54% from an estimated 5,800 Grevy's Zebra in the 1980s to ~2,680 animals currently.<br/><br/>The most recent estimates put the total population of Grevy's Zebra remaining in the wild in Kenya and Ethiopia at less than 2,000 mature individuals, based on 73% adults in well studied populations (Rubenstein and Brown pers. obs. 2014). This number consists of approximately 2,350 individuals in Kenya (1,716 mature animals) in 2016 and about 230 individuals in Ethiopia (168 mature animals) in 2012. The largest regional population numbering around 1,300 individuals (949 mature) is in the centre of the Samburu region of central Kenya. <br/><br/>In Kenya, the Grevy’s Zebra population declined from around 13,700 in 1977 (Dirschl and Wetmore 1978) to 4,300 in 1988 (KREMU 1989). They then declined further to 2,400-2,700 in 2000 (Nelson and Williams 2003) and 1,570-1,980 in 2004 (KWS 2012), to an estimated population size of 1,470-2,140 in 2006 (B. Low pers. comm. 2007); a decline of 85-90% over 29 years. In 2008, the population was estimated to consist of 2,400 individuals, indicating that either counting techniques had improved or that the population had stabilized or even increased, or a combination of the two (Mwasi and Mwangi 2007, KWS 2012). An assessment of all existing counts carried out by Kenya’s Grevy’s Zebra Technical Committee in 2012 estimated that by 2011 the population in Kenya was approximately 2,500. In January 2016 a comprehensive census of Grevy's zebra in five counties in Kenya was conducted (“The Great Grevy’s Rally”). The census comprised of 350 people (members of the public, conservancy members, rangers and scouts from conservancies and National Parks and Reserves, and scientists) driving over 25,000 km² recording Grevy's zebras using GPS enabled cameras. Over 40,000 photos of Grevy's Zebra were taken. The photographs were sent to the US-based IBEIS team to process the images, identifying unique individuals seen on days 1 and 2 as well as the number seen on day 1 that were re-sighted on day 2. From these three values population size estimates could be computed. In the future, such analyses will be performed by Kenyan scientists once the software is made publicly available. From the sight-resight analysis the population was estimated to be 2,250 individuals (95% CI of +/- 93; KWS 2016). For the first time, Laikipia county has the highest number of Grevy’s Zebras (supporting over half of Kenya's Grevy's Zebra population), surpassing Samburu and Isiolo counties, the traditional heartland of the species. An additional 80-100 animals were estimated in Tsavo, Oserian, Meru National Park, and the Laisamas area - areas that were too dangerous or inaccessible to survey during the census period (KWS 2016). The total Kenya population in 2016 is therefore estimated to be ~2,350 individuals. The population will be re-censused in August 2017. It is expected that the Kenyan population of Grevy's Zebra will remain stable, or may increase due to conservation efforts.<br/><br/>In Ethiopia, Grevy’s Zebra declined from an estimated 1,500 (or a possible maximum of 1,900) in 1980 to approximately 600 in 1995 (Rowen and Ginsberg 1992, F. Kebede pers. comm. 2007), to approximately 100 in 2003 (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2003). In 2006, the population in Ethiopia was estimated to be approximately 130 (F. Kebede pers. comm. 2007). The trend from 1980 to 2003 (23 years) suggests a decline of roughly 94%. Counts and ‘sight-resight’ population analyses of the largest population suggest that by 2011 Ethiopia’s population had increased to approximately 230 individuals (Kebede et al. 2012, Kebede pers. comm. 2014). However this population is mainly in the Alledghi Wildlife Reserve (196 +/- 53 animals, declined from 600 in 1970) and very few individuals remain in Chew Bahir (22 animals, declined from 1,500 in 1970) and Borana (10 animals) (Williams 2002, Kebede pers. comm. 2014).&#160; The population in Ethiopia is expected to at best stay stable, and is likely to decline.<br/><br/><br/>The density and area of occupancy of Grevy’s Zebra fluctuates seasonally as animals move in their search for resources. During the dry season, when they are dependent on permanent water, animals tend to be more concentrated. However, given that they can move up to 35 km from water even during the dry season, their densities are never high. They are most abundant and most easily observed in the southern portion of their range in southern Samburu and Laikipia counties, Kenya.",Stable,"Grevy's zebra is only found in the Horn of Africa, specifically Ethiopia and Kenya. Grevy's Zebras have undergone substantial reductions in range. Historically, they ranged east of the Rift Valley in Kenya to southwestern Somalia, and in northern Ethiopia from the Alledeghi Plain through the Awash Valley, the Ogaden, and north-east of Lake Turkana in Ethiopia to north of Mt. Kenya and southeast down the Tana River in Kenya (Bauer <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1994). Currently, Grevy’s Zebra have a discontinuous range, and are found from the eastern side of the Rift Valley in Kenya to the Tana River. Currently there is a small, isolated population in the Alledeghi Plains northeast of Awash National Park (N.P.) in Ethiopia. From Lake Ch’ew Bahir in southern Ethiopia, the population extends to just north of Mt. Kenya although a few animals are found further southeast along the Tana River. A small introduced population survives in and around Tsavo East N.P. in Kenya.<br/><br/>Grevy's Zebra are considered to be extirpated from Somalia, where the last confirmed sightings date to 1973. There are no confirmed records that the species ever occurred in Eritrea or Djibouti (Bauer <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1994, Yalden <em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1986). Sightings in South Sudan are questionable and need to be verified (Williams 2002, 2013).","In Kenya, Grevy’s Zebras are only hunted at subsistence level for meat and medicinal uses; commercial trading of skins has ceased. In Ethiopia, killing of Grevy’s Zebra for meat and medicine is the primary cause of the decline (Kebede 2013).",Terrestrial,"Listed on CITES Appendix I. Grevy's Zebra are legally protected in both Kenya and Ethiopia, although in the latter, official protection has been limited. Changing attitudes of local pastoralist populations towards the species has had dramatic effects on improving the ranging, foraging and drinking capabilities of Grevy’s Zebras. Scout programs in which community members participate in gathering essential data on the ecology and behaviour of their populations not only generates income, it transforms the scouts into Grevy’s Zebra champions which in turn helps change community attitudes and gather essential information when populations are at risk (Low <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). In addition, in Kenya Grevy’s Zebras have been protected by a hunting ban since 1977. While under the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act No 376 of 1976 (Part II of the First Schedule), Grevy’s Zebra was listed as a ‘Game Animal’ (Williams 2002); there is a chance that they will be up-listed to a legally ‘Protected Animal’ in Kenya.<br/><br/>At present, protected areas form less than 0.5% of the range of Grevy’s Zebra. In Ethiopia, the protected areas are nominal (Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve, Borena Controlled Hunting Area and Chew Bahir/Chalbi Wildlife Reserve). In Kenya, the Buffalo Springs, Samburu, Shaba N.R. complex and the private and community land wildlife conservancies in Isiolo, Samburu and the Laikipia Plateau provide a core and crucial protection of Kenya’s southern population of Grevy’s Zebra (Williams 2002). On the Laikipia Plateau, protection and reduced competition with domestic livestock, have seen Grevy's Zebra numbers increasing since they first expanded into this area in the early 1970s (Williams 2002, 2013). In addition, changing attitudes in Samburu county, the centre of its distribution, has enabled Grevy’s Zebra to share resources more equitably with livestock, thus increasing the proportion of infants and juveniles (Low <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Habitat restoration through grass re-seeding and planned livestock grazing is targeting core habitat areas in Grevy’s Zebra range. Close monitoring of Grevy’s Zebra body condition during prolonged droughts is carried out by scouts and additional water provision made to ensure continued access to declining water sources (<a href=""http://www.grevysZebratrust.org/water-management.html"">http://www.grevysZebratrust.org/water-management.html</a>). In addition, supplementary feeding of Grevy’s Zebra during extreme drought is being piloted in Kenya (Grevy’s Zebra Disease Response Committee, 2013), and appears to have prevented a population decline during the 2011 drought in the conservancies of central Samburu County (Low and Rubenstein pers. obs).<br/><br/>Kenya has completed its second conservation strategy for Grevy’s Zebra (KWS 2012). It has 5 strategic objectives: 1) Coordination and implementation of the conservation and management strategy; 2) Enhancement of stakeholder partnership in Grevy’s Zebra conservation; 3) Enhancement of Grevy’s Zebra conservation and habitat management; 4) Establishment of a program for monitoring and managing Grevy’s Zebra population health; and 5) Enhancement of transboundary Grevy’s Zebra conservation.<br/><br/>In September 2016&#160;               a workshop involving Grevy’s zebra biologists, conservationists and the governors of the five counties where Grevy’s zebras live will be convened by Kitili Mbathi, the Director General of the Kenya Wildlife Service, at the Mpala Reseach Center. The workshop will explore options that will move the populations from ‘ sustainable’ to increasing’ and identify actions that the governors can commit to that will help make this happen. Future actions to increase numbers might include: restoration of grasslands, improved water access, addressing high lion predation rates in Meru County, and developing local capacity and supporting citizen science monitoring.&#160;<br/><br/>Ethiopia has held two workshops on the status and conservation of the Grevy’s Zebra. Research and community-based conservation is on-going in the Alledeghi Wildlife Reserve. The Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority in collaboration with the IUCN/SSC Equid Specialist Group will be developing a national species action plan in the near future.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Releases of captive-bred birds may buffer the overall population against these threats; however, further research is required into the demographic consequences of such releases, and surveys are needed to assess the population trend. If it can be demonstrated that these releases have bolstered the breeding population, without detrimental genetic effects, and slowed or halted declines, then the species may warrant downlisting in future.<br/><p></p>","It inhabits sandy and stony semi-desert and is specialised to arid conditions where trees are absent and both shrub cover and herb layer are sparse (Collar 1979, Goriup 1997, Snow and Perrins 1998, Martí and del Moral 2003), and appears to prefer remote areas away from human settlement (Chammem <em>et al. </em>2012). It feeds on invertebrates, small vertebrates and green shoots, and typically lays 2-4 eggs in a scrape on the ground. Eggs and young are susceptible to ground predators. North African populations may be sedentary or partially migratory, moving relatively short distances to find recent plant growth (Snow and Perrins 1998).<br/><br/>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1996).  <br/><p></p>","The principal threat is from hunting, which has worsened with the increased use of firearms, off-road vehicles and other technology (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005, Michler 2009). This threat is compounded by pressures on the species's habitats, from agricultural expansion, over-grazing of livestock, road construction, other infrastructure development and tourism developments (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005). Eggs are susceptible to trampling by livestock and collection by humans. Disturbance can be caused by oil exploration activities, along with disturbance associated with other threats. Locust control programmes can lead to direct and indirect poisoning of birds and a reduction in food supply. Floods and droughts cause additional pressures (Azafzaf <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/><br/>Subspecies <em>fuertaventurae</em> is considered threatened by collisions with powerlines (Lowen 2007, C.

On the basis of these estimates, the population of <em>C. undulata</em> (as split from <em>C. macqueenii</em>) is placed in the band for 20,000-49,999 individuals, assumed to equate to c.13,000-33,000 mature individuals.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;occurs across a wide range in North Africa.

More recent estimates place the population at 108-252 birds on Fuerteventura, 272-801 on Lanzarote and 3-10 on La Graciosa (Carrascal <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, whilst another census estimated the population at around 1,000 birds on the all the islands, with 384-459 on Fuerteventura, 383-806 on Lanzarote and 11-17 on La Graciosa (Lorenzo <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span> 2007)<strong></strong>.

It is diurnal and largely terrestrial, but will also use the forest canopy. In gallery forest along the Comoé River in Burkina Faso, Galat and Galat-Luong (2006) observed this mangabey eating the fruits of the liana <em>Saba senegalensis</em>; at this site, a group of nine individuals was counted, while groups of up to 23 individuals were seen in the past in Comoé National Park, Côte d’Ivoire (Fischer <em>et al</em>. 2000). In the Tanoé swamp forest in Côte d’Ivoire, a mean group size of 5.13 (range: 1.53–8.73) was reported during a 3-month survey conducted in 2009 (Gonedelé Bi, unpublished data 2009).","The species is hunted for its meat, both for local consumption and for the commercial bushmeat trade. Unregulated hunting has probably been the major cause of its decline. Illegal timber exploitation and mining is on the increase, which is leading to further habitat loss and fragmentation as a result of logging, the clearing for agriculture and charcoal, the demand for firewood, and fire. <em>Cercocebus lunulatus</em> has also been killed because of its crop raiding. In Ghana, many forests have been converted to rubber plantations. In Côte d’Ivoire, in the last decade, several forest reserves and protected areas that the species formerly inhabited have been completely converted into plantations, resulting in&#160;the local extirpation of the species and other primates in these forests (Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015).

Despite a high prevalence in the wild population, the virus has no detectable impact on the survival or health of this host species (Silvestri <em>et al</em>. 2003).&#160;Sooty Mangabeys do not develop AIDS despite high levels of SIV infection because of several genetically-based mechanisms that enhance immune function (Palesch <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;<em>Cercocebus atys</em> can contract leprosy (Rojas-Espinosa and Løvik 2001), and Type 2 diabetes is more common in mangabeys than in other primate species (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The bushmeat trade, the practice of keeping monkeys as pets, and the growing number of people living near wild Sooty Mangabeys significantly increases the risk of transmission of multiple zoonotic diseases (Mossoun <em>et al</em>. 2015)</span></span></span></p>","<p>  </p><p>Current, comprehensive data on the abundance and distribution of Sooty Mangabeys throughout much of their six-country range are lacking; however, available evidence suggests the species has declined across most of its distribution. In Côte d’Ivoire, the species has been extirpated in most of its range, except for the Taï National Park and the sacred grove of Gbepleu near the town of Man in western Côte d’Ivoire (S. Gonedelé Bi pers. obs. 2015). In Taï National Park, a survey by Covey (2009) estimated population density to be 4.35 groups/km² and N’Goran <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated that approximately 63,000 individuals reside in the park. Recent surveys failed to detect the species in the Dodo Coastal Forest of southwestern Côte d’Ivoire (Soiret <em>et al</em>. 2019) and the Tonkpi region of west-central Côte d’Ivoire (Kramoko&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>During nationwide surveys of Liberia, Sooty Mangabeys were the second most common monkey detected on line transects (Junker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys of four counties (Gbarpolu, Bomi, Bong and Grand Cape Mount) comprising the Sime Darby Plantation (oil palm, rubber) reported Sooty mangabeys present, although specific locality information were not published (Béné <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Several surveys carried out over the last ten years in the Mount Nimba region confirm the presence of Sooty Mangabeys there (Béné <em>et al</em>. 2013b,c, Granier 2016). In southeastern Liberia, surveys in the Grebo-Sapo Corridor reported a Sooty Mangabey encounter rate (groups/km) of 0.08 (Furnell <em>et al</em>. 2015a). The species appears to still be common in Sapo National Park (Vogt, 2011, Oates 2011) though it is hunted regularly (Greengrass 2016). Encounter rates in the Putu Range (0.09) are significantly lower than those inside Sapo National Park (0.19) (Vogt, 2011). During a 4-month survey in 2015, Sooty Mangabeys were heard but not seen in the newly-created Grebo-Krahn National Park (Furnell <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015b).<br/><br/>In Guinea in 1992, the species was often encountered during a 10-day field visit to the Kounounkan region, near the small town of Moussayah, Forécariah Province (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 1994). However, it was rarely encountered during a rapid assessment of the primate fauna conducted in 2005 in Sangaredi sub-prefecture in northwestern Boké Préfecture (Eriksson and Kpoghomou 2006). During site visits in 2017 and 2018, Sooty Mangabeys were observed in several areas in the Fouta Djallon region (R.A. Mittermeier pers. comm. 2017, C. André pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Recent surveys confirm Sooty Mangabeys near the village of Beli in the Boe region of Guinea-Bissau (Binczik <em>et al</em>. 2017) and they are present in Cantanhez Forest National Park (Garriga <em>et al</em>. 2018); however, their presence elsewhere in Guinea-Bissau is no longer certain (Gippoliti and Dell’Omo 2003, Minhos <em>et al</em>. (2013).<br/><br/>In Sierra Leone, the population of <em>C. atys</em> in Gola Forest National Park may have actually increased in the last 20 years. In 1985, before Sierra Leone’s 1991-2001 civil war, Davies (1987) had 0.14 encounters per km with this species (sightings and calls combined), while in 2006–2007 Klop <em>et al</em>. (2008) had an encounter rate based on sightings and vocal detections of 0.45 per km. It is not possible, however, to translate such encounter rates accurately into population density estimates, especially in the case of a species like <em>C. atys</em> whose calls carry for a considerable distance in the forest, and whose calling patterns can be affected by many factors. A nationwide survey of chimpanzees in Sierra Leone revealed Sooty Mangabeys mostly in the northern part of the country where human population numbers are lower (Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys carried out in the Moyamba and Port Loko districts of Sierra Leone during 2013–2014 identified Sooty Mangabeys as crop-raiders (Garriga <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). </p>  <p></p>",Decreasing,"This species ranges from Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to the Nzo-Sassandra system in Cote d'Ivoire.&#160;It occurs between sea level and at least 1,000 m asl; possibly higher in the Loma Mountains in Sierra Leone.",The species is hunted for bushmeat across its range.

They are omnivorous with a diet consisting of terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, invertebrates, mushrooms, fruits, flowers and small vertebrates. In areas close to cultivated land, such as the periphery of Bwindi Impenetrable and Nyungwe national parks, these monkeys enter fields and gardens to forage on crops.

Based on deforestation rates in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Ivory Coast, this species has lost at least 30% of its primary habitat over the past three generations (~1990-2018). Due to the combined negative impacts of hunting, which has resulted in the extirpation of a number of subpopulations and reduced others to levels that may not be viable over the long-term, <em>C. diana</em> numbers are suspected to have undergone a decline of 50% or more over this time period.","This largely arboreal species lives in the canopy of primary and old secondary lowland moist forest, and riverine and gallery forests. It is rare in degraded forest, but it appears that it can survive in lightly-logged forest where the canopy is relatively intact. This species occurs from just above sea level in Sierra Leone to at least 1,300 m asl in the Loma Mountains, Sierra Leone. Diana Monkeys feed mainly on fruits, arthropods and flowers; leaves become seasonally important when other items are less available (Buzzard 2006, Whitesides 1989). They spend much of their time in association with other primate species, which may be an anti-predator strategy (Whitesides 1991, Noë and Bshary 1997). Humans are the main predators on Diana Monkeys (Koné and Refisch 2007, McGraw 2007). Other important predators include Chimpanzees (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>), Leopards (<em>Panthera pardus</em>), and African Crowned Eagles (<em>Stephanoatus coronatus</em>) (Boesch and Boesch 1989, Shultz and Noë 2007, Oates 2011).","<em></em><em>Cercopithecus diana</em> is threatened by hunting, and habitat degradation and loss.<br/><br/>The relatively large body size of this species and the value of its meat and skin make it a preferred game species across its range in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Subsistence hunting is widespread and laws against commercial hunting  and other illegal activities (mining, habitat encroachment) inside  protected areas are poorly enforced throughout the <em>C. diana</em> range. The increasing scale of commercial hunting poses the greatest  threat (Béné<em> et al</em>., 2013c; Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). Although Diana Monkeys adopt certain behaviours to minimize mortality due to hunting (Bshary 2001, Koné and Refisch 2007), they are now rarely  found in areas with high hunting pressure, compared to areas where  hunting pressure is relatively low (N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Côte d’Ivoire, the species has been extirpated from almost all the  protected areas within its Extent of Occurrence (&gt;80%).<br/><br/>In addition to hunting pressure, large-scale deforestation in the  region, through mining, logging, conversion to agricultural land and  charcoal production, continues to reduce the habitat available to this  species (McGraw 1998, Tweh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015, WCF 2015).&#160; Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea each lost between 14 and 21% of their  total forest cover between 2001 and 2017, and dominant drivers of loss  continue (<a href=""https://www.globalforestwatch.org/"">www.globalforestwatch.org</a>).<br/><br/>Combining the significant loss of suitable habitat with intense poaching  pressure, it is suspected that the total  population of <em>C. diana</em> has declined by more than 50% during the last three generations<em>.&#160;</em>","<em>Cercopithecus diana</em> is now a rare and declining species throughout most of its range. Populations are affected by habitat loss through agricultural expansion (cocoa, oil palm, rubber, rice), intensive commercial logging, and by hunting for bushmeat (Lindsell <em>et al</em>. 2011; Gonedele Bi <em>et al</em>. 2012; Béné <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b,c; Covey and McGraw 2014; Greengrass 2016). In Côte d’Ivoire, the species has been extirpated from almost all (&gt;80%) the protected areas within its extent of occurrence (EOO). In the Taï NP where a viable population occurs, an estimated 97,000 individuals were reported in 2006-2008 based on survey data (N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012); a number that has almost certainly declined since that time. Within Taï NP, Diana Monkey abundance is strongly influenced by hunting pressure and this monkey is nearly 100 times more common near research stations and tourist sites than areas where hunting is unchecked (N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012). Outside Taï NP, a 2007-2010 biomonitoring survey reported the species in two reserves (Cavally, Goin-Debe) at a very low encounter rate (0.08–0.2 grp/km) with a decrease in the encounter rate ranging from 0.2 to 0.16 grp/km in Cavally FR and 0.08 to 0 grp/km in Goin Debe FR (WCF 2010). The ongoing hunting pressure, habitat encroachment and human settlement with these forest reserves pose severe threat to the survival of remaining populations. Currently, viable populations are found in Tiwaï Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Gola Forest National Park and Loma Mountains National Park in Sierra Leone; Sapo National Park in Liberia. Surveys within the Grebo-Sapo Corridor of southeastern Liberia reported a Diana Monkey encounter rate (N/km) of 0.31 (Furnell <em>et al.</em> 2015).

In Korup National Park, <em>P. preussi</em> made up a relatively large proportion of the total primate offtake (22% of carcasses) in a recent study (Linder and Oates 2011).

Between 2013 and 2014, nearly 300 <em>P. preussi</em> were killed by 30 surveyed hunters living within 3 km of Korup (Astaras and Linder 2016). Offtake surveys of hunters in a village in northeast Korup NP indicated that Preuss’s red colobus represented 2.4% of the 824 animals killed by hunters in June 2016 (Hofner 2016). Fa <em>et al</em>. (2006) counted 494 Preuss’s Red Colobus carcasses for sale in rural Cameroonian bushmeat markets and 284 Preuss’s Red Colobus in rural Nigerian bushmeat markets between August 2002 and January 2003. Most of these red colobus carcasses were recorded in markets close to Korup NP.</p>  <p>In addition to the threat from hunting, red colobus habitats have suffered and continue to suffer from forest loss and declining habitat quality, driven primarily by logging and small- and large-scale agriculture (Waltert <em>et al</em>. 2002, Forboseh <em>et al</em>. 2007, Linder 2013, Schoneveld 2014, B. Morgan pers. obs. 2016), resulting in a 3.8% decrease in tree cover since 2000 (Global Forest Watch 2019). Forests directly to the north and east of Korup NP have been and continue to be selectively logged, as have forests in the Makombe-Ndokbou area. One of the most exploited timber species in southwestern Cameroon is <em>Lophira alata</em> (Namuene 2014), a tree species that red colobus monkeys rely on for food. Large-scale industrial oil-palm plantations located adjacent to Korup NP and Ebo Forest threaten the integrity of forests in both areas.</p>  <p>Underlying these threats is an increasing human population, leading to increasing demands for bushmeat and other natural resources. The human population growth rate in Cameroon and Nigeria is high and has been increasing from ~2.0% annual growth rate in the early 1960s to 2.6% in 2017–2018 (World Bank 2019).&#160;</p>  <p>The so-called “Anglophone Crisis” in the South West and North West Regions of Cameroon further exacerbates the threats listed above. Since 2017, conservation activities in Korup NP (SW Region) have been suspended due to civil unrest, which has forced a substantial proportion of the human population to flee into the forest. This has likely led to increased pressure on forest resources in and around Korup NP, including increased hunting of red colobus monkeys.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Based on extrapolation of a known number of groups in a circumscribed area in southern Korup National Park and an average group size of 24–33 individuals, there are estimated to be between ~3,300 and 4,600 red colobus monkeys in Korup NP, the remaining stronghold for this species (J.

Extrapolating 0.25-0.4% annual loss to the decade 1990–2000 gives an additional 2.5-4%&#160; lost. Therefore, we estimate an overall range loss of 12–14% between 1990 and 2020.<br/><br/>Added to forest loss is increasing hunting for bushmeat. Monkey meat is eaten in rural locations and traded commercially for consumption in towns and cities, and the bushmeat trade is a serious threat to red colobus monkeys across Central Africa (Struhsaker 2010). Red colobus are targeted for because of their large size, which affords a good return to a hunter for the cost of a shotgun cartridge. Red colobus live in relatively large groups (Struhsaker and Grubb 2013), and their behaviour when faced with a hunter tends to be to observe rather than flee – which affords very easy, multiple targets for the hunter. Hunting pressure was high throughout the areas surveyed in the last few years: Maiko National Park (Amsini <em>et al</em>. 2006a,b), Usala (S. Nixon pers. comm. 2019) and Okapi Wildlife Reserve (Vosper <em>et al</em>. 2012, Madidi <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In 2019, there were roughly three times more people in DRC than in 1990 (mean human population growth 1990–2018 was ~3% annually). In addition, once intact blocks of forest are increasingly fragmented and made far more accessible to hunters: in DRC, 4.2% of forests classified as intact were lost between 2000–2013 (Potapov <em>et al</em>. 2017). Finally, the ability of the ever-increasing proportion of urban dwellers to pay much higher prices for bushmeat has created a highly lucrative market for commercial hunters, driving ever more rapid extraction of bushmeat from the regions’ forests. At present, 44% of the human population in DRC lives in towns and cities (World Bank 2019), compared with 27% in 1980, and this upward trend has been the case since 1960 (when it was 22%).<br/><br/>Because red colobus monkeys are large-bodied and bring a higher profit per cartridge than smaller species, it is preferentially selected by hunters and tends to be eliminated or at least greatly reduced in abundance before other, smaller monkeys. Red colobus now appear to be very rare, even in protected areas.<br/><br/>Thus, there is a combination of 12–14% of total habitat loss, plus 4.2% loss of intact forest, plus the increased demand for bushmeat, plus increased access too remote areas and an increased incentive for hunters to supply bushmeat to towns and cities. <em>Piliocolobus semlikiensis </em>is therefore suspected to have undergone a population decline exceeding 30% during the past three generations (1990–2019). The taxon is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2cd, as the decline has been ongoing for some time and will continue into the future; causes have not ceased (indeed, the intensity of the causes is increasing), nor will they in the foreseeable future.","Little is known of this species but all observations have been in forest habitats – terra firma, swamp forests and along rivers. The animals live in groups. It is assumed, that like other red colobus, they are primarily folivores.","The Semliki Red Colobus is directly threatened by habitat loss and hunting, and indirectly by the creation of easy access routes into huge areas of previously remote forests and increasing human populations.<br/><br/>The species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and “farm bush,” which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. (2016) and Harris <em>et al</em>. (2017). In DRC, over 90% of forest loss is due to shifting agriculture (Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. 2018). Since 2001, there has been a trend towards gradually increasing annual forest loss, especially since 2013–2014 (GFW 2019).<br/><br/>Hunting for bushmeat is increasing throughout the range. The meat is eaten by rural populations, traded to miners (Spira <em>et al</em>. 2019), or sold in urban markets. Road access into once-remote forests – even around protected areas – has hugely increased during the last 20–30 years (Kleinschroth <em>et al</em>. 2019), facilitating increased hunting and transport of bushmeat for commercial trade in both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2016; Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Human populations in the range of the taxon are growing at roughly 2.7% annually, and this rate will not slow down in the near future (United Nations 2019, World Bank 2019).","<p>The Semliki Red Colobus is targeted by hunters due to its large size. In recent years, they have rarely been seen, despite intensive survey efforts. They were recorded eight times in Maiko National Park in 2005 (both in the north and the south of the park: 380 and 300 km of effort, respectively; Amsini <em>et al</em>. 2006a,b). In 2007, red colobus vocalisations were heard on three separate transects close to the Ituri River (which forms the limit between <em>P. semlikiensis </em>and <em>P. oustaleti</em>), but which side of the river the vocalisations emanated from was unclear (WCS unpubl. data 2005–2007). Also in 2007, they were seen only once in the Usala area (which lies between Maiko National Park and Tayna Natural Reserve), although teams walked over 200 km of recces (Nixon <em>et al</em>. 2007). In the past, two groups were observed in Virunga National Park (Struhsaker 2010), but they were not recorded during surveys of the Semliki forest, Virunga National Park in 2008 (S. Nixon pers. comm. 2019) – the site of the taxon’s type locality. Finally, they were not found in Mt. Hoyo Reserve by Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2015), but were apparently recorded in that area in 2018 (D. Kujirakwinja pers. comm. 2019).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"The geographic range (area of occurrence) of <em>Piliocolobus semlikiensis </em>covers approximately 54,400 km². This is a forest-dwelling, Central African taxon and the vast majority of its range is in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) although, given the known distribution, it is possible that they could (rarely) occur in the contiguous forests of Semuliki and Rwenzori national parks, western Uganda. However, they were not recorded in Semuliki during a recent survey (Nixon et al. 2019) and there are no records in Rwenzori to date.<br/><br/>The southern limit of <em>P. semlikiensis </em>is roughly 1° S, comprising the Lowa River (to the southwest) and further east, its tributary, the Oso River. The northern limit is roughly 1.2° N, comprising the Nduye River (at the northeastern edge of the range of this taxon), which then runs west and joins the Ituri River that in turn becomes the Aruwimi River, which completes the northern limit. The eastern limit is the Albertine Rift, especially the northern sector of Virunga National Park, with a possible extension into Uganda, as noted above. The western limit is unclear but can be described as a very rough north-south line veering west towards the south at about 27.9° E. The reason for this vague boundary is that this taxon, as defined here, incorporates what has been described as a “hybrid swarm”, flanked to the west by <em>P. langi </em>and to the south by <em>P. lulindicus </em>and <em>P. foai</em>, with possible contribution from <em>P. oustaleti </em>in the north.",<p>The species is illegally hunted for local consumption and sale to bushmeat markets. The level of offtake is probably declining as remaining populations are reduced and those remaining are mostly remote and depleted (and hence more costly to hunt).<br/></p>,Terrestrial,"This taxon is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

92659769,18252,Piliocolobus foai,Endangered,A2cd,2020,2020-01-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Endangered, based on a precipitous reduction in extent of occurrence (EOO) in the past 30 years that is expected to continue into the future. <em>Piliocolobus foai </em>is threatened by uncontrolled hunting and habitat loss in an area that has seen high levels of civil unrest in the past 30 years. The geographic range described by Colyn (1991) was approximately ~23,000 km². Since then, surveys have shown that this species remains in only two small and isolated populations and currently has an EOO of ~6,700 km², representing a 70% decline since the range was defined in the 1990s. Furthermore, only a single sighting was recorded between 2003 and 2019 in for one of the populations (D. Kujirakwinja pers. comm. 2019). Given past trends of uncontrolled hunting that have not stopped, it is extremely likely that <em>P. foai </em>will be extirpated from Itombwe Nature Reserve in the near future, if it even still exists there.<br/><br/>The two known locations for <em>P. foai </em>are 1) Kabobo and Ngandja Reserves and adjacent Luama Hunting Reserve (together comprising the Kabobo Massif protected area complex) where it occupies an area of forest of about 1,200 km²; and 2) Itombwe Nature Reserve, where numbers have declined dramatically during the past 30 years due to habitat loss and hunting.<br/><br/><em>Piliocolobus foai</em> has not been recorded in Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the past three decades, and is thought to be no longer present in this area.<br/><br/>The Kabobo Massif, the location of the only confirmed population, has had low levels of human impact; it has been protected historically because civil conflicts meant that human settlement in the region has been low (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). Establishment of the Kabobo Massif protected area complex (Rainforest Trust 2016) has contributed significantly to the conservation of Foa's Red Colobus. Nevertheless, human populations are currently increasing in the area. Hunting and habitat degradation associated with artisanal mining are occurring, particularly in Luama Hunting Reserve (A. Plumptre and D. Kujirakwinja pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>In addition to habitat loss, a major threat is hunting: <em>P. foai </em>is targeted for bushmeat across its range. Because red colobus monkeys are large-bodied and bring a higher profit per cartridge than smaller species, they are preferentially selected by hunters and tend to be eliminated or at least greatly reduced in abundance before other, smaller monkeys. They live in relatively large groups (Struhsaker 2010, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013), and they have a tendency to observe humans rather than flee – which affords hunter with very easy, multiple targets. Hunting pressure was high in all areas surveyed in the recent past, and is associated with the expansion of artisanal mining and insecurity during periods of civil unrest.<br/><br/>Monkeys are eaten in villages and traded commercially for consumption in towns and cities; the bushmeat trade is a serious threat to red colobus monkeys across Africa (Struhsaker 2010). In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), there were approximately three times more people in 2019 than in 1990 (3% mean annual human population growth in DRC 1990–2018). The ability to pay much higher prices for bushmeat by the increasing proportion of urban dwellers in DRC has created a highly lucrative market for commercial hunters, which is the increasing rate of bushmeat extraction. At present, 44% of the human population in DRC lives in towns and cities (World Bank 2019), compared with 27% in 1980, and this upward trend has been the case since 1960 (when it was 22%). Given the human population growth, increasing human access to previously intact forest, uncontrolled hunting and the vulnerability of red colobus to hunting, this species is expected to continue declining.<br/><br/><em>Piliocolobus foai</em> is listed as Endangered under criterion A2cd due to a 70% decline in its extent of occurrence (EOO) in the recent past and hunting for bushmeat. The causes are not reversible, have not ceased, nor will they in the foreseeable future.","<p>                   </p><p><em>Piliocolobus foai</em> occurs in primary montane and submontane forest from 800 to 2,270 m asl. In Itombwe, it is restricted to evergreen closed forests; in Kabobo, it also occurs in adjoining gallery forests on the escarpment above Lake Tanganyika. It is not known to range far into gallery forests or the forest islands west of the escarpment (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/></p><p></p>","<em>Piliocolobus foai</em> populations have been reduced or extirpated from over 50% of the species’ range by hunting and by range loss due to habitat conversion and degradation during the past 30 years. Hunting certainly contributed to the loss of the taxon from KBNP, and remains a threat in Itombwe Nature Reserve, where the species is now apparently almost extirpated.<br/><br/>For the past two decades, eastern DRC has been the theatre of entrenched conflict promulgated by a multiplicity of rural militias, a number of whom are based in the region’s protected areas, including Itombwe Nature Reserve and the Kabobo Massif. This has not had an entirely negative impact. Rebels based in the Kabobo Massif prevented widespread occupation by farmers, herders and miners for two decades from the late 1970s through the fall of the Mobutu regime in 1997 (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). As security returned, incursions in the landscape increased (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Elsewhere, however, occupation by militias and brigands has made management and protection of these protected areas difficult or impossible, favouring resource extraction and use by hunters, miners and pastoralists.<br/><br/>Outside protected areas, habitat loss and degradation are due primarily to shifting cultivation and smallholder farming, small-scale logging, charcoal production and conversion of forest to pastures. Deforestation in DRC increased by a factor of 2.5 between 2011 and 2017 (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss and associated degradation has been particular severe in the range of <em>P. foai</em>, the region of DRC where human population densities are highest.<br/><br/>Small-scale (artisanal) and industrial-scale mining threaten the remaining forests in eastern DRC. Notably in the Itombwe Massif, where artisanal miners have reached even the most remote areas of this site. Since 2011, a major Canadian-registered, international gold mining company, Banro, has been operating concessions totalling 2,616 km² in and around Itombwe, and the company has outstanding requests for prospection within the boundaries of the Nature Reserve (Thierry Regards 2019).<br/><br/>In the Kabobo Massif, fires set for hunting and to clear land for agriculture are among the main threats to the evergreen montane forests favoured by <em>P. foai </em>(Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016).","<p>                   </p>No population estimates are available for <em>P. foai</em>, which has a restricted range that is threatened by habitat degradation and hunting.<br/><br/>The species was described as uncommon in the Itombwe Massif in the early 1990s (Doumenge and Schliter 1997). It was recorded in 1996 in lower montane formations between 1,220 and 1,850 m asl by Omari <em>et al</em>. (1999), who noted low overall encounter rates of primates in the massif (0.1 groups/km) and widespread evidence of hunting. Subsequent surveys and patrols between 2003 and 2019 yielded only a single observation of <em>P. foai </em>from Itombwe (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2010, D. Kujirakwinja pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>Rahm and Christiaensen (1963) and Rahm (1964) reported the species in what are now the highland sector and corridor of Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP). Specimens attributed to <em>P. foai </em>were collected in this same region (Colyn 1991); however, there are no recent records of this species from surveys in this area (Inogwabini <em>et al</em>. 2001, Spira <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The last remaining stronghold for <em>P. foai </em>is the Kabobo Massif Reserve Complex, where it was recorded several times during surveys conducted in 2008 (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is threatened here, nonetheless, and rare in the Luama Hunting Reserve (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"Endemic to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), <em>Piliocolobus foai </em>(<em>sensu stricto</em>, Colyn 1991) is restricted to montane forest habitats and does not occur west of the Albertine Rift highlands in areas of lower elevation. Historically, the species’ ranged through montane and submontane forests (900–2,800 m asl) in the Albertine Rift, from Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP), south through the Itombwe Massif to Mt Kabobo (Rahm 1964). Colyn (1991) suggested, although without confirmed specimens, that <em>P. foai</em> ranged south to the Lukuga River (800 m asl); however, there is now very little if any remaining suitable habitat in this region, which borders on the city of Kalemie. Specimens from Irangi, west of the KBNP highlands, have been attributed to P. ellioti (Rahm and Christiaensen 1963). West of the Albertine Rift highland forests, red colobus populations show intergradation between <em>P. foai </em>and <em>P. lulindicus </em>and possibly other forms, and are considered to be hybrids (Colyn 1991).<br/><br/><em>Piliocolobus foai</em> is currently known from only two widely-separated locations. In the Kabobo region, it occurs in an area of ~1,200 km² of evergreen and gallery forests on the Lake Tanganyika escarpment (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2008, unpubl. data 2019). In the Itombwe Massif, it was recorded in 1996 (Omari <em>et al</em>. 1999), but patrol teams have reported only one sighting since 2003 (D.

The species appears to prefer high canopy and litter cover (E. Mulotwa <em>in litt.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. Its sparse and irregular distribution may correspond in part to the limited availability of this habitat type (Hart and Upoki 1997). The species is not restricted solely to primary forest, old secondary forest adjacent to primary forest is heavily used at least for foraging (Mulotwa <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010).

There is a high probability that such threats and subsequent declines will continue into the future, and as such this qualifies as Vulnerable. In addition, the species' life history strategy (long-lived, slow-breeding) puts the species under greater possible threat of declines. More accurate trend data may become available in the near future and so further reassessment may be required in the future. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>It lives in groups of 2-9 members, rarely 12, and is a co-operative breeder, with the dominant pair assisted by adult, mostly male, and immature helpers to defend a territory and provision a nest (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). The breeding pairs have previously been assumed to be monogamous, but molecular techniques have revealed that extra-pair copulations do occur (Theron <em>et al. </em>2013). Groups occupy year-round home ranges of 50-100km<sup>2</sup>, determined primarily by the availability of suitable nest sites and food availability during the dry season (Kemp 2005; Wilson and Hockey 2013). Laying occurs in large cavities in trees, cliffs or earth banks (L. Kemp <em>in litt.</em> 2016), mainly from September to December, with a clutch of 1-3 (usually 2) eggs, although only one survives to fledging (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001; Chiweshe, Kemp and Webster <em>in litt.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. One study in South Africa showed that a family group produced on average only one fledgling every nine years, although birds in the Okavango Delta appear to breed more frequently (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001; S. Tyler <em>in litt. </em>2010). Juvenile mortality is reported to be high in a large protected area, and this is likely to be even higher in unprotected areas where anthropogenic threats are present (Kemp 1990). <strong>Habitat </strong>It inhabits woodland and savanna, also frequenting grassland adjoining patches of forest up to 3,000 m in parts of its range in eastern Africa. The species fares well in protected areas where human threats are excluded and rural areas where cattle assist in maintaining their preferred short grass habitat. If cultural protection is still practiced, the species is productive, but in areas where there is no cultural protection or it has diminished due to the appropriation of Western culture, the species is highly fragmented (L. Kemp <em>in litt.</em> 2016). <strong>Diet </strong>Its diet is mainly made up of arthropods, and, especially during the wet season, snails, frogs and toads, and sometimes larger prey such as snakes, lizards, rats, hares, squirrels or tortoises. It will on occasion feed on carrion, taking scraps and associated insects. Fruits and seeds are also recorded in its diet, although infrequently (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001)<strong></strong><strong></strong>.  <p></p>","A major threat to the species is loss of nesting habitat due to clearance for small-scale use, agriculture, and because of fires and violent storms (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). It can become heat stressed and exhibits heat avoidance behaviour in temperatures above 26<sup>o</sup>C, and increasing temperatures with climate change could pose a threat (L.

Thomsett <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Although cultural beliefs offered some protection in the past in Kenya, recent generations tend not to hold such values, and the species may be directly persecuted as a result (S. Thomsett <em>in litt. </em>2010). Persecution may occur directly because the species breaks window panes by attacking its own reflection in glass (incurring costs and creating human-wildlife conflict), indirectly by consuming poisoned bait meant for other species, and it is sometimes killed for traditional rituals against drought (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 2001; K. Morrison and Y. Friedmann <em>in litt.</em> 2005; L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016)<strong></strong>. In South Africa and Zimbabwe, where these beliefs are upheld, there is actually a significant protection given to this species because it has high cultural importance, and these beliefs outweigh any offtake for traditional use (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016). Collisions with powerlines may also be a threat in South Africa (K. Morrison and Y. Friedmann <em>in litt.</em> 2005)<strong></strong>, although only one such mortality has been recorded and more mortalities may occur from electrocution by standing on step-down transformer boxes - especially if an insect nest has been built on or near the box which could act as an attractant for the species (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016; R. Little <em>in litt. </em>2016). Such threats are exacerbated by the slow reproductive rate and maturation, longevity and social structure of the species (S. Thomsett <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. This species can be susceptible to Newcastle's Disease Virus (L. Kemp <em>in litt. </em>2016), and may be under threat from stepping on land mines in areas of conflict (L. Kemp <em>in litt.</em> 2016).<br/><p></p>","The global population size has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be widespread and common but sparse.

Declines have continued and a reassessment is underway, and assessments in Namibia as well as South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, have listed the species as Endangered (Simmons 2015; Taylor and Kemp 2015). Although data for other range countries are lacking, several threats are also thought to be causing population declines in Kenya (S. Thomsett <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>, Botswana (S.

T. C. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. It breeds during the wet season months of May-December in West Africa, and July-January in East Africa (subject to local seasonal variation)<strong></strong>, nesting in single pairs in territories 0.5-1 km<sup>2</sup> (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. During the dry (non-breeding) season it is more congregatory, forming large flocks of up to several hundred individuals (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. In South Sudan it begins to flock along the Nile in November, reaching a peak in late February and March (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. In Chad it gathers in concentrations after breeding, and then moves south (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. In Nigeria it was subject to local movements with seasonal changes in water levels (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986), though it no longer occurs in the country. It forages singly, in pairs or in small groups (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>.<strong> Habitat </strong><em>Breeding</em><strong> </strong>This species is found in wet and dry open habitats, but prefers freshwater marshes, wet grasslands, and the peripheries of water-bodies<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong>. In South Sudan it is especially found in areas with water up to 1 m in depth, and knee-high to hip-high vegetation dominated by <em>Cyperus</em>, <em>Eleocharis</em>, <em>Scirpus</em>, <em>Setaria</em>, <em>Cynodon </em>and various leguminous and rosaceous plants (Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>. It always remains near wetlands, but is rarely associated with deep, open water (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. It often prefers to forage on dry ground with short grass (Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong> and, particularly in West Africa, it will sometimes forage and nest in upland areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>, rice fields, wet crop fields and even abandoned fields (Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong>. It prefers to roost in large trees, but will use small trees or shallow water when necessary (Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding</em> During the non-breeding season it congregates in larger permanent wetlands<strong></strong>, and often forages near herds of domestic livestock (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong> or even in rubbish dumps (Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>. <strong>Diet </strong>This species is a generalist omnivore (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Its primary food source is small grain crops (45%)<strong></strong>, with small plants, small invertebrates and small vertebrates also featuring in the diet<strong> </strong>(Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003). It will take insects (grasshoppers, flies), molluscs, millipedes, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, reptiles, seed heads, grass tips and agricultural grain (corn, rice, millet) (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<strong>Breeding site </strong>Nests are built on the ground<strong></strong> in densely vegetated wetlands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Meine and Archibald 1996)<strong></strong>. The nest consists of a round, loosely constructed platform of reeds and grasses placed in short grass marsh in several centimetres of water, or occasionally on dry land (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. Its base is often over a metre in diameter (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986)<strong></strong>. Clutch-size is c.2.5 eggs per nest. Incubation lasts 22-25 days, and chicks are able to fly when 35-40 days old (Dodman <em>et al. </em>2014).<p></p>","Habitat loss and degradation are significant threats, occurring through drought, wetland drainage and conversion for agriculture, overgrazing, fire, agricultural and industrial pollution, industrial construction and dam construction (flooding wetlands upstream and dessicating those downstream) (Meine and Archibald 1996, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003, <strong></strong>Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2007, <strong></strong>T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> 2009)<strong></strong>. Droughts have both directly and indirectly impacted this species's habitat, since they force people to migrate to relatively moist, less populated regions, which are then subjected to the associated pressures mentioned above (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Considerable hunting pressures also exist (P. Hall <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2007, Kone 2007, Morrison 2009)<strong></strong>, including capture and sale of live birds, some destined for legal international markets (over 7,000 birds since 1985 when the species was listed on CITES Appendix II [UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database, January 2005]<strong></strong>). Parts of dead Black Crowned-cranes, notably the head and wings, are used in traditional healing (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. In addition, indiscriminate pesticide application may be leading to harmful bio-accumulation of toxins (E. T. C. Williams <em>in litt.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>, and direct poisoning to reduce crop depredation has been reported in East Africa (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Warfare and political instability affects nations across the range of the species, and may have particularly impacted upon those in South Sudan where the implementation of conservation measures has not been able to proceed (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2003), and remains problematic.

When breeding in solitary pairs or small groups however, nests are more likely to be placed on the tops of trees or on ledges of buildings at lower elevations (1,800 to 2,000 m) (Brown <I>et al.</I> 1982, del Hoyo <I>et al.</I> 1992).

However, this may have been an artifact of the study occurring within a particularly bad year for storms, and the fact that the remaining native forest on Tinian is restricted almost exclusively to cliff lines which may have been responsible for protection from storm damage, rather than the habitat type itself (L. Zarones&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016). A broader study over multiple seasons and using replicate plots per habitat type is recommended (L. Zarones&#160;<em>in litt. </em>2016). Although the species has been shown to breed year-round, there appears to be distinct seasonality in nesting activity and success, with less nesting occurring during periods of low rainfall (USFWS 1996).</span>","The Tinian Monarch is regarded as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need by the CNMI Division of Fish and Wildlife, due to threats from commercial, agricultural and residential development, &#160;invasive vines, military expansion, typhoons, and the potential for establishment of the brown tree-snake (Liske-Clark 2015).&#160;By 1945, native forest had been reduced to 5-7%, owing to development for sugarcane production and the construction of infrastructure to support military activities in Second World War (USFWS 1996, Lusk <em>et al.</em> 2000b)<strong></strong>.

The potential introduction of the exotic brown tree-snake <em>Boiga irregularis</em> from the nearby island of Guam is an increasing concern, especially as proposed development on the island (U.S. Dept. of Defence 2007, 2015)<strong></strong> necessitates the importation of large amounts of building materials (J.

96192471,18262,Piliocolobus lulindicus,Endangered,A2cd,2020,2020-01-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> is a forest-dependent species targeted for bushmeat because of its large size. Over the past 30 years, there has been an approximately 15% loss in forest cover across its range. In the forest that remains, the species has been highly reduced in abundance or extirpated from over 70% of forest blocks surveyed in the western half of the range, and is likely extirpated from parts of the eastern half of its range, including Kahuzi-Biega National Park, which was a stronghold for this taxon in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Total forest loss across the entire <em>P. lulindicus</em> range was about 8,920 km2 (9.3% of the area) over 17 years (2001–2018; GFW 2019), which is 1.7 generations for this monkey (generation time for this genus is estimated at 10 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). The rate of forest cover loss in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is increasing over time: since 2014, it has been ~1% per year. Prior to that, the annual rate of loss was 0.25–0.4% (GFW 2019). Eastern DRC has been badly hit, and unfortunately the range of this monkey features as a new “hotspot” of forest loss (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Projecting backwards three generations (to 1990) goes beyond the last 17 years for which forest loss data are available; however, we know that forest loss was already occurring before 2001. If forest loss in the 1990s was consistent with 0.25-0.4% per year, then we would expect approximately 15% of the overall range to have been lost between 1990 and 2020. In addition, the once intact blocks of forest in the region are increasingly fragmented; in DRC, 4.2% of forests classified as intact were lost between 2000–2013 (Potapov <em>et al</em>. 2017). Given the recent increase in rate of forest loss, even more of its range is expected to be lost and/or fragmented in the future.<br/><br/>Just as concerning as habitat loss, if not more so, are population declines due to hunting. Because red colobus taxa are large-bodied and bring a higher profit per cartridge than smaller species, they are preferentially selected by hunters and tend to be eliminated or at least greatly reduced in abundance before other, smaller monkeys. They live in relatively large groups (Struhsaker 2010, Struhsaker and Grubb 2013), and their behaviour faced with a hunter tends to be to observe rather than flee – which affords very easy, multiple targets for the hunter. Hunting pressure was common across all areas surveyed in the recent past, and is exacerbated with the expansion of artisanal mining and during periods of civil unrest.<br/><br/>Monkeys are eaten in villages and traded commercially for consumption in towns and cities, and the bushmeat trade is a serious threat to red colobus across Africa (Struhsaker 2010). In DRC, there were approximately three times more people in 2019 than in 1990 (mean human population growth 1990–2018 was approximately 3% annually). The ability to pay much higher prices for bushmeat by the ever-increasing proportion of urban dwellers has created a highly lucrative market for commercial hunters, which drives increasing extraction of bushmeat from the regions’ forests. At present, 44% of the human population is DRC lives in towns and cities (World Bank 2019) compared to 27% in 1980, and this upward trend has been the case since 1960 (when it was 22%).<br/><br/>Thus, there is a combination of 15% total habitat loss (1990–2020), plus 4.2% loss of intact forest, plus increasing demand for bushmeat (three times more people in DRC), increased access for hunters, and an increased incentive for hunters to supply bushmeat to towns and cities. <em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> is, therefore, suspected to have undergone a population decline exceeding 50% during the past three generations, and is listed as Endangered under criterion A2cd.<br/><br/>Given the increase in the human population, in access to previously intact forest, uncontrolled hunting and the species’ vulnerability to hunting, the decline will likely continue at a similar, if not faster, rate.","<p>Little is known of this species, but all observations have been in forest habitats – terra firma, lowland moist forests, and along rivers. The animals live in groups. It is assumed, that like other red colobus, they are primarily folivores.<br/></p>","<em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> is directly threatened by habitat loss and hunting, and indirectly by the creation of easy access routes into huge areas of previously remote forests and increasing human populations.<br/><br/>The species is subject to habitat modification, as intact forest is converted to farmland and “farm bush,” which can be seen clearly in Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. (2016) and Harris <em>et al</em>. (2017). In DRC, over 90% of forest loss is due to shifting agriculture (Tyukavina <em>et al</em>. 2018). The ongoing trend is gradually increasing annual forest loss since 2001, especially since 2013-2014 (GFW 2020).<br/><br/>Hunting for bushmeat is increasing throughout the range of this taxon. The meat is eaten by rural populations, traded to miners (Spira <em>et al</em>. 2017), or traded markets in urban locations. Road access into once-remote forests – even close to protected areas – has hugely increased during the two decades (Kleinschroth <em>et al</em>. 2019), facilitating increased hunting and transport of bushmeat for commercial trade in both local markets and distant urban centres (Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013, 2016; Ziegler <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Human populations in the range of this species are growing at roughly 2.7% annually, and this rate will not slow down in the near future (United Nations 2019, World Bank 2019).","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>The population has declined due to uncontrolled hunting, and habitat loss and degradation. Conflict was a major correlate of <em>P. lulindicus </em>decline in the lowland sector of Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP). Kahuzi-Biega National Park is the only protected area where the species has been reported (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2002). In 1994–1995, red colobus were reported as widespread, and common in three of five zones surveyed (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the subsequent eight years, the region was a theatre of intense conflict, during which the park was targeted by hunters and artisanal miners; some areas were burned (Hart <em>et al</em>. 1998). Surveys resumed in 2004 and were conducted periodically through 2017 (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2007, Spira <em>et al</em>. 2018). Red colobus have been not recorded during any post-conflict surveys, including the areas where they were classified as abundant in the 1990s.<br/><br/>Hunting was also a primary factor linked to declines in western populations of this taxon. A rapid assessment survey in 2018 (Hart unpubl. data 2018) found that red colobus were confirmed or highly likely to have been extirpated in 76% of 102 habitat blocks in a zone covering about 45% of the western part of the species’ range, from the Lualaba River to approximately 27° E. The majority of disappearances were reported to have occurred during the period 1998–2006, coinciding with civil unrest and political instability. Uncontrolled hunting was cited in most cases where causality was identified, although habitat loss through the expansion of shifting agriculture affected about 20% of blocks assessed. Habitat loss was very high around important mining centres, such as Kalima, Pangi, Punia and Lubutu, where human population growth was also high.<br/><br/>Populations in the east of the range face higher pressure from the expansion of artisanal mining than populations in the west. Large mining centres are associated with the largest declines of red colobus (Hart unpubl. data 2018). At present, the remaining populations of <em>P. lulindicus </em>occur in isolated subpopulations, separated by areas of degraded or converted habitat, or by areas of suitable forest where the species has been extirpated.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"Endemic to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), <em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> ranges from the Congo (Lualaba) River in the west, east to the lowland-montane transition (1,200–1,500 m asl) at approximately 28.5° E, where it intergrades with <em>P. foai </em>(Rahm 1965, Colyn 1991). The southern limit of the range is mapped as the Lukuga River at approximately 4.7° S (Colyn 1991), where the species apparently occurs in several large forest islands south of the contiguous forest zone. The northern limit is given as the Lowa River based on the location of an examined specimen (Colyn 1991).<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a></p>","<p>This species is illegally hunted for local consumption and sale to bushmeat markets.

A 2018 search of these markets found no red colobus for sale (Hart unpubl. data 2018).<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"This genus is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

It was reported formerly from Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP) but the species is not known to occur there at present. Red colobus were reported in the three of four survey zones of KBNP lowland sector in 1994–1995, and common to abundant in two of them (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2002). Red colobus were not recorded on surveys in these same zones 20 years later (Hart et al. 2007) or in 2015-2017 (Spira <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2017).

The plan identifies priority areas for conservation and recommends range-wide and taxon-based actions to prevent red colobus extinctions. Range-wide conservation priorities include actions that aim to improve government investment in wildlife conservation, expand and improve protected areas, determine taxon-specific distribution and abundance, engage with local human populations and integrate them into conservation activities, remove barriers that prevent local access to human healthcare and family planning, and raise awareness of the plight of red colobus.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Inference of a single generation time of up to 30 years in an unexploited population is based on data from the assessment for <em>T. manatus latirostris</em>. The level of threats, particularly hunting and incidental catches, appears to be continuing to increase throughout range with locally high rates and near extirpation in some regions. Lack of protein and continued poverty for human populations, and limited enforcement of national laws, are expected to drive increasing illegal hunting levels. Destruction of coastal areas due to development, mangrove harvesting, siltation and dams are resulting in reduced habitat. We infer a high probability that a 30% or greater reduction in population size will result within a 90 year three generation period (Vulnerable A3cd).<br/><br/>Using survey information from Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Senegal and Cameroon, and inferring what is known about Manatee habitat in other range states and Manatee density data for <em>T. manatus</em>, it is estimated that there are fewer than 10,000 Manatees in Africa.

They have been observed or recorded from coastal areas, estuarine lagoons, large rivers that range from brackish to fresh water, freshwater lakes and the extreme upper reaches of rivers above cataracts. In general, their habitat requirements seem to be similar to <em>T. manatus</em> and require sheltered water with access to food and freshwater (Reep and Bonde 2006, Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012). They may transit areas of unsheltered coast, but they are usually rare in these areas.<br/><br/>Optimal coastal habitats for Manatees, based on the movements of radio-tagged Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire and the number of reported sightings from other areas are: a). coastal lagoons with abundant growth of mangroves, aquatic plants or emergent herbaceous growth; b). estuarine areas of larger rivers with abundant mangroves (<em>Rhizophora racemosa, R. harrisonii, R. mangle</em>) in the lower reaches and lined with grasses, particularly <em>Vossia </em>and <em>Echinochloa </em>further upriver; and c). shallow (&lt;3 m depth) and protected coastal areas with fringing mangroves or marine macrophytes, particularly <em>Ruppia </em>sp., <em>Halodule wrightii</em> or <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>. In riverine habitats that have major fluctuations in flow rates and water levels, Manatees seem to prefer those areas that have access to deep pools or connecting lakes for refuge during the dry season and seasonally flood into swamps, savannas or forests with abundant grasses and sedges. In central African countries including Gabon and Republic of the Congo, Manatees use coastal lagoons during the dry season and then migrate up rivers to feed in flooded forests and lakes during the rainy season (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees that live extremely far inland in rivers in countries such as Senegal and Mali use specific feeding areas where year round aquatic and shoreline plants occur and also feed on freshwater mussels and fish, and then spread out onto flood plains during the rainy season to feed on emergent vegetation (Keith Diagne 2014).<br/><br/>African Manatees feed primarily on vegetation, and over 70 species of plants have been documented to date as Manatee food throughout their range (Villiers and Bessac 1948, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Akoi 2004, Ogogo <em>et al</em>. 2013, Keith Diagne 2014). Some of the species more commonly observed being eaten by Manatees include: <em>Vossia</em> sp., <em>Eichornia crassipes</em>, <em>Polygonum</em> sp., <em>Crinum natans</em>, <em>Nymphea</em> sp., <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, <em>Cymodocea nodosa</em>, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em>, <em>Azolla</em> sp., <em>Echinochloa</em> sp., <em>Lemna</em> sp., <em>Myriophyllum</em> sp., <em>Pistia stratioties</em>, <em>Rhizophora</em> sp, and <em>Halodule wrightii</em>. In countries including Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014), Cameroon (Takoukam and Koh Dimbot pers. comm.),&#160;and Sierra Leone (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988), Manatees are also known to eat small fish captured in fishermen’s nets. Manatees are also reported to eat freshwater and estuarine molluscs in many countries, including Senegal, The Gambia, Mali, Gabon, and Angola, and shell remains have been found in Manatee stomachs (Powell 1996, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Stable isotope analyses examined Manatee diet using samples from Gabon and Senegal and determined that molluscs and fish comprised 10% of &#160;Manatee average lifetime diet in Gabon, and 50% of diet in both freshwater and marine systems in Senegal (Keith Diagne 2014). Therefore, the African Manatee is not strictly herbivorous, but is omnivorous, a distinct difference from the other Manatee species.<br/><br/>Manatees can travel freely from salt to freshwater. They appear to prefer estuarine areas where there is little disturbance and the waters are shallow and calm. They can be found in marine habitats where there is relatively calm water and a source of freshwater. For example, in Senegal, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, Manatees are attracted to a large network of freshwater seeps or springs that are found in nearshore marine habitats (Powell 1990).<br/><br/><em>T. senegalensis</em> are mostly solitary, with mothers and calves forming the principal social unit. Manatees will often rest together in loose, small groups of two to ten individuals and mating herds have been observed in Gabon, Senegal, Nigeria and Sierra Leone (E. Eniang pers. comm., Keith Diagne unpublished data). In some African countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Manatees feed principally at night and travel in the late afternoon and at night (Powell 1996), but in other countries such as Gabon’s N’dogo and N’gowe Lagoons and in the Casamance region of Senegal they can be seen travelling and feeding during all hours of day and night (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne unpublished data). They usually rest during the day in water that is 1–2 m deep and sometimes in the middle of a watercourse or hidden in mangrove roots or under natant vegetation. They make little disturbance while swimming. The Manatees that are easily sighted during daylight hours generally occur in places where little hunting occurs.<br/></p><p><br/></p>","<em>T. senegalensis</em> population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.<br/><br/>Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.<br/><br/>In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.<br/><br/>Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.<br/><br/>Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.<br/><br/>In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.<br/><br/>Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/>National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms). However, with the up-listing of the species to CITES Appendix I in March 2013, international trade is no longer legal.","<p>There are no population estimates based on quantitative information. Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. (1982) and Nishiwaki (1984) made a number of intuitive estimates for 15 countries, based primarily on interviews rather than direct surveys. Roth and Waitkuwait (1986) and Akoi (2004) made estimates of 750-800 Manatees for Côte d'Ivoire. In 1999 a report by ABE estimated the Manatee population in Benin at 125 individuals. There are no population number estimates for other countries at this time. The first genetics analyses for the species indicated high haplotype diversity and strong population structure but included samples from few individuals (Parr 2000, Parr and Duffield 2002, Vianna <em>et al.</em> 2006). More recent mitochondrial DNA analyses using 63 new samples from eight countries identified sixteen new control region and nine new cytochrome-b haplotypes for the species (Keith Diagne 2014). These are the first African Manatee genetic results from Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Ivory Coast and Benin. New haplotypes were characterized by high haplotype diversity, but low nucleotide diversity, indicating expansion after a period of low effective population size (Keith Diagne 2014). Phylogenetic trees identified two clades aligned geographically, indicating regional population separation likely due to low recent dispersal (Keith Diagne 2014). Ongoing mitochondrial and nuclear genetics analyses will probably allow for population estimates for Gabon and Senegal in the near future (Keith Diagne unpublished data). The Lake Chad population has probably been extirpated. It was reported that Manatees were gone from Lake Chad by 1929 (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998), and although reports of them occurred in the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers leading into Lake Chad, Salkind (1998) reported that they were gone from these waterways as well. Today the drying and desertification of Lake Chad no longer provides much suitable habitat.<br/>Available population information by country follows:<br/><br/><strong>Mauritania</strong><br/>The species occurs in the Senegal River and its tributaries (Powell 1996); this river forms the border between Mauritania and Senegal. It is an infrequent inhabitant of the Diawling National Park, a wetland reserve of interconnecting streams, lakes and ponds adjacent to the Senegal River near the Diama dam (Perrin 2001). Manatees also probably inhabit the Gorgol Marigot, a large seasonally flooded tributary east of Kaedi.<br/><br/><strong>Senegal</strong><br/>In Senegal, the Manatee was reported as close to extinction by Navaza and Burnham (1998) but more recent work indicates that this is not the case (Diop 2006, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne and Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In the Senegal River Manatees are permanently isolated from the coast by the Diama Dam, located in the Senegal River east of St. Louis, and upstream by the Felou Dam in Kayes, Mali which prevents them from moving further eastward. Manatees are no longer reported west of the Diama dam in the Senegal River delta near St. Louis or coastally in this region (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data ). However, Manatees are sighted throughout the Senegal River east of the dam. Manatees are frequently seen in Lake Guiers year round, and in 2005 Tocc Tocc Community Reserve was created for their protection along the northwestern shore of Lake Guiers. In February 2014, Tocc Tocc Reserve was designated as Senegal’s fifth Ramsar site. During the rainy season when the Senegal River floods, Manatees are regularly seen near Kanel and Matam in eastern Senegal (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). As flood waters recede during the dry season, Manatees become stranded in seasonal lakes at Wendou Kanel and the local people, along with assistance from the Senegalese NGO Oceanium Dakar, have been rescuing and releasing them back into the main Senegal River since 1984. Beginning in 2008, Manatees became trapped behind a new agricultural dam at Navel, near Matam, on the Senegal River. Five Manatees died as a result of entrapment behind the dam, and dam grates were removed in 2010. Seven live Manatees were rescued in early 2009 and satellite tags were attached to three adult Manatees that were rescued and released back into the Senegal River (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). These Manatees used over 265 km of the Senegal River to the north and south of the release site and made directed trips to feeding areas (L. Keith Diagne <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). Manatees are also frequently sighted at freshwater springs that occur along coastal Senegal from the Delta Saloum region to the southern border of the country and beyond into Guinea-Bissau. In the Senegal portion of the Gambia River, Manatees are reported as far inland as Niokolo-Koba National Park during the rainy season (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, P. Brillant pers. comm.), and they are also reported in this river across the border in Guinea (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Casamance River Manatees are reported as far east as Kolda, also at Basse Casamance National Park, and near the mouth of the river they can be seen daily drinking from a freshwater spring at Point St. George (Ba <em>et al</em>. 2008, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). The only reports of recent Manatee hunting in Senegal are from the Delta Saloum region (IUCN and Parc National du Delta du Saloum 2005, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).</p><p><br/><strong>The Gambia</strong><br/>In The Gambia, numbers are thought to have declined, but as of 1993 the Manatee was still numerous in the Gambia River. They have been fully protected for many years but are still believed to be hunted extensively (Perrin 2001, Jallow 2008). Manatees are reported throughout the Gambia River and its tributaries, and in Niumi National Park, Bao Bolong National Park, Kiang West National Park, and the Tanbi Wetlands Complex. There are no estimates of population numbers and little current research or conservation activities. In 2014 Manatee hunting was reported in Jareng in the Niamina East, and reports of incidentally caught Manatees were reported from Jareng as well as Tendaba in the Lower River Region (D. Saine pers. comm.). Manatees are also affected by the destruction of their habitat due to deforestation of mangroves (Jallow 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea Bissau</strong><br/>Guinea-Bissau is considered likely have one of the largest Manatee populations in Africa, because of the relatively undisturbed state of its mangroves, wetlands and river systems (Schumann 1995, Powell 1996). Silva and Araújo (2001) found that Manatees occupied a wide variety of habitats and were most abundant around the Bijagos Archipelago. Based on interviews, a total of 256 sightings involving 439 individuals interviewed were reported. Powell (1996) reported seeing about 20 individual sterna from Manatees hunted in the Bijagos Archipelago by a single Senegalese fisherman who seasonally fished there. In 1997, the government signed an agreement with IUCN to develop a National Plan for Conservation of the West African Manatee in Guinea-Bissau, and some training and survey work started, but the work stopped when the war started in 1998 and has never resumed (Silva and Araújo 2001). The major source of mortality before the war was accidental capture in fishing nets; they were not extensively hunted. Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 Manatees killed between 1990-1998, approximately 23 per year. More recently, Manatees have been advertised by a private company for export on the internet, and two were exported to the Toba Aquarium in Japan in 1996 (Asano and Sakamoto 1997, Kataoka <em>et al.</em> 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Guinea</strong><br/>Little information is available on the Manatee in Guinea. The country has extensive suitable habitat (Powell 1996), but no systematic studies have been carried out (Barnett and Prangley 1997). Manatees occur in the Soumba, Konkouré and Fatala estuaries, Sangareyah Bay, Rio Komponi, Rio Nunez and the border area of the Guinean southern coast, notably in the Benty estuary (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008, Camara 2011). In the eastern side of Guinea, Manatees are reported in the Niger, Tinkisso and Gambia Rivers and at Haute Niger National Park (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Boffa and Boké, Manatees are more easily observed during the rainy season, in channels when they are feeding (Théophile <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are reported in the estuary at Dubréka, and a new research project will begin studying them there (O. Camara pers. comm.). In 2009 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Kanfarandé (C. Kpoghomou pers. comm.), and two Manatee calves were rescued from fishermen’s nets and released in Dubréka and Benty in 2011 and 2013 respectively (Camara 2011, O. Camara pers. comm.). According to CITES records, six live Manatees were exported from Guinea to China in 2008.<br/><br/><strong>Sierra Leone</strong><br/>The presence of Manatees has long been recorded throughout Sierra Leone. Early work confirmed its occurrence throughout the coastal areas of Bonthe and Pujehun districts and the Sierra Leone River estuary as well as in all rivers (Lowes 1970, Robinson 1971). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported their presence widely in Sierra Leone, including the Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sierra Leone, Sherbro, Wanje and Sewa river systems and Lake Mape. Manatees migrate between the Malem, Shenge, and Wange Rivers and probably move upstream near Teboh, and their presence is confirmed at Yeluba Island (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 1988). The southern side of the coastal area (Shenge to Sulima) is believed to contain the most important numbers of Manatees, but there are no data on population numbers (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Recent work by Siaffa and Jalloh (2006) reported that their occurrence in many wetlands is seasonal, with high numbers seen up rivers during the rainy season when the water level is high. They are also frequently reported devastating rice fields during the rainy season, and with the rise of the water level there is also an increase in accidental captures in fishing nets&#160;(Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). As of the late 1980s the species was still widely distributed in the country, but the catches at that time were thought to be unsustainable. The Manatees are trapped, netted and harpooned (Powell 1996). Although the Manatee is considered sacred in northern Sierra Leone, and therefore not directly hunted, when incidentally caught it is still eaten (Siaffa and Jalloh 2008). Hunting is most prevalent in the wetlands of southern Sierra Leone, where Manatee meat and oil are relatively common household food items, selling for approximately 2,500-3,000 Leone (less than 70 cents in USD) per half kg piece (Siaffa and Jalloh 2006). Heavy hunting activity is also reported in river mouths, particularly in mangrove areas (van der Winden and Siaka 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Liberia</strong><br/>Manatees have been recorded from the St. Paul River, Mesurado River, the lower Moro, St. John River, as well as the Cestos and Sankwen Rivers and in the Piso Lake region (Powell 1996). Information collected from fishermen and riparian communities in 2006 indicated that Manatees occur in the Cavalla River estuary in the southeast (Wiles and Makor 2008). The main threats to Manatees in Liberia are reported as accidental entanglement in fishing nets, direct hunting, boat collision (propeller injuries), and habitat destruction (Wiles and Makor 2008). No information is available on status and there are no current manatee studies in Liberia.<br/><br/><strong>Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast)</strong><br/>Information about Manatee distribution and relative abundance in Côte d’Ivoire was collected for the first time between 1978 and 1983 by the German Technical Assistance Mission (MATA), which surveyed 107 sites and estimated that the number of Manatees living in Côte d’Ivoire was well below 850 individuals (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). Akoi (2004) reported that the Manatee occurs along the entire coastal region of Côte d’Ivoire, as well as in all main rivers and their estuaries, and almost all lagoons. According to findings of surveys and the movements of individuals monitored by VHF radio telemetry from 1986-1988 and 2000-2002 (Powell 1996, Akoi 2004), six main areas of occurrence were identified: the Aby-Tendo-Ehy lagoon complex with the estuaries of River Tanoh and River Bia; the Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Comoé; the west Ebrié lagoon complex with the mouth of River Agneby; the Tagba-Makey-Tadio-Niouzoumou lagoon complex with the mouths of River Bandama and tributaries of Gô and Boubo; N’gni lagoon with the mouths of River Bolo and Niouniourou; the mouths of the Sassandra, San Pedro and Cavally Rivers. Groups of 10 to 20 individuals were observed several times in the N’gni lagoon in Fresco in the month of August (Akoi 2004). Human development is believed to be the reason why Manatees have completely disappeared from waters around Abidjan (Akoi 2004). A programme of research and education led by K. Akoi from 1986 until his death in 2009 was the longest running Manatee research programme in Africa to date. The population was tentatively estimated at 750–800 Manatees in five to six small, isolated populations (Akoi 2004). Illegal hunting is still a problem, as is habitat destruction including development and dams (the Kossou dam in the Bandama River and the Buyo dam in the Sassandra River). Hunting is illegal, but continues, with traps, harpoons, hook lines, baited hooks and nets all used (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Nicole <em>et al</em>. 1994, Powell 1996, Akoi 2004). There was some success in educating potential hunters and in enforcing the hunting ban in some areas (Akoi 2000), but unfortunately all programmes ended after the death of Akoi in 2009, and there are currently no research or conservation activities taking place. According to CITES records, four live Manatees were exported to Taiwan in 2004. At least two of these were sent to Farglory Ocean Park; one of these died in 2010 and the second is still in captivity at the park (T. Mignucci pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Ghana</strong><br/>The African Manatee occurs in coastal and inland waterways in Ghana, particularly in the Afram arm of Lake Volta, and in the rivers Dayi, Asukawkaw, Obusum, Sene, Digya and Oti (Ofori-Danson 1995). Manatees occur in Abi, Tano and Ehy lagoons in the southwest of Ghana (Roth and Waitkuwait 1986). They are also found in the River Tano, the lagoons and swamps associated with the lower Volta and in Lake Volta (formed by construction of the Akosombo dam). There are reports of sightings in the tributaries of the river Tordzie, such as Lolo, Altra, and Hortor in the southern area of Tongu. However, there is no report of its presence in the White or Black Volta Rivers. Ofori-Danson and Agbogah (1995) concluded that the confluence of Oti could define the upper limit of the distribution area of the Manatee in Ghana. The African Manatee has become very elusive in Lake Volta under stress from declining water levels and hunting (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In addition, environmental degradation in the Lake Volta is on the increase. The situation continues to worsen as the human population of Ghana continues to grow, urbanization and tourist development increase and human activities become diversified (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). As a result, there is growing concern to educate the populace and also to facilitate the Ghana Wildlife Division charged with the responsibility of managing the country’s terrestrial and aquatic wildlife resources to take action. Legal protection has been established for Manatees in Ghana, and the Wildlife Division prohibits trade and hunting of Manatees. However, the enforcement of wildlife laws protecting the Manatee is frustrated by a lack of resources, manpower and limited awareness of existing regulations (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.). In 2007, the Earthwatch Institute supported a project entitled “Enhancing conservation of the West African Manatee in Ghana”. During this project, no Manatees were encountered, suggesting that the stock could be too depleted to support further removal and there is urgent need for enforcement and conservation measures (P. Ofori-Dansen pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Togo</strong><br/>Manatees were previously reported in Kpessi, Agbodrafo, Abatékopé (near Aného), and in Lake Togo at Ekpui, Togoville, Kéta, Akoda and Kouénou, but this is no longer the case (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Manatee is observed in Lake Togo with its tributaries the Zio and Haho, and in the Mono River. According to the findings of surveys undertaken in 2006 among riparian communities and field observations, the Manatee population on Lake Togo is important (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). There are two concentration areas in Lake Togo: one in the south of the lake, and the other at the junction between the lake and the River Haho. The existence of these two concentration areas would justify the number of skulls observed in the villages of Amédéhoévé and Dekpo, which are the closest to those areas. It seems that the confluence between Lake Togo and the river Haho generally supports more Manatees than in the Lake Togo-Zio area (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008). All interviewed fishermen exploiting Lake Togo have confirmed this. The population in the Mono River is very sparse according to fishermen, but there is a reported area of population concentration at&#160; Adamé. The northern distribution limit of the species in the Mono is in the village of Agomé-Glozou. Young Manatees are regularly observed by fishermen, and in Lake Togo, mating herds are observed especially when individuals are sighted in groups during the flood period of the Haho and Zio Rivers. It is necessary to design a significant map of former and current Manatee areas to establish an efficient conservation status, and to determine any impacts of the Mono River’s Nangbeto hydroelectric dam on Manatees (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In March 2015, a collaboration between the Togolese NGO Alliance Nationale des Consumateurs et de l’Environment and the Togo Ministry of Security resulted in the arrest of a Manatee hunter in Dékpoé in possession of more than 20 skulls and 40 vertebrae of Manatees.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Benin</strong><br/>In Benin, the Manatee had been thought to be extinct (Perrin 2001). However, this is not the case (Powell 1996, Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006). The Manatee is sporadically distributed across the whole country (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). It occurs in coastal areas, including estuaries and coastal lagoons, in the great rivers in both brackish and fresh water, and in freshwater lakes, with reported sightings from both northern and southern wetlands (Affomasse 1999, ABE 1999, Guedegbe 2000). In the Niger valley, Manatees may be encountered in areas of medium depth at the confluences of the Mékrou-Niger and the Alibori-Niger, and in the branches of Bello Tounga and Kompa Gourou. Manatees are found in Bonou, Wébossou, Sèkodji Gomè, Ouinhi, Agonli-Houégbo (Kpoto) and Lac Sélé (Adjakpa 2002, Tchibozo 2002). They are frequently seen stranded in seasonal lakes off the Oueme River during the dry season (Tchibozo 2002, Dossou-Bodjrénou <em>et al</em>. 2006, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). In the Mono River, Manatees are seen migrating during high water periods, and are reportedly concentrated near the village of Hêvê and near the beaches of Avlo in the Boucle du Roy in Benin (Dossou-Bodjrénou 2003, Ichola and Tchibozo 2008). Manatees are hunted throughout Benin for food and traditional medicines (Ichola and Tchibozo 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Nigeria</strong><br/>The Manatee is distributed throughout Nigeria including the Niger, Benue and Cross Rivers and their tributaries, as well as coastally (Sykes 1974, Powell 1996, Awobamise 2008). Manatees are present in Lake Kainji above the dam and this population is isolated from other Manatees both upriver (by the Kandjadji dam under construction in northwestern Niger), and downriver by the Kainji dam (constructed in 1968). Manatees occur along the length of the Benue River and most of its tributaries, including the Gongola, Taraba, Donga Rivers, the Pie River as far as Yankari, the Katsena Ala River and the Deb River, which drains Lake Pandam, an important dry season refuge (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, Sykes 2010). The Manatee is believed to be depleted throughout Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers (Powell 1996, Oboto 2002, E. Eniang pers. comm.). It is hunted for its meat, oil and for organs used in traditional medicine (Oboto 2002, Awobamise 2008). There is no effective enforcement of protection laws. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to development and pollution of the Niger Delta by oil development. A fisherman of Sapele district reported that Manatees of different ages and sizes were found dead and floating after the Jesse petroleum pipeline fire incident (Oboto 2002). Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including work by University of Uyo in the Cross River region (E. Eniang <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), a project training former Manatee hunters in aquaculture as an alternative livelihood in Lekki Lagoon near Lagos (B. Dunsin unpublished data), and a new study of Manatees in Lake Pandam (R. Gbegbaje pers. comm.).<br/><br/><strong>Cameroon</strong><br/>In Cameroon, Manatees occur throughout the coastal region, from the extensive mangroves and estuarine waters of the Ndian Delta and Bakassi area in the west to the Wouri and Mungo Rivers and the Cameroon Estuary, and south to the Sanaga River and the lower sections of the Nyong and Ntem Rivers (Nishiwaki 1982, Powell 1996, Noupa 2008). Manatees are frequently observed in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve, the lower Sanaga River, and Lake Tissongo (Takoukam 2012). Manatees occur in the Sanaga River as far as Edea, where there is a dam and rapids, and in Lake Ossa (connected to the Sanaga), which has been documented as an important year round sanctuary (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012, Mayaka <em>et al.</em> 2015). Inland, Manatees are found in the upper Cross River, especially around the Munaya-Cross confluence, and they also occur in northern Cameroon in the Benue River, from the Faro River and the Mayo-Kebbi to Lakes Tréné and Léré in Chad (Powell 1996). Manatees cannot descend the Benue into Cameroon south of the Lagdo dam. Although Grigione (1996) reported that illegal hunting was very limited in Cameroon, more recent reports have shown otherwise: Manatees are regularly hunted in the lower Sanaga region and Lake Ossa, and Manatee meat can be found in markets in Douala on a regular basis (Powell 1996, Takoukam 2012). Along the coast, incidental capture in fishing nets and habitat destruction are also problems (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013). According to CITES records, two live Manatees were exported from Cameroon to South Korea in 2008, and four more were exported to China in 2010. A new marine mammal stranding network set up in 2013 that covers coastal Cameroon, the Wouri and lower Sanaga Rivers and Lake Ossa documented 157 Manatee sightings (comprising 349 individuals) and thirteen incidentally caught Manatees between February and October 2013 (Takoukam <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong><br/>The African Manatee is present in the coastal areas of Equatorial Guinea on mainland Africa, but is absent from Bioko and Annobón islands (Dodman 2008c). The main areas of occurrence are in the Muni and Cogo estuaries, and it most likely occurs in the Rio Woro estuary and the Rio Ecucu near Bata, where one was captured in 1988 (Républica de Guinea Ecuatorial 2005). Machado (1998) considered that the Rio Muni area contained prime habitat for the Manatee. Bolobo (2001) reported that the Rio Muni supported an appreciable population of Manatees. They probably occur in the lower reaches of the Mitémélé River on the mainland (Powell 1996). In the southernmost part of Equatorial Guinea, Manatees are occasionally sighted in Corisco Bay and around Corisco Island where sparse seagrass beds of <em>Halodule wrightii</em> have been documented (Keith and Collins 2007). There are no current Manatee research or conservation activities in Equatorial Guinea.<br/><br/><strong>Gabon</strong><br/>Gabon may have one of the highest densities of Manatees remaining in Africa (Powell 1996, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). Reports of opportunistic sightings are common in the N’gowe and N’dogo Lagoons, particularly at the northern ends and in associated rivers (Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007). During the rainy season Manatees are also frequently sighted in seasonally flooded lakes off the Rembo Bongo north of N’dogo Lagoon, including Kivoro, Gore, Longa Longa, Mafoume, Mouaga, and Marimossi Lakes (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Louembet (2008) reported high Manatee seasonal use of the Abanga River and associated lakes, as well as hunting of 133 Manatees in this region from 2005-2008. Manatees are reported, but are sighted much less frequently in Mondah and Corisco Bays, the Libreville Estuary and Komo River, the lakes of the Ogooue region, and Banio and Fernan Vaz Lagoons (Mbina 2001, Endamne 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Bycatch occurs in gillnets and directed hunting is reported, primarily in the lower Ogooue River and associated tributaries and lakes in the region of Lambaréné, as well as occasionally in N’dogo Lagoon (Louembet 2008, Mvele and Arrowood 2013, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data, G. Minton pers. comm.).&#160;New mitochondrial genetics results for Gabon identified eight control region haplotypes, the highest number found for the species in any African country to date, indicating high genetic diversity (Keith Diagne 2014). Additionally, seven of eight haplotypes only occurred in a single water body, which may indicate strong local adaptation and low genetic mixing (Keith Diagne 2014). Manatees traveling between major lagoons and rivers in Gabon would need to move between these sites using the ocean, which has very strong currents and a narrow continental shelf. African Manatees are rarely documented in the Atlantic Ocean off Gabon, and with abundant food resources in rivers and lagoons, generally do not need to move between freshwater habitats. Similar geophysical barriers have been hypothesized to impede movements of West Indian manatees (Hunter <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p><br/><strong>Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Manatees occur throughout coastal rivers, lakes and lagoons of the Republic of the Congo, and have been documented in Conkouati National Park, and the Kouilou and Loémé Rivers (Akoi 1994, Kaya 2005, Bal and Bréheret 2007, Kaya 2008). Surveys of Conkouati Lagoon and adjacent rivers and lakes indicated that Manatees are seen primarily in the lakes and at the mouth of Conkouati Lagoon near sandbanks (Akoi 1994, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2006, L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Surveys of the Kouilou River region conducted by the NGO Renatura (Bal and Bréheret 2007) confirmed Manatee presence in Lakes Nanga, Ndinga, and Katina, as well as the following tributaries of the Kouilou: the Mboukou Massi, the Loundji, and the Midounvo rivers. However, the same study concluded that Manatees were not present in Lake Youbi and presence could not be confirmed in Lake Koubambi (Bal and Bréheret 2007). In the Loémé River, Manatees are reported primarily in the lower river and its estuarine areas, and fishermen also reported that Manatees occur in Lake Kayo, south of the Loémé, in the dry season (Kaya 2005).<br/><br/><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong><br/>Hatt (1934) and Powell (1996) reported that Manatees were common in the lower reaches of the Congo River. Manatees are regularly reported along the coast at Parc Marin des Mangroves and a hunted Manatee was observed at Boma in 2013 (S. Mbungu pers. comm.) Status is unknown, but given the frequency of sightings reported across the river on the Angola side (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011) it is possible there is a sizeable population in the lower Congo River. Powell (1996) reported that a local name for the species exists in the upper reaches of the Congo River so it may occur there as well, although other reports for this region (Dodman 2008b, J. Hart pers. comm.) do not believe Manatees exist above the rapids, and today it would have to be an extremely isolated subpopulation since it is unlikely Manatees can traverse the extreme gorges in the river west of Kinshasa.<br/><br/><strong>Angola</strong><br/>Manatees have been reported along the coast from the Congo River in the north, to the Longa River in central Angola, but little information is available on abundance or status (Powell 1996, Dodman 2008a, Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Morais (2006) found Manatees in the Longa River, extending their southernmost range to that river from the Cuanza. Manatees have been documented the length of the Cuanza River and its tributaries and lagoons from the river mouth to Cambambe dam, which, prior to construction of the dam, was characterized by steep rapids that also presented a natural barrier (Morais 2006). The Manatees’ distribution also extends up the Lucala River (a main tributary on the north bank) for at least 30 km upstream from the Cuanza River. Key sites of the river basin include areas at and around Cauigia Lagoon, Cabemba Lagoon, the Tôa Lagoons, Quissungo Lagoon and a small extension of the Ngolome Lagoon, as well as in the Caua River and in the Massangano region (Morais 2006). Based upon boat and interview surveys conducted from 2007-2009 in the lower Congo River from the mouth to 40 km upriver, as well as numerous tributaries on the Angola side of the river, Manatees are commonly sighted in this region (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2011). One Manatee was sighted by the survey team in the Nzadi Caca tributary of the Congo River in 2007 and it stayed near the boat for 1.5 hours, surfacing approximately every 8-10 minutes (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2011). Only one local hunter was identified in all interviews of villages from the mouth to 40 km upriver, and he was interviewed by L. Keith Diagne before he passed away in 2008. The hunter estimated he had killed approximately three Manatees a week (using harpoons and nets) for the past 30 years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). Manatees are hunted on the Cuanza River, Manatee meat has been seen for sale in the capital of Luanda, and a fisherman from a village at a lagoon on the Bengo River reported 77 Manatees killed during 1998 (Ron 1998, Morais 2006). Xavier (2011) documented a Manatee hunted by net capture in Lake Caúmba.<br/><br/><strong>Mali</strong><br/>Manatees are found throughout the entire Niger River system of Mali and in the Bani River but may have been reduced by hunting (Powell 1996, Berthe 2011). The Makala dam at Segou (constructed in 1945), another planned dam at Taoussa, as well as additional dams in Guinea and Niger, have chopped Mali’s Niger River Manatee populations into smaller habitat areas, and is of great concern for the conservation of the species in that country. There are no estimates of population numbers. In 2010 a Manatee carcass was recovered in Koulikoro (Timbo 2010), constituting the furthest inland record for the species, although there are reports of sightings further west from Bamako (Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Manatees are frequently sighted in the Bani River near Djenné and Mopti, and have been documented regularly drinking from a freshwater spring near the village of Sokon (Berthe 2011). Manatees are also frequently reported in Lake Debo and the surrounding area in the inland Niger delta (Kienta 1985, Kombo and Toko 1991, Kienta <em>et al</em>. 2008). In western Mali Manatees occur in the Senegal River up to the Felou dam at Kayes, which prevents them from moving further upriver (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).<br/><br/><strong>Niger</strong><br/>Poche (1973) declared the Manatee extinct in Niger’s Park W, but this is not the case. A study by Ciofolo and Sadou (1996) found Manatees throughout the Niger River in Niger. In the northern Ayorou region (extending from the border with Mali to Tounga Faire), Manatees were sighted throughout the year and a large number of skulls collected by hunters indicated heavy poaching (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). In the region of Park W, Manatees were sighted in the main channel of the Niger River and a female was accidentally captured in 2002 (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996, Issa 2008). In 2010 a new Manatee study was initiated in this region (Boubacar 2010). In the southern Niger Boumba-Gaya section of the river, Manatees have been observed during low water periods, which may indicate migration elsewhere during other times of the year (Ciofolo and Sadou 1996). A male Manatee was captured in this area in 2004 but only survived in captivity for two weeks (Issa 2008). In June 2012, several Manatees were observed together in the Niger River in downtown Niamey near a major bridge (a possible mating herd). One female from this group was harpooned and killed by a hunter; the carcass was confiscated and biological samples were collected (Boubacar 2012). Manatees are heavily hunted throughout Niger for meat and organs (which are believed to have healing powers), and although the species is fully protected under national laws, there is little if any enforcement (Issa 2008).<br/><br/><strong>Chad</strong><br/>Manatees were once abundant in the Chad basin including the Chari, Bamingui, Bahr-Kieta, and Logone Rivers, but became rare by 1924 and are now believed to be extinct in this region (Hatt 1934, Powell 1996, Salkind 1998). Lake Chad is greatly reduced in size and desertification is a big problem there. Today Manatees occur only in Lakes Lére and Tréne, as well as the Mayo-Kebbi River which feeds the lakes from the west (Idriss 2008). In a survey in 1995, Manatees were found to be less abundant than formerly, but not uncommon in both lakes (Salkind 1998). Hunting continued on the rivers and lakes, despite enforcement efforts. The animals were sought mainly for their oil, which is shipped with dried meat to Cameroon (Perrin 2001). As of 2011 it has been reported that there are few Manatees left in Lakes Lére and Tréne, and that the local people have formed “militias” to protect the Manatees from Nigerian poachers who come across the border to kill them at night (J. Hart and A. Wachoum pers. comms.).<br/><br/><strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br/>Manatees inhabit all of the nations that surround Burkina Faso (Mali, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Niger), but have never been reported within this country. They are present in Volta Lake above the dam (see Ghana above). However, Perrin (2001) could find no mention of its occurrence in the upper tributaries of the Volta (White Volta, Red Volta and Black Volta) or in the Mekrou River, which forms the boundary between Burkina Faso and Togo/Benin and drains the wetlands of the Parc National de l'Arly. Pending directed surveys, its occurrence there must be considered possible (Perrin 2001).</p>",Unknown,"<em>Trichechus senegalensis</em> occurs in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. This species occurs in most of the coastal marine waters, brackish estuaries, and adjacent rivers along the coast of western Africa from southern Mauritania (16°N) to the Cuanza and Longa Rivers, Angola (9°S) (Beal 1939, Blancou 1960, Robinson 1971, Husar 1978, Nishiwaki 1984, Grigione 1996, Powell 1996, Perrin 2001, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). They ascend most major rivers within their range until cataracts, dams or shallow water prevents their progress. In some rivers, such as along the Benue and Oueme Rivers, Manatees seek refuge during the dry season in permanent lakes that communicate with the rivers during high water but are cutoff when river waters subside (Sykes 1974, Chabi-Yaouré 2012). Manatees can be found 110 km offshore among the shallow coastal flats and mangrove creeks (with abundant seagrasses and calm water) of the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau (Powell 1990) as well as offshore of Delta Saloum, Senegal. In recent times, hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers (see Threats Section). Manatees are found in the upper reaches of Niger River in the inland delta of Mali and as far as Koulikoro, which are the furthest inland records, over 2,000 km from the ocean (Kienta 1985, Timbo 2010, Berthe 2011, Keith Diagne 2014). They occur along the entire length of the Gambia River, penetrating into Senegal where there are records as far upstream as Niokola-Koba National Park (Grubb&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998, P. Brillant pers. comm.). There are also reports of Manatees further upstream in the Gambia River in Guinea (Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Chad, Manatees are present in Lake Léré and Lake Tréné and in the Mayo-Kebbi river (Hatt 1934, Salkind 1998). Manatees are believed to have been extirpated from Lake Chad by 1929 and no longer occur in the Chad Basin (Salkind 1998). Centres of population appear to be Guinea-Bissau, the lakes and coastal lagoons of Gabon, the lagoons of Ivory Coast, the Niger River in Mali and Nigeria, Sanaga River and coastal Cameroon, and the lower reaches of the Congo River (Powell 1996, Silva and Araújo 2001, Keith <em>et al</em>. 2006, Keith and Collins 2007, Keith Diagne 2011, Takoukam 2012). The Manatee population in Africa is reported to be reduced, but their present range appears to be comparable to historic reports (Husar 1978, Dodman <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major rivers from north to south including lakes within these river systems: the Senegal, Saloum, Gambia, Casamance, Cacheu, Mansoa, Geba, Grande de Bulba, Tombali, Cacine, Kogon, Kondoure, Sierra Leone, Great Scarcies, Little Scarcies, Sherbro, Malem, Waanje, Sewa, Missunado, Cavally, St. Paul, Morro, St. John, Bandama, Niouniourou, Sassandra, Comoe, Bia, Tano, Volta, Mono, Oueme, Niger, Mekrou, Benue, Cross, Pie, Katsena Ala, Deb, Okigb, Issa, Bani, Akwayafe, del Rey, Ngosso, Andokat, Mene, Munaya, Wouri, Sanaga, Faro, Chari, Bamaingui, Bahr-Kieta, Logoné, Mitémélé, Gabon, Ogooué, Nyanga, Lovanzi, Kouilou, Loémé, Congo, Loge, Dande, Bengo, Cuanza, and Longa.<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lakes: Lake Guiers (Senegal); Lake Volta (Ghana); Inland Niger delta (Mali); Lake Léré and Lake de Tréné (Chad); Lake Togo (Togo); Lake Aheme (Benin); Lake Onangue, Lake Ezanga, Lake Mandje (Cachimba) (Gabon).<br/><br/>Occurrence in major lagoons: Digboué Lagoon, Tadia Lagoon, Ebrié Lagoon, Fresco Lagoon, Bandama Lagoon, Comoe Lagoon, (Ivory Coast); Sakumono Lagoon, Lake Songaw Lagoon, Keta Lagoon (Ghana), Grand Popo Lagoon, Lake Nokoue (Benin); Badagry Lagoon, Yewa Lagoon, Lagos Lagoon, Lekki Lagoon (Nigeria); Nkomi (Fernan Vaz) Lagoon, N’gowe (Iguela) Lagoon, N’dogo Lagoon, Banio Lagoon (Gabon); Conkouati Lagoon (Republic of the Congo); Massabi Lagoon (Cabinda).","<span lang=""EN-US"">Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly  everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass  is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and  Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones and oil for  traditional medicines and rituals (see details under Threats). Live animals are also occasionally caught and exported to aquaria (see details under Population and Threats).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"The African Manatee is one of the least understood marine mammals in the world, and has recently been shown to be the least studied large mammal in Africa (Trimble and Van Aarde 2010). They are often referred to as the ""forgotten"" sirenian. African Manatees were up-listed from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I as of the Conference of Parties 16 in March 2013. They are also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species and are protected by national laws in all range states. In 2013 the IUCN SSC Sirenian Specialist Group created an African Manatee Subgroup in order to focus conservation efforts for the species. Though African Manatees are protected throughout their range, enforcement and control of hunting appears negligible. Hunting is largely local and sometimes ritualized and the meat is usually consumed locally. In some regions, hunting is primarily opportunistic and meat and products are traded locally and across borders. Awareness of the protected status of the Manatee is widespread in most areas surveyed, but often there is little perceived fear of arrest and punishment (Powell 1996); enforcement is rare and fines or sentences for the most part have been negligible. Frequently when individuals have been arrested, the fine can be less than what is gained by selling the Manatee meat and oil in the market (Powell 1996). Although in general protection is minimal and offtake is probably at unsustainable levels, progress has been made in some regions to discourage hunting. Oboto (2002) mentions that in some parts of Nigeria people are afraid to hunt Manatees for fear of arrest. In Senegal the Ministries of Water and Forestry and National Parks have been very proactive in participating in Manatee rescue and research activities along the Senegal River and Lake Guiers, so people are aware that they will be arrested if they hunt Manatees, and as a result there has been almost no hunting in these places for at least the last five years (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data). In an effort to encourage law enforcement agencies to arrest hunters, the Species Survival Network is creating informational posters that will be distributed to wildlife law enforcement agencies in all African Manatee range countries. It is important for Manatee researchers to work together with wildlife law enforcement and to provide data to assist the enforcement of Manatee protection laws, but to date these relationships are limited to only a couple African countries.<br/><br/>The species is believed to be in decline throughout much of its range, but without accurate baseline information it is impossible to know how to conserve these Manatees, and conservation is also unlikely without capacity building. A lack of long-term, committed funding, as well as the difficulty of accessing the extremely remote regions where African Manatees live, murky water habitat throughout their range, and the animals’ elusiveness, have severely limited studies. This species is only likely to be conserved through a network of grassroots, localized efforts by African researchers dedicated to long-term conservation and education efforts in their countries, and through increased funding to conservation activities.<br/><br/>Côte d’Ivoire had one of the most important Manatee conservation programs from 1989–2009 (Akoi 1992, Akoi 1994, Akoi 2000, Akoi 2004) but unfortunately it ended with the death of its leader, K. Akoi. Akoi’s staff were left with no support when funding was withdrawn after his death. This was a hard lesson that too often Manatee programs in Africa are dependent on the work of individuals. More people need to be trained and efforts need to be integrated into broader conservation programs so that Manatee conservation initiatives do not end if one person is no longer able to continue the work.<br/><br/>Many new African Manatee conservation initiatives have begun since 2008. From 2007–2009 the Earthwatch Institute (UK) funded annual training workshops for African biologists interested to begin Manatee research and conservation activities. The workshops were held at Lake Volta, Ghana and were led by P. Ofori-Danson, C. Self-Sullivan, and L. Keith Diagne. Over three years 33 participants from 17 African countries were trained, and equally importantly, a spirit of collaboration was born. When Earthwatch funding ended, L. Keith Diagne continued the training workshops in other countries, and built an African Manatee researcher network to increase and sustain communication between researchers in different countries, increase data collection, conservation activities, and educational awareness programs. The long-term strategy is to create a sustainable and cohesive network of African researchers who will determine population sizes and status of African Manatees in a majority of the 21 range countries, as well as develop and implement management plans for conservation of the species. The network continues to try to identify collaborators from all 21 countries. As of 2015, L. Keith Diagne has conducted five additional training workshops in Gabon, Mali, The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau for 80 African biologists from 19 countries. In May 2010, Wetlands International Africa (WIA) conducted a training workshop in Senegal with a modular course given by P. Ofori-Danson to&#160;17 local experts and wildlife managers from six African countries. General recommendations for this initiative were presented afterwards (Morales-Vela and Castelblanco-Martinez 2011). In 2013 and 2014, A. Kamla Takoukam also conducted two training workshops in Cameroon for 30 biologists.

97204950,41763,Equus ferus,Endangered,D,2015,2014-10-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Previously listed as Extinct in the Wild (EW) from the 1960s up to the assessment in 1996. The species was then reassessed as Critically Endangered (CR) due to at least one surviving mature individual in the wild. Successful reintroductions have qualified this species for reassessment. The population is currently estimated to consist of more than 50 mature individuals free-living in the wild for the past seven years. This taxon is threatened by small population size and restricted range, potential hybridization with domestic horses, loss of genetic diversity, and disease. As the population size is small, it is vulnerable to stochastic events such as severe weather. <em>Equus ferus przewalskii</em> qualifies as Endangered (EN) under Criterion D.","Przewalski’s Horses exhibit a harem defense polygyny (Van Dierendonck <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160; After dispersing from their natal band at approximately 2 years of age, males enter bachelor groups consisting of other young males and unsuccessful older stallions. When they are five years of age or older, stallions attempt to form harems of semi-permanent membership that are held year-round.&#160; They take over already-established harems, steal mares from rivals, or are joined by females dispersing from their natal harem at approximately two to three years of age (L. Boyd pers. comm.; Zimmermann <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Przewalski's Horse formerly inhabited steppe and semi-desert habitats.&#160; As most of this range became converted to agriculture, degraded or was increasingly occupied by livestock, the species became restricted to semi-desert habitats with limited water resources (Van Dierendonck and de Vries 1996). Lowland steppe vegetation was preferentially selected by horses at Hustai National Park and seasonal movements were affected by the availability of the most nutritious vegetation (King and Gurnell 2005). The breadth of species consumed and dietary overlap with other ungulates increased in winter, compared to summer, although forage did not appear to be limiting (Siestes <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the Gobi the Przewalski's Horses also selected for the most productive plant communities (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The species is not territorial; home range sizes in Hustai NP varied from 120 to 2,400 ha and, in addition to grazing sites, included a permanent water source, patches of forest, and ridges with rocky outcrops (King and Gurnell 2005). In Great Gobi B SPA, home ranges of 150 to 825 km<sup>2</sup> were reported (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Because the historic range is not precisely known, there has been much debate about the areas in which Przewalski's Horses were last seen: was it merely a refuge or was it representative of the typical/preferred habitat? The Mongolia Takhi Strategy and Plan Work Group (MTSPWG 1993) concluded that the historic range may have been wider but that the Dzungarian Gobi, where they were last seen, was not a marginal site to which the species retreated as they had access to the rich habitats of mountain valleys and more oases than in the present time (Sokolov <em>et al</em>. 1990), due to these areas being occupied by herders and their livestock. Although grass and water are more available in other parts of Mongolia, these areas often have harsher winters. Subsequently, others provided evidence that the Gobi is an edge habitat, rather than an optimal habitat for Przewalski's Horses (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2008), and certainly also subject to severe winters with devastating consequences for the population (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2011). Studies of feral horses have shown that they are able to live and reproduce in semi-desert habitats but their survival and reproductive success is clearly sub-optimal compared to feral horses on more mesic grassland (Berger 1986). Van Dierendonck and de Vries (1996) suggest that the wild horse is primarily a steppe herbivore that can survive under arid conditions when there is access to waterholes.","A number of causes have been cited for the final extinction of Przewalski's Horses in Mongolia and China. Among these are significant cultural and political changes (Bouman and Bouman 1994), hunting (Zhao and Liang 1992, Bouman and Bouman 1994), military activities (Ryder 1993), climatic change (Sokolov <em>et al.</em> 1992), and competition with livestock and increasing land use pressure (Sokolov <em>et al</em>. 1992, Ryder 1993, Bouman and Bouman 1994). Capture expeditions probably diminished the remaining Przewalski's Horse populations by killing and dispersing the adults (Van Dierendonck and de Vries 1996). The harsh winters of 1945, 1948, and 1956 probably had an additional impact on the small population (Bouman and Bouman 1994). Increased pressure on, and rarity of waterholes in their last refuge should also be considered as a significant factor contributing to their extinction (Van Dierendonck and de Vries 1996).<br/><br/>For the reintroduced populations, small population size and limited spatial distribution is the primary threat, followed by potential hybridization with domestic horses and competition for resources with domestic horses and other livestock. Wherever Przewalski's Horses come into contact with domestic horses, there is the risk of hybridization and transmission of diseases. Recently, illegal mining in the protected areas is an additional threat to their viability. In Hustai NP it has been noted that overgrazing of the buffer-zone and continued pressure on the reserve are possible consequences of the enhanced economic activity in this area (Bouman 1998); however, the second phase of the project (1998-2003) paid much more attention to sustainable development of the buffer-zone. In the western section of the Great Gobi B SPA livestock grazing by nomads and military personnel continues, particularly in fall, winter and spring; however, the core zone is largely free from human influence all year round. Infectious diseases transmitted from domestic horses and their parasites, notably <em>Babesia equi</em>, <em>B. caballi</em> and strangles (infection by <em>Streptococcus equi</em>), are a major threat to small reintroduced populations originating from zoos (Roberts <em>et al</em>. 2005, King and Gurnell 2005). As was observed during 2009/2010, severe winters can result in significant mortality. While predation occurs naturally as for any wild ungulate, if excessive there could be impacts on this small population.<br/><br/>There is concern over loss of genetic diversity after being reduced to a very small population and maintained in captivity for several generations. Sixty per cent of the unique genes of the studbook population have been lost (Ryder 1994). Loss of founder genes is irretrievable and further losses must be minimized through close genetic management. Furthermore, inbreeding depression could become a population-wide concern as the population inevitably becomes increasingly inbred (Ballou 1994). However, correct management of the population can slow these losses significantly, as has been achieved since the organization of the regional captive-breeding programs. Fortunately, Przewalski's Horses have been shown to have both higher nuclear and mitochondrial nucleotide diversity than many domestic horse breeds in spite of the population bottlenecks they have experienced (Goto <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>At the ‘Endangered Wild Equid Workshop’ held in Ulaanbataar in 2010 the following threats were identified:Loss of population due to stochastic events (i.e. severe winter);<ol><li>Limited habitat and resources (pasture and water);</li><li>Domestic horses (hybridization, disease, social stress);</li><li>Lack of information, appreciation / awareness, lack of knowledge; and</li><li>Exploitation of resources (i.e. mining).</li></ol><br/>Specific actions needed for each threat category were identified and described.","The history of population estimates and trends in the Przewalski's Horse has been described by Wakefield <em>et al.</em> (2002). Small groups of horses were reported through the 1940s and 1950s in an area between the Baitag-Bogdo ridge and the ridge of the Takhin-Shaar Nuruu (which translated from Mongolian, means 'Yellow Mountain of the Wild Horse'), but numbers appeared to decline dramatically after World War II. The last confirmed sighting in the wild was made in 1969 by the Mongolian scientist N. Dovchin. He saw a stallion near a spring called Gun Tamga, north of the Takhin-Shaar Nuruu, in the Dzungarian Gobi (Paklina and Pozdnyakova 1989). Subsequent annual investigations by the Joint Mongolian-Soviet Expedition failed to find conclusive evidence for their survival in the wild (Ryder 1990). Chinese biologists conducted a survey in northeastern Xinjiang from 1980 to 1982 (covering the area of 88-90°E and 41°31'-47°10'N) without finding any horses (Gao and Gu 1989). The last native wild populations had disappeared.<br/><br/>Of the 53 animals recorded in the Studbook as having been brought into zoological collections in the west, fewer than 25% contributed any genes to the current living population. All Przewalski's Horses alive today are descended from 12 wild-caught individuals, and as many as four domestic horse founders described below, which were the nucleus of the captive breeding programme (Bowling and Ryder 1987). Eleven of the wild-caught individuals were brought into captivity between 1899 and 1902 with the last of them dying in 1939. The twelfth founder (Orlitza III) was captured as a foal in 1947. A thirteenth founder was born in 1906 in Halle (Germany) to a wild-caught stallion and a domestic Mongolian mare, and a fourteenth founder is a female born in Askania Nova (Ukraine) to a Przewalski's Horse stallion and a domestic female of a Tarpan type. In spite of the introgression of domestic horse blood, the current population is genetically very close to the original wild horses (Bowling <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>As of 1 January 2014, the number of living captive and reintroduced animals in the International Studbook was 1,988 (883 males.1101 females.4 sex unknown). In addition to animals held in captivity and those already re-introduced, there have been a number of animals released into very large enclosures (reserves): Le Villaret, France (~4 km<sup>2</sup>; 2013: 18.18), Askania Nova, Ukraine (30 km<sup>2</sup>; 2014: 24.46), and Hortobágy National Park, Hungary (700 km<sup>2</sup>; 2014: 125.129). Bukhara, Uzbekistan (51 km<sup>2</sup>) had 19.17.1 horses in 2008 (W. Zimmermann pers. comm.) and 24 horses by 2013 (O. Pereladova pers. comm.). The unfenced Chernobyl exclusion zone (2,600 km<sup>2</sup>) in Ukraine contained 32.36 horses in 2008 (W. Zimmermann pers. comm.), and approximately 60 horses in early 2014 (T. Mousseau pers. comm.).<br/><br/>There are now approximately 387 free-ranging reintroduced and native-born Przewalski's Horses in Mongolia at three reintroduction sites (Zimmerman 2014). Between 1992 and 2004, 90 captive-born horses were transported to the Takhin Tal acclimatization site, from where they were released into the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area (SPA) (ITG International Takhi Group, Zimmermann 2008). A further three males were translocated from Hustai National Park to Takhin Tal in 2007 (Zimmermann 2008). In 2008 there were approximately 111 free-ranging horses in this subpopulation (Zimmerman 2008, Kaczensky and Walzer 2004). By December 2009 there were 138 individuals, but due to an extremely harsh winter (dzud) in 2009/2010 the population suffered extreme mortality: in April 2010 only 49 individuals remained (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2011). By 2012 the population had increased to 71. By the end of 2013 there were 90 horses forming six harems and several bachelor groups. Sixteen foals were born in 2013; three of these foals died, and one adult male disappeared and is presumed dead (P. Kaczensky pers. comm.).<br/><br/>From 1992 to 2000, 84 horses were brought to Hustai National Park (NP) by the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski Horse and Mongolian Association for Conservation of Nature and the Environment (MACNE) from reserves in Europe (King and Gurnell 2005). As of the middle of 2012 this population had approximately 275 individuals (Zimmerman 2014). By the end of 2013, there were 297 horses, of which 228 were members of 29 harems and the rest were bachelors.&#160; Sixty-four foals were born in 2013, with a 61% survival rate by year’s end: 25 foals, four yearlings, and seven adults died during 2013 (Usukhjargal 2013).<br/><br/>A third reintroduction site was started in 2004 at Seriin Nuruu in the Khomiin Tal buffer zone of the Khar Us Nuur National Park in western Mongolia (Association pour le Cheval de Przewalski: TAKH). Twenty-two individuals consisting of four pre-established families and one male bachelor group were brought from the reserve at Le Villaret, France between 2004 and 2005, and four horses from Prague Zoo were added in 2011 (Association TAKH, Zimmermann 2008). By the end of 2013 this population had 40 horses; eight foals were born in 2013 and 3threeof these died, as did two adult stallions (C. Feh pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In previous assessments of the reintroduced population in Mongolia, mature individuals were considered to be those that were born in the wild and five years of age. Individuals born in captivity were not counted as mature until they had reproduced in the wild, and produced offspring that were at least five years old (so potentially reproductive). The population grew from 55 mature individuals in the wild in 2006 (52: 26.26 in Hustai NP, 3: 1.2 in Gobi NP), to 79 in 2007 (Hustai NP: 33.35; Great Gobi B SPA: 3.8), 104 in 2008 (Hustai NP: 39.51; Great Gobi B SPA: 7.7), and 151 in 2009 (Hustai NP: 52.66; Great Gobi B SPA: 15.18). The winter of 2009/2010 was very severe and there was high mortality of Przewalski's Horses, particularly in the Gobi. In 2010, Hustai NP's mature population was 117 (53.64) and Great Gobi B SPA's number of mature individuals was reduced to 17 (8.9), giving a total population of 134 mature individuals. In 2012 the criterion for captive-born horses to be included as mature individuals was tightened to require them to have produced reproductively viable offspring (i.e., the reintroduced animal reproduced, and at least one of its offspring also reproduced); mature (≥5 years old) wild-born individuals continued to be included. Under these criteria, there were 178 mature individuals in the wild at the end of 2012: 153 (65.88) in Hustai NP, 23 (5.18) in Great Gobi B SPA, and 2 (1.1) in Khomiin Tal. Hence for a period of seven years, the mature population of Przewalski's Horses in Mongolia has been more than 50 individuals. Although this means that the Przewalski's Horse qualifies as Endangered (EN) it should be borne in mind that most of these individuals are from one reintroduction site and climatic perturbations like the extremely harsh winter in 2009/2010 can have very negative effects on small populations (Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2011). In China, the Wild Horse Breeding Centre (WHBC) in Xinjiang Province has established a large captive population of Przewalski's Horses (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2014). Since 2001 horses have been released into the nearby Kalamaili Nature Reserve (KNR), which had a population of 99 in 2012 and 121 in 2013. One harem group is roaming free on the Chinese side of the Dzungarian Gobi (Xinjiang); another 102 horses are roaming free during summer time but are returned to the acclimatization pen during the winter (Zimmermann <em>et al.</em> 2008; Qing Cao pers. comm.). The Gansu Endangered Species Research Center (GESRC) also has a captive breeding programme and has released at least seven horses into the Dunhuang Xihu National Nature Reserve (DXNNR) in 2010 and 2012 (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2014); all of these horses are fed in winter. A total of 59 foals have been born in the wild in China since 2009, with an estimated 19 individuals surviving in 2013 (Qing Cao pers. comm.). Until better data are available these animals are not known for sure to meet the criterion of mature individuals for a reintroduced species so have not been included in the species population size for this assessment.",Increasing,"Until the late 18th century, this species ranged from the Russian Steppes east to Kazakhstan, Mongolia and northern China. After this time, the species went into catastrophic decline. The last wild population of Przewalski’s Horse (<em>Equus ferus przewalskii</em>) survived until the mid-20th century in southwestern Mongolia and adjacent Gansu, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia (China). Wild horses were last seen in 1969, north of the Tachiin Shaar Nuruu in Dzungarian Gobi Desert in Mongolia (Paklina and Pozdnyakova 1989).<br/><br/>All extant wild horses belong to the subspecies <em>Equus ferus przewalskii</em>. The first visual account of Przewalski's-type wild horses date from more than 20,000 years ago. Rock engravings, paintings, and decorated tools dating from the late Gravetian to the late Magdalenian (20,000-9,000 BC), were discovered in caves in Italy, southern France, and northern Spain; 610 of these were horse figures (Leroi-Gourhan 1971). Many cave drawings in France show horses that look like Przewalski’s Horse (Mohr 1971). In prehistoric times, the species probably roamed widely over the steppes of Central Asia, China, and Europe (Ryder 1990), although wild horses in Europe could have been Tarpans (<em>Equus ferus gmelini</em>).<br/><br/>The first written accounts of Przewalski's Horse originate from Tibet, recorded by the monk Bodowa, who lived around 900 AD. In the ""Secret History of the Mongols"", there is also a reference to wild horses that crossed the path of Chinggis Khaan during his campaign against Tangut in 1226, causing his horse to rear and throw him to the ground (Bokonyi 1974). That the wild horse was a prestigious gift, denoting its rarity or that it was difficult to catch, is shown by the presentation of a Przewalski’s Horse to the emperor of Manchuria by Chechen-Khansoloj-Chalkaskyden, an important Mongolian, circa 1630 (Zevegmid and Dawaa 1973). In a Manchurian dictionary of 1771, Przewalski’s Horse is mentioned as ""a wild horse from the steppe"" (Dovchin 1961).<br/><br/>Przewalski's Horse was not described in Linnaeus's ""Systema Naturae"" (1758) and remained largely unknown in the West until first mentioned by John Bell, a Scottish doctor who travelled in the service of Tsar Peter the Great in 1719-1722 (Mohr 1971). His account of the expedition, ""A Journey from St Petersburg to Peking"", was published in 1763. Bell and subsequent observers all located horses known at that time within the area of 85-97°E and 43-50°N (Chinese-Mongolian border). Wild horses were reported again from what is now China by Colonel Nikolai Mikailovich Przewalski, an eminent explorer, at the end of the 19th century. He made several expeditions by order of Tsar Alexander the Second of Russia to Central Asia, aiming to reach Tibet. While returning from his second expedition in Central Asia, he was presented with the skull and hide of a horse shot about 80 km north of Gutschen (in present-day China, around 40°N, 90°E). The remains were examined at the Zoological Museum of the Academy of Science in St Petersburg by I.S. Poliakov, who concluded that they were a wild horse, which he gave the official name <em>Equus przewalskii</em> (Poliakov 1881). Further reports came from the brothers Grigory and Michael Grum-Grzhimailo, who travelled through western China from 1889-1890. In 1889, they discovered a group in the Gashun area and shot four horses: three stallions and a mare. The four hides and the skulls of the three stallions, together with an incomplete skeleton, were sent back to the Zoological Museum in St. Petersburg. They were able to observe the horses from a short distance and gave the following account: ""Wild horses keep in bands of no more than ten, each herd having a dominant stallion. There are other males, too, but they are young and, judging by the hide of the two-year old colt that we killed, the dominant male treats them very cruelly. In fact, the hide showed traces of numerous bites"" (Grum-Grzhimailo 1982).<br/><br/>After the 'rediscovery' of the Przewalski's Horse for western science, western zoos and wild animal parks became interested in this species for their collections. Several long expeditions were mounted to catch animals. Some expeditions came back empty-handed and some had only seen a glimpse of wild Przewalski's Horses. It proved difficult to catch adult horses, because they were too shy and fast. Capture of foals was considered the best option as when chased they would become exhausted and lag behind their group (Hagenbeck 1909), although this may have involved killing adult harem members in the process (Bouman and Bouman 1994). Four expeditions that managed to catch live foals took place between 1897 and 1902. Fifty-three of these foals reached the west alive. Between the 1930s and the 1940s only a few Przewalski's Horses were caught and most died. One mare (Orlitza III) was caught as a foal in 1947 and was the last wild mare to contribute to the Przewalski's Horse gene pool in Europe. In Mongolia several Przewalski's Horses were captured and crossbred with domestic horses by the Mongolian War Ministry (Bouman and Bouman 1994).<br/><br/>In subsequent years the captive population increased, and since the 1990s reintroduction efforts have started in Mongolia and China; Mongolia was the first country where truly wild reintroduced populations existed within the historic range. Reintroductions in Mongolia began in the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area in the Dzungarian Basin (9,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and Hustai National Park in Mongol Daguur Steppe (570 km<sup>2</sup>) in 1994 (King and Gurnell 2005). A third reintroduction site, Khomintal, (2,500 km<sup>2</sup>), in the Great Lakes Depression, was established in 2004, as a buffer zone to the Khar Us Nuur National Park in Valley of the Lakes (C. Feh pers. comm.). Releases began in the Kalamaili Nature Reserve (17,330 km<sup>2</sup>), Xinjiang Province, China in 2001 and in the Dunhuang Xihu National Nature Reserve (6,600 km<sup>2</sup>), Gansu Province, China in 2010 (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2014), although almost all of these animals are corralled and fed in winter (Qing Cao pers. comm.). Further reintroduction sites are planned in Kazakhstan and Russia (W. Zimmerman pers. comm.).","There is currently no use or trade in Przewalski's Horses. Hunting is not currently a threat to the species, though this needs to be monitored.

97216466,18868,Puma concolor,Least Concern,,2015,2014-04-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Least Concern because it is one of the most widely-distributed mammals in the Western Hemisphere. Although it has been extirpated from its former range in midwestern and eastern North America (Nowell and Jackson 1996), it is attempting to recolonize this region (Thompson and Jenks 2010, LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2012) and populations are healthy enough for regulated harvest in western North America. However, it is considered to be declining elsewhere in its range, and as a large carnivore intricately linked to other wildlife and habitat associations, from a social and political perspective its conservation and management presents numerous challenges.","This species is found in a broad range of habitats, in all forest types, as well as lowland and montane desert.  Several studies have shown that habitat with dense understory vegetation is preferred, however, Pumas can live in very open habitats with only a minimum of vegetative cover (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  Pumas co-occur with Jaguars in much of their Latin American range, and may favour more open habitats than their larger competitor, although both can be found in dense forest (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Pumas are capable of taking large prey, but when available small to medium-sized prey are more important in their diet (in tropical portions of the range).  This is true of wild prey as well as livestock (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  In North America, deer make up 60-80% of the Puma's diet, and the mean weight of prey taken is 39-48 kg.  In Florida, however, where deer numbers are low, Pumas take smaller prey including feral pigs, raccoons and armadillos, and deer account for only about 1/3 of the diet (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).<br/><br/>Home range sizes of Pumas vary considerably across their geographic distribution, and the smallest ranges tend to occur in areas where prey densities are high and prey are not migratory (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).  In North America, home range sizes ranged from 32-1,031 km<sup>2</sup> (Lindzey <em>et al.</em> 1987).","Pumas are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching of their wild prey base.  They are persecuted across their range by retaliatory hunting due to livestock depredation, and due to fear that they pose a threat to human life (IUCN Cats Red List workshop 2007).  Pumas have killed a number of people in western Canada and the US in recent years.  Pumas are legally hunted in many western US states, although hunting was banned by popular referendum in California in 1990.  Road kills are the principal cause of mortality in the endangered Florida Panther subpopulation, and heavily travelled roads are a major barrier to Puma movements and dispersal (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002).","The Canadian population was roughly estimated at 3,500-5,000 and the western US population at 10,000 in the early 1990s (Nowell and Jackson 1996).  The population of Central and South America is likely much higher, although it is unclear how abundant Pumas are in the dense rainforest of the Amazon basin (Nowell and Jackson 1996). The Florida subpopulation, numbering 100-180, is isolated, and has been supplemented by a reintroduction of pumas from Texas (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 2014). In Brazil it is considered Near Threatened but subspecies outside the Amazon basic are considered Vulnerable (Machado <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005).  It is also considered Near Threatened in Peru (Inrena 2006), Argentina (Diaz and Ojeda 2000) and Colombia (Rodriguez-Mahecha <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006), and Data Deficient (inadequately known) in Chile (CONAMA 2005). <br/><br/>Density estimates include:<br/><ul><li>Utah, US: 0.3-0.5/100 km<sup>2</sup> (Hemker <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1984)</li><li>Washington, US:&#160; 5.03/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Robinson <em>et al.</em> 2008)</li><li>Idaho, US:  0.77-1.04/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Laundre and Clark 2003)</li><li>Peru: 2.4/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Janson and Emmons 1990)</li><li>Patagonia: 6/100 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Franklin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999)</li><li>Pantanal 4.4/100&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Crawshaw and Quigley unpubl. in Nowell and Jackson 1996)</li><li>Belize 2-5/100&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Kelly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008)</li><li>Argentina 0.5-0.8/100&#160;km<sup>2&#160;</sup>(Kelly&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008)</li><li>Bolivia 5-8/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kelly <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008)</li><li>West Mexico 3-5/100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Nunez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998)</li></ul>",Decreasing,"The geographic range of the Puma is the largest of any terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002), from Canada through the US, Central and South America to the southern tip of Chile.

97218336,3787,Capra falconeri,Near Threatened,,2015,2014-09-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species is assessed as Near Threatened: it nearly qualifies as Vulnerable under criterion C2a(i) as there are less than 10,000 mature individuals (estimated 5,808, based on our analysis of data from 2011-2013) and each subpopulation, except one, has less than 1,000 mature individuals. The largest subpopulation had an estimated 1,697 mature individuals in 2011. There is no observed, estimated, projected or inferred continuing decline of the total population. However, stable and increasing subpopulations are restricted to areas with sustainable hunting management and protected areas. Were these conservation activities to cease in the future, poaching would likely increase, possibly changing positive trajectories in these areas downward, and the species would then qualify as Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The previous (2008) assessment of Endangered appears erroneous. The data available would have qualified the taxon for the category Vulnerable based on criterion C with &lt;10,000 mature individuals, because the most recent estimates cited by Valdez (2008) ranged from 5,080 to 5,630 (mean 5,355) individuals, of which 60% or 3,213 would have been mature animals. Further, there had been an inferred continuous decline (C1), and in the largest subpopulation in the Torghar Hills there were an estimated 1,600 individuals, of which 960 (60%) would be assumed to be mature, just meeting the threshold of criterion C2a(i) for the category Vulnerable.<br/><br/>The reason for the change from category Vulnerable (the corrected 2008 assessment) to Near Threatened is Genuine (recent, since assessments 1994, 1996 and 2008). Available data show that the earlier population decline had ceased for more than five years due to effective conservation measures. This has led to the stabilization of key subpopulations and increase in parts of the species range. Since 2002, the largest subpopulation has been estimated at &gt;1,000 mature individuals for a number of years. Thus, criteria C1 and C2a(i) for Vulnerable have not been met for five or more years.</p>","<em>Capra falconeri</em> is adapted to mountainous terrain with steep cliffs, between 600 and 3,600 m elevation. The species is typically found in areas with open woodlands, scrublands and light forests. In Pakistan and India these are made up primarily of oaks (e.g. <em>Quercus ilex</em>), pines (e.g. <em>Pinus gerardiana</em>), junipers (e.g. <em>Juniperus macropoda</em>) and Deodar Cedar (<em>Cedrus deodora</em>) as well as spruce (<em>Picea smithiana</em>) and fir (<em>Abies spectabilis, A. pindrow</em>) in certain areas. In Tajikistan the vegetation in the lower parts consists of open woodland and shrub communities with Pistachio (<em>Pistacia vera</em>), Redbud (<em>Cercis griffithii</em>) and Almond (<em>Amygdalus bucharica</em>); with increasing elevation juniper trees (<em>Juniperus seravschanica</em>), (<em>J. semiglobosa</em>), mixed with shrubs of maple (<em>Acer regelii</em>, <em>A. turkestanicum</em>), rose (<em>Rosa kokanica</em>), honeysuckle (<em>Lonicera nummulariifolia</em>) and <em>Cotoneaster spp.</em>. Markhor rarely use the high mountain zone above the tree line. Markhor are diurnal, but most active in the early morning and late afternoon. They alternate seasonally between grazing (summer) and browsing (winter), eating grasses and leaves. Females gestate for 135-170 days and give birth typically to 1-2 kids. The animals are sexually mature at 18-30 months, and live up to 12-13 years. Predators include Wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), Snow Leopard (<em>Panthera uncia</em>), Lynx (<em>Lynx lynx</em>) and on kids Golden Eagle (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>). <em></em>","<em></em><em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></strong></em><br/>Within Afghanistan, Markhor have traditionally been hunted in Nuristan and Laghman, and this may have intensified during the Afghan wars since 1979. According to surveys by WCS in Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008), Markhor continue to be the most important game for local hunters (despite a nominal nationwide ban on hunting). Petocz and Larsson (1977) wrote that rangelands and forests were likely capable of supporting a higher Markhor population than that observed. They assumed that impact of livestock grazing on habitat conditions was limited because the number of domestic animals was restricted by the area's capacity to produce and store winter fodder, as heavy snowfall prevents winter grazing. Recent numbers of livestock are unknown for Nuristan, but recent increases associated with an expanding human population may create competition for forage (WCS 2008). According to a study using recent satellite imagery (Delattre and Rahmani 2007) no large-scale deforestation of the coniferous forests was observed in Markhor habitat in Afghanistan. However, the extent of deforestation for the last five years in a region affected by war and largely out of state control is unknown.<p><br/>In India, all Markhor populations are small (usually &lt; 50) and fragmented. The largest population, in Kajinag, may have potential for long-term survival if immediate conservation measures can be implemented. Key threats to the Markhor’s range are insurgency-related effects, intensified local resource use, poaching, and large-scale development. Poaching by professional hunters may have been the primary cause of decimation of Markhor in the past, but communal hunting during winter was practised until recently. Armed conflicts may have increased poaching by both the military and militants, while poaching by local people may have declined due to confiscation of arms and restriction on human movements. Other pressures come from habitat encroachment by camps of Gujjars and the armed forces, excessive livestock grazing by local and nomadic Bakkarwal herders in parts of the range, and collection of timber and other forest products. Large scale development includes the proposed Mughal road connecting the state capital Srinagar with Rajouri, which passes through the Hirpura Wildlife Sanctuary, and limestone and gypsum mining around Limbar and Lacchipora Wildlife Sanctuaries. The Indian Government has fenced the entire Line of Control with multi-layered barbed wire. This may have caused further fragmentation of populations of Markhor (Bhatnagar <em>et al. </em>2009). <br/><br/>In Pakistan, control of poaching in Chitral Gol National Park and in several community-based conservancies has been successful. There, the population is stable or increasing. However, many subpopulations of Flare-horned Markhor are still small (&lt; 100) and the level of connectivity between them is unknown. The major threat outside established conservancies is poaching.&#160;<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri heptneri<br/><br/></em></strong>In Afghanistan, interviews suggested that within Markhor range overhunting is a considerable problem, with little capacity for enforcement of the national hunting ban (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012). As a result, Markhor appear to be under threat due to unsustainable hunting. (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012) Poaching in adjacent areas of Tajikistan is reported to threaten the source population of Markhor in Shahr-e Buzurg District (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, Michel <em>et al. </em>2014).<br/><br/>In Tajikistan, Markhor are poached for meat. There are published reports of skins and horns of about 100 poached Markhor being detected in a camp of Afghan poachers in Tajikistan (Michel 2010). According to Moheb and Mostafawi (2011), hunters in northern Shahr-e Buzurg in Afghanistan told numerous stories of groups of hunters going to Tajikistan to poach, and they showed horns and two skins said to originate from there. Because of remoteness, logistical hurdles and lack of security, the international border in this area remains difficult to control.&#160; Cross-border poaching affects the security situation for game wardens, researchers, tourists, and legal foreign hunters and thus jeopardizes the conservation of Markhor in the Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve and adjacent areas. A recent report (Alidodov <em>et al.</em> 2014) suggests that in some areas poaching is mainly targeted at mature males (including illegal trophy hunting, Vaisman <em>et al. </em>2014), and that there is a low proportion of adult males (4-5% of the total number, compared to above 20% in other areas). Habitat quality has deteriorated in some locations due to excessive and poorly regulated fuel wood cutting and intensive grazing.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, increasing grazing of goats and intense poaching threaten Markhor (Lukarevski 2002), whereas Weinberg <em>et al.</em> (1997b) reported that in 1995 grazing and illegal hunting seemed well controlled in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, Markhor are now largely restricted to the Surkhan State Strict Nature Reserve and its buffer zone. Despite their protected status, illegal cutting of trees and shrubs, livestock grazing, and poaching were reported (UNDP 2007). No specific information on the current status of these threats is available, but recent Markhor population data (Xoliqov 2013) suggest that the threats are controlled, at least to some extent.<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros<br/><br/></em></strong>Valdez (2008) reported that in Afghanistan excessive hunting by local people and forage competition with livestock were pushing Markhor to the periphery of its range. Such severe pressure was leading the population to a slow demise, and its status is unlikely to have improved since.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most important threat to subpopulations outside the Torghar Conservancy is illegal hunting. Other threats include competition with livestock, risk of disease transmission from livestock (Woodford <em>et al.</em> 2004), habitat degradation, and habitat loss (Sheikh and Molur 2004). According to Hess <em>et al. </em>(1997), significant habitat loss was caused by logging in the Sulaiman Range, which they considered the most important area of straight-horned Markhor’s distribution. No recent data on the Markhor in the Sulaiman range are available and recent satellite images from 2011 and 2013 (Google Earth, accessed 2014) suggest that habitat conditions in the Sulaiman range are still largely suitable for Markhor.<br/><br/>Another threat for all Markhor subspecies may be posed by the spillover of contagious diseases from domestic goats and other livestock sharing Markhor habitat. Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP), a contagious, lethal disease to caprids, perhaps overlooked for long time in the north of Pakistan, was recently confirmed to be present in domestic goats in Gilgit-Baltistan and south-western Tajikistan (Peyraud <em>et al.</em> 2014). <em>Mycoplasma capricolum</em> subsp. <em>capricolum</em>, an infectious bacterium hosted by domestic goats, killed at least 64 Markhor in fall 2010 in one area in Tajikistan (Ostrowski<em> et al</em>. 2011). In India diseases such as foot and mouth disease are reportedly common in livestock and can infect Markhor (Ranjitsinh<em> et al. </em>2007).<br/><br/>Hybridization with domestic goats may be a potential threat for all subspecies as goats commonly graze in Markhor habitats. Hammer <em>et al.</em> (2008) found introgressive hybridization with domestic goat among 35.7% of Markhor from three zoos, and speculated that in some cases introgressed wild living ancestral <em>C. falconeri</em> herds may have been the source populations of captive Markhor.</p>  <em></em>","The criteria for Red List Categories refer to mature individuals, but most available population data present total numbers. Here we referred to these total numbers; and for the assessment we assumed that 60% of each population estimate were mature individuals, defined as “the number of individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction” (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of Markhor, this definition excludes kids and yearlings.<br/><br/>The most recent data for most of the species’ range are from different time periods (2008–2014) and of variable quality, including information based on observations, estimates and educated guesses. Data from 2011-2013 are available for most areas, suggesting a total of about 8,800 Markhor. This number does not include some areas for which no data are available for that period. Based on older data and trends we assumed that in total approximately 900 Markhor existed in those areas, for a global population of about 9,700. We therefore assess the global population to be more than 5,800 mature individuals.<br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri falconeri<br/></em></strong><br/>In Afghanistan, during a survey in April 1972, 37 Markhor were counted in the upper Alingar Valley, and numerous signs of presence and reports by local hunters were documented there and in the upper Alishang Valley, suggesting a viable population (Petocz 1972). In south central Nuristan Petocz and Larsson (1977) recorded 350 Markhor, but considered this number a small proportion of the local population. The observed sex-age structure indicated high reproduction and possibly a fairly stable population size or moderate decline despite hunting pressure. In contrast, in eastern Nuristan Petocz <em>et al</em>. (1977) found a dramatic decline caused by hunting. Camera surveys, hunter interviews, and participatory distribution mapping conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in south central Nuristan during 2006-2007 and 2008 (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2011) suggested that the species was still present in the area surveyed by Petocz and Larsson (1977) and that the occupied range area was still largely the same. Although a 370 km transect survey by the WCS team recorded only three individuals, information obtained from local hunters and the importance of the species as main object of hunting indicated a population at least in the range of up to a few hundred animals.<br/><br/>In India, a survey of the species October 2004 to April 2005 in the Hirpura and Kajinag areas of the Pir Panjal Mountains in Jammu and Kashmir, recorded 35 Markhor groups, comprising 155 individuals (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005). This count, as well as interviews with key local informants, indicated that 350–375 Markhor may have existed in the surveyed area of Jammu and Kashmir. This is slightly higher than earlier numbers of 200–300 (Schaller 1977, Fox and Johnsingh 1997), probably because earlier reports were incomplete guesses based on information from only parts of the Kashmir Valley. The taxon’s range had contracted from about 300 km² in the late 1940s to about 120 km² in 2004–2005. (Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009)<br/><br/>For Pakistan, population numbers are available for various time periods and for different locations. Areas were surveyed during different seasons. The numbers we present are based on differing methods (counts, estimates, guesses), and names, locations and borders of specific sites are not always clearly defined. Most recent numbers are available for 2011 and 2012, suggesting a total number of about 4,500 Flare-horned Markhor. More than 1,500 occurred in Gilgit-Baltistan (WCS 2012), 2,959 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Iftikhar Uz Zaman pers. comm. 2014); and Arshad (2011) believed that in Azad Jammu and Kashmir approximately 50 Markhor existed. If these figures are correct, they indicate a substantial increase from the previous Red List assessment (Valdez 2008), when less than 2,500 to 3,000 Flare-horned Markhor were assumed to survive in Pakistan. Approximately 21 years before the current assessment (or about three generations), there were thought to be in total about 2,075-2,575 Flare-horned Markhor, including 1,075 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP 1992) and 1,000-1,500 in Gilgit-Baltistan (NA Forest Department unpubl. information 1993, reported in Valdez 2008). Thus numbers in Gilgit-Baltistan may have remained stable or increased, while the population in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa appears to have increased substantially.<br/><br/>Schaller and Khan (1975) assumed a total of at least 5,250 Flare-horned Markhor living in Pakistan and in India. Petocz (1972) and Petocz and Larsson (1977) counted 387 animals in Afghanistan. The total population number of the subspecies at this time was thus about 5,650 Markhor (about 3,380 mature individuals). Available data suggest that during the period 1985-1993, the total number for the subspecies might have been around 2,950 (1,770 mature individuals). Arshad (2011) assessed the total population number for “Kashmir” Markhor alone at 1,800–2,000 individuals. An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that as of 2012, the total population of <em>C. f. falconeri</em> was close to 5,000 (i.e., about 3,000 mature individuals). Hence the total population of this subspecies apparently decreased from the early 1970s to the early 1990s, but since then it appears to have recovered.<br/><br/>Data for specific locations in Pakistan show varying trends of population numbers:<ul><li>In 1970, the Chitral Gol, a valley of 77.5 km² in the Chitral District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province (formerly NWFP), and at that time the private hunting reserve of the Mehtar of Chitral, was estimated to harbour 100 to 125 animals (Schaller and Mirza 1971). In 1984, this area was declared a National Park, and by 1985-86, it contained 160 (recorded) to 300 (estimated) animals. In addition, the proportion of males &gt; 4.5 years in the population increased during the same period (Hess 1986). Within this time span, Aleem (1979) recorded a maximum of 520 animals in Chitral Gol in 1979. The increase was attributed to better protection from poaching and to other improvement efforts in the Park (Malik 1985). However, according to Ahmad (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008), the population in Chitral Gol National Park was reduced to 195 Markhor in 1987. Estimates by Arshad (2011) showed an increase to 373 in 2003 and 590 in 2005/2006. Ali (2008) confirmed the positive trend leading to 612 Markhor recorded in 2006 with a computed annual growth rate of 7.7%. I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population in Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division (including Chitral Gol National Park and its buffer zone, Arshad pers. inf. 2014) from 1,146 in 2009 to 1,364 Markhor in 2012, a greater rate of growth than that suggested by a projection of the data presented by Ali (2008). The precision of these estimates cannot be assessed, as some earlier counts may have been biased low, and the area covered during different surveys might have changed and be thus not directly comparable. Nevertheless, these estimates suggest a substantial increase in the Chitral Gol National Park and adjacent areas.</li><li>For the Tushi Game Reserve (GR) in the Chitral District, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 125 animals, similar to the estimate in 1985-86 (anonymous 1986, Hess in press, quoted in Valdez 2008). In the Tushi Shasha Conservancy, Ali (2008) observed 137 Markhor in 1990 and 545 in 2006, from which he calculated an annual population growth of 7.9%. For the entire Chitral Wildlife Division (without Chitral Gol National Park Wildlife Division) I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) reported an increase of the estimated population from 1,049 in 2009 to 1,456 Markhor in 2012.</li><li>The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) estimated 221 Markhor in Kohistan and 58 in Swat of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province. According to I. Uz Zaman (pers. comm. 2014) numbers recorded in Kohistan from 2009 to 2012 varied between 128 and 233, whereas recorded numbers in Swat decreased from 110 in 2010 to 11 in 2012.</li><li>The population of Markhor in the Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary (Gilgit District of Gilgit-Baltistan Province) was estimated by Roberts (1969) as not less than 500 to 600 animals; by Schaller and Khan (1975) as 50; by Rasool (no date, probably 1976, quoted in Valdez 2008) as 109; by Hess (1986) as 50 to 75; and by Rasool (unpubl. data, quoted in Valdez 2008) in 1991 as 40-50. In 2012 this population had reportedly recovered to 300 animals (WCS 2012).</li></ul><br/><br/><em>Capra falconeri heptneri</em><br/><strong><em><br/></em></strong>WCS staff surveyed parts of the potential range of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> in Northern Afghanistan in 2011. Due to security problems these surveys covered only small areas. The team observed four Markhor between Payan-e Moor and Aspakha Villages in the Kohe Ghaws area of Shahr-e Buzurg in Takhar Province. Local hunters believed that there were perhaps 20 Markhor left in this area. The interviews in Shahr-e Buzurg strongly supported the historical presence of Markhor in this district: 41 informants from northern and central Shahr-e Buzurg believed that Markhor were abundant in northern Shahr-e Buzurg during the 1970s. In the area between Dahan-e Ab Kof and Leiwgard Village in the Gandamargh Valley (Kuf Ab District in Darwaz, Badakhshan Province), the team observed six Markhor. Interviews with local hunters suggested that this area held approximately 80 Markhor (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>In the ex-Soviet republics, the total population was estimated to be about 1,000–1,200 animals in the 1970s (Zhirnov 1977), generally decreasing in the 1990s to about 700 animals (Weinberg <em>et al</em>. 1997a). However, Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997b), based on reports from game wardens and local inhabitants, believed the local population in Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve in eastern Turkmenistan increased during the mid-1990s.<br/><br/>Between 1960 and 1970, Zhirnov (1977) assumed that there were approximately 1,000 Markhor in Tajikistan, with the only viable population in the Kushvariston and Hazratishoh Mountains. In contrast, Sokov (1983, quoted in Baskin and Danell 2003) assumed that in 1967 only 500 remained in Tajikistan, decreasing to 400 by 1983. During the late 1980s in the Hazratishoh Range and in Kushvariston (Tajikistan) there were around 350 Markhor (Sokov 1989). Survey data from 2008-2012 (Michel et al. 2014) indicated that the subpopulation in the Hazratishoh and Darvaz Ranges of Tajikistan was stable and likely increasing, with a total of 1,018 recorded in 2012. A survey in 2014 recorded 1,300 in these areas (Alidodov <em>et al</em>. 2014) In the Sarsarak Range a separate population was rediscovered in 2014, with eight Markhor counted and about 30–40 reported by local hunters (K. Karimov pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>During surveys on the western (Turkmenistan) slopes of the Kugitang Range in 1995 and 2000, Weinberg et al. (1997b) and Lukarveski (2002) recorded 227 and 303 Markhor respectively. No recent information from Turkmenistan is available on the population number and trend of this subpopulation. Given the stable or slightly increasing numbers at the eastern (Uzbekistan) slope of the Kugitang Range, we assume that in Turkmenistan currently there are about 250 Markhor.<br/><br/>In the early 1980s there were 400 Markhor in Uzbekistan according to the Red Data Book of Uzbekistan (1983), but in 1994 there were only 270-290 estimated in Uzbekistan, with only 86 counted in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (western slope of Kugitang Range) in May 1993 (Chernogaev et al. 1995). Survey data by the administration of Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve suggested an increase since a low in 2003 (140-150 recorded, 160–180 guessed), reaching its maximum at 310–313 animals in 2013 (Xoliqov 2013).<br/><br/>An educated guess, combining data from different areas, suggests that the recent (2011-2013) total population of <em>C. f. heptneri</em> was about 1,680 Markhor (1,008 mature individuals).<br/><br/><br/><strong><em>Capra falconeri megaceros</em></strong><br/><br/>In Afghanistan, few animals survived even in the late 1990s, perhaps 50-80 in the Kohe Safi region, with a few in other isolated pockets (Valdez 2008). No recent information is available on the population numbers of Straight-horned Markhor in Afghanistan. The subspecies may be extirpated in the country, but potentially Markhor from Pakistan (e.g., Torghar hills) may cross into Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, population numbers for Straight-horned Markhor are well documented for the Torghar Hills (Baluchistan). Roberts (1969) believed that the main concentration of the Straight-horned Markhor was in the Toba Kakar and Torghar hills and numbers could have been less than 500. In 1984, Tareen estimated that fewer than 200 Markhor remained in the Torghar Hills (Mitchell 1989, quoted in USFWS 2012). The estimate by Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) of 1,684 for 1999 represents a substantial increase compared to Johnson (1997) who estimated there were 695 Sulaiman Markhor in the Torghar Hills in 1994. Rosser et al. (2005) summarized results from surveys that suggested Markhor in the Torghar Hills had increased to over 1,600 by the year 2000. Arshad and Khan (2009) presented an estimate of 3,158 Markhor in Torghar in 2008. M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014) considered this estimate possibly biased, and based on a new, conservative analysis of these data, suggested revising this estimate to 1,729. The most recent population estimate of 2,829 in 2011 is from M. Frisina (pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>There is no recent estimate for Straight-horned Markhor in other areas in Pakistan, but we assume there to be about 200 <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in other areas of Baluchistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated 150 Straight-horned Markhor in the Takatu hills in 1971, but later Ahmad (1989) reported that only 50 still existed in these hills, and only 100 in the area of Koh-i-Sulaiman. In the Ziarat Mountains in Balochistan, Qadir Shah <em>et al</em>. (2010) recorded nine and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) counted 32 Straight-horned Markhor. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) gave a total of only 24 animals for the whole province: 12 for the Mardan area, and 12 for the Sheikh Buddin National Park.<br/><br/>Although an accurate estimate of the total number of this subspecies is not possible, it can be assumed that with the population in the Torghar Hills estimated at 2,829 in 2011 (M. Frisina pers. comm. 2014) the total number might be slightly above 3,000 animals. In the 1990s this total was assumed to be around 870 (Ahmad 1989, NWFP 1992, Johnson 1997 quoted in Frisina and Tareeen 2009, Valdez 2008). Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated that more than 2,000 individuals remained throughout the entire range of Straight-horned Markhor in Pakistan. Roberts (1969) estimated that the total population of the former subspecies <em>C. f. jerdoni</em>, restricted mainly to the Province of Baluchistan, may have exceeded 1,000 animals, but that it was severely threatened because it survived in discontinuous and isolated pockets. For this same area, Schaller and Khan (1975) estimated fewer than 1,000 animals. Thus, over the past 20 years, numbers have recovered substantially, but this is known only for one area, the Torghar Hills.",Increasing,"<p>This species is found in northeastern Afghanistan, northern India (southwest Jammu and Kashmir), northern and central Pakistan, southern Tajikistan, southwestern Turkmenistan, and southern Uzbekistan (Grubb 2005). <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Capra falconeri falconeri</strong><br/><br/></em>Afghanistan: historically occurred in the eastern portion of the country, in the high mountainous, monsoon forests of Laghman (headwaters of Alingar and Alishang Rivers); Kunar and Nuristan (Habibi 1977, Petocz 1972, Petocz and Larsson 1977) and is still extant at least in south central Nuristan (WCS 2008, Stevens <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>India: restricted to part of the Pir Panjal range in southwestern Jammu and Kashmir (Ranjitsinh <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bhatnagar <em>et al</em>. 2009). Populations are scattered throughout this range, starting from just east of the Banihal pass (50 km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu-Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009 observed Markhor only in Kajinag and Hirpura, and confirmed evidence of their occurrence in Boniyar and Poonch. In the areas of Shamsabari and Banihal Pass the taxon is likely extinct.<br/><br/>Pakistan: a&#160;detailed study on the past and present distribution of “Kashmir” Markhor by Arshad (2011) showed that the area of occupancy and the number of locations have declined greatly (approx. 70%) during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. However, historic ranges larger than present ranges are partly a result of too much generalization in the older distribution maps, which include large sections of unsuitable habitat. It is not clear to what extent exchange takes place between the often small groups of Markhor inhabiting different watersheds. Flare-horned Markhor are mainly confined to the Indus and its tributaries, as well as to the valleys of the Kunar (Chitral) river and its tributaries. According to Schaller and Khan (1975), along the Indus River, Markhor inhabited both banks from Jalkot (District Kohistan) upstream to near the Tungas village (District Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit on the Gilgit River, Chalt and (Haraspo) Sikandarabad on the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley on the Astor River. Currently, Markhor are known from various locations in the Diamer, Astor, Gilgit and Baltistan Districts.&#160;Markhor are&#160;found along the Nagar Hunza River from Sikandarabad downstream, in Naltar Valley, along the Gilgit River downstream from Singul and along the Indus River downstream from Basho to the provincial border with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). Markhor are known to be present in the Juglot Ghooro, Rahimabad and Haramosh valleys in Central Karakoram National Park (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, Ecologist, Central Karakoram National Park, pers. comm. 2014). The population in Haramosh was considered extinct by Arshad (2011), but since winter 2011 Markhor have been observed there (Athar A. Khan and Syed Yasir Abbas, pers. comm. 2014), possibly indicating natural recolonization. The distribution range in Gilgit-Baltistan has been updated based on information from various sources (WCS, Mayoor Khan pers. comm. 2014). In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Flare-horned Markhor were found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan where it inhabited valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River (Schaller and Khan 1975). The distribution range in Chitral has been updated based on Arshad (2011), and includes side valleys of the Indus River upstream from Dubair, the Shishi River Valley as well as the Chitral River Valley and its tributaries upstream from Chitral up to Kaghozi Gol (Mastuj River Valley) and Shogore (Lutkho River Valley).<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri heptneri</strong><br/><br/></em>This subspecies previously occupied most of the mountains lying along the banks of the Upper Amu Darya and the Pyanj Rivers from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan. Currently, it is found in only two or three scattered populations&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">and its distribution has been greatly reduced&#160;(Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997). The subspecies was confirmed to occur as well in Afghanistan on the bank of the Pyanj River (Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Afghanistan: almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution before 1979 (Habibi 1977). Reconnaissance surveys and interviews with villagers have shown that, across from the two strongholds of Markhor in Tajikistan, this subspecies exists but in very low numbers in the Darwaz Region (Kof Ab district, ~ 38°02’ N, 70°23’ E) of Badakhshan Province, and in Shahr-e Buzurg District and neighboring Chah Ab District of Takhar Province (~ 37°31’ N, 70°02’ E). The Markhor seem to cross the Pyanj River (which forms the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012).<br/><br/>Tajikistan: limited to the region along the Pyanj River east of Kulyab, southern Hazratishoh range (~ 70°05' E and 37°54' N), including the Kushvariston massif (~ 70°03' E, 37°35' N) and the Pasi Parvor mountains (~ 70°16' E, 37°44' N), and the eastern slope of the southwestern edge of the Darvaz range (~ 70°21' E, 38°05' N, Shuroabad&#160; district of Khatlon Region and Darvaz district of GBAO Region). Formerly markhor were reported from the Babatag Mountains (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Uzbekistan (Ishunin 1972) and from the Sanglak and Sarsarak Ranges (southern parts of the Vakhsh Range, ~ 69°7' E, 38°13' N) (Abdusalyamov 1988). No recent reliable information suggests that Markhor still exist in the Babatag (Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). The presence of Markhor in the Sarsarak Range was confirmed in 2014, but the species has been extirpated from the Sanglak Mountains (Khalil Karimov, Panthera, pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Uzbekistan: found in the Kugitang Range (~ 66°36' E, 37°48' N) at the border with Turkmenistan. Its occurrence was reported in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century from the Babatag Range (~ 68°03' E, 37°46' N) at the border with Tajikistan (Bogdanov 1992).<br/><br/>Turkmenistan: restricted to the western slope of the Kugitang Range (~ 66°31' E, 37°49' N), bordering Uzbekistan (~66°40’ E, 37°30’ N; Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997a).&#160;<br/><br/><br/><em><strong>Capra falconeri megaceros</strong><br/><br/></em>In Afghanistan, at least until 1978, this subspecies survived in the Kabul Gorge (Kabul Province) and the Kohe Safi area of Parwan Province, and possibly in some isolated pockets of Paktia Province. Intensive hunting pressure had forced it into the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range (Petocz <em>et al.</em> 1977, Valdez, 2008). No recent information is available on whether or not the subspecies is still extant in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, the most comprehensive study of the distribution and status of the Straight-horned Markhor was published by Schaller and Khan (1975). The study showed a huge past range for this subspecies, but the actual range in Pakistan at that time consisted only of small isolated areas in Baluchistan Province, a small area in the former Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), and one unconfirmed occurrence in Dera Ghazi Khan District (Punjab Province). Virk (1991) summarized the information for Baluchistan Province, and confirmed the subspecies’ presence in the area of the Koh-i-Sulaiman (Zhob District) and the Takatu hills (Quetta District), both according to Ahmad (1989). The presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Torghar hills of the Toba Kakar range (Zhob District) has been repeatedly confirmed and it is possible that currently this area holds the only population consisting of more than 100 individuals of this subspecies (Tareen 1990, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Arshad and Khan 2009). Qadir Shah <em>et al. </em>(2010) and Mazhar Liaqat (2013) confirmed the presence of Straight-horned Markhor in the Ziarat Mountains in Ziarat District of Baluchistan Province. The NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1987, 1992) considered that the areas of Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. There is no recent information about the Safed Koh range (Kurram and Khyber Districts) where, according to Schaller and Khan (1975) probably at least 100 animals lived on the Pakistan side of the border with Afghanistan in the early 1970s.</p>",See Use and Trade details under Threats.,Terrestrial,"<p>All subspecies and populations of <em>Capra falconeri</em> were uplisted from Appendix II to Appendix&#160;I of CITES in 1992. The 10<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Conference of Parties to CITES in 1997 passed a resolution (Conf. 10.15) allowing for an annual export quota of six Markhor trophies from Pakistan’s community-based hunting management areas to states parties to CITES. CITES increased the annual export quota to 12 in 2002, to further encourage community-based conservation (Resolution Conf. 10.15 (Rev. CoP 14)). The EU Scientific Review Group has expressed a positive opinion on the import of Markhor trophies from well-managed conservancies in Tajikistan (EU SRG 2014).<br/><br/>Within Afghanistan, the species was protected nominally in 2004 (WCS 2008) by a nationwide presidential decree banning hunting, but this ban was not generally enforced. In 2009 the species was listed on Afghanistan’s Protected Species List, making any hunting or trade within the country illegal. The species does not occur in any protected areas. Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>identify remaining populations, their distribution and numbers;</li><li>facilitate the development of community-based conservation in areas with extant populations or with potential for immigration of Markhor from neighboring countries and establish conservation incentives;</li><li>raise public awareness about the conservation importance of the country’s Markhor populations and potential benefits from their sustainable use;</li><li>develop trans-boundary collaboration between nature conservation authorities and community based initiatives, including the prevention of cross-border poaching (Petocz 1972; Petocz and Larsson 1977; Valdez 2008; Moheb and Mostafawi 2011, 2012; Michel <em>et al.</em> 2014). Urgent measures are required to conserve the straight-horned “Kabul” Markhor <em>C. f. megaceros</em> if still extant. Surveys to assess numbers and distribution are important. Local people’s support for its conservation is essential, but this will be difficult to obtain, as the initiation of community-based hunting management is currently not possible due to the hunting ban and the difficult security situation in the area.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In India, Markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir’s Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978 (Ganhar 1979). Currently, Markhor in India occur in only three small protected areas: the Limber Game Reserve, and the Lachipora and Hirapora Wildlife Sanctuaries. Conservation measures proposed include:</p><p></p><ul><li>raise awareness among the army, policy makers and local people about the rarity of the Markhor and the importance of the region for its conservation;</li><li>the largest Markhor population, in Kajinag, merits the establishment of a protected refuge and the state’s Wildlife Department has already initiated a move to set up the Kajinag National Park;</li><li>involve local people, especially nomadic herders and the armed forces, in the conservation of Markhor, including the realigning of grazing practices so that important areas of Markhor habitat are excluded from grazing, and as much as possible mitigating the larger impacts due to fencing and insurgency (Bhatnagar <em>et al.</em> 2009);</li><li>consider future re-introductions to previously inhabited ranges in the Pir Panjal mountains.</li></ul><p></p><p>    </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Pakistan, the Markhor is completely protected by federal law (Rao 1986). In 1991, the Federal government imposed a 3-year ban on all big game hunting. This ban officially lapsed in 1993 but practically remained in effect, although it was ignored in the case of community-based trophy hunting programs (Shackleton 2001). The central government has issued permits only where a community-based trophy hunting program has been established; as of 2000, 80% of the permit fees were mandated to go to the community and 20% to provincial authorities in charge of nature conservation (although inter-community and provincial-federal disputes over receipts and permitting have occurred). The program continued through 2013 with trophy price for Markhor increasing from US $ 18,000 to about US $ 80,000-100,000. According to official records, between 1998 and 2008 approximately US $ 830,000 was distributed to communities within the former NWFP from hunter remittances from the 17 Markhor taken during this period (A. Khan unpublished data, NWFP Wildlife Management, 2008). With higher trophy fees during the last years, significantly higher contributions to the local communities have created substantial incentives for the conservation of Markhor in the participating conservancies. However, the small number of permits issued by the government (up to 12 per annum in accordance to the CITES export quota) may prevent an extension of the approach into still unmanaged areas.<br/></span><br/>In Pakistan several protected areas contain Flare-horned Markhor: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa - Chitral District: Chitral Gol NP, Drosh Gol GR, Gahirat Gol GR, Goleem Gol GR, Goleen Gol GR, Purit Gol- Chinar Gol GR, Tushi GR (NWFP 1992); Swat District: Totalai GR (Zool. Survey Dept., 1987). Gilgit-Baltistan – Central Karakoram NP (in Hunza-Nagar, Gilgit and Skardu Districts) Gilgit District: Kargah WS, Naltar WS, Danyore GR, Sherqillah GR. (Rasool, no date); Astor District: Astor WS, Tangir GR (Rasool, no date); Baltistan District: Baltistan WS, Askor Nallah GR (Rasool no date). Azad Jammu and Kashmir - Muzaffarabad: Mauji CR, Qazi Nag GR, Hillan CR (Zool. Survey Dept. 1986); Poonch District: Phala GR (Qayyum 1986). Only one protected area is known to contain straight-horned markhor in Pakistan: Sheikh Buddin NP (previously a Wildlife Sanctuary) in Dera Ismail Khan District of NWFP (Zoological Survey Dept. 1987). The status of the subspecies in protected areas in Baluchistan is uncertain. Its occurrence is not confirmed in Chiltan-Hazarganji NP, and there is no reliable information for either Sasnamana or Ziarat Juniper WS’s. There are no reports of markhor in protected areas in Punjab.<br/><br/>The Torghar Conservation Project in Baluchistan has reduced poaching and competition by livestock (Johnson 1997; Frisina and Tareen 2009); the markhor population in this area is reported to have increased steadily since initiation of the program (Rosser <em>et al</em>. 2005, Frisina and Tareen 2009, Frisina, Montana State University, pers. comm. 2014). The TCP is the oldest community-controlled program in Pakistan and has been so successful that tribal groups in other mountain ranges of Baluchistan have expressed interest in setting up similar programs (Frisina and Tareen 2009, Ahmed <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Throughout Diamer, southern Gilgit, and Astore Districts of Gilgit-Baltistan community based conservation programs aimed at Markhor conservation have created over 40 community conservation organizations and 18 registered conservancies, and trained and deployed over 100 community rangers. Markhor are now well-protected and appear to be experiencing a significant recovery (WCS 2012).<br/><br/>Proposed conservation measures include:</p><p></p><ul><li>treat Kargah Wildlife Sanctuary as a focal area for Markhor and enforce protection measures. Kargah is probably the best place for Markhor in the Gilgit District, and like the Chitral Gol, should be rather easy to control because it is a traditional wildlife sanctuary and is close to Gilgit;</li><li>adopt a similar procedure for the area around Bagheecha in the Indus valley, which is one of the best places in Baltistan for Markhor and also relatively easy to control and to the Haramosh and Sikandarabad valleys (in Hunza-Nagar District) in the region of Central Karakoram National Park;</li><li>develop a conservation and management plans that includes information on the status and distribution of <em>C. f. megaceros</em> in the areas it still inhabits outside the Torghar conservancy; consider the area of Koh-e Sulaiman and the Takatu hills as a focal area for conservation efforts and include participatory management in the tribal areas in this plan;</li><li>retain the hunting ban (with its exception for approved community-based trophy hunts);</li><li>encourage the development of community-based hunting management areas in currently unmanaged areas and buffer zones of national parks, and consider a slight increase of the annual quota to ensure more equitable access to benefits from trophy hunts for all conservancies (with quota set on the basis of monitoring results).</li></ul><p></p>    <p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Tajikistan, Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik) with an area of almost 20,000 ha was established in 1973, but since the early 1990s poaching has become common, and the security situation deteriorated due to incursions by Afghans (Michel 2010, Moheb and Mostafawi 2011). Markhor are legally protected, but hunting by foreigners was permitted (at least two Markhor/year) in the early 1990s (Weinberg<em> et al.</em> 1997). For the hunting season 2013-2014 the Government of Tajikistan issued a hunting quota of six Markhor, and five were taken by foreign hunters. Hunts are restricted to conservancies established and managed by local small family businesses and community based non-governmental organizations. About 80% of the Markhor recorded by the recent survey (Alidodov<em> et al. </em>2014) were in these conservancies. All captive Markhor in Dashtijum and Romit Strict Nature Reserves and the introduced animals in Romit were poached during civil unrest during the 1990s. </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Proposed conservation measures include:</span></p><p></p><ul><li>strengthening community-based conservation and management through secure rights and obligations for conservancies, issuing of area-specific hunting quotas based on survey results, issuing of import permits for hunting trophies and sharing of benefits with local communities;</li><li>prevention of assignment of hunting rights to non-locals and business structures and of illegal trophy hunts;</li><li>reducing poaching through trans-boundary collaboration, community-based hunting management and law enforcement;</li><li>reducing the risk of disease transmission from domestic sheep and goats by implementing grazing regulations minimizing direct and indirect transmission risks, monitoring the presence of infectious agents in domestic stock and implementing efficient vaccinations on domestic sheep and goats at least against CCPP and Peste des Petits Ruminant disease;</li><li>preservation of the quality of habitat through regulation of forest use and grazing.</li></ul><p></p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">In Turkmenistan the species is legally protected. Markhor occur in the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik), established in 1986 and covering about 27,000 ha. Lukarevsky (2002) suggested that ecotourism and trophy hunting may provide incentives for the conservation of Markhor. Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) suggested enlarging the Kugitang Strict Nature Reserve because it protects only the high elevation summer habitat of Markhor and the currently unprotected lower winter ranges are grazed by livestock. Critical for any consideration of a potential trophy hunting programme would be the full involvement of local community members and a benefit sharing mechanism which would ensure their support.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, trophy hunting of Markhor took place in the 1990s (e.g. two in 1994; Weinberg <em>et al. </em>1997) and until about 2005, including hunting in an enclosure containing a small captive group, which no longer exists (S. Zagrebin pers. comm. 2013). The EU Scientific Review Group in 2006 expressed a negative opinion on the import of Markhor trophies originating from the wild, which led to a suspension of trade in 2007. Markhor in Uzbekistan occur in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve (zapovednik). With assistance by a UNDP/GEF project during 2008-13 a managed buffer zone was established, encompassing all current Markhor habitat outside the strict nature reserve. Collaboration between the Kugitang (Turkmenistan) and Surkhan Strict Nature Reserves would be of utmost importance for the conservation management of this trans-boundary subpopulation.</p>  <em></em>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

102331567,15932,Pan paniscus,Endangered,A4bcd,2016,2016-03-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to high levels of illegal hunting, and habitat destruction and degradation, <em>Pan paniscus</em> is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in the last 15–20 years and it is thought that this reduction will continue for the next 60 years. Currently, by far the greatest threat to the Bonobo's survival is poaching for the commercial bushmeat trade. It has been estimated that nine tons of bushmeat are extracted daily from a 50,000-km² conservation landscape within the Bonobo’s range. Not only is there is a massive demand for bushmeat stemming from the cities, but rebel factions and poorly-paid government soldiers add to that demand, at the same time facilitating the flow of guns and ammunition (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). In some areas, local taboos against eating Bonobo meat still exist, but in others, these traditions are disintegrating due to changing cultural values and population movements. Stricter enforcement of wildlife laws and more effective management are urgently needed.<br/><br/>Habitat loss through deforestation and fragmentation ranks second. Much of the forest loss in this region is caused by slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture, which is most intense where human densities are high or growing. Logging and mining do not yet occur on an industrial scale in the Bonobo’s range, but in future, industrial agriculture is very likely to become a serious threat. Minimising the conversion of intact forest to human-dominated land uses, will be critical for the future survival of Bonobos. Countrywide factors contributing to the decline include the mobility of growing human populations, opening markets, commercial exploitation of natural resources and road construction. As in the past, the survival of Bonobos will be determined by the levels of poaching and forest loss—threats that have been shown to accompany rapid growth in human populations and political instability (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2014). Due to their slow life history and a generation time estimated to be 25 years, Bonobo populations cannot withstand high levels of offtake. The population decline over a three-generation (75 year) period from 2003 to 2078 is likely to exceed 50%, hence qualifying this taxon as Endangered under criterion A.<br/><p></p>","The geographic range of <em>Pan paniscus</em> is characterised by undulating terrain with elevations between 300 and 700 m asl and a humid climate (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bonobos inhabit closed, moist, mixed, mature and secondary forests as well as forest-savannah mosaics (<em>ibid</em>.). In the eastern and southern parts of their range, Bonobos occupy a mosaic of moist tropical forest, dry forest, savannah woodland, marshy grassland and swamp forest, yet they also require access to relatively-undisturbed mature forests. If available, Bonobos prefer primary forests and seasonally-inundated swamp forests, foraging in small streams and breast-deep ponds (Narat 2014, Serckx 2014).<br/><br/>Bonobos are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. They live in multimale-multifemale, fission-fusion communities, usually made up of 30–80 individuals. A single community occupies a home range of 20–60 km², and there is extensive overlap between the ranges of different communities (Fruth <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bonobos are omnivorous; over 50% of their diet is comprised of fruits and seeds, which are supplemented with leaves, stems, shoots, pith, bark, flowers, truffles, fungus, and honey (Hohmann <em>et al</em>. 2006). They appear to be more dependent on terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, including aquatic plants, than chimpanzees. Bonobos have occasionally been documented hunting and eating vertebrates (e.g., duikers, primates; Hohmann and Fruth 2008) and invertebrates (e.g., termites, caterpillars; Kano 1992). Bonobos build new nests to sleep in each night and sometimes make day nests in trees at heights of 5–50 m (Fruth 1995). It has been reported that Bonobos also make ground nests (Kano 1983, Guislain and Reinartz pers. comm). Their role as seed dispersers is critical for forest regeneration (Tsuji <em>et al</em>. 2010, Beaune <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>There is no birth season. Gestation is about eight months. Interbirth interval at Wamba (1976–1996) averages 4.8 years, and females average 0.18 offspring per year of their adult life. Physical maturation is slow with infants being weaned shortly before birth of the next offspring. Infant and juvenile mortality is low, with 73% of offspring surviving to age six (Furuichi <em>et al</em>. 1998). Females migrate aged 6–13 years, settling into a new community when they start cycling at 9–12 years. They produce their first offspring at 13–14 years of age (Furuichi <em>et al</em>. 2012). One generation is estimated to be 23–25 years (Myers Thompson 1997, T. Furuichi pers. comm. 2007, Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><p></p>","<p>The major threats to Bonobos include: poaching (mainly for bushmeat and for some medicinal purposes); residue from civil warfare (availability of modern weaponry and ammunition; military-sanctioned hunting); human-induced habitat alteration (commercial logging and agriculture, traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, fallow land); human population growth and migration; and lack of education (insufficient awareness among urban and rural communities that hunting and eating Bonobos is unlawful). Bonobos reproduce slowly, and thus their populations are particularly susceptible to direct losses caused by humans.&#160;</p><p></p><ol><li><strong>Poaching</strong>: despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, poaching is the most direct and immediate threat to great apes in DRC. Although taboos against hunting Bonobos still exist in some regions, these taboos have become ineffective where poachers are not local. In other locations, transient and immigrant human populations with different cultural values have increased the frequency of hunting and eating of Bonobos. Poachers prefer large mammals, and since&#160;Bonobos are the largest primate in the region, they may be targeted along with ungulates and monkeys. Commercial poachers, aided by military and local administrations, are active even in legally-protected sites, such as Salonga National Park (SNP), Lomako-Yokokala Faunal Reserve, Tumba-Lediima Natural Reserve, Sankuru Natural Reserve, and the proposed Lomami National Park. The importance of these protected areas as significant reservoirs of Bonobos will be compromised rapidly if current levels of poaching continue. Between 2003 and 2006, Hart <em>et al</em>. (2008) recorded evidence of poaching in 51% of survey grids across SNP, with hunting pressure highest in the north and east. However, since then, investment in effective antipoaching measures appears to have protected at least the Lokofa Sector in the southern block of SNP, where Bonobo abundance remained stable between 2006 and 2015 (WCS 2015). Extrapolating from interview data gathered for a bushmeat survey conducted in the Lomami National Park (LNP) area in 2008, it was estimated that 270 Bonobos per year were consumed around Kindu, representing three Bonobos per 100 km² per year in the area investigated (Mirambo <em>et al</em>. 2014). Currently, this negative trend has been halted within the park through surveillance and collaboration with local communities (Hart and Hart 2011, 2015). The intake rate of orphaned Bonobos into the Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary may be viewed as another indicator of hunting pressure and/or anti-trafficking efforts. Hughes <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated that 4.2 Chimpanzees (2.6–8.9 individuals) are removed from the wild whenever a single live infant is obtained as a by-product of a hunt. Considering that Bonobos are more social than Chimpanzees, the ratio of dead&#160;Bonobos per orphaned infant may be higher. Data compiled between 1994 and 2012 show a small but steady increase in the number of orphans entering the sanctuary, with two peaks each of six infants in 1997 and 2000 during the Congolese wars, and a peak of 16 individuals in 2004 after the implementation of peace and return to the regular use of rivers as major transport routes (ABC 2012). An influx of nine Bonobos in 2012 was also notably high, but arrivals decreased to two in 2015. While various explanations for lower intakes are possible (e.g., decline of Bonobos in the wild, or effective anti-poaching and anti-trafficking measures, or Bonobos being exported illegally), it is important to remember that the variation in such small numbers may be stochastic, rather than a real trend.</li><li><strong>Habitat loss</strong>: subsistence agriculture, commercial agriculture, logging and road construction all cause forest loss and fragmentation that reduces the usable (or ‘effective’) habitat available to&#160;Bonobos. Moreover, civil strife has been shown to exacerbate destruction and degradation of&#160;Bonobo&#160;habitat: in Luo Scientific Reserve and Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve, primary forest loss in previously unfragmented core forests was over two times greater during a decade when conflict and war were predominant in the region (1990–2000) than during a relatively conflict-free period (2000–2010), when humans left their hiding in core forest areas and returned to their natal villages and farms within long-established agricultural complexes (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, as conflict recedes, large-scale commerce is expanding and industrial agriculture is likely to become a significant driver of forest loss. Oil palm is already being grown in what would otherwise be&#160;Bonobo&#160;habitat (Nackoney <em>et al</em>. 2012), and Africa is becoming the new frontier for oil-palm plantations, which offers excellent economic prospects in countries with appropriate rainfall, soil and temperature conditions (Rival and Levang 2014). A staggering 99.2% of the Bonobo’s range is suitable for oil palm (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2014), highlighting the enormous risk the palm-oil industry will pose unless sustainable management plans are developed and implemented to protect great apes and their habitats (IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014). It is worth noting that even though permits for prospection or resource extraction have already been granted, drilling for petroleum is unlikely to recommence in the near future, given the low price of crude oil on the international market. Although logging and mining do not yet occur on a large scale in Bonobo habitat, industrial extraction could become a serious threat in future. Minimising the conversion of intact forest in DRC to human-dominated land uses, will be critical for the survival of Bonobos, particularly when considering DRC’s high human population growth rate (2.45% in 2015; CIA 2015).</li><li><strong>Disease</strong>: infectious diseases are of particular concern in areas where Bonobos live in close proximity to human communities, or have been habituated to human observers for research or tourism purposes (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015). Diseases that pose a risk to Bonobos include human-borne pathogens such as respiratory viruses, and natural pathogens such as <em>Ebolavirus</em>. Respiratory disease outbreaks were observed among Bonobos at Wamba when displaced people and soldiers were moving through the forest (Sakamaki<em> et al</em>. 2009), and human respiratory syncytial virus and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> co-infection has been detected at Malebo, where Bonobo habitat is surrounded by a particularly high human density (Leendertz pers. comm.). In 2014, a human outbreak of Ebola virus disease occurred in the Bonobo’s range. Considering their highly cohesive social structure, and high rates of physical contact, an <em>Ebolavirus</em> outbreak could devastate a Bonobo community. Despite a lack of scientific investigation of disease in wild Bonobos, these cases highlight the increasing need for health monitoring and disease contingency plans, as recommended by Gilardi <em>et al</em>. (2015).</li></ol><p></p><p></p>","The size of the Bonobo population is uncertain because only 30% of its historic range has been surveyed. Estimates from the four known Bonobo strongholds, based around protected areas, suggest a minimum population of 15,000–20,000 individuals (IUCN and ICCN 2012, IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). Although Hickey <em>et al</em>. (2013) compiled and analysed all Bonobo survey data collected between 2003 and 2010, the survey coverage was too patchy to allow the total number of Bonobos to be estimated.<br/><br/>Sop <em>et al</em>. (in prep.) used spatial modelling to investigate trends in Bonobo nest encounter rates on recce and standard line transect surveys carried out in two different periods. Data were available from eight sites, covering a total area of 16,500 km². Site-specific change estimates were weighted according to population size, and then change in nest encounter rates between different years was used as a proxy for Bonobo population change. Rate of change was estimated using two approaches: site-level Generalized Linear Models (GLMs); and a simple exponential population change model (ExpM). Sop <em>et al</em>. estimated an annual decline of 5.95% with a total decline of 54.9% between 2003 and 2015 (95% confidence interval: -17.6% to +6.4% and -18% to +0.001% for the GLM and ExpM, respectively). Under the same conditions, the expected decline in abundance over one, two and three generations (25, 50 and 75 years respectively) would be 85.6%, 97.9% and 99.7%, respectively. However, not all sites experienced significant declines in Bonobo abundance. The Lokofa Sector of Salonga National Park, for example, has ecoguards deployed throughout and was the best protected of the eight sites in the analysis (WCS 2015). Although Sop <em>et al</em>.’s assessment incorporated data from both protected and non-protected areas, the total coverage was limited by data availability. In addition, the preliminary model had limitations with regard to the representativeness of sites and data availability, such as disproportionate sampling effort between years; and lack of data on seasonality, nest production, re-use and decay rates. If few nests are located and sample size is low, then precision tends to be poor, leading to weak detection of trends. Although a drop in abundance between the two time periods was detected, the small number of paired samples did not produce population sizes. The range-wide data required will eventually show areas considered to be suitable, but from which Bonobos are absent, and perhaps presence of Bonobos in areas not yet surveyed. Despite uncertainty around the modelled rate of decline, a strong negative trend is apparent in Sop <em>et al</em>.’s analysis. Even with an annual rate of decline of only 1%, total losses would exceed 50% over three generations, underscoring the need for monitoring of Bonobo populations and threats.<br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pan paniscus</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""> has a discontinuous range in the low-lying central basin of Equatorial Africa, south of the Congo River.

Bonobos are protected by national and international laws throughout their range, and the majority are found in national parks (IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. database 2016). However, most protected areas lack resources and suffer from poorly-controlled poaching, and enforcement is generally weak.</p><p>An IUCN and ICCN (2012) Bonobo conservation strategy (<a href=""http://www.primate-sg.org/bonobo"">http://www.primate-sg.org/bonobo</a>)&#160;outlines five intervention strategies with objectives and conservation actions centred on the Bonobo&#160;‘strongholds’,&#160;which are to be implemented by 2022:</p><p></p><ol><li><strong>Strengthening institutional capacity.&#160;</strong>One objective under this strategy is the creation of new protected areas. Since SNP was established in 1970, an additional 35,580 km² supporting Bonobos has been officially designated. The Iyondji Community Bonobo Reserve in the ‘northern block’ was created in 2012 (Sakamaki <em>et al.</em> 2012). The establishment of LNP, currently a provincial park with a ban on all hunting, will add 8,880 km² of protected habitat to the Bonobo’s range (Doumenge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Once LNP is officially gazetted, protected areas harbouring Bonobo populations will total more than 78,080 km². Protected areas, however, will not curtail poaching as long as law enforcement is ineffective, thus the objectives of eliminating poaching, monitoring and controlling the bushmeat trade, and eliminating the circulation of weapons and ammunition in protected areas are crucial. Considerable efforts have been made in SNP, with recent improvements in guard numbers, education and equipment. The government’s ‘Operation Bonobo’ aims to confiscate military weapons that have been in circulation since 2012, carry out joint FARDC and ICCN patrols, and liberate the parts of SNP under the control of poachers. A specially-trained ‘<em>Corps en charge de la sécurisation des Parcs Nationaux</em>’ will be in charge of anti-poaching in all national parks. However, law enforcement in the Bonobo’s range as a whole is still fragmentary, and conservation efforts are hampered by the vastness of the areas to be patrolled, as well as corruption and isolation, and persistent political and economic instability. NGOs and research projects with bilateral investment provide greater assurance of active and permanent on-the-ground enforcement, and are working to strengthen ICCN’s limited capacity throughout DRC.</li><li><strong>Consultation and collaboration with local actors.&#160;</strong>Here the main objective is to integrate conservation issues into national development plans, land-use and macro-zoning plans, and implement sustainable subsistence activities at key sites. In an attempt to transfer responsibility for&#160;managing natural&#160;resources to local communities, WWF began sensibilisation activities in the Lac Tumba and Salonga-Lukenie-Sankuru landscapes and around southern block of SNP, and assisted stakeholders to establish local development and conservation committees (<em>Comités locaux de développement et de conservation</em>).&#160;</li><li><strong>Awareness building and lobbying.&#160;</strong>Objectives include developing a nationwide communications strategy, undertaking awareness-building activities at key sites, sensitising urban communities and private sector operators, and lobbying government administration at national and provincial levels. In 1995, USAID established the 25-year Central Africa Regional Programme for the Environment (CARPE) to increase local, national and regional capacity and participation in natural resource management, and strengthen conservation policy development and implementation to reduce biodiversity loss. Recently, CARPE established two distinct but interdependent projects:&#160;an Environmental Monitoring and Policy Support (EMAPS) project intended to boost the quality and scope of conservation policy-making, and forest monitoring, analysis and information dissemination; and CAFEC (see below; USAID 2014). Smaller organisations are conducting conservation education programmes in areas adjacent to Bonobo habitat as well as urban centres, such as Kinshasa or Kisangani, where demand for bushmeat is high. For example, Lola ya Bonobo in Kinshasa welcomes more than 20,000 visitors per annum, half of them school children. Such education-outreach activities can influence local attitudes to wildlife (ABC 2014).</li><li><strong>Research and monitoring activities.&#160;</strong>The primary objective here is to develop a clear framework for monitoring Bonobo populations and the threats to Bonobos, which is necessary to track changes in population size and distribution, to assess the level and location of threats, and ultimately to assess progress towards the Goal and Vision of the 2012 conservation strategy. The Central Africa Forest Ecosystems Conservation (CAFEC) project, and the SCAEMPS programme (Strengthening Central Africa Environmental Management and Policy Support) were established under CARPE. CAFEC supports the sustainable management of targeted forest landscapes, which include most of the landscapes where Bonobos occur, and involves targeted, site-based activities. SCAEMPS is a regional ‘quality control’ programme, ensuring that standardised, state of the art methods of monitoring wildlife, law enforcement (such as SMART&#160;<a href=""http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org/"">http://www.smartconservationsoftware.org</a>), and livelihoods and governance are used across CARPE landscapes, and that databases are established to store the data collected. Supported by CARPE and other donors, ICCN and international NGOs have implemented surveys in about 40% of SNP. A three-year co-management agreement for the future monitoring and management of SNP was signed in 2015, focusing on the education, training and support of guards. Development of cost-efficient methods for biomonitoring (camera traps, drones) is underway. Development of a disease prevention plan to minimise human-Bonobo disease transmission, and establish an early detection mechanism and an emergency intervention plan to address potentially catastrophic disease outbreaks is not yet underway.</li><li><strong>Sustainable funding.&#160;</strong>Here, the objective is to evaluate funding needs for Bonobo conservation and create sustainable sources of funding. In the last 10 years,&#160;government donors (EU, KfW, USAID) have provided considerable conservation finance to support biodiversity conservation, park management, education or other developmental aid, rather than species-specific activities.&#160;While Bonobos will benefit from general support, a number of smaller donors (Arcus Foundation, Beneficia Foundation, USFWS, zoological gardens) are sponsoring the smaller NGOs and distinct projects focused on Bonobo conservation. Monetary support has slowly increased over time; however, the extent to which Bonobo populations outside protected areas is benefitting needs to be assessed. Fortunately, the Bonobo population does not need to be reinforced with individuals bred in captivity. In 2009 and 2011, Lola ya Bonobo, where intake rates and breeding have led to spatial constraints, released rehabilitated Bonobos back into the wild. The released individuals adapted easily to their new environment, became fully independent and reproduced successfully. Despite this success and the repopulation of a small area of former Bonobo habitat, reintroduction of great apes is controversial and often viewed as a mechanism for managing sanctuary populations (ABC 2014, C. André pers. comm.).

115130419,15951,Panthera leo,Vulnerable,A2abcd,2016,2014-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>  </p>The Lion population is inferred to have undergone a reduction of approximately 43% over the past 21 years (approximately three Lion generations, 1993-2014).<br/><br/>We infer a decline of 43% based on time trend analysis of census data for 47 relatively well monitored Lion subpopulations. These subpopulations approximately totalled an estimated 7,500 Lions in 2014 and comprise a substantial portion of the total species population, so that we feel confident in applying observed trends to the species as a whole as well as on a regional basis.<br/><br/>The overall classification of the Lion as Vulnerable masks a dichotomy: we observe that sample Lion subpopulations increased by 12% in four southern African countries (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) and in India, while an observed decline of 60% in sample subpopulations outside these countries is inferred for the remainder of its African range. In other words, in the majority of its range the Lion meets the A2 criterion for Endangered with the inferred rate of decline over 50% in three generations, but this trend is numerically mitigated by a small number of subpopulations in a restricted geographical range.<br/><br/>This dichotomy is reflected in listings of the species in different Red Lists: in South Africa, the Lion will be categorized as Least Concern on the national Red List in preparation (Child <em>et al</em>. In prep.), whereas in India it is Endangered (as subspecies <em>P. l. persica</em> on the global IUCN Red List: Breitenmoser <em>et al</em>. 2008) and in the region of West Africa meets the criteria for Critically Endangered (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2015).&#160; The range state list in Table 1 (attached Supporting Material) further illustrates the high threat levels across the species’ broad geographic range, as Lions have been recently extirpated in 12 African countries and we suspect possible recent extirpation in another four.<br/><br/>Among the causes of decline, the most important are indiscriminate killing in defence of human life and livestock, habitat loss, and prey base depletion. Prey base depletion is partly linked to habitat loss, but more importantly to poaching and bushmeat trade (Becker <em>et al</em>. 2013). An emerging threat is trade in bones and other body parts for traditional medicine, both within Africa and in Asia (IUCN 2006a, b; Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, although trophy hunting contributes positively to Lion conservation, improvements in management practices have been recommended (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2013, Edwards<em> et al</em>. 2014), as when poorly regulated, it also contributes to population declines (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Croes <em>et al</em>. 2011, Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014). While attention is currently focused on Lion hunting reforms to ensure sustainability, the leading causes of population decline are more difficult to address and are likely to continue. The observed and inferred reductions are based on direct observation; appropriate indices of abundance; declines in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and habitat quality; and actual and potential levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>Several subpopulations have been stable, among them the only remaining subpopulation in Asia (surviving in the Gir Forest area of Gujarat, India) and several subpopulations in southern Africa. Subpopulations appear to be stable where management is properly funded; fencing is one of several effective conservation management techniques (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, many Lion subpopulations occur in areas where management budgets are low, leading to local decline and even extinction, for example in West Africa (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160; Little is known about Lion subpopulations in Angola, Central African Republic and South Sudan, but we fear drastic declines especially for the latter two.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we assess the Lion as Vulnerable based on criterion A, more specifically A2abcd. Lion range and abundance exceed the Vulnerable thresholds for criteria B, C and D, respectively, so these criteria do not contribute to the present assessment, whilst criterion E was not applied. Vulnerable A2abcd is the same listing as the previous assessment but with a different underlying method. Previous assessments were based on a suspected decline of the total estimated number of Lions, which necessarily included low quality data. In the present assessment we did not use total Lion estimates, because we had a better alternative. We now have enough good quality data for a representative sub-set of Lion subpopulations to calculate an observed decline, from which we infer a decline for the species as a whole.<br/><p>  </p>","The Lion has a broad habitat tolerance, absent only from tropical rainforest and the interior of the Sahara desert (Nowell and Jackson 1996). There are records of Lion to elevations of more than 4,000 m in the Bale Mountains and on Kilimanjaro (West and Packer 2013). Although Lions drink regularly when water is available, they are capable of obtaining their moisture requirements from prey and even plants (such as the tsama melon in the Kalahari desert), and thus can survive in very arid environments. Medium- to large-sized ungulates (including antelopes, zebra and wildebeest) are the bulk of their prey, but Lions will take almost any animal, from rodents to a rhino. They also scavenge, displacing other predators (such as the Spotted Hyaena) from their kills.<br/><br/>Lions are the most social of the cats, with related females remaining together in prides, and related and unrelated males forming coalitions competing for tenure over prides. Average pride size (including males and females) is four to six adults; prides generally break into smaller groups when hunting. Lions tend to live at higher densities than most other felids, but with a wide variation from 1.5 adults per 100 km² in southern African semi-desert to 55/100 km² in parts of the Serengeti (Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Pride ranges can vary widely even in the same region: e.g., from 266-4,532 km² in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of South Africa (Funston 2001).<br/><br/>In India, the habitat of the Asiatic Lion is dry deciduous forest. The Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by cultivated areas and inhabited by the pastoralist Maldharis and their livestock (Meena <em>et al</em>. 2014). Domestic cattle have historically been a major part of the Asiatic Lion's diet, although the most common prey is the Chital Deer. Mean pride size, measured by the number of adult females, tends to be smaller than for African Lions: most Gir prides contain an average of two adult females (Nowell and Jackson 1996).","<p>The main threats to Lions are indiscriminate killing (primarily as a result of retaliatory or pre-emptive killing to protect human life and livestock) and prey base depletion. Habitat loss and conversion has led to a number of subpopulations becoming small and isolated (Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2008). Furthermore, trophy hunting has a net positive impact in a some areas, but may have at times contributed to population declines in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011, 2013), Cameroon (Croes <em>et al.</em> 2011) and Zambia (Rosenblatt <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Conflict</strong><br/>The economic impact of stock raiding can be significant: Patterson <em>et al</em>. (2004) estimated that each Lion costs ranchers in Kenya living alongside Tsavo East National Park US$290 per year in livestock losses. Likewise, annual losses of cattle to Lions in areas adjacent to Waza National Park in Cameroon comprised only about 3.1% of all livestock losses, but were estimated to represent more than 22% of financial losses amounting to about US$370 per owner (Bauer 2003). Consequently, Lions are persecuted intensely in livestock areas across Africa; their scavenging behaviour makes them particularly vulnerable to poisoned carcasses put out to eliminate predators. Little actual information exists on the number of Lions killed as problem animals by local people, even though this is considered the primary threat to their survival outside protected areas. Implementation of appropriate livestock management measures, coupled with problem animal control measures and mechanisms for compensating livestock losses, are some of the primary responses to resolving human-Lion conflict (Frank <em>et al</em>. 2006, Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hazzah <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Prey depletion</strong><br/>Lion population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Lion prey species; large wild herbivores (Van Orsdol <em>et al</em>. 1985, Hayward <em>et al</em>. 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Regional Lion population trends reported in this assessment, are closely mirrored by time series data on main Lion prey species from 78 herbivore populations monitored between 1970 and 2005 in West, Eastern and Southern Africa; while herbivore population sizes increased by 24% in Southern Africa, they declined by 52% in Eastern Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Use of Lion bones and body parts and derivatives for traditional medicine</strong><br/>Illegal trade in Lion body parts for medicinal purposes is considered a threat to African Lion subpopulations (according to the regional Lion conservation strategies, which call on countries to prohibit [IUCN 2006a] and control [IUCN 2006b] trade in Lion bone and other parts and products) as well as to the small subpopulation in India's Gir Forest (M. Ventraman pers. comm. 2014). In West and Central Africa, Sogbohossou (2006) found many reported uses for Lion skins and bone in Benin (with fat and bones being most commonly utilized: N'Diaye 2014), and a survey carried out around Nigeria's Yankari National Park found more than 22 Lion parts considered to be of medicinal value, with most of the over 200 interviewees saying they had used Lion parts in the past, and half within the past three years (Born Free Foundation 2008). The widespread prevalence of fakes in the traditional medicinal market is indicative of a continued demand. While fakes may replace items in the market that otherwise would be illegally sourced from the wild, they could perpetuate demand and poaching when consumers aspire to the genuine wild item rather than making a conscious choice of an (often cheaper) alternative (Nowell 2014).<br/><br/>There appears to be increasing interest in the use of African Lion bone in Asia. There is no history of Lion bone being used in traditional medicine there, but China has permitted the use of bones from captive Lions to make medicinal wines traditionally containing Tiger bone. South Africa has reported the export of large quantities of Lion bone sourced from captive animals to China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. Legal international trade in bone reported as from captive-bred Lions could serve as a cover for illegally wild-sourced Lion (and other big cat) parts (Nowell and Pevushina 2014). There is also concern that wild Lion parts from eastern and Southern Africa could be drawn into the large illegal wildlife trade to Asia centred around elephant ivory.<br/><br/><strong>Trophy hunting</strong><br/>Trophy hunting is carried out in a number of sub-Saharan African countries and is considered an important management tool for conserving wild land providing financial resource for Lion conservation for both governments and local communities. However, there is concern that management regimes have not always been sufficient to deter unsustainable offtakes (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2006). A sustainable offtake level of one male lion per 2,000 km² has been recommended (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011), but offtake has been higher in many areas, which suggests that it is potentially a threat (Lindsey <em>et al</em>. 2013b). Trophy hunting can thus be a tool for conservation but also a threat, depending on how it is regulated and managed (Whitman <em>et al</em>. 2004, Loveridge <em>et al</em>. 2007, Packer <em>et al</em>. 2011). Hunter<em> et al</em>. (2013) cautioned that regulatory measures which reduce the profitability of Lion trophy hunting could have widespread negative impacts for wildlife-based land use, anti-poaching and tolerance of Lion outside protected areas.<br/><br/><strong>Other</strong><br/>Disease has also been a threat to Lion subpopulations (Munson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Trinkel <em>et al</em>. 2011). In parts of southeastern Tanzania there have been alarmingly high incidences of people killed by Lions, with up to 400 human Lion-related fatalities recorded from 1997-2007 (Ikanda and Packer 2007).<br/></p>","<p><strong>Population Trend</strong><br/>This assessment is based on a time trend analysis of census data from relatively well-studied Lion subpopulations (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013, plus additional unpublished data provided by contributors). Census estimates were obtained by scientific research methods including total count, individual identifications, total or sample inventory using calling stations, radio telemetry, photo databases, spoor counts and density estimates based on direct observations corrected for patrol effort.&#160;These methods are rated as producing the most reliable type of Lion population estimates by background papers for the 2006 IUCN regional Lion workshops (Table 5 in Bauer <em>et al.</em> 2005a, b).&#160;We did not include population estimates for sites which were based on extrapolation of Lion densities obtained by research in other areas, or informed guesstimates by researchers. The minimum number of census surveys per site over the assessment time period is two, but some sites have been more regularly monitored (Table 3 - Data Points column, in Supplementary Material).&#160;In some cases census methodology varied between years, and for some surveys accuracy may have been low, but the complete data set shows an obvious trend that is unlikely to be an artefact of methodological insufficiencies.<br/><br/>IUCN Red List Criteria define three generations as the relevant time span for trend assessment. Lion Generation Length (GL) is based on the formulation of Pacifici <em>et al</em>. (2013):</p><p><br/>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; GL = R<sub>span</sub>*z +AFR</p><p>Where AFR = Age of first reproduction = 3.5 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; R<sub>span</sub> = 15.5 (the age when 95% of females are no longer reproductive) - AFR = 12 yrs (Packer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Z = 0.29 (a constant “depending on survivorship and relative fecundity of young vs. old individuals in the population” (IUCN 2014), calculated as the slope of the linear regression between GL and Rspan for 221 mammalian species (Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013)</p><p>Thus GL = 12*0.29 +3.5 = 6.98 yrs<br/><br/>To fill gaps between censuses conducted in non-consecutive years, we interpolated population sizes, assuming a linear change between years. For surveys conducted for only a few years between 1993 and 2014, we extrapolated to the beginning and end points based on an exponential rate of change taken from the observed growth rate for each respective subpopulation. However, all extrapolations are capped by the estimated carrying capacity for each reserve so that subpopulations that experienced dramatic population change were not assumed to have been at implausibly high totals in either 1993 or 2014. Subpopulations were first categorized according to whether or not the reserves were surrounded by a fence; unfenced subpopulations were further categorized according to geographical location with the exception of Niassa Reserve (Mozambique), treated as an outlier as discussed below.<br/><br/>In graph form (Figures 1-4 in the Supplementary Material) we summarize the repeated censuses of 46 different African Lion subpopulations using all available repeat-survey data. Figure 5 (in the Supplementary Material) addresses the 47th Lion subpopulation in our analysis, the only Asian subpopulation.<br/><br/>Outside parts of southern Africa, Lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62% between 1993 and 2014 (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).&#160; Although these totals only included about 4,600 Lions in the year 1993, several surveyed areas are restricted to the best-protected portions of much larger ecosystems (e.g., the phototourism areas of Selous and Serengeti).<br/><br/>In contrast, the total number of Lions in six unfenced reserves in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe only declined by about 11% (Figure 2, Supplementary Material). Note that the overall stability in southern Africa masks considerable heterogeneity: between 1993 and 2014 the monitored Lion subpopulation in a portion of the Okavango ecosystem is estimated to have declined by 46%, whereas the much smaller subpopulations in Gonarezhou and Kunene have increased dramatically.<br/><br/>The striking contrast between these three countries in southern Africa and the rest of the continent is probably related to the equally striking differences in human population densities (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013) in Namibia (2.5/km²), Botswana (3.4) and Zimbabwe (26) vs. Benin (78), Burkina Faso (57), Cameroon (40), Cote d’Ivoire (64), Ghana (102), Kenya (67), Nigeria (189), Rwanda (420), Senegal (68), Tanzania (48), Uganda (137) and Zambia (45).<br/><br/>The unfenced Niassa subpopulation is estimated to have increased by over 250% since 1993 (Figure 3, Supplementary Material); despite severe bushmeat poaching the Lions are still recovering from excessive prey depletion during civil war. In addition, on a shorter time scale, Lions have benefited from extensive ivory poaching, which has provided them with sizeable quantities of elephant meat (Colleen Begg pers. comm. 2014). Human population density in Mozambique is 74/km² with sizeable numbers of people living inside Niassa Reserve, so unless management is further strengthened, this unfenced Lion subpopulation may soon experience declining food supplies and increased human-lion conflicts. These arguments strongly suggest that the ‘boom’ in the Niassa Lion subpopulation has stopped and is unlikely to be repeated in the future. We therefore consider Niassa to be a special case and treat it as an outlier in our analyses, we believe that this offers a better understanding of trends, but we note that this does not alter the assessment (with Niassa included, the assessment would still be Vulnerable A2abcd).<br/><br/>The 16 fenced African subpopulations (10 in South Africa, and all but one in southern Africa) have grown by 29% since 1993, most having already reached their presumed carrying capacities by 2013 (Figure 4, Supplementary Material). Note that although these numbers now total over 3,226 lions, our data come from the great majority of fenced reserves in Africa and that little further growth can be expected in these subpopulations.<br/><br/>Asia is home to a single contiguous subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat (Figure 5, Supplementary Material). While the population has stabilized inside the Gir Reserve, the so-called “satellite” population in the surrounding countryside has expanded by ~400% in the past 21 years.<br/><br/>The 47 sample Lion subpopulations totalled an estimated 9,615 lions in 1993 (excluding Niassa, which is treated as an outlier as described above); that number shrank by 22% to 7,455 lions in 2014 (Table 2, Supplementary Material).&#160; However, as described above, there are significant regional differences evident in population trend, and we use these to inform our inferences about population trend for the species as a whole. Table 2 (Supplementary Material) groups the sample subpopulations by region in Africa, following the IUCN (2006a, b) regional Lion conservation strategies, but combining West and Central Africa due to a small sample size for Central Africa.&#160; In Southern Africa, the sample population grew by 8%, while in sharp contrast, sample populations declined by 59% in Eastern Africa and 66% in West and Central Africa.<br/><br/>Table 3 (Supplementary Material) shows the estimated Lion population size in 1993 and 2014 for each of the 47 sample subpopulations with percentage change, and it can be seen that most countries had a declining trend for sample Lion subpopulations, with only four countries (India, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe) seeing a growth trend. Table 4 (Supplementary Material) groups these countries with Botswana, which had a relatively low average rate of decline for its sample populations; two out of three sample subpopulations increased; the decline documented in the Okavango subpopulation was restricted to only part of the protected area; and overall 2012 estimates for the national population suggest that it his increased since 2003 (C. Winterbach unpubl. data). Mozambique is not included in this group as the increasing trend in its Niassa subpopulation is treated as an outlier in this analysis. The sample Lion population in five countries (Botswana, India, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe) grew by an estimated 12%, whereas the Lion population in the remaining African range countries declined by an estimated 61% (Table 4, Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>We infer population trend for the total Lion species population based on these two rates of change, as follows. In 2002, two separate country compilations of population estimates for Lions in Africa estimated the number of Lions in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to comprise between 1/4 to 1/3 of the total African Lion population, as shown in Table 5 (Supplementary Material). We suspect that this proportion was somewhat lower in 1993, given that the number of Lions is inferred to have increased in these countries while decreasing in the remainder, and use a figure of 1/4 or 25% for our species population trend calculation. If 25% of the Lion population increased by 12%, and 75% decreased by 60%, this results in an inferred trend of (0.75*-60%) + (0.25*12%) = -43% between 1993 and 2014 (Table 6, Supplementary Material).</p><br/>This qualifies the Lion as Vulnerable, but it is of great concern that the vast majority of the population is inferred to have declined at a rate that meets the criteria for Endangered. Since our sample subpopulations were all monitored, we suspect an even greater average rate of decline for unmonitored unfenced subpopulations across much of Africa, since lack of monitoring could suggest lack of conservation effort.<br/><br/><strong>Abundance</strong><br/>For this assessment, we do not aim to provide a new estimate of total Lion numbers, we present no new data. A recent paper summarized and updated efforts to estimate the population size of the African Lion leading to the most recent estimate of 32,000 lions in 67 Lion areas (Riggio <em>et al</em>. 2013). The paper presents some recent data, but where no new data were available it included unaltered numbers from earlier sources, such as Bauer and Van der Merwe (2004) and Chardonnet (2002). As a consequence, Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) include numbers from 2002 and 2004 for areas where we believe the downward trend described above occurred. We therefore consider these sources to be insufficiently precautionary for our purpose and feel that an assessment on numbers is less robust than our assessment based on trends. Considering the difficulty in interpreting Lion numbers and the availability of an alternative (see above), we decided not to use total Lion numbers for the present assessment<br/><br/>However, we do attempt to correct for outdated sources in the Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) estimate by application of the regional trends we found (Table 3, Supplementary Material) to the 2002 population size estimates within the respective regions (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004, Chardonnet 2002). These are two largely independent and reasonably comprehensive sets of estimated numbers that were coherent in time. Rather than presenting these numbers as in any way current, we look at how they might be expected to have changed.&#160;We calculated estimated present Lion numbers per region (Table 7, Supplementary Material) by applying the observed trend over the subsequent 12 years, except that numbers for West Africa were taken from a comprehensive recent survey (Henschel <em>et al</em>. 2014) because of their greater precision. As a small modification from Chardonnet (2002) we moved the estimate for Selous ecosystem to Eastern Africa to be consistent with the regional divisions used here. The two 2002 estimates were compared in detail (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2005a,b), showing the ALWG study (Bauer and Van der Merwe 2004) was more conservative and stricter on data quality. Most notably, Bauer and Van Der Merwe (2004) lacked data for Ruaha and Tarangire which may hold close to 5,000 Lions. With all these considerations, we have greater confidence in an estimate of closer to 20,000 Lions in Africa than in a number over 30,000.<br/><br/><strong>Approach to Uncertainty&#160;</strong>We do not have sufficient confidence in earlier or recent species population estimates to employ them to estimate trend and for this assessment have used groupings of scientific time series site estimates as a proxy. &#160;Although these data are more numerous for Lions than for other big <em>Panthera </em>cats, there is still considerable uncertainty inherent in both the data (Bauer <em>et al</em>. 2015) and our treatment of it to estimate species population trend. Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2014) state that, ""All attitudes (towards uncertainty) should be explicitly documented. &#160;In situations where the spread of plausible values (after excluding extreme or unlikely values) qualifies a taxon for two or more categories of threat, the precautionary approach would recommend that the taxon be listed under the higher (more threatened) category.""&#160;<br/>As noted in Table 2 (see Supplementary Material), if the species trend is inferred directly from the total sample population trend, the result, a decline of 22%, would qualify the species as Near Threatened rather than Vulnerable. However, considering the demonstrated significant regional differences such an approach would be inappropriate.&#160;<br/>We treated Mozambique's Niassa subpopulation trend as an outlier and removed it from our trend analysis for reasons described above, but we also documented the effect of the exclusion. Some contributors proposed a second outlier: Tanzania’s Katavi subpopulation. Katavi has been consistently and repeatedly monitored, but the survey methodology was imprecise (vehicle transects: Caro 2011), this yielded a significant decline rate approaching 100% in a large population of over 1,100 estimated lions in the study site portion of the park in 1993 (Table 3). If Katavi would have been treated as an outlier and excluded from the analysis, inferred rate of decline would be 33%, and the rate of decline for Lions in East Africa would be 37%. Lions are still extant in Katavi (as shown in our map), although well below carrying capacity (Kiffner <em>et al.</em> 2008). Rather than using an arbitrary low value, we used the value documented by surveys (zero); Lions are extant but at a density so low as not to be detected. While the methodology is imprecise, it has proved reliable for carnivore monitoring in the Serengeti (Durant <em>et al</em>. 2011). Furthermore, the extent of decline may have been measured with lack of precision, but population decline remains uncontested. Since it is one of only two long-term monitoring programmes in Tanzania (Caro 2011) we decided that it was important to include these data and decided that there was insufficient ground to treat it as an outlier.<br/>Another uncertainty that needs to be documented is our treatment of small fenced reserves in southern Africa. Most of the population increases have occurred in these areas where intensive management practices include translocations, stocking, contraception and euthanasia. Such management is atypical, and as pointed out by Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) the Red List Guidelines are ambiguous as to the inclusion or exclusion of fenced areas. Their exclusion from the analysis would raise the inferred Lion decline rate to 49%. Following through on our supposition that unmonitored Lion populations have undergone an even higher rate than our monitored sample, this could potentially have been interpreted as a suspected rate of decline over 50%, qualifying the Lion as Endangered. However, we did not exclude fenced populations from our assessment. Hayward <em>et al</em>. (2015) state that such decisions should consider the ‘type, scale, frequency and effects of the suite of management interventions’ and could be taxon specific. We consider that management of Lions in the concerned areas aims to mimic natural processes, aims to retain adaptive potential and follows a meta-population management approach. We further consider that fences have been documented as effective tools in Lion conservation (Packer<em> et al</em>. 2013). We find this sufficient justification for inclusion of these reserves.<br/>National estimated rates of population change are most meaningful in practice, and these are given in Table 3 in the Supplementary Material. &#160;We did not use national rates to gauge species decline, as the sample sizes are generally small and estimates of national Lion populations imprecise.",Decreasing,"Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the Lion formerly ranged from Northern Africa through Southwest Asia (where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years), west into Europe, where it apparently became extinct almost 2,000 years ago, and east into India (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). Today, the only remainder of this once widespread northern population is a single isolated subpopulation in the 1,400 km² Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. Lions are extinct in North Africa, having perhaps survived in the High Atlas Mountains up to the 1940s (Nowell and Jackson 1996, West and Packer 2013).<br/><br/>Lions are found in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The last assessment of extant Lion range is provided by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013); they identified 67 Lion areas comprising 3.4 million km², which is 17% of historical range or about 25% of savanna Africa. We took those layers as a starting point, but made a few modifications to reflect the cautionary approach used by the IUCN Red List. Like with population numbers (see Population section), Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013) copied old layers in the absence of new information. <em>De facto</em>, this means that large swathes of land are classified as Lion range based on the group exercises led by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group; they found 86 Lion Conservation Units (LCUs) covering 4.6 million km² or 22% of historical range (IUCN 2006a,b; Bauer 2008). Henschel <em>et al</em>. (2010, 2014) found that many of these LCUs in West and Central Africa no longer contained Lions, and the range map was adapted accordingly for this assessment. Similarly, the survey and mapping unit at Panthera conducted further range updates based on new survey results and other properly documented information from other regions. Furthermore, some of the mapped LCUs are located in areas where armed conflict may have had an impact on lion persistence (e.g. Central African Republic and South Sudan). Until proof of the contrary, and based on the lack of recent data to confirm Lion presence, we therefore classified such areas as Possibly Extinct but maintained Protected Areas inside them as Lion range (including many large hunting concessions, such as in the Central African Republic). Some of the areas currently mapped as Possibly Extinct could contain relict Lion subpopulations, and should be prioritized for field surveys aimed at establishing Lion status.<br/><br/>Areas where we consider Lion populations Possibly Extinct total 1,811,087 km², over half (52%) of the range classified as extant by Riggio <em>et al</em>. (2013). We estimate extant Lion range, areas where we are reasonably confident that lions persist, based on recent records, at 1,654,375 km², or 8% of historical range. This range reduction reflects a combination of recent known and inferred decline, as well as improved knowledge.",For information on Use and Trade see under Threats.,Terrestrial,"Since 1975 <em>Panthera leo</em> has been included in CITES Appendix II, and&#160; the Endangered Asiatic Lion subspecies <em>P. leo persica</em> in CITES Appendix I. CITES listing of the Lion is currently undergoing a Periodic Review process to evaluate whether this accurately reflects the present situation, with a final recommendation of the Animals Committee expected at its 28th meeting in 2015. The Animals Committee also noted recent information regarding possible changes in the nomenclature of Lions and requests its nomenclature expert to&#160; review this information (CITES AC27 WG8). <br/><br/>In Africa, Lions are present in a number of large and well-managed protected areas, and remain one of the most popular animals on the must-see lists of tourists and visitors to Africa. Most range states in East and Southern Africa have an infrastructure which supports wildlife tourism, and in this way Lions generate significant cash revenue for park management and local communities and provide a strong incentive for wildland conservation.<br/><br/>Regional conservation strategies have been developed for Lions in West and Central Africa (IUCN 2006a) and Eastern and Southern Africa (IUCN 2006b). By setting out common priorities to guide action on both national, community and landscape levels, the regional conservation strategies have the potential for broad and significant improvement of Lion status and management (Nowell <em>et al</em>. 2006). These regional strategies have been used in many countries to develop Lion Conservation Action Plans. While all these documents show awareness of the threats and recognition of solutions, the continued decline in Lion range and numbers show that political priority and funding are not sufficient (Packer <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em></em>",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Numbers are considered to be in decline in much of the range, as a result of hunting, overgrazing, and outbreaks of rinderpest. In some other areas, bush encroachment has increased the amount of suitable habitat, and local range expansion and population increases have been reported. Nevertheless, the level of decline is suspected to have reached at least 20% over a period of 13 years (three generations), so approaching the threshold for Vulnerable under criterion A2cde. The Lesser Kudu will probably persist in the arid scrublands of northeastern Africa, as long as human and livestock densities remain relatively low in extensive parts of its range such as northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia. It nevertheless faces a continuing, long-term population decline as meat hunting and pastoralism increase within its remaining range. Its status may eventually decline to threatened.","The Lesser Kudu is closely associated with <em>Acacia-Commiphora</em> thornbush in semi-arid areas of north-eastern Africa; it generally avoids open spaces and long grass (East 1999, Leuthold 2013). They are largely confined to lowland areas up to 1,200 m (Stewart and Stewart 1963) but have been recorded at about 1,740 m near Mt Kilimanjaro (Grimshaw <em>et al.</em> 1995). The Lesser Kudu is primarily a browser, consuming mainly leaves of trees, shrubs and herbs (Leuthold 2013).","Its shyness and preference for thick cover enable it to withstand considerable hunting pressure, e.g., it is relatively plentiful throughout the Ogaden region wherever there is sufficient dense bush, despite widespread, uncontrolled hunting by local people (East 1999). On the other hand, its susceptibility to rinderpest resulted in a substantial decrease in its numbers in eastern regions of Kenya during the mid-1990s. These populations can be expected to recover following the subsidence of this rinderpest outbreak. There are relatively few parts of the Lesser Kudu’s range where protection against poaching reaches moderate levels or better, and eradication of rinderpest from cattle would be a major step towards reducing current pressures on its populations (East 1999).","Citing various authors, East (1999) indicated that population estimates based on recent aerial surveys are available for considerable areas of the Lesser Kudu’s range, but aerial surveys substantially underestimate this species’ true numbers. In addition, its populations are unknown in the remainder of its range. The sum of available estimates, about 22,000, is therefore probably a significant underestimate of the species’ actual total numbers. Correcting for under-counting bias in aerial surveys, East (1999) produced a total population estimate of 118,000. East (1999) suggests local densities of 0.5-3/km².&#160;Despite the species’ ability to persist in the face of uncontrolled meat hunting, its numbers are probably in gradual decline over extensive areas of its range as human settlement expands. There are however reports from some sites of increasing numbers as bush expands following extirpation of elephants.",Decreasing,"The Lesser Kudu occupies semi-arid areas of north-eastern Africa, commonly known as the Somali-Masai Arid Zone, in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. Its range extends from <em>ca</em> 12°N in the Awash area of Ethiopia southward through southern Ethiopia, much of Somalia except the northeast (i.e., east of 46°E and north of 08°N), most of Kenya except the southwest, extreme southeast Sudan, extreme northeast Uganda to northeast and central Tanzania (Leuthold 2013). It is probably extinct in Djibouti.<br/><br/>Two records of this species in Arabia (Harrison and Bates 1991) are based on sets of horns, one obtained in Saudi Arabia and the other in Yemen. No live animals have ever been reported from the region, there is no local word for the species, which is highly distinctive, and the import of horns and of live animals is common in the region.","Lesser Kudu are subject to meat hunting and trophy hunting for skins or horns (Leuthold 2013). Funaioli and Simonetta (1966) mention up to 20,000 skins having been sold in a single year in Somalia, with an average of 11,000 per year between 1952 and 1963, almost all as a result of poaching.",Terrestrial,"About one-third of the estimated total population occurs in protected areas.

The Common Eland’s Red List status will not change as long as substantial, stable populations continue to occur in a good number of protected areas and it remains a popular and economically significant species on private land. The requirement for large areas to accommodate its seasonal wanderings is likely to result in further contraction of the distribution and numbers of free-ranging populations as human settlement expands. This may be at least partly compensated for by the continued growth of its numbers on private farms and conservancies.","Common Elands are one of the most adaptable ruminants, inhabiting sub-desert, acacia savannah, miombo woodland, and alpine moorlands to 4,900 m (Grimshaw <em>et al. </em>1995, Thouless 2013).

This region was the epicentre of Africa's ""world war"", to which Gorillas have also fallen victim. The Mountain Gorilla subspecies (<em>Gorilla beringei beringei</em>), was listed as Critically Endangered since 1996. Although a drastic reduction of the Grauer’s Gorilla subspecies (<em>Gorilla beringei graueri</em>), has long been suspected, quantitative evidence of the decline has been lacking (Robbins and Williamson 2008). During the past 20 years, Grauer’s Gorillas have been severely affected by human activities, most notably poaching for bushmeat associated with artisanal mining camps and for commercial trade (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). This illegal hunting has been facilitated by a proliferation of firearms resulting from widespread insecurity in the region. Previously estimated to number around 16,900 individuals, recent surveys show that Grauer’s Gorilla numbers have dropped to only 3,800 individuals – a 77% reduction in just one generation (<em>ibid</em>.) This rate of population loss is almost three times above that which qualifies a species as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/>Mountain Gorillas have been faring substantially better; one of the two subpopulations is recovering from an all-time low in the 1980s, making Mountain Gorillas the only great ape taxon that has been increasing in number (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2013). A 2015–2016, survey of the Virunga population has confirmed that it is still growing and has now increased to over 600 individuals, bringing the total population to roughly 1,000 (Hickey&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Grauer's Gorillas continue to decline at an average rate of 5% per year (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Even with the growth of the Mountain Gorilla subspecies, the overall decline of the Eastern Gorilla species is expected to exceed 80% over three generations due to the high levels of poaching, loss of habitat as human populations expand, and civil unrest and lawlessness in parts of this species’ geographic range. If unabated, in 2054, only 14% of the 1994 population will remain. Therefore, Eastern Gorillas qualify as Critically Endangered under criterion A (A4bcd).","Grauer's Gorillas range between 600 and 2,900 m asl in dense mature and secondary lowland tropical rainforest through transitional forests to Afromontane habitat, including bamboo forest, swamp and peat bog. Mountain Gorillas are restricted to elevations above 1,400 m in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and above 1,850 m in the Virungas by human occupation at lower levels. Their habitat includes many Afromontane vegetation types, including bamboo forest, mixed forest, and subalpine grassland on the volcanic peaks. The Bwindi Mountain Gorillas live at lower elevations, in forest characterised by steep slopes of predominantly mixed forest habitat with a dense understorey.<br/><br/>Diets of Eastern Gorillas vary greatly with elevation and its effect on food availability. Mountain Gorillas are largely herbivorous and feed on stems, pith, leaves, bark, and occasionally ants. Their favoured food items are wild celery, thistles, nettles, bedstraw, wood and roots. Both subspecies feed almost exclusively on young bamboo shoots when they are in season twice a year. Gorillas at lower elevations have a more diverse and seasonal diet. Both Grauer’s Gorillas in lowland forest and Bwindi Gorillas are frugivorous.<br/><br/>Eastern Gorillas are diurnal and semi-terrestrial. After waking, they feed intensively and then alternate rest, travelling and feeding until night-time. All Gorillas build nests to sleep in, some in trees, but the majority of their nests are on the ground. Gorillas are not territorial, and there is extensive overlap between the annual home ranges of different groups, which vary in size from 6–40 km². Eastern Gorilla groups are polygynous or polygynandrous, with one or more adult males, several females, their offspring, and immature relatives forming the core of relatively stable groups. Median group size is 10 weaned individuals; maximum observed group size is 65 individuals.<br/><br/><u><strong>Life History</strong></u> (as summarised in Williamson and Butynski 2013)<br/>Male Eastern Gorillas are capable of reproducing when they become “blackbacks” at 8-12 years of age. They are considered “silverbacks” at 12 years of age, and reach their full adult size at 15 years. Female menarche occurs at 6-7 years of age, followed by a period of adolescent sterility. Average age of first parturition is 9.9 years. Females have a reproductive cycle of <em>ca</em> 28 days and are receptive for 1-4 days around the time of ovulation. They experience lactational amenorrhea while suckling infants. Young are weaned at 3-4 years of age, from which point they no longer travel on their mothers’ back. Females give birth every 3-4 years and generally produce 3-4 surviving offspring during their reproductive life span. Maximum life span is unknown, but it is certainly over 40 years. Eastern Gorillas have a generation time of 18.2 years for females and 20.4 years for males (Langergraber <em>et al</em>. 2012).","Major threats to Eastern Gorillas are:<br/><ol><li><strong><u>Poaching</u> </strong>- Despite the fact that all killing, capture or consumption of great apes is illegal, hunting represents the greatest threat to Grauer’s Gorillas (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). A high demand for bushmeat stems from the growing human population, the destabilising impact of armed groups, artisanal miners in remote areas and a general scarcity of affordable domestic protein in rural areas. The permanent presence of people who provide the workforce for exploitation of natural resources also constitutes a major factor in this problem. Miners working in national parks have admitted to poaching Gorillas, which are relatively easy to hunt with guns and provide large quantities of meat (Kirkby <em>et al</em>. 2015). Illegal capture of live infants is a secondary threat (after the mother has been killed and eaten), except on occasions when Mountain Gorilla infants have been the principle target, fulfilling the demands of a fictitious, international market. These orphans usually die or are seized by the wildlife authorities.</li><li><strong><u>Habitat loss and degradation</u></strong> - Agricultural and pastoral activities are leading to continued loss and fragmentation of Gorilla habitat in DRC. At present, there is no commercial logging in the Eastern Gorilla’s range, but there is continuous artisanal extraction of resources, which puts added stress on natural habitats. Illegal mining has decimated the lowlands of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, a Grauer’s Gorilla stronghold. Destruction of forest for timber, charcoal production and agriculture continues to threaten the isolated Gorilla populations that persist in North Kivu and the Itombwe Massif.</li><li><u><strong>Civil unrest</strong></u> - For two decades, refugees, internally-displaced people and numerous armed groups have placed enormous pressure on DRC’s forests through uncontrolled habitat conversion for farmland, harvesting of firewood, timber extraction and mining. Ongoing political unrest and military activity, including rebel occupation of national parks have compounded other threats (Yamagiwa 2003, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). A recent survey identified 69 armed groups operating in North and South Kivu (Stearns &amp; Vogel 2015), covering important portions of remaining Grauer’s Gorilla range. Armed conflict and the collapse of law and order in DRC brought a significant rise in the illegal circulation of military weapons and ammunition. Former traditional hunters have obtained guns, notably AK47s, and the commercial trade in bushmeat increased with the spread of firearms, often supplied by government soldiers and rebel militia. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Virunga Mountain Gorillas were also impacted by war and instability (Kalpers <em>et al</em>. 2003, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2011).</li><li><u><strong>Disease</strong></u> - Regulated tourism is a key strategy for Eastern Gorilla conservation; however, transmission of human diseases is a major concern (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2015), as is excessive disturbance to Gorillas and their habitat (Macfie and Williamson 2010), which could jeopardize conservation programmes. Examples of likely or proven human-­to-­great ape disease transmission include respiratory viruses (Köndgen <em>et al</em>. 2008, Palacios <em>et al</em>. 2011, Spelman <em>et al</em>. 2013), human herpes simplex virus (Gilardi <em>et al</em>. 2014) and scabies (Kalema-Zikusoka <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some of these cases have been fatal and most have involved habituated Gorillas or Chimpanzees. Nonetheless, Mountain Gorillas visited by researchers and tourists have consistently shown higher population growth rates than unhabituated Gorillas, which is likely due to the daily monitoring of habituated groups. Continuous monitoring leads to better protection and facilitates veterinary interventions to remove snares and treat respiratory illnesses (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2011); it is almost impossible to treat unhabituated Gorillas.</li><li><strong><u>Climate change</u></strong> - Climate change is predicted to impact the forests of the Albertine Rift escarpment, leading to the upslope migration of species and key Gorilla habitat, notably montane forest (Ayebare <em>et al</em>. 2013). Increased temperatures and modified rainfall patterns are also likely to result in changes in food availability and habitat quality (McGahey <em>et al</em>. 2013). With almost all montane forest in the eastern highlands now destroyed and converted for agriculture to support some of the highest human population densities in the African Great Lakes region, climate change may have negative effects on food security for the human populations surrounding Gorilla habitat, which could also conservation efforts in the future.</li></ol>","It is likely that fewer than 5,000 Eastern Gorillas remain.&#160;<em>Gorilla b. beringei</em>&#160;lives in two isolated populations in three countries: DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. The first surveys of the Virunga Mountain Gorillas estimated a population size of 274 individuals in 1971–73 (Harcourt and Groom 1972, Groom 1973). The population fell to a low of 254 individuals in 1981 (Aveling and Harcourt 1981, Weber and Vedder 1983). Since then, protection measures have enabled the population to recover and the most recent estimate for the Virungas is a minimum of 600 individuals (Hickey <em>et al</em>. 2018). The second (Bwindi-Sarambwe) Mountain Gorilla population numbers about 400 individuals (Roy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Thus, the total population of the subspecies is now at least 1,000 individuals (Roy <em>et al</em>. 2014, Hickey <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In 1994–95, the total population of <em>G. b. graueri</em> was estimated to be 16,900 individuals (Hall <em>et al</em>. 1998a, 1998b). Since then, widespread insecurity and poaching for bushmeat, particularly around mining camps, have led to increasing fragmentation of the population and rapid reductions of numbers. Using survey data collected between 2010 and 2015, Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated that the number of Grauer's Gorillas remaining in 2015 is only 3,800—a 77% loss since 1994-95. These population estimates were made using night nest abundance and distribution, and predictive modelling. Nest encounter rates indicate an ongoing rate of decline of ~5% per year at many of the sites surveyed, due to fragmentation and illegal hunting around the many artisanal mining camps and villages located in areas where Grauer's Gorillas occur (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"Eastern Gorillas are found in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), northwest Rwanda and southwest Uganda.<br/><br/><em>Gorilla beringei beringei</em> (Matschie 1903) is restricted to two populations in forests only 25 km apart, but isolated by land that is intensely cultivated and densely settled. One population is in the Virunga Volcanoes, straddling the borders between DRC (Virunga National Park), Rwanda (Volcanoes National Park) and Uganda (Mgahinga Gorilla National Park). The other occurs in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, with a small contiguous portion in Sarambwe Nature Reserve in DRC.<br/><br/><em>Gorilla beringei graueri</em> (Matschie 1914) is endemic to the forests of the Albertine Rift escarpment in eastern DRC. It has a discontinuous distribution from the lowlands east of the Lualaba River to the Mitumba Mountains and the Itombwe Massif. Mt. Tshiaberimu in Virunga National Park is the northern limit of Grauer’s Gorilla’s geographic range. The southern limit is a subpopulation in the Hewa Bora region, Fizi District (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Although formerly known as the Eastern Lowland Gorilla, <em>G. b. graueri</em> occurs over the widest altitudinal range of any Gorilla, from approximately 600 m to 2,900 m asl, overlapping considerably with the altitudinal range of <em>G. b. beringei</em> (1,400–3,800 m asl; Williamson <em>et al</em>. 2013).","<p>Gorillas are completely protected by national and international laws in all countries of their range, and it is, therefore, illegal to kill, capture or trade in live Gorillas or their body parts.<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<em>Gorilla beringei</em> is listed on Appendix I of CITES, and under Class A of the African Convention (as the species <em>Gorilla</em>). DRC has a legal framework for managing national parks and wildlife, but has difficulty applying its laws, and political will is limited. Underlying this is a difficult sociopolitical context – a breakdown of law and order during two decades of conflict, combined with poverty and economic insecurity, exacerbates the difficulties of enforcing the law in this region. To address the critical situation faced by Grauer’s Gorillas, NGOs are working with the government authorities to support protected areas and reinforce conservation programmes. However, the widespread presence of armed groups in eastern DRC restricts the ability of conservation organisations to operate in the field.<br/><br/>One quarter of the predicted range of the Grauer’s Gorillas occurs in national parks and nature reserves; the remaining three quarters is currently unprotected (Plumptre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Gazetting of the Itombwe Reserve and establishing a protected area west of Kahuzi-Biega National Park could secure as much as 50% of the subspecies' range.<br/><br/>Conservation challenges are likely to increase as the DRC government continues its efforts to stabilize the east. Security will favour industrial extraction, large-scale agriculture and infrastructure. While development will increase the country's ability to support its human population and participate in the global economy, it will also result in increased human settlement in forest areas critical to Gorillas. Targeted conservation action in priority sites will be vital to slow further demise of this subspecies.<br/><br/>The entire Mountain Gorilla population resides in protected areas where there are active government programmes. Although the protected areas are relatively well monitored, illegal activities continue in some locations, therefore monitoring the impacts of both illegal activities and conservation actions should continue. While these national parks are legally protected, habitat fragmentation and degradation will be exacerbated if infrastructure developments are allowed within their boundaries.<br/><br/>To achieve conservation successes, long-term commitment is key, as shown by the international conservation organisations that have been working in difficult circumstances for decades to support the protected area authorities and try to secure the survival of Eastern Gorillas. IUCN has published a detailed conservation strategy with clear priorities for Grauer’s Gorillas (Maldonado <em>et al</em>. 2012). See Plumptre <em>et al</em>. (2015) for additional recommendations and see Robbins <em>et al</em>. (2011) for an overview of the impacts of conservation activities on mountain Gorillas in the Virunga Massif.<br/><p></p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

This produced a severe bottleneck that significantly reduced genetic variability. For most of the twentieth century, numbers continued to decline mostly as a consequence of human invasion of habitat and adverse fishing interactions. This resulted in the fragmentation of the species into many subpopulations and the disappearance of several of them. There is evidence for recent small increases in Mediterranean Monk Seals at each of the main three identified subpopulations, but their numbers remain very small. The number of mature individuals in the eastern Mediterranean (the largest subpopulation) is likely fewer than 250, and 100-200 occurring in the other known subpopulations.<br/><br/>Monk Seals continue to be exposed to a number of substantial threats, including habitat loss and deterioration, displacement and persecution. Unpredictable threats from disease and toxic algal blooms (red tides) also pose a threat to the remaining small population, as exemplified by the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco when more than 200 animals died in one mass-mortality event in 1997.<br/><br/>With the advantage of new data being available for this species, it is now thought that the previous assessment (Critically Endangered A2abc: Aguilar and Lowry 2008) was an overestimate of the scale of decline in the global population over the previous 33 years, since most of the reduction in population size likely happened more than three generations ago. Endangered (EN C2a(i)) would have been a more appropriate assessment at that time. It is clear that the population size has been reduced to below the IUCN threshold for EN under criterion C: currently the population contains 350-450 mature individuals, with less than 250 mature animals in the largest subpopulation. There is evidence of recent small increases in each of the main three subpopulations, however it is not clear when this increasing trend began or whether this trend is likely to continue into the future. Continuing decline in population size is therefore retained as a precautionary approach for this assessment. It is important to monitor the situation over the next five years to establish whether the population is genuinely increasing and whether this increase is likely to continue into the future. Maintaining and adding to conservation measures that are already in place for this species will help to secure its future. The species is here listed as Endangered (EN C2a(i)), and reassessment of its status in five years’ time is recommended.","Mediterranean Monk Seals are medium-sized phocids that reach 2.3-2.8 m in length (Gilmartin and Forcada 2002). Based on seals examined after a mass mortality at Cabo Blanco, average adult lengths were estimated at 2.42 m in females and 2.51 m in males. Pups up to 3 months of age averaged 1.08 m with a range of 0.74-1.38 m (Samaranch and Gonzalez 2000). In the eastern Mediterranean, newborn pups averaged 102.6 cm in length (i.e., total length from the snout to the end of the hind flippers; N = 8, SD = 10.74) and 15.5 kg in weight (N = 3, SD = 1.5; Dendrinos 2011). Adults weigh from 240-300 kg, and newborns 15-26 kg (Boulva 1979, Gilmartin and Forcada 2002), with records of a male reaching 400 kg and a pregnant female reaching 302 kg (Sergeant <em>et al</em>. 1978).<br/><br/>Adult females moult an average of 134 days after parturition, and sometimes begin the moult prior weaning their pup (Pastor and Aguilar 2003). In males, the process of developing the mature pelage pattern is gradual; it involves at least two annual moults and can be completed by the age of 4 years (Badosa <em>et al</em>. 2006). Mediterranean Monk Seal pups at the Cabo Blanco region moult on average 64 days after birth in the case of females and on average 82 days in the case of males; the molt occurs partly in the water and takes an average of 15 days to be completed (Badosa <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the eastern Mediterranean in contrast the first molt occurred 19-57 days postpartum (N = 16; Mean 37.5 days, SD = 9.85; Dendrinos 2011).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals once hauled out on open beaches (Johnson and Lavigne 1999b, Johnson 2004) but today they use marine caves with sea entrances for hauling out, resting and pupping throughout their range. In recent years in areas where conservation measures are in place and/or human activity is low, such as the protected areas at Cabo Blanco (Gilmartin and Forcada 2002, Fernandez de Larrinoa <em>et al</em>. 2007, P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.), the Desertas Islands Nature Reserve (Pires and Neves 2000) and the island of Gyaros (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2008), Monk Seals are frequently observed to haul out on open beaches. On some occasions even births on open beaches have been recorded in these areas.<br/><br/>Most marine caves used by Mediterranean Monk Seals for resting and pupping possess a set of common geophysical characteristics, that include an entrance above or below water level, an entrance corridor, and a dry surface/area, where the seals haul out (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2007b). Seal preferences regarding the use of a cave as a resting or pupping site are influenced by these parameters (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2004). Cave selection (i.e., usage frequency and intensity) may also be influenced by changes in the internal morphology of a cave, as has been seen to occur at Cabo Blanco (González <em>et al</em>. 1997) or the state of the tide (only in the Atlantic populations, as tides in the Mediterranean are negligible) (Pires <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>A major difference in the terrestrial habitat of Mediterranean Monk Seals occupying the area of Cabo Blanco and the rest of their range is the number of marine caves used by the species. Whereas in Cabo Blanco, the entire Monk Seal population uses a small number (&lt;5) of marine caves for resting and pupping (Marchessaux and Muller 1987, Francour <em>et al</em>. 1990, González <em>et al</em>. 1997, Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012) in the archipelago of Madeira (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2004) and in the eastern Mediterranean this number is much higher (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004; MOm 2007, 2008, 2009). In a study that covered 250 km of coastline inhabited by Monk Seals in the Cilician Basin region of southern Turkey, 282 caves were searched. Of these, 39 showed evidence of Monk Seals, including three that were used for pupping and 16 that were actively being used at the time of the survey (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004). Similarly, in Greece more than 500 caves have been found to be occupied by the species and more than 100 to be used for pupping (MOm 2007, 2008, 2009). Monk Seal activity in the marine caves in the eastern Mediterranean is highest in autumn and winter and coincides with the pupping season of the species (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004, Dendrinos 2011).<br/><br/>In the Cabo Blanco region prior to the mass die off in 1997, most pups were born from summer to early winter, with a small peak of births in October; 84% of the births took place in only two caves separated by 1.1 km (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 1999, Pastor and Aguilar 2003). Following the mass die-off a change in the reproductive parameters of the colony was registered (González <em>et al</em>. 2002): currently births are recorded from April to November, with a clear peak in September (Cedenilla <em>et al</em>. 2007). In all other parts of the species range, pupping appears to be even more synchronous. In the archipelago of Madeira most pups have been recorded in the months October and November (i.e., 38 out of 48 recorded from 1989 to 2012; Pires <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. Pires pers. comm). The same pupping season was recorded for 11 pups born at Turkey’s Cilician Basin and for more than 220 pups born in Greece from 1990 to 2014 (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 1994, 1999; Dendrinos 2011).<br/><br/>Pups begin to catch fish toward the end of their lactation period (Pastor and Aguilar 2003). Pups are weaned when they are about four months old, with up to five months reported (Pastor and Aguilar 2003, Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fostering and milk stealing are not uncommon and have been recorded at Cabo Blanco (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2007), Madeira (Pires 2004), and in Greece (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2012). At the Cabo Blanco colony, in 26.6% of the suckling episodes observed in mother–pup pairs of known identity, pups suckled from females other than their mothers. Some females nursed more than one pup, at least occasionally, and in some cases a pup was fostered long-term by an unrelated female (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 2007). Pups enter the water and begin diving during their first week and from that point onwards spend 55-74% of their time at sea (Dendrinos 2011). Three pups tagged with time depth recorders spent more time at sea and diving at night than during the day; most dives were to the bottom for relatively long periods, probably indicating foraging. The mean depth of dive was 11.6 m and its mean length was 149 seconds (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the Northern Sporades Islands in Greece, two rehabilitated weaned pups dived on average to greater depths and even managed to dive to a depth of 200 m (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2007a).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is 11.2 years (Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013). Female Mediterranean Monk Seals probably become sexually mature at 3-4 years of age. One female at Cabo Blanco became pregnant at 2.1 years and gave birth at 3.1 years, the youngest age known for this species (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). Females can give birth in successive years. Although birthing is not strictly seasonal, individual females have been documented to give birth close to the same time in successive years, within a 15 day span (Pastor and Aguilar 2003). The annual reproductive rate in Mediterranean Monk Seals at Cabo Blanco prior to the mass die-off was extremely low, at 0.25-0.43 pups to each sexually mature female (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2000). Since the mass die-off event the population appears to be recovering and currently annual reproductive rates average 0.76 pups/adult female (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). Females caring for pups will go to sea to feed for up to 17 hours, with an average time of 9 hours (Gazo and Aguilar 2005). Females tend to forage longer further into nursing.<br/><br/>Prior to the mass mortality event, pup survival at Cabo Blanco was extremely low; just under 50% of the pups born annually managed to survive their first two months, and most mortalities occurred in the first two weeks. This very low survival rate was associated with mortality caused by severe storms, and high swells and tides, but impoverished genetic variability and inbreeding might also have been factors (Gazo <em>et al</em>. 2000). Currently, annual pup survival has increased considerably and numbers 65% (54-76%, depending on weather conditions; P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). In Greece annual pup survival appears to be even higher (Dendrinos 2011); this is most likely due to the fact that lactating females and their pups have a higher number of suitable caves to choose from when seeking refuge from severe weather conditions.<br/><br/>Compared to most other pinnipeds, little is known about the diving capacities and behavior of Mediterranean Monk Seals. The maximum depth and duration of diving for one lactating female were 78 m and 15 minutes, respectively (Gazo and Aguilar 2005) and 100 m for an adult male (P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm.). However, diving behaviour of Monk Seals at Cabo Blanco appears to be constricted by the topographic features of the marine environment in the region, as Monk Seals in the Mediterranean Sea (which is much deeper than the Cabo Blanco region) have been recorded to dive much deeper. Maximum dive depths for a rehabilitated male and a female juvenile Monk Seal were 196 m (Dendrinos <em>et al</em>. 2007a) and 205 m (MOm unpublished data), respectively. Neves (1998) observed two types of diving in shallow near-shore waters, which are thought to be associated with “spot resting” and “transit feeding”. When “spot resting”, seals dove as though headed into a current for 8-12 minutes, surfaced at about the same location, and usually repeated this pattern for approximately three hours. Underwater observations by divers indicate that while doing this seals rest at the bottom of the sea (R. Pires pers. comm). Transit feeding dives lasted 5-7 minutes, during which the seal moved continuously along a shoreline apparently foraging. A similar behaviour has been observed in Turkey, where adult Monk Seals dove for approximately 6.5 minutes and rested at the surface for approximately one minute (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2002). Monk seals in the eastern Mediterranean have been recorded to travel long distances, for example ~288 km in three months with a maximum straight distance travelled of ~78 km (Adamantopoulou <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Stomach content analysis of dead Monk Seals has revealed that they have a heterogeneous diet consisting of bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. In Greece, Monk Seals are known to eat more than 70 prey species (50% cephalopods, 48% fishes, 1.5% non-cephalopod molluscs, 0.4% crustaceans; Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011). The common octopus (<em>Octopus vulgari</em>s ~34%) and bony fish from the family Sparidae (~28%) were identified in Monk Seal stomachs most frequently (Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the Atlantic, at the Desertas Islands off Madeira, visual observations of Monk Seals with prey at the surface included seals eating Golden-grey Mullet (<em>Liza aurata</em>), Parrot Fish (<em>Sparisoma cretense</em>), Barred Hogfish (<em>Bodianus scrofa</em>), Salema (<em>Sarpa salpa</em>), Cuttlefish (<em>Sepia officinalis</em>) and Crabs (<em>Pachygrapsus</em> spp.). Other prey reported includes Eels (<em>Anguilla</em> spp.), Limpets (<em>Patella</em> spp.) and Rays (<em>Raja</em> spp.) (Neves 1998). In Cabo Blanco, stomach content analyses indicated that 71.3% of prey items by weight were cephalopods and 68.3% were Octopus. Fish species were mainly from the families Sparidae, Scianidae and Haemulidae (Muñoz Cañas <em>et al</em>. 2012). Collectively, results from stomach content (Marchessaux 1989, Neves 1998, Salman <em>et al</em>. 2001, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pierce <em>et al</em>. 2011, Muñoz Cañas <em>et al</em>. 2012) and stable isotope analyses (Pinela <em>et al</em>. 2010, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2014b) studies suggest that Monk Seals forage primarily on the continental shelf along the coast.","The Mediterranean Monk Seal is one of the most endangered pinniped species, and one of the most endangered Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) mammals on Earth (Isaac <em>et al</em>. 2007, <a href=""http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=27"">EDGE</a> web site).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals have a long history of interaction with humans that includes exploitation for subsistence needs, commercial harvest, and persecution as a competitor for fisheries resources or because it produced actual and perceived damage to fishing gear (Johnson and Lavigne 1999b, Stringer <em>et al</em>. 2008). Once abundant, Monk Seals were written about and illustrated in the literature and depictions of classical antiquity (Johnson 2004). Along the coast of northwest Africa, they became the target of a commercial harvest for skins and oil by the Portuguese as early as the 15th century (Isräels 1992).<br/><br/>Reasons for population decline declines in the 20th century include: increased human pressure displacing seals from their habitat; destruction/alteration of suitable habitat; continued mortality due to deliberate aggression by fishermen to eliminate a competitor, even in countries and areas where the species is legally protected; fisheries by-catch; and a mass die-off at the Cabo Blanco Monk Seal colony.<br/><br/>Habitat deterioration, destruction, and fragmentation have played a significant role in the plight of the Mediterranean Monk Seal. Once an open beach dweller, the species has been persecuted by humans for centuries and forced to occupy increasingly marginal habitat. The gradual process from occupying open beaches to being displaced and forced into increasingly marginal habitat (i.e., smaller and more unsuitable marine caves) has been thoroughly documented (Johnson and Lavigne 1999a). This threat is still in place today, particularly in the eastern Mediterranean (MOm 2007, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013). An alarming decline in pupping success has been recorded in the most important pupping location of the species in southern Turkey (where up to seven pup births have been recorded) due to increased human activity (i.e., industrial development, including the construction of a thermal and nuclear power plant and a marine terminal). Critical Monk Seal habitat has been affected by increased tourism activities throughout Turkey, even in protected areas such as the Olympos Beydagları National Park, and the Kas, Kekova Specially Protected Area. Tourists and scuba divers in these areas appear to frequently visit Monk Seal shelters. Although some resting activity of Mediterranean Monk Seals continues, no pupping activity has been recorded in these caves (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2009). With human populations and coastal activities increasing around the Mediterranean, so do potential threats to the species habitat.<br/><br/>Interactions with fisheries are of great conservation concern, throughout the species range (Güçlüsoy and Savas 2003, Güçlüsoy 2008, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hale <em>et al</em>. 2011, González and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2013). Deliberate killing of Monk Seals mainly by fishermen was responsible for one-third of all mortalities of 79 stranded animals in Greece (1991-1995) and is considered the single most important source of mortality for this species in the eastern Mediterranean (Androukaki <em>et al</em>. 1999). Deliberate killing, hunting, and capturing live animals for exhibition purposes were the main cause for the population reduction of the species in Turkey until 1980 (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals have been entangled in a wide variety of fishing gear including set-nets, trawl nets, and long-lines (Johnson and Karamanlidis 2000) and entanglement remains a major source of mortality in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, especially for sub-adult animals (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013). Adverse fishing interactions are also considered as one of the probable causes for the lack of recovery of the Cabo Blanco population after commercial sealing ended in the region. Currently, illegal industrial and artisanal fishing is one of the main threats to the survival of the colony, mainly for sub-adult seals (González and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2013). In comparison, the effect of negative seal-fisheries interactions in the archipelago of Madeira is considered to be lower. Traps, purse seines, and illegally used gill nets are the main fishing gear posing a threat to the species in the region (Hale <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, concurrent with the recent expansion of the species’ range to the island of Madeira, signs of animosity towards the species by fishermen have been recorded, that potentially could pose a future threat (R. Pires pers. comm).<br/><br/>A <em>Morbillivirus</em> was isolated from Mediterranean Monk Seals after the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco in 1997. The virus most closely resembled a Dolphin <em>Morbillivirus</em> that was previously implicated in the 1991 mass mortality of Striped Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea (Osterhaus <em>et al</em>. 1992, van de Bildt <em>et al</em>. 1999). However, although this virus was already circulating in Monk Seals prior to the mass mortality, there is some doubt as to whether it was responsible for the deaths that occurred. Indeed, the active virus was found in pups that went into a rehabilitation center because their mothers had died, and none of them showed clinical signs and all survived the event without specific treatment. Dinoflagellate-produced saxitoxins were found in tissues from animals that died during the die-off and the suddenness of death of the animals and the general clinical symptoms suggest that the cause of death was from the toxins rather than a <em>Morbillivirus</em> epidemic (Hernandez <em>et al</em>. 1998). Toxic algal blooms (red tides) are favored by oceanographic conditions near Cabo Blanco and were reported from nearby Morocco during a 25-year period leading up to the mass mortality. Toxic algal blooms are unpredictable and following the catastrophic loss of Monk Seals in 1997 must be considered a serious threat to the species in the region (Reyero <em>et al</em>. 2000, UNEP 2005).<br/><br/>Potentially, limited availability of food sources, genetic inbreeding, and pollution could constitute a threat to the survival of the species. Currently, not enough information is available to fully evaluate the magnitude of these threats, however there is no indication that they are significantly affecting the population at present.<br/><br/>In southern Turkey an important monk seal colony almost disappeared in the 1990s, when industrial-scale fishing in the area reduced the available fish sources and negative interactions of artisanal fishermen with monk seals (i.e., deliberate killings) increased. However, a series of regulations enforced to protect fish sources alleviated the problems and helped the local monk seal population to resume pupping in the area (Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Genetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2007, Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2014a) have shown that, as a consequence of severe population bottlenecks and population/habitat fragmentation, all sub-populations have suffered a dramatic decrease in genetic variability over the last few centuries. The genetic diversity of Mediterranean Monk Seals is among the lowest found in pinnipeds; it is comparable to Hawaiian Monk Seals and Northern Elephant Seals. The potential consequences of the loss of genetic variability and genetic inbreeding are still hard to evaluate for the Mediterranean Monk Seal, however potential consequences of genetic inbreeding include congenital defects leading to stillborn pups, something that has been recorded in several small Monk Seal populations (Bareham and Furreddu 1975, Pastor <em>et al</em>. 2004, MOm, unpublished data). Additionally, low fitness and increased susceptibility to disease may be an effect of genetic erosion that can compromise a population and lead to extinction.<br/><br/>Contaminant burdens have always been suspected to be a threat to the Mediterranean Monk Seal and thus monitoring pollutants has been considered a high priority (Boulva 1979, Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, information is only available on organochlorine pollutants, which were analysed in the blubber of individuals collected during the 1990s from the Cabo Blanco and the Greek subpopulations. Residue levels were found to be very low in the former subpopulation and moderate to high in the latter (Yediler <em>et al</em>. 1993; Borrell <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2007); currently, efforts are underway to more fully evaluate the effects of pollution on the Mediterranean Monk Seal through the analysis of more recent samples from the eastern Mediterranean (Marsili <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zaccaroni <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Mediterranean Monk Seals are at an unknown, but suspected high, level of risk from oil tanker and other ship accidents, spills, and groundings. This results from increased tanker traffic in the area, and a greater chance for accidents, disturbance, and collisions near important habitat. Four accidents or spills have occurred near Monk Seal habitat in the recent past, including a supertanker that spilled oil off Morocco in 1989 (Isräels 1992), an oil spill in the Madeira Islands in 1990 (UNEP 2005), and the grounding of a bulk carrier near Cabo Blanco in 2003 (UNEP 2005). None of these spills or accidents had any known impacts on Monk Seals, but they highlight the threat of significant impacts from a major maritime accident near an important Monk Seal site (UNEP 2005). In contrast, a ship accident that occurred at Çavuş Island near Bodrum in southwest Turkey in 1996 directly affected Monk Seals and their habitat (Kiraç 1998). A clean-up operation lasting until 1997 effectively restored the habitat to its original quality. In response to this accident regulatory measures have been taken in Turkey to reduce the threat from oil spills (Kiraç and Guclusoy 2007).<br/><br/>More recently, the arrival of Lessepsian fishes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, such as the toxic Pufferfish (<em>Lagocephalus sceleratus</em>), could have a negative impact on Monk Seals in the region. The Pufferfish has been implicated in the death of a Monk Seal at Cyprus (A. Gücü pers. comm). Additional risks to Mediterranean Monk Seals come from political instability in some parts of their range, the challenge of implementing effective conservation for a species in a complex multi-national environment, weak enforcement of agreements and international laws, collapse of occupied pupping caves, and reduction of the carrying capacity of the environment as a consequence of fishing overexploitation (Aguilar 1999).","The once abundant Mediterranean Monk Seal has disappeared from most of its former range, with the majority of the decline in the global population seen over the last century having occurred more than three generations ago.<br/><br/>Conservation measures introduced over the last 30 years have helped to stem the decline, and there is now evidence of recent small increases in all known subpopulations. However at present it is not clear whether these increases are likely to continue into the future. The Mediterranean Monk Seal population remains very small and still faces many threats (see the Threats section below). It is regarded as one of the most endangered pinniped species in the  world, with approximately 600-700 animals in the population (an estimated 350-450 of these are mature individuals). The population has also been fragmented into 3–4 subpopulations:<br/><ul><li>The largest subpopulation is located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and numbers 350-450 individuals (including mature and immature individuals). It is estimated that 300–400 live in Greece (MOm 2007, 2008, 2009) and about 100 in Turkey (Güçlüsoy <em>et al</em>. 2004). Based on data from the closest extant relative of the Mediterranean Monk Seal (i.e., the Hawaiian Monk Seal) the number of mature individuals in the eastern Mediterranean is likely fewer than 250.</li></ul><ul><li>Approximately 220 seals currently inhabit the second largest subpopulation at the Cabo Blanco area. Recent monitoring efforts have individually identified at least 116 adult and sub-adult Monk Seals in this subpopulation (i.e., &gt;3 years old; Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012). Maximum counts of seals hauled-out at one time was 146 in 2009, and 159 individual adult seals were identified at the end of 2013 (CBD Habitat, P. Fernandez de Larrinoa pers. comm). In the early 1990s this subpopulation was estimated at about 317 seals but a mass mortality event in 1997 reduced numbers to nearly a third (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1999, Forcada and Aguilar 2000). Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. (2012) estimated that there were 85 adult seals at Cabo Blanco in 2007.</li></ul><ul><li>The third subpopulation is located in the archipelago of Madeira and numbers approximately 40 seals (Pires <em>et al</em>. 2008, R. Pires pers. comm). Once restricted to the remote Desertas Islands (Neves and Pires 1999), Monk Seals have recently recolonized the main island of Madeira (Pires 2011), where suitable habitat for the species still exists (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2003). There are even strong indications of pupping on the island (R. Pires pers. comm).</li></ul><ul><li>The number of Mediterranean Monk Seals that might still survive at the Mediterranean coasts of eastern Morocco (and perhaps Algeria) is unknown (Mo <em>et al</em>. 2011).</li></ul>The subpopulations at Cabo Blanco in the Atlantic (Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012) and at the island of Gyaros in the eastern Mediterranean (Karamanlidis <em>et al</em>. 2013) are the only large extant aggregations of the species that still preserve the structure of a colony; the other subpopulations in the eastern Mediterranean are composed of loose groups of extremely reduced size (usually less than 20 individuals).<br/><br/>Monk Seals continue to be exposed to a number of substantial threats, as exemplified by the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco when more than 200 animals died in one mass-mortality event in 1997 (Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012). Such unpredictable threats could rapidly impact any or all of the subpopulations in future.",Increasing,"Mediterranean Monk Seals were once widely and continuously distributed in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and in the North Atlantic waters from Morocco to Cabo Blanco, including the Canary Islands, Madeira Islands and the Azores (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2006). A few individuals have been recorded in Senegal, the Gambia and the Cape Verde Islands at the southern end, as well as in Portugal and Atlantic France at the northern end of the species' distribution (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2006), but the origin of these individuals is unknown.<br/><br/>Today the distribution of the Mediterranean Monk Seal is highly fragmented and consists of 3–4 isolated subpopulations. In the Mediterranean Sea, the stronghold of the species is at islands in the Ionian and Aegean Seas (Adamantopoulou <em>et al</em>. 1999), and along the coasts of mainland Greece, Cyprus, and western and southern Turkey (Güçlüsoy <em>et al</em>. 2004; Gücü <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009; MOm 2007; Nikolaou pers. comm). In the Turkish Black Sea, Mediterranean Monk Seals are believed to be extinct since 1997 (Kiraç and Savas 1996, Kiraç 2011); some individuals still survive in the Sea of Marmara (Inanmaz <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the North Atlantic, two subpopulations exist: one at Cabo Blanco (also known as Cap Blanc) at the border of Mauritania and Western Sahara (Gonzáles and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2012, Martínez-Jauregui <em>et al</em>. 2012), and one at the Archipelago of Madeira (Pires <em>et al</em>. 2008). An unknown number of Monk Seals might still survive at the Mediterranean coasts of eastern Morocco (and perhaps Algeria) (Mo <em>et al</em>. 2011), but without ongoing systematic monitoring and conservation actions the status and fate of this subpopulation is in question.<br/><br/>The extent of occurrence for Mediterranean Monk seals is approximately 5,000,000 km² and the area of occupancy is 315,000 km².","In the past, Mediterranean Monk Seals were hunted by humans for their fur, oil, meat and for medicinal use. Evidence suggests that the species was severely depleted during the Roman era (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2006). Today there is no commercial exploitation of this species.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Mediterranean Monk Seal is legally protected throughout its range through numerous national laws and regional and international treaties, as well as European Union regulations. Legislative measures and research, management, and conservation actions to effectively protect important Mediterranean Monk Seal populations are currently in place in the following areas: the Desertas Islands Nature Reserve in the Madeira Archipelago, the National Marine Park of Alonnisos, Northern Sporades Islands, the marine protected area in Northern Karpathos–Saria and the 3-mile no-take zone at the Island of Gyaros in Greece, the no-fishing area of the Cap Blanc Peninsula and the participative reserve that has been created to protect the pupping caves of the Cabo Blanco Monk Seal population. In Turkey similar actions are carried out in five coastal locations in the country: Foça, Karaburun, Alaçatı-Sigacik, the Bodrum Peninsula, and the Cilician coasts (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Additionally, the species is explicitly mentioned in 102 Natura 2000 sites within the European Union (82 sites in Greece, 10 in Italy, five in Spain, three in Portugal, and two in Cyprus). According to the Council’s Directive 92/43EEC “on the conservation of natural habitats of wild fauna and flora” the Mediterranean Monk Seal is considered as a species of community importance. Based on the above Directive, Natura 2000 sites are legally considered by EU member states as Protected Areas.<br/><br/>Throughout the range of the species, widespread action has been taken to sensitize the local human population towards Monk Seal conservation, to protect breeding caves, to restrict fishing gear and relocate the most adverse fishing practices, to develop monitoring programs and intervention protocols, and to increase on-site capability to rehabilitate sick and injured individuals, particularly pups. Numerous agreements, conventions, and treaties (on a regional, national, and international level) are in force to protect Monk Seals, and many workshops and conferences have brought together scientists and managers to discuss Monk Seal conservation issues and problems. Furthermore, numerous international bodies and fora, including the Regional Activity Center for Specially Protected Areas and the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, have put forward initiatives and proposals in order to ameliorate existing threats and mitigate pressures from relevant sectors (i.e., fisheries, bycatch, etc.). Isräels (1992) summarized 30 years of this conservation history, and provided details on accomplishments and failures to meet objectives. Currently, there is a UNEP/Mediterranean Action Plan (first issued in 1978 and revised in 1988) in force for the conservation and management of Monk Seals in the Mediterranean and an Action Plan for the recovery of the Monk Seal in the eastern Atlantic under the Migratory Species of Wild Animals Convention (Bonn Convention) (González <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the context of the plan a list of actions have been implemented, such as the establishment of mechanisms to coordinate and finance the conservation, the population monitoring and study, habitat protection and environmental education.<br/><br/>In Greece, the “National strategy and action plan for the conservation of the Mediterranean Monk Seal in Greece, 2009-2015” (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2009) describes in detail actions that have to be carried out in the country by 2015 in order to safeguard the future of the species. Similarly, in Turkey the National Monk Seal Committee has drafted a “National Action Plan for the Conservation of Mediterranean Monk Seal <em>Monachus monachus</em> in Turkey” that has been approved by the Turkish Ministry of Forest and Water Works (Kiraç <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Recently a new Regional Strategy for the Conservation of the Mediterranean Monk Seal has been adopted also by the UNEP parties (Notarbartolo di Sciara 2013).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
121229971,41688,Ursus arctos,Least Concern,,2017,2016-02-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The range of the Brown Bear has historically declined in North America, Europe, and Asia, and the species has been extirpated in North Africa. However, it remains widespread across three continents, and is still one of the world’s most widely distributed terrestrial mammals. Globally the population remains large, and is not significantly declining and may be increasing in some areas (Swenson <em>et al. </em>1998, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2006, Mace <em>et al. </em>2012, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013, Chapron<em> et al. </em>2014). There are many small, isolated subpopulations that are in jeopardy of extirpation, but others, under more protection and management, are expanding.</p>","<p>Brown Bears occupy a great variety of habitats from dry Asian steppes to Arctic shrublands to temperate rain forests. Their range overlaps that of both the American Black Bear (<em>Ursus americanus</em>) and Asiatic Black Bear (<em>U. thibetanus</em>), and also slightly that of the Polar Bear (<em>U. maritimus</em>). Elevationally they range from sea level to 5,000 m (Sathyakumar 2006). They occupy a greater diversity of habitats than any other species of bear and also exploit a large variety of food items. In terms of diet, they fall between the mainly plant-dependent ursids and the carnivorous polar bear (Mattson 1998, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). In North America, Brown Bears (Grizzly Bears) are more carnivorous where ungulates (especially in Arctic areas) or spawning salmon (coastal areas) are abundant (Mowat and Heard 2006). The productivity and density of brown bears varies enormously, corresponding with the productivity of their habitats and availability of salmon. Coastal areas of North America and Eastern Russia, with concentrations of spawning salmon, have high densities (&gt;100 bears per 1,000 km²) of Brown Bears (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Seryodkin 2006) with high reproductive rates (Hilderbrand <em>et al. </em>1999). Deciduous and mixed forests of the Dinaric and Carpathian mountain ranges of Eastern Europe also host high bear densities with high reproductive rates (Kusak and Huber 1998, Frković <em>et al.&#160;</em>2001). More moderate densities of bears (20-50 bears per 1,000 km²) occur across the interior mountain ranges of North America (McLellan 1994, Schwartz <em>et al. </em>2003, McLellan 2011), Europe, and Asia where they forage on a great variety of grasses, herbs, roots, berries, nuts, as well as animal matter such as insects, mammals, and fish if available. Moderate densities of bears are also found across portions of the boreal forests of North American, Asia and Scandinavia (Bellemain <em>et al. </em>2005). Lower densities (5‒15 bears per 1,000 km²) are found in dry, desert-like areas, alpine and sub-alpine areas, as well as areas where habitat availability and numbers of bears have been reduced by high human and domestic livestock densities (Nawaz 2007); however, in most of these areas (e.g., northern India, western China) density estimates are not available.<br/> <br/>Breeding occurs during April to July but implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until late autumn. Cubs, usually in litters of 1 to 3 (rarely 4 or 5), are born in January or early February when the mother is hibernating. In North America, female bears generally have their first litters at 5 to 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years thereafter (Schwartz <em>et al.</em> 2003). In some areas of Europe, however, females generally have their first litter at least one year earlier, and produce litters every two years (Swenson <em>et al. </em>2000, Frković <em>et al. </em>2001). At the other extreme, brown bears in northern Pakistan produced litters that average only 1.3 cubs every 5.7 years, on average (Nawaz <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>","<p>Although, as a whole, this species is secure with relatively large numbers and an expansive range, many small, isolated subpopulations are threatened due to their low numbers and frequent contact with humans. These small subpopulations tend to be found in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development. As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with available human-related foods; being large and somewhat aggressive, these bears may threaten life and property (often agricultural products) and may be killed as a consequence. Areas of high human use that attract bears may serve as significant mortality sinks (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2004, 2006). Additionally, bears living near humans may be killed inadvertently (e.g., vehicle or train collisions), poached for parts or products, or killed by people hunting for other species. Even small numbers of bears removed from small subpopulations can have adverse effects on population growth (Wakkinen and Kasworm 2004); conversely, preventing just a few deaths may avert a population decline (Wiegand <em>et al. </em>1998, Garshelis <em>et al. </em>2005). Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al</em>. submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East, where Brown Bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to direct removal of Brown Bears, many other human activities (such as agriculture, plantation forestry, highways, hydroelectric and wind power developments, and human settlements) eliminate, fragment, or erode the value of bear habitat (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, Waller and Servheen 2005, Proctor <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat fragmentation is a serious threat that isolates population units with deleterious demographic and genetic impacts (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2005, 2012). With increasing human populations, the value of Brown Bear habitat is being degraded in many areas (e.g., Can and Togan 2004, Nawaz 2007), while in other areas (i.e., Turkey), fewer people are now living in rural areas and conditions are improving for Brown Bears.<br/><br/>In Europe, four of ten subpopulations are Critically Endangered. However, the current public interest, financial investment and management actions, seem to presently secure most populations at least for their short to midterm survival. Portions of subpopulations in some countries are less secure due to lower local acceptance and correspondingly high human-caused mortality rates. Almost half of the subpopulations are currently growing, but to guarantee long-term survival, all present and potential future threats must be kept in check. The key threats for bears in Europe were identified as: habitat loss due to infrastructure development, disturbance, low acceptance, poor management structures, intrinsic factors, accidental mortality and persecution. Most threats were expected to increase in the future (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>The total number of Brown Bears on earth is estimated to exceed 200,000. Reliable population estimates (derived mainly from mark-recapture or resight, and modifications thereof) exist for several areas in North America and Europe (Miller <em>et al. </em>1997, Swenson <em>et al.&#160;</em>2000, Bellemain<em> et al. </em>2005, Mowat <em>et al. </em>2005, Proctor <em>et al. </em>2010, 2012, Mowat <em>et al</em>. 2013), but few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000, while estimates in the U.S. (mainly in Alaska) are around 33,000, Canada 25,000, and Europe (excluding Russia) 15,400. Whereas the species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, the southern portions of the range are highly fragmented, with many small subpopulations. In North America, the southern fringe has isolated subpopulations ranging in size from near 700 bears in and around Yellowstone National Park (Haroldson <em>et al. </em>2013) to approximately 25 individuals in the Cabinet Mountains of Montana (Proctor <em>et al. </em>2004, Kendall <em>et al. </em>2016) and even less, likely &lt;10 bears, in some southern areas of British Columbia.<br/> <br/>In Europe, Brown Bears occur in 22 countries. Based on the existing data on distribution, as well as a range of geographical, ecological, social and political factors these can be clustered into 10 subpopulations (Chapron <em>et al.</em> 2014): Scandinavian, Karelian, Baltic, Carpathian, Dinaric-Pindos, Eastern Balkan, Alpine, Abruzzo, Cantabrian, and Pyrenean. Based on reported and updated census data, the largest population is the Carpathian population (&gt;8,000 bears), followed by the Scandinavian and Dinaric-Pindos populations (&gt; 3,400 and 3,040 bears, respectively). The other subpopulations are much smaller ranging from several hundred (e.g., Baltic ~700, Cantabrian ~200) to less than one hundred (e.g. Alps ~37 bears). Compared to the last survey, which included data up to 2005 (Bear Online Information System for Europe, BOIS), the Scandinavian, Dinaric-Pindos, and Cantabrian populations have recorded a clear increase. The other populations remained stable. The perceived decrease in the Eastern Balkan subpopulation is likely due to new monitoring techniques. All subpopulation ranges have been relatively stable or slightly expanding. In the Alpine subpopulation the loss of the central Austrian segment in the last decade was counter-balanced by the expansion of the north Italian segment in Trentino, due to translocations from Slovenia. The Pyrenean subpopulation also grew because of translocations from Slovenia (Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/> <br/>Small subpopulations of Brown Bears are also scattered across many portions of Asia, but relatively little is known of numbers or degree of connectivity. In Pakistan there are an estimated 15-30 animals in an isolated subpopulation in the Hindu Kush Range (M. A. Nawaz pers. comm., 2014). Another 130–220 bears are estimated to occur in what is thought to be an isolated subpopulation in the Himalaya Mountains of Pakistan and India (Sathyakumar <em>et al. </em>2012, Abbas <em>et al. </em>2015). There is another subpopulation of bears in the Karakoram-Pamir Mountains of Pakistan and these are likely joined across the Wakhan corridor and the Pamirs of Afghanistan, west of the Taklimakan Desert to the Hissaro-Alai and Pamirs population in southern Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In China, Brown Bears exist in sparse, poorly defined populations in the west and also in the northeast, with guesstimates of ~6,000 and ~1,000 in each of these regions, respectively (Gong and Harris 2006). Three GPS-collared bears in the Sanjiangyuan Region of Tibet, two male and one female with cubs, had home ranges of &gt;7,000 km² and 2,200 km² respectively; these expansive home ranges suggest connectivity (but low density) within the dry, high mountains and plateaus of Tibet. A much more dense population on Hokkaido, Japan may have 2,200 or more Brown Bears, although even there, where significant information has been collected through research and sport harvest returns, reliable population estimates are not available (Mano 2006). There appears to be several isolated subpopulations in the Middle East including bears in the Elburz and Zagros Mountains of Iran and bordering areas in Iraq (Kurdistan), and what is thought to be several isolated subpopulations in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Perhaps the most isolated Brown Bear population in Asia is found in the Gobi desert of southern Mongolia and along the northern China border (currently 21‒29 bears; Tumendemberel <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/>In total, 44 subpopulations of Brown Bear have been identified globally; most occur in the southern portions of their circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. Because many of these subpopulations are small, isolated, and in need of conservation attention, they have been assessed individually using the IUCN Red List Criteria for isolated subpopulations following the guidance of Gärdenfors <em>et al. </em>(2001) and IUCN (2012) (see the Supplementary Material attached to this document).</p>",Stable,"<p>The Brown Bear is the most widely distributed ursid. It once ranged across a large portion of western North America, including northern Mexico. There is also some evidence of sporadic occurrence (after retreat of the Wisconsin ice sheet) within the eastern half of the continent (Guilday 1968). Populations on the Ungava Peninsula may have extended to the Atlantic Ocean (Loring and Spiess 2007). They also ranged throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and across North Africa. A history of prolonged overexploitation in Europe stretching back centuries resulted in the elimination of brown bears from many countries. The date of their extirpation from North Africa is uncertain, but they may have existed as late as the 1500s in the Sinai of Egypt (Manlius 1998) and mid-1800s in Algeria and Morocco (Hamdine <em>et al</em>. 1998). During the 20th century, Brown Bears (called Grizzly Bears in interior North America) were intentionally extirpated in Mexico (≈1960), a large portion of southwestern U.S. (Brown 1985, Mattson and Merrill 2002), and most of the Canadian prairies. Bears have been rare in the Middle East throughout the 1900s, and were believed to have been extirpated by the mid-1950s; however, recent sightings of tracks and a photo of a bear in western Syria, near the Lebanon border, suggests either a relict subpopulation, vagrants from Turkey, or released captive animals&#160; (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Presently, Brown Bears occupy approximately 5,000,000 km² of the northwestern portion of North America, 1,200,000 km² of Europe (excluding Russia), and much of northern Asia. Resident populations are known to exist in 45 range countries. The largest numbers exist in Russia, the U.S. (Alaska), and Canada. Many populations in Europe and the more southerly portions of Asia and North America are small and isolated (Servheen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2000, Kaczensky <em>et al</em>. 2013). Very small numbers of Brown Bears still remain in several Asian countries such as Iraq and Nepal (Gurung 2004, Ridings 2006, Aryal <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Europe, Andorra was reoccupied in 2003 from bears reintroduced into the French Pyrenees. A few wandering individuals are periodically crossing into Switzerland from a reintroduced population in northern Italy, and into Lithuania from Latvia and Belarus, but not enough as yet to be considered as occupied range in these countries.</p>","<p>Where Brown Bears exist in a large, contiguous population, they are sometimes hunted for sport or killed for control purposes, and rates may sometimes be unsustainable at least over the short term (Lamb <em>et al. </em>submitted, McLellan 2015, McLellan <em>et al</em>. submitted). Estimates of sustainable exploitation are hampered by the difficulty and expense of obtaining reliable estimates of population size, natural mortality, and reproductive rates. Most countries do not have the resources to develop and implement adequate monitoring programs and sustainable management plans for Brown Bears. Moreover, even with such plans in place, illegal or unreported kill may equal or exceed the legal and supposedly sustainable kill (McLellan <em>et al. </em>1999, McLellan 2015). This is apparently occurring in the Russian Far East and China, where brown bears are poached for the commercial trade in gall bladders and paws (Seryodkin 2006, Servheen 2013, Burgess <em>et al. </em>2014). In portions of Alaska, the management goal is to reduce bear populations to encourage Moose and Caribou populations to expand for the benefit of hunters (Miller <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Conservation actions for Brown Bears vary greatly among nations and regions within nations. Large populations of this species (in Russia, Japan, Canada, Alaska, and parts of eastern and northern Europe) are legally hunted, and thus managed as a game animal. Hunting regulations, usually designed to ensure a sustainable harvest of bears, vary among areas but often involve a lottery for a limited number of permits (a quota system) and restricted season length. Most small populations are protected by national laws and international agreements, with varying degrees of enforcement. Brown Bear as a species is listed under CITES Appendix II; the populations in Bhutan (if they exist), China, and Mongolia, and those classified as the subspecies <em>Ursus arctos isabellinus</em> (northern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, to Kazakhstan and Gobi desert) are listed under Appendix I. Furthermore, international trade in bears and bear products from certain populations in countries of the European Union is restricted by EU regulations. In parts of the U.S., small populations of Grizzly Bears have increased under protection of the Endangered Species Act (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). Reintroductions, population augmentations, and connectivity management also have helped to restore numbers and geographic range in several locations in the U.S., southern Canada, and Western Europe (Clark <em>et al. </em>2002, Kasworm <em>et al. </em>2007). There are numerous protected areas around the world with Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a viable population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses (Herrero 1994, Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2006). Some countries have rules or management guidelines designed to reduce human impacts on Brown Bears and their habitat, whereas in other countries bear management protocols and regulations are limited or non-existent (Servheen<em> et al. </em>1999, Zedrosser <em>et al. </em>2001, Kaczensky <em>et al. </em>2013).<br/><br/>In Europe most of the bear populations are protected by the Habitat Directive (Habitat Directive;&#160; <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN""><span lang=""EN-US"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:01992L0043-20070101&amp;from=EN</a>) which is compulsory for all EU countries. Portions of populations that fall within EU countries are not allowed to be classified as game animals.&#160; However, Sweden, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Croatia currently use derogations under article 16 of the Habitat Directive to allow a limited kill of bears by hunters. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Norway manage bears as a game species with annual quotas as they are only limited by the Bern Convention. Trophy hunting of bears enhances local acceptance of these animals by the public in some populations (Knott <em>et al.</em> 2013). Nearly all European countries have some form of bear management plan, action plan or bear management strategy. However, in a number of countries these documents have not been adequately implemented.</p>",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

They prefer well-shaded clear waters, between 21-28°C, and neutral to slightly basic pH (Allen et al 1993; Allen<em> et al.</em> 2002). They are common in river sections with deep (5-6 m), wide (&gt;10 m) pools, with continuous canopy, submerged and exposed tree roots and algae covered pebble and rock substrate (Corbett<em> et al.</em> 2002). River sections with those features were rarely recorded by ground and aerial surveys (Corbett <em>et al.</em> 2002). They may form schools with other fish, such as <em>Hephaestus jenkinsi</em> (Corbett <em>et al.</em> 2002). There is little known of the reproductive biology of this species.

The main threats to this species includes degradation of riparian vegetation due to changed fire regimes (increased severity and intensity of fire could impact riparian vegetation and water quality, especially a larger late dry season burn along the gorge) and/or livestock and feral terrestrial animals (especially during dry periods concentrating of few water sources), and alteration of water quality related to land management (Bradshaw Army Field Training Area) (Pavey 2006). 50% of the range is in a military range with live fire, and although managed, chance events including stray ordinance and pollution spills might impact adult refuge pools. Alien fish species are not established in the Victoria River, but could pose a potential risk to the species (e.g. Tilapia) (Bush Blitz 2017).

123584478,12762,Smutsia gigantea,Endangered,A2cd+4cd,2019,2019-05-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Endangered under criteria A2cd and A4cd. Evidence indicates a decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality over a period of three generations (45 years) based on forest loss in West and Central Africa (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Mayaux <em>et al.</em> 2013, Achard <em>et al.</em> 2014) resulting in the species qualifying for A2c. It also meets criteria A2d on the basis that it is reasonable to infer, and coinciding with forest loss, that populations have declined by 50% over a period of three generations (1974-2019) due to exploitation for local consumption and more recently harvest for international trafficking to Asian markets. The species also meets criteria A4cd using a period of 45 years (three generations; 30 years past, 15 years future) because it is inferred that suitable habitat has been lost in the last 30 years (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2013, Mayaux <em>et al.</em> 2013, Achard <em>et al.</em> 2014), and will continue to be so, while populations have been and are expected to continue to be overexploited. Intercontinental trafficking of tropical African pangolin scales to Asia has seemingly increased in the last decade and governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within one generations time; there is increasing Chinese investment in West and Central Africa which is apparently facilitating pangolin trafficking; there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for African pangolin derivatives, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest, will be effective; and the population of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to double by 2050 with the largest increases in countries including DRC (United Nations, 2019) thereby placing greater pressure on populations of this species. A generation length of 15 years has been used for this assessment based on the estimated generation length for Temminck’s Pangolin (<em>Smutsia temminckii</em>); however, it should be noted that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding this estimate and further research into the life history of the Giant Pangolin is required in order to make a more informed estimate of generation length.  <strong></strong>","<p>The Giant Pangolin<em> </em>occurs in primary and secondary rainforest forest formations, gallery forests, swamp forests, forest-savannah mosaic habitats and wooded savannah (Hoffmann <em>et al. </em>2019). The species also persists discontinuously in savannah woodland /agricultural mosaics in central and southwestern Uganda (N. Matthews and S. Nixon unpubl. data). In Tanzania it has been recorded in bamboo stands in miombo woodland (Foley <em>et al. </em>2014). It is thought that the species may be dependent on access to permanent water sources (Kingdon <em>et al. </em>2013), although this requires confirmation. The species is found across a wide altitudinal gradient, from sea level on the Gabon coast to at least 2200 a.s.l. in the Albertine rift escarpment forests of eastern DRC (S. Nixon, unpubl. data). &#160;The Giant Pangolin is myrmecophagous and feeds on ants (including <em>Palthothyreus</em> and <em>Anomma)</em>, and termites (including the genera <em>Macrotermes</em>, <em>Pseudocanthotermes</em>, <em>Odontotermes</em>, <em>Cubitermes</em>, <em>Apicotermes</em> and <em>Protermes;</em> Vincent 1964; Pagès 1970) but other insect species may also be taken (Kingdon 1971). It is a terrestrial species; animals spend the daytime resting under piles of plant debris, in thickets, under fallen tree roots, in partially opened termitaria, or in burrows (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Individuals may have relatively consistent home ranges, although average home range size is not known and may vary quite substantially across different habitats (Pagès 1970, Kingdon 1971, S. Nixon, unpubl. data) and between sexes (N. Matthews and S Nixon unpubl. data). Individuals are primarily solitary although females are sometimes seen with their young and camera trap surveys have detected individuals walking close together suggesting some association (Bruce <em>et al. </em>2017, N. Matthews and S. Nixon unpubl. data). Scent marking behaviour is evident and commonly observed in both male and female Giant Pangolins in central Uganda which may reflect territorial and/or, pre-copulatory behaviour (N. Matthews and S. Nixon unpubl. data). Their reproductive biology is not well known; breeding may be seasonal and females usually give birth to a single young, possibly annually, but perhaps every second year. Generation time is estimated at 15 years based on the calculated generation time of&#160;Temminck’s Pangolin (<em>S. temminckii)</em> but may be longer.</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>","<p>As with other pangolin species, unsustainable levels of hunting and poaching are the primary threat to the long-term survival of the Giant Pangolin. The species is subject to widespread exploitation for bushmeat and use in traditional medicine and is regularly recorded in bushmeat markets (Colyn&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1987, Bräutigam <em>et al.</em> 1994, Fa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Bowen-Jones 1998, Ayeni <em>et al.</em>&#160;2001). Colyn <em>et al.</em> (1987) found that this species comprised one-tenth of the total number of pangolins (~100) on sale as bushmeat in rural areas around Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2004, Giant Pangolins contributed 5,019 kg in terms of harvested biomass (including either whole animals and/or animal parts) from five markets monitored in Gabon, compared to 2,053 kg for White-bellied Pangolins (<em>Phataginus tricuspis</em>) and 335 kg for Black-bellied Pangolins (<em>P. tetradactyla</em>; Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). </p><p>Market surveys across range countries have revealed the price of Giant Pangolins has increased substantially over the past two decades with Mambeya <em>et al.</em> (2018) recording a 211% price rise (compared to a 73% rise in the price of arboreal pangolins) between 2002 and 2014 in Liberville, Gabon. Further, while Giant Pangolins were not recorded among the 18 most commonly traded species between 2002 and 2006, a 2014 study revealed they were the seventh most traded species forming 3.6% of all carcasses sold. Ingram <em>et al.</em> (2018) concluded that prices rose 5.8 times across central Africa between 1993 and 2004 , estimating&#160; that 0.4-2.7 million pangolins were harvested every year in Africa during this period including 100,000 Giant Pangolins per annum. In Nigeria numbers of Giant Pangolins for sale in bushmeat markets have increased since 2003 as White-bellied Pangolins become harder to source (D. Soewu, unpubl. data). Figures from bushmeat markets are likely to underestimate the actual offtake: Fa <em>et al.</em> (1995) noted that survey records of Giant Pangolin meat in the markets of Bioko were misleading as only 10% made it to market. Similarly, in Liberia, only 25% of the harvest is sold, as local hunters preferred it to other species, while harvest rates in six communities adjacent to Sapo National Park were found to be unsustainable (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The breakdown of taboos protecting the species has led to increased hunting pressure in some areas. For example, local protection afforded by totems in western Côte d’Ivoire has broken down due to refugee movements throughout the region as a result of conflicts in Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). </p><p>The species is increasingly recorded in international trade. There are no reports of trade in live specimens in the CITES trade reports between 1996 and 2011, however in 2012 50 individuals were reportedly exported from Togo to Lao PDR for commercial purposes and in 2015 100 live animals were exported from Nigeria to China for use in captive breeding according to the CITES trade data (Challender and Waterman 2017). Between 2011 and this species being listed on CITES Appendix I in January 2017, 3,268.14 kg of Giant Pangolin scales (an estimated 908 individuals) were traded internationally (Challender &amp; Waterman 2017).</p><p>The true scale of the illegal international trade is unknown, but between 2012 and 2017 6,115kg of Giant Pangolin scales were seized, equating to an estimated 1,697 individuals (Challender and Waterman 2017). These shipments were all apparently destined for markets in East or Southeast Asia. It is estimated that between 2015 and 2019 the equivalent of more than 400,000 African pangolins were trafficked&#160;either in Africa bound for Asia, or en route to East Asian countries, including the Giant Pangolin (Challender<em> et al.</em> 2019; D. Challender, unpubl. data). In 2018 and 2019 there were numerous very large seizures (e.g. up to and &gt;12 tonnes of African pangolin scales) of shipments en route to Asia, and which likely included scales from Giant Pangolin. Ilegal intercontinental trade is a serious and growing threat to Africa’s pangolins, particularly as the illicit nature of the trade means that it is likely that the vast majority of such exports are not detected. This species' large size, low reproductive rate and terrestrial habits make it particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p>Habitat loss is also a threat. Past and present declines in Giant Pangolin area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality likely differ between West and Central Africa. West Africa has deforestation rates that are three times higher than in the Congo Basin forests (Mayaux et al. 2013), with some countries having lost up to 98% of their natural forest cover (e.g. Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana; Achard et al. 2014; Mayaux et al. 2013; Knauer et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2017). West Africa also has higher human population densities (Tatem 2017), and smaller patches of roadless areas (Ibisch et al. 2016) than Central Africa. Annual deforestation is higher in areas with higher human population density (Mayaux et al. 2013). In 2018, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest loss of tropical primary forest in the world, while Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire ranked 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> (of countries with &gt;100,000 ha of primary forest) in terms of their percent increase in forest loss from 2017 at 60% and 26% respectively (World Resources Institute 2019), however true rates of loss are imperfectly known.</p>","<p>This is a solitary, nocturnal and elusive species which is difficult to census and as a result there is no reliable information on population abundance or densities (or occupancy). Recent camera trapping surveys have given information on the relative abundance of the species in some study areas across their range, including in Tanzania, and Cameroon (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2014, Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2017). Detection rates for Giant Pangolins tend to be low using systematic or random camera trapping methods. Data collated from 17 camera trap studies across eight countries (Cameroon, DRC, Gabon, Liberia, Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda) between 2010 and 2016, and representing 1993 camera trap stations and 137,145 trap nights, revealed the proportion of Giant Pangolin detections (naïve occupancy) was only 0.13, and the proportion of sampling occasions with detections (naïve detection probability) was 0.02 (Khwaja <em>et al.</em> in prep). Recent studies however indicate that camera-trapping rates can be improved through targeted efforts (Bruce <em>at al.</em> 2017; N. Matthews and S. Nixon, unpubl. data). Density and abundance are likely to be influenced by a variety of factors including habitat suitability, prey availability, levels of anthropogenic persecution, and to a lesser extent predation levels from large carnivores. The species is believed to be generally rare and populations are thought to be declining across their range.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The species is widely but discontinuously distributed throughout West and Central Africa in a broad range of habitats including primary and secondary rainforest formations, swamp forest, forest savannah mosaics and savannah woodlands. It is recorded from Senegal (though there is no evidence of its presence in Gambia) eastwards through Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia (including the vicinity of Mt Nimba; Coe 1975), Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, where it has also been reported from the north in Mole National Park (Grubb <em>et al.</em> 1998). There is no information from Togo (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), although Grubb <em>et al.</em> (1998) map older records from Ghana near Fazao-Malfakassa National Park on the border with Togo. The species was previously thought to be found across northern Benin, but may now be restricted to the W and Pendjari National Parks (Akpona and Daouda 2011), although recent surveys have not detected the species there. Sayer and Green (1984) referred to sightings in Burkina Faso and Niger (although the species was not included by Lamarque 2004). The distribution of this species in Nigeria is unclear, but it may occur in the south and was camera-trapped in the southeast in Gashaka Gumti National Park in 2016 (S. Nixon, unpubl. data). It was previously recorded as occurring on the island of Bioko (Kingdon <em>et al.</em> 2013), however these reports are likely of carcasses brought in from the mainland to be sold at market (Hoffmann <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ingram <em>et al.</em> 2019). From the eastern bank of the Sanaga River in Cameroon the species is continuously distributed throughout the Congo Basin into Central Uganda (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Giant Pangolins have been observed on the lakeshore in western Kenya, close to the Uganda border, although there are no recent records (Kingdon 1971). There is an authenticated record from the Mahale Mountains in western Tanzania, where their presence has been confirmed by camera-traps and they may also occur in Gombe National Park (Foley <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are no records from Burundi (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013) but the presence of the species has recently been confirmed in South Sudan, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D. Reeder, unpubl. data). Although previously thought extirpated in Rwanda the species has recently been confirmed present in the Akagera National Park in the east of the country (D. Bantlin, unpubl. data). The northern limits of the distribution are not well known but can be expected to broadly coincide with the limits of the tropical lowland rainforests and forest savannah mosaics. The northern banks of the Kasai and Tshuapa Rivers apparently define its southern limits within the central forest block (Kingdon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).</p><p>  <strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>","<p>The Giant Pangolin is subject to exploitative threats.

Large seizures of Giant Pangolin scales totalling 6,115kg, or an estimated 1,697 individuals, have been made in recent years, apparently destined for south east Asia (Challender and Waterman 2017). This species has also been identified in seizures made in Hong Kong (Mwale <em>et al.</em> 2017) and it is highly likely that Giant Pangolin scales were present in the apparently increasing number of seizures involving tropical African pangolins but not identified to species level. The low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade and the fact that hunting and poaching is indiscriminate between age and sex, and increasingly targeted for export markets, suggest that documented pangolin seizures comprise only a small fraction of the actual trade, with real volumes likely at unsustainable levels (see Challender and Waterman, 2017).<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Giant Pangolins are present in protected areas across their range, including in: Cameroon: Campo Ma’an (Matthews and Matthews 2006), Dja Faunal Reserve (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2018), Lobéké National Park (T.

Juveniles are in especially high demand in the pet trade, whilst larger adults enter food and medicinal markets. Although harvesting has declined dramatically recently, due to the extirpation of wild populations, continued commercial demand poses a serious impediment to reintroduction into the wild (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2011). In addition to over-exploitation, habitat degradation and fragmentation, as the result of conversion to agricultural lands, threaten <em>G. platynota</em>.","<p><em>Geochelone platynota</em> was extremely rare as early as the 1980s and suffered significant declines to the point that it was considered ecologically extinct in the wild as early as 2000. Since 2013,&#160;<em>G. platynota</em> has been successfully reintroduced into former localities of Minsontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuary. About 2,100 reintroduced subadults (about five years old) were reintroduced, and these are reproducing in the wild, with 51 hatchlings encountered in surveys during 2017 (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018).

An attempt in 2007 to reintroduce <em>G. platynota</em> into Minsontaung was unsuccessful, with all tortoises poached, or disappearing within six months (Platt<em> et al</em>. 2011). A licensed commercial captive breeding operation exists in Bagan, however, there are no exports currently from this facility following the CITES Appendix I listing.<br/><br/>Captive breeding of the species has been greatly successful. From 2008–2016 three assurance colonies in Myanmar increased at an annual rate of 37% (Platt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160;In mid-October 2016, the total captive population of&#160;<em>G. platynota&#160;</em>in Myanmar was 7,150 individuals with an additional &gt;1,000 eggs incubating (Platt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).

Other populations breed in territorial pairs (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong> between July and December with a peak during the months of August and September coinciding with the peak of the floods<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). The most southerly populations often breed a little earlier in July-August <strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). During the non-breeding season the species is fairly congregatory, occurring regularly in flocks of 10-50 individuals (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong>, and there are reports of flocks of up to 1,000 in the Okavango Delta in April-May (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <strong>Habitat </strong>In South Africa this species was found to occupy large home ranges of approximately 16 km<sup>2</sup>, which consist largely (75%) of grassland with a small core of essential wetland breeding habitat <strong style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</strong>McCann and Benn 2006).<strong> </strong><em>Breeding </em>It nests in shallow sedge-dominated wetlands, often above 2,000 m altitude (<strong></strong>del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996)<strong></strong>.

Elsewhere in its range it breeds on large low-lying tropical, seasonal flood plains such as the Okavango Delta (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong> where wetlands are bordered by grasslands<strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). It may use man-made habitats such as dams (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005).

It congregates at large wetlands on riparian floodplains, but also requires pristine or semi-pristine, high-altitude wetlands and grasslands in some places<strong>&#160;(</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996;&#160;Barnes 2000; Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 1998). It frequents dambos (depressions), permanently isolated wetlands (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006) and vleis<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>) as well as using grasslands, pastures, and occasionally cultivated fields for foraging (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Dams and pans are used as roosting sites during the non-breeding season (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Ethiopian population is less dependent on wetlands during this season, generally moving to drier, lower elevation habitats including ploughed fields<strong> </strong><strong> (</strong>Archibald and Meine 1996). Birds that breed in the Okavango Delta often move to recently burnt ground in the dry season (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). <strong>Diet </strong>The species feeds on rhizomes, roots and bulbs of sedges (<em>Cyperus</em> and <em>Eleocharis</em> spp. [Bento 2002]), and grass sward and seed (Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). It will also take animals including small aquatic snails, fish and frogs<strong> </strong>(Hockey <em>et al</em>. 2005). Chicks are reported to eat insects<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003<strong></strong>).<strong> Breeding site </strong>Preferred nesting sites are where grass and sedge marshes are bordered by drier, flat to sloping grassland meadows, with medium height vegetation and water up to 1 m in depth (<strong></strong>Johnsgard 1983)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. The nest is a large mound of plant material (reeds and sedges), 1 m in diameter and protruding 20 cm above the water surface, usually with a moat of open water about a metre in diameter around it. A significant proportion of nests in the Okavango Delta are on small mud islands two or three metres in diameter, exposed by 20-30 cm as floodwaters recede, and in these cases, the eggs are laid on few pieces of reed or sedge stems.

R. J. Dean <em>in litt. </em>1999<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">,</span><strong> </strong>Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002, McCann and Benn 2006, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Uys 2012). Other threats include nest disturbance<strong> </strong>(P. Leonard <em>in litt. </em>1999, P. Mundy <em>in litt. </em>1999,<strong> </strong>McCann and Benn 2006); grass-burning regimes (M. Herremans &amp; R. E. Simmons <em>in litt. </em>1999, T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), though in the non-breeding season burnt floodplains are used for feeding in some areas<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003); poisoning; collision with utility lines<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996); direct consumption of chicks; persecution, and traditional medicine<strong> </strong>(A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998). Increasing livestock farming, wars, desertification and agrochemicals are additional threats to the species's habitats<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Nest destruction through trampling by livestock is believed to be a problem<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The population is threatened by the illegal removal of eggs and chicks for international trade<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). Adults are also taken for trade and are hunted<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The level of exports from Tanzania is believed to exceed known legal exports<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). The destruction of vegetation by fires probably leaves adults more susceptible to predation and hunting, and flood levels in turn influence the extent and intensity of fires (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Recent potential threats that could extensively affect a large portion of the Okavango Delta include the proposed hydroelectric scheme at Popa Falls in Namibia, papyrus cutting, channel modification, and the extensive aerial spraying of pesticide to eradicate the tsetse fly<strong> </strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The extent of suitable breeding habitat in the Zambezi Delta (Mozambique) and Kafue Flats (Zambia) and the suitability of remaining habitat for feeding is believed to have declined as a result of the interruption of the natural flooding regime by the Cahora Bassa (Tete province), Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe), and Itezhi-tezhi (Zambia) dams upstream, and hunting is also a threat in this country<strong> </strong>(Parker 2005, Bento <em>et al</em>. 2007). Breeding success appears to be low in the species<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b).<strong> </strong>A pre-fledging chick:adult ratio of 5.8% on the Okavango Delta in January 2003 indicates a low chick survival rate<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock 2003). However, each pair of this long-lived species needs to raise only two chicks that survive to adulthood over the course of their lifetimes for the population to remain stable<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Hancock <em>et al.</em> 2003). The species is highly sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon home ranges which are impacted by adjacent land-use (Morrison and Bothma 1998).   <br/><p></p>","Its present world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals (Pittman 2007) or fewer (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), fewer than 8,000 individuals (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100, placed in the range 9,000-10,000. This increase though may not be a true increase in the population and further research to better understand the movements between the key flood plains in south-central Africa and the seasonal movements whereby cranes come together in large flocks in the drier season needs to be explored further (Morrison in press). This estimate roughly equates to 6,000-6,300 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Bugeranus carunculatus</em> is found in <strong>Ethiopia, </strong>(c.200 [Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2003, 2007]), <strong>Tanzania</strong> (c.200 [Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003]), <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong> (probably around 500 [Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007]), <strong>Zambia</strong> (c.4,500 [Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007]), <strong>Angola</strong> (c.500, perhaps declining<strong><sup> </sup></strong>[W.

The total population appeared stable from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996), however when estimates from the 1980s are compared with those from 2006, it is judged to have declined significantly<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006), perhaps indicating declines in the last 10 years. The key Zambian population at the Kafue Flats reportedly fell in the mid-1990s (Archibald and Meine 1996, Burke 1996) and was estimated at c.1,000 individuals in 2002<strong> </strong>(Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002), but may now be as high as around 2,900 individuals (Shunangu <em>et al. </em>2015). Significant populations elsewhere in Zambia include the Liuwa Plains (1,900 individuals [Viljoen 2015]) and the Bangweulu Swamps (African Parks Foundation pers. comm.<em> </em>to K. Morrison 2016). The Okavango Delta in Botswana also holds a significant population, of between 1,200 and 1,300 birds (Hancock 2008). The comparison of 2002 estimates with those from 1993 suggests marked declines in Mozambique, Zambia and possibly Botswana (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The substantial reduction in numbers since 1993 apparently reflects real declines at individual sites and regions, although the 2002 estimate may be influenced by an improvement in accuracy relative to previous estimates (Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007). The world population has been variously estimated at 7,700 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007) or fewer<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Motsumi <em>et al</em>. 2007), not more than 8,000 individuals<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss<em> et al.</em> 2007) and 6,000-8,000 individuals<strong> </strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003). More recent estimates though suggest that the population is currently &gt;9,100 (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). It exists in three disjunct populations, the large south-central population and small Ethiopian and South African populations<strong> </strong>(Jones <em>et al.</em> 2006, Pittman 2007), which may be relicts from its former range<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 2003).</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. Protected areas (including Ramsar Sites) have been established in several key wetlands, notably in Zambia, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996; T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000; T. Fakarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). A major environmental flows initiative is underway for the Zambezi River basin, addressing the restoration of natural flooding patterns, conservation of basin wetlands, and control of invasive species in the Zambezi River basin (Beilfuss and Brown 2010).&#160; Key wetlands targeted by the program include the Kafue Flats, Zambezi Delta, Liuwa Plain, Busanga Swamps, and others, covering about 40% of the global Wattled Crane population. The initiative is a partnership between Zambezi basin dam operators and water authories, NGOs (World Wide Fund for Nature, International Crane Foundation), universities in the basin countries, and other stakeholders. In South Africa, and some other countries, action has included legal protection, marking and relocation of powerlines, awareness programmes, and encouragement of habitat protection, security and management by private landowners (Archibald and Meine 1996, Barnes 2000<strong>,</strong> Burke 1996). In the Kafue Flats, more than 800 ha of invasive <em>Mimosa pigra</em> was eradicated through aerial spraying and community-involvement in manual cutting (Shanungu 2009), although much of this has regrown due to a lack of follow up action (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). A conservation group conducted aerial surveys, field research and a community awareness programme in the Kafue Flats (Kamweneshe and Beilfuss 2002). Aerial surveys, nest monitoring<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Motsumi and Hancock 2004a, Nkape 2004) and monitoring of adult:juvenile ratios<strong> </strong>(Hancock 2003, Mostumi and Hancock 2004b) took place annually on the Okavango Delta in the early 2000s. Surveys and monitoring occur in several countries in south-central Africa (Zambia [International Crane Foundation (ICF) / Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) Partnership, in partnership with the Zambian Department of National Parks and Wildlife; African Parks Foundation], Zimbabwe [BirdLife Zimbabwe], Namibia [Namibia Crane Working Group], South Africa [ICF/EWT Partnership; Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, in partnership with the Endangered Wildlife Trust; KwaZulu-Natal Crane Foundation]), and also aim to drive more awareness amongst local communities (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2016). In 1993, an action plan was developed for the species at the African Crane and Wetland Training Workshop (Beilfuss <em>et al.</em> 1996). A continent-wide programme for the species was launched in 2001 to monitor the species's status and threats, and help develop effective conservation programmes for the management of wetland systems<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). National conservation plans have been developed for Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, (Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). Following a workshop in July 2000, the Wattled Crane Recovery Programme was initiated for the South African population<strong> </strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006, Pittman 2007). There are currently five partners in this South African programme, one aim of which is to establish a viable captive population and supplement the wild population (K. Morrison <em>in litt. </em>2012). The Johannesburg Zoo has also built a dedicated chick-rearing facility, and several captive management facilities throughout South Africa now participate in the breeding programme<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Pittman 2007). In 2005, it was announced that a veterinary fence would be constructed to the east of the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park in Botswana, effectively extending the park boundary and protecting grasslands used by the species from the high density of livestock in the area<strong> </strong>(BirdLife Botswana 2006).

Robertson <em>in litt. </em>1998). Re-operate large dams to restore flooding in key Wattled Crane habitats, including Kafue Flats and Zambezi Delta (Beilfuss and Brown 2010). Coordinate range-wide surveys and long-term monitoring<strong> </strong>(Burke 1996), partly in order to understand population movements between sites and countries<strong> </strong>(T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2000). Continue and expand ecological research (Burke 1996, S. J.

Improve protection of birds outside of protected areas such as the Jao/Boro rivers of Botswana<strong> </strong>(Gibson <em>et al</em>. 2002). Increase educational campaigns (A. Shimelis <em>in litt. </em>1998), targeting landowners with breeding cranes,<strong><sup> </sup></strong>as well policy makers (Burke 1996, T. Fokarayi <em>in litt. </em>2016). Employ satellite tracking to study the species's movements across its range (BirdLife Botswana Crane Working Group 2004, Morrison and van der Spuy 2006). In South Africa, work with farming communities to conserve natural grasslands that surround wetlands<strong> (</strong>McCann and Benn 2006). Investigate whether the South African<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Morrison and van der Spuy 2006) and Ethiopian (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2006) populations represent separate subspecies.

Declines have been driven by high levels of hunting pressure and lowland forest deterioration. Further surveys are urgently needed to identify and protect any remaining populations.<br/><p></p>","The species was said to inhabit exceedingly damp mountain forests up to an estimated 600 m. However, all early collecting localities were in the forested lowlands, and there is no evidence that it can live above 300 m. It is most abundant in areas with thick undergrowth and liana covered hillsides (N. Brickle <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. Records in the 1990s came from lowland areas which have been selectively logged (N. Brickle <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. <p></p>","Its historical range is now almost completely denuded of primary forest through a combination of herbicide spraying during the Vietnam war, logging and clearance for agriculture. The last forested areas known to support the species are subject to continuing degradation by wood-cutters. Small patches of very humid forest, embedded in a matrix of unsuitable forest, are only likely to maintain their high humidity values when large areas of forest remain intact. Forest fragmentation in the hills above the now deforested coastal plain has been more intense than forest loss, but is likely to have caused an overall drying of the forest, which might have rendered formerly suitable patches of forest unsuitable (S. Mahood <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Whilst the species has been recorded in degraded habitats, it is uncertain whether it is able to persist in such conditions the long term (W. Duckworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2012). Hunting pressure from collectors of various forest-products poses a major threat, and the species may be affected by indiscriminate snaring (N. Brickle <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. Although galliformes can withstand extremely high levels of trapping (Brickle <em>et al.</em> 2008), they can be locally eliminated. Because trapping is indiscriminate and targeted at more resilient species of ground-dwelling birds such as Red Junglefowl <em>Gallus gallus</em>, it continues when numbers of other species such as Edwards’s Pheasant are severely reduced and uneconomically viable as a single species harvest. Through this mechanism, populations can be trapped to local extinction (BirdLife International 2001).  <br/><p></p>","The complete lack of records since 2000 suggests that any remaining wild population is now tiny (S.

Several other individuals were found in the Quang Tri and Thua Thien Hue Provinces, but the last confirmed recent record was in 2000, where one male was confiscated from a hunter and held in captivity in the Hai Lang District Forest Protection Department, Quang Tri. Between 1964 and 1994, there were &gt;30 records of the species, with a further record in 1999 (R.

In 2011, dedicated camera-trap surveys for the species in two relatively undisturbed sites, Khe Nuoc Trong Watershed Protection Forest and Quang Binh and Dakrong Nature Reserve, Quang Tri, failed to record the species (Le Trong Trai <em>in litt. </em>2012). <em>Lophura 'hatinhensis', </em>which was previously described as a species, is a mutation of <em>L. edwardsi</em> that has been observed at either end of, and within the known range of, <em>L. edwardsi</em>&#160;&#160;(J.

In Syria its population has declined dramatically over the past 30 years and is probably now extinct as a breeding population. At least 95% of truly wild birds are now concentrated in one subpopulation in Morocco. Numbers have increased owing to management actions and consequent improved breeding success, and potential new colonies have been discovered. Despite these increases the population size is still very small, and so the species is listed as Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour:&#160;</strong>The small Syrian population is migratory, but the larger western population is dispersive (del Hoyo <em>e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Breeding occurs in colonies of up to 40 pairs, beginning in mid-February, and eggs are laid in March-April (del Hoyo <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Colonies are vacated in late June or early July, but migration and dispersal do not commence until August, with birds recorded on the breeding grounds as late as November (<strong></strong>Cramp and Simmons<em>&#160;</em>1977)<strong></strong>. Some reside in Souss-Massa NP and around Tamri throughout the year (Bowden <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Juveniles tend to disperse over the longest distances (del Hoyo <em>et al<em>.</em></em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Movements appear to be to some extent determined by rainfall (Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Migrating birds from the Syrian population do not arrive in their Ethiopian winter quarters before December (Cramp&#160;and Simmons 1977)<strong></strong>. All return to their breeding colonies in February and March (Cramp&#160;and Simmons&#160;1977)<strong></strong>. Birds in general are gregarious throughout the year (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species forages in loose groups with birds well spread out, but commutes in flocks between the colony or roost and the feeding grounds (Cramp&#160;and Simmons 1977)<strong></strong>. Winter flocks vary from a few individuals to over 100 (Cramp&#160;and Simmons&#160;1977)<strong></strong>. Breeding performance is highly variable from one year to the next (Bowden <em>et al.</em> 2003), but does not appear to be related to rainfall in the vicinity of the colonies as previously reported elsewhere. It is suggested that coastal fogs in the Souss-Massa region may buffer the adverse impacts of low rainfall, and may in part account for the year-round residency of the birds<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Bowden <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/><br/>Habitat:&#160;</strong><em>Breeding </em>Colonies are usually situated in rocky areas, cliffs and escarpments  in remote arid regions (Cramp&#160;and Simmons 1977)<strong></strong>. In the past castles, ruins and walls were used as nest sites even in urban areas (<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. They are often located near the banks of rivers, along streams or on the coast (<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992). Birds may feed on dry ground and rocky slopes, as well as in wetlands, on coastal sandy strips, on river beds and in sandy banks on the sea shore<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Roosts away from the breeding site can be in trees, on cliff ledges or sometimes in fields<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>During the non-breeding season it may be found in mountain meadows, stubble fields, short grass, rocky semi-arid ground, and damp ground in lower areas of high plateaus (<strong></strong>Hancock <em>e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992).<em> </em>It prefers areas with very sparse vegetation, but sometimes frequents pastures and cultivated fields (Aghnaj <em>e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 2001)<strong></strong>. It avoids tilled fields and pastures where the grass exceeds 25 cm in height<strong> </strong>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et<em> al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992). Birds that migrate to Ethiopia during the non-breeding season feed on high moors, wet meadows and by fast-flowing mountain streams and lake margins up to 3,500 m elevation<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/><br/>Diet:&#160;</strong>It has a broad diet, feeding on any available animal life (Aghnaj <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 2001) including insects, arachnids, scorpions, earthworms, snails and vertebrates such as fish, amphibians, lizards and snakes, small rodents and small birds, whether alive or dead<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et a<em>l</em></em><em>.</em> 1992). It will also feed on vegetation including berries, shoots, duckweed, and rhizomes of aquatic plants (<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992).  <p></p>","The species has been in decline for several centuries, perhaps partly owing to unidentified natural causes. However, the more recent rapid decline is undoubtedly the result of a combination of factors, with different threats affecting different populations. Hunting was the main threat to the tiny Syrian population, and overgrazing and collecting of firewood have reduced habitat quality in feeding areas, with food availability declining during the pre-dispersal period when the species's nutritional requirements are high (Lindsell <em>et al</em>. 2011). The ongoing conflict in Syria makes it very difficult to assess current threats and whether the species persists there. Prior to the conflict, suspected threats were; construction of a well at a main feeding site;&#160;disturbance from other human activities, and this population was also potentially threatened by trophy hunters, combined with a lack of safe areas with water sources (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The integrity of the protected area at the Syrian breeding colonies was potentially threatened by oil concessions, infrastructure development and plans for urbanisation (Serra<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et <em>al</em></span><em>.</em> 2009, Murdoch 2010). Satellite tracking of juvenile birds indicates that the main threat to the eastern population was mortality from hunting in the Arabian Peninsula. Three birds tagged in summer 2010 did not survive their first winter (R. Grimmett<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in l<em>itt</em></span><em>.</em> 2011). Breeding productivity in Syria in 2005 was zero: local rangers reported predation as the cause. The most serious nest predator had been Brown-necked Raven&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Corvus ruficollis</span>, however, predation by Egyptian Vulture&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Neophron percnopterus</span>&#160;on young ibis chicks was also suspected (Serra&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009). The Birecik subpopulation has also suffered from losses to predation in some years (J. Tavares pers. comm. 2008). At Souss-Massa NP, the most recent causes of breeding failure have been loss of eggs to predators and, more importantly, poor chick survival as a result of starvation and predation (Bowden<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;et al.&#160;</span>2003).<br/>In Turkey, a major historical threat was poisoning and reduced breeding success caused by pesticides used against locusts and mosquitoes (Murdoch 2010). In Morocco, illegal building and disturbance close to the breeding cliffs and changes in farming on the feeding grounds are the threats that may have the most severe impact on the population. A proposed tourist development at the national park could prove detrimental to the birds if it is not constructed in a sensitive way (Anon. 2009). Poisoning was originally suspected to be the cause of death of three tagged individuals found in Jordan, however electrocution whilst standing on electricity pylons is now believed to have been the most likely cause (Anon 2009). On the Ethiopian wintering grounds disturbance of the last few birds, as well as rainfall shortages have been identified as threats in the short-term (Serra <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the longer term, conversion of pastures to crops and increasing use of fertilisers and pesticides are likely to threaten wintering birds (Serra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). Illegal hunting in Italy has been identified as a key threat to birds undertaking human-led migration from captive breeding populations in the Alps (Wald 2014).<p></p>","In Souss-Massa National Park and Tamri, Morocco in 2015, 116 pairs raised 205 fledglings with a total of 580 individuals present at the end of the breeding season (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2015). In 2014, 115 pairs produced 192 young which went on to fledge (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2014). In 2013,&#160;113 pairs (i.e. 226 mature individuals) nested, out of 319 adults, and produced 148 fledged young with a total of 443 birds at the end of the breeding season (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2013, J. F. Orueta <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In 2011, 110 pairs produced 138 fledged young (J. F. Orueta <em>in litt</em>. 2016), matching the breeding success of 2010, when 105 pairs fledged 138 young (R. Grimmett <em>in litt.</em> 2011). After the breeding season the total number of birds in the western population may have exceeded 500 in 2011-2012 (IAGNBI 2012), and almost reached 600 individuals in 2015 (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2015). Only a single mature female returned to Syria in 2013 (C. Bowden <em>in litt.</em> 2013) and again in 2014, but reportedly no birds returned in 2015 (Serra 2015). The last successful breeding record in Syria is from 2011 when a single breeding pair fledged two young (R. Grimmett <em>in litt.</em> 2011). The Turkish population now numbers around 100 individuals (IAGNBI 2012), but these managed birds are excluded from the total estimate. The species is considered Regionally Extinct in Europe (BirdLife International 2015).",Stable,"<em></em>The historical range of the species probably extended throughout North Africa and into the Middle East. However, since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century the species has been known from two disjunct populations: a western population in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Morocco</span> and an eastern population in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Turkey </span>and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Syria</span>. In Morocco it is found at Souss-Massa National Park (Souss-Massa NP) (338 km<sup>2</sup>, three sub-colonies) and at nearby Tamri (one colony, half the breeding population) (Bowden 1998), with some movement of birds between these two; and in 2017 two new breeding sites were identified (Aourir <em>et al. </em>2017). In 1995, the Moroccan population was estimated at 300 individuals (74 breeding pairs that laid eggs) (Bowden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et a<em>l</em></span><em>.</em> 2003). In 1998, it had declined to 59 pairs, following the mysterious death of 40 birds in 1996 (Bowden 1998, Touti<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et <em>al</em></span><em>. </em>1999),  but by 2015 there were 116 pairs that laid eggs (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2015). Importantly, since 1980 there has been no overall decline in  numbers at Souss-Massa NP (Bowden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et <em>al</em></span><em>.</em>  2003). At present the population in Morocco is stable. In 2014, the total number of birds in Morocco was estimated at 524 individuals, with 115 pairs successfully raising 192 young which went on to fledge (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2014); and in 2015 there were 116 pairs, 205 fledglings and 580 birds at the end of the breeding season (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2015). These breeding numbers are the best since detailed records began 30 years ago (Safford unpubl. 2016). There is some cause for optimism that former areas  may soon be recolonised (C. Bowden<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2006), this is supported by observations of groups of up to 12 birds (both adults and sub-adults) in areas within the species's former range (J. F. Orueta <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The eastern population was believed to have died out, however in 2002 a tiny colony, consisting of just seven individuals, was rediscovered at Palmyra in Syria (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et<em> al</em></span><em>. </em>2004). Having barely been rediscovered, this population now looks as though it will once more be lost, with just a single individual returning to the colony in 2013 (C. Bowden <em>in litt.</em> 2013) and again in 2014, and reportedly no birds returning in 2015 (Serra 2015).&#160;Being migratory, the Syrian population is behaviourally distinct from the Moroccan one, from which it is thought to have separated long ago. During the six breeding seasons following the rediscovery (2002-2007), the three, and then two, pairs bred well and a total of 24 chicks fledged and left the breeding area successfully (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et <em>al</em></span><em>.</em> 2009). Between 2004 and 2007, five immature ibises returned to the colony (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et <em>al</em></span><em>.</em> 2009). In 2008, breeding failed with four chicks dying, probably due to predation by Brown-necked Raven <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Corvus ruficollis</span> (Hirschfeld 2008). The causes of failed breeding in 2009 are uncertain, but intraspecific disturbance and low spring rainfall are possible factors (Murdoch 2010). In 2011, a single breeding pair fledged two young (R. Grimmett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in li<em>tt</em></span><em>.</em> 2011), but the same pair failed to breed in 2012 (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2012). Searches in 2003 for further colonies within the Syrian steppes proved fruitless (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et a<em>l</em></span><em>.</em> 2004). <br/><br/>Satellite-tagging has revealed that the Syrian population migrates south through <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Jordan </span>and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Saudi Arabia</span>; six birds spent three weeks in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Yemen </span>(July-August), then wintering in central <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ethiopia</span>; migrating back to Syria, through <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Eritrea</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sudan</span>, Saudi Arabia and Jordan in February (Lindsell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span><em>.</em> 2009); with very few individuals located in Ethiopia in the winter over recent years (Serra and Wondafrash 2009), with the most recent sightings being three adults in winter 2014 (Bowden 2014) and only one individual seen since 2015, which is suspected to have come from Syria (C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;Records of untagged birds in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Israel </span>and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Djibouti </span>in late 2007 may relate to immature birds from the Syrian colony or birds from an as yet undiscovered population (Hirschfeld 2008). A semi-wild population numbering 91 individuals in 2006 exists at Birecik, Turkey (J. Tavares <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in<em> litt</em></span><em>.</em> 2007), where birds are free-flying for five months, breeding on natural nest sites and nest-boxes on cliffs, but are taken into captivity after the breeding season to prevent them from migrating (G. Eken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in<em> litt</em></span><em>.</em> 2005, J. Tavares <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in<em> litt</em></span><em>.</em> 2007). Three birds from the colony migrated in 2009 travelling via the Palmyra site. However, three were found dead in Jordan (Niemann 2009). In 2013, six individuals were selected to remain in the wild and at least five of these migrated south in August stopping very close to the Palmyra site (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2013). However in September 2013 the birds moved westwards towards Homs and a few days later all three tagged birds stopped transmitting (Bowden 2013), for unknown reasons, but hunting and electrocution on power lines are possible causes of mortality.<br/><br/>Historically, the species occurred across parts of southern Europe, and reintroduction projects are underway for a migratory population in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Austria </span>and<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> Germany&#160;</span>(numbering c.30 individuals [Wald 2014]) which has been successfully trained to winter in Tuscany, Italy (Waldrappteam 2014a, b); and the reintroduction a more sedentary population has been initiated in Andalusia,&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spain</span>, with a long-term aim to re-establish the species (C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2016). There are currently around 1,200 studbook registered individuals in European zoos (Wald 2014) and probably a further 800 unregistered birds of Moroccan origin (C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Around 190 birds were released in Spain between 2004 and 2009 (Boehm and Bowden 2010), and in 2008 a released pair laid two eggs, perhaps the first breeding of the species in the wild in Spain for 500 years (Hirschfeld 2008). Up to 24 breeding adults were present on three breeding cliffs in 2013 (Jordano and Márquez 2013) and 25 breeding pairs in 2014 (UvA Bird Tracking System <em>undated</em>). However, predation by eagle-owls has meant a near-complete breeding failure there in 2017 (J. F. Orueta <em>in litt. </em>2017,&#160;M. Quevedo <em>in litt. </em>2017), and the population is not yet self-sustaining, with yearly restocking releases (A. Cunningham <em>in litt</em>. 2017). There have been some sightings of some Spanish re-introduced individuals crossing to Morocco (e.g.&#160;Muñoz and Ramírez 2017), although these predominantly appear to be hand-reared juveniles (Bowden <em>et al. </em>2018).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. CMS Appendix I and II. In 1999, an international advisory group IAGNBI was created to coordinate efforts and provide scientific advice (Bowden 2001)<strong></strong>. The IAGNBI met in August 2016 (Boehm and Bowden 2016, C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The eastern sub-population is listed as Critically Endangered in the regional Red List for the Arabian Peninsula (Symes <em>et al. </em>2015). An international species action plan was published in 2006. An African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) International Working Group was established in 2012 and a revised International Single Species Action Plan (ISSAP) for the Conservation of the Northern Bald Ibis was approved by AEWA in 2015 (C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The revised ISSAP has four objectives to be achieved by 2025: increase reproductive success; reduce adult/juvenile mortality; establish new colonies; fill key knowledge gaps (Bowden 2015).<br/>Over 1,000 individuals of the western population exist in captivity worldwide, but birds from the eastern population are much rarer in captivity (four Turkish zoos hold 20 birds and participate in an <em>ex situ</em> breeding operation&#160;[Böhm 2004]). An international studbook was discontinued in 1998<strong> </strong>(Böhm 2004). An <em>in situ</em> breeding programme at Birecik aims to establish a partially captive population of 150 birds to provide birds for release to the wild population if this action is agreed in future <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Böhm 2004)<strong></strong>. Supplementary feeding is conducted for the Turkish population, but there is no evidence that this increases productivity (Yeniyurt <em>et al. </em>2017). Colour-ringing of young at Birecik has begun and there were plans to attach satellite transmitters to a family party in July 2007 (J. Tavares <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. A captive breeding centre has been built at Ain Tijja-Mezguitem, north-eastern Morocco, and is stocked with zoo-bred birds imported in 2000 and 2004 (WAZA www.waza.org). In 2004, an information centre was also constructed. Six pairs bred in 2006 and successfully reared six offspring. In 2007, the aviary contained 19 birds (13 adults and six juveniles). The centre was closed in 2016 with the remaining birds transferred to Rabat Zoo (J. F. Orueta <em>in litt</em>. 2016). A reintroduction was planned once the population has reached around 40 birds (WAZA www.waza.org). Other captive breeding schemes exist or are planned in Austria, Spain and Italy, and programmes of releasing captive birds are either in progress or in the experimental phase in Bavaria, Spain, and Italy (N. Schaffer <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2007, UNEP/CMS 2008, Fritz 2010)<strong></strong>. In southern Spain, a total of 190 birds were released between 2004 and 2009 (Boehm and Bowden 2010). Although juvenile mortality has been high, the first breeding pair was formed on nearby cliffs in 2008. A small independent non-migratory colony is now becoming well established in the area (Matheu <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;There are two introduced populations in the Alps, totalling 30 individuals, in Burghausen (Germany) and Salzburg (Austria) (Wald 2014). These birds have undertaken human-led migration to Orbetello Lagoon in Tuscany, Italy and in 2011 the first wild bird independently migrated from Italy to Burghausen (Waldrappteam 2014a). There have been experimental field studies of the feeding ecology of hand-raised individuals in potential summer and winter habitat in Europe (Zoufal <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. An EU LIFE+ project was initiated in 2013 (Waldrappteam 2014b). The primary objective of the project is to re-establish migratory breeding colonies in Germany and Austria which will winter in Italy. A small breeding colony already exists in Burghausen (Germany) and a further two colonies are to be established in Kuchl (Austria) and Uberlingen (Germany) (Waldrappteam 2014b). By 2019 the colonies should consist of at least 119 individuals (Fritz 2014). The project also aims to reduce illegal hunting of the species in Italy (Anon. 2014).&#160;In Turkey, efforts have focused on increasing the semi-wild population through better husbandry, and now awareness-raising activities are ongoing, targeting locals and particularly farmers, focusing on the ecological importance of the species and the negative effects of using pesticides (Hatipoglu 2009, C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In 1991, the Souss-Massa National Park was designated specifically to protect nesting and feeding areas<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Bowden <em>et al.</em> 2003) and in 1994, a monitoring and research programme was set up involving local people (Bowden 1998)<strong></strong>. The provision of freshwater near the breeding colonies in the national park has been shown experimentally to increase productivity, buffering individuals against the impacts of low rainfall, and is now an ongoing conservation measure (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. The Palmyra project in Syria has initiated a research and protection programme in collaboration with local communities, however the current security situation means any work on the species is very difficult. Three birds were satellite-tagged there in June 2006 (Anon. 2006)<strong></strong>, and one in 2007; giving an indication of the migratory route of Syrian individuals. Syria's first local conservation society, the Palmyra Society for the Protection of Environment and Wildlife, aims to develop ecotourism in the area (Anon. 2008)<strong></strong>. The breeding area in Syria was declared a protected area in 2004 by Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform. It was also declared as an IBA by BirdLife in 2007. Ecotourism and awareness raising has been promoted throughout the range. Conservation action to date has focused on reducing the negative influences on breeding success, but it is recognised that for such a long-lived bird, adult survival is also likely to be an important limiting factor on the population size. Plans to release young birds from the Birecik colony in Syria during 2009 were halted by delays in obtaining permissions from the Turkish authorities, although it was hoped that this would be possible in 2010<strong> </strong>(Anon. 2008). Five birds were released from the Birecik colony in 2013 and fitted with satellite tags but these birds were lost over Syria and future releases halted to prevent further losses (Safford unpubl. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct research into feeding and breeding biology, and habitat requirements (Brindley <em>et al.</em> 1995), and investigate (safety concerns allowing) whether the eastern subpopulation persists.

Fritz <em>in litt. </em>2017]).&#160;Explore the possibility of reintroducing captive-bred birds into previously occupied sites (when detailed information on ecological requirements is available) (Brindley <em>et al.</em> 1995, Mendelssohn 1994, Bowden 2001)<strong></strong>.

Protect potential wintering areas in Ethiopia in case the eastern subpopulation persists. Raise awareness among hunters on the migration route (Anon. 2006)<strong></strong>.

The population is undergoing a continuing decline owing to hunting, nesting disturbance and the modification and burning of its habitat. <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is mostly sedentary, although it may make some movements in order to find optimal feeding habitat as water levels vary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. In South Sudan there are regular seasonal movements between feeding and breeding zones<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Guillet 1978)<strong></strong>. It is very solitary. Even within the pair, male and female will often feed at opposite ends of their territory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Loose aggregations may occasionally occur where receding water levels and large numbers of fish become concentrated in a small area (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It breeds solitarily, usually maintaining a density of fewer than three nests per square kilometre (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). The breeding season is long. Eggs are laid at the end of the rains, as waters start to recede, and chicks fledge towards the end of the dry season (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat </strong><em>Breeding </em>It both breeds and forages in seasonally flooded marshes, but may utilise separate habitats for foraging and breeding (Renson 1998, Ngwenyama 2012).<strong></strong> The vegetation in these flooded marshes is dominated by a mixture of papyrus <em>Cyperus papyrus</em>, reeds e.g. <em>Phragmites</em> spp., cattails<em> </em><em>Typha</em> spp. and grasses, particularly <em>Miscanthidium</em> spp. (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992).<em> </em>It is often found in areas with abundant floating vegetation, often papyrus (Baker 1996)<strong></strong>. It also uses permanent non-papyrus swamps in areas such as the Malagarasi (Tanzania) (Dinesen and Baker 2006) and Lake Victoria (Uganda)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Dinesen <em>in litt</em>. 2007). <em>Non-breeding </em>It usually forages in shallow water (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong><strong></strong> where it makes use of clear channels among the vegetation that have been created by the movements of large mammals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It tends to avoid areas where the vegetation is too dense to be penetrated easily, or is taller than the bird's back (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). It is reported to prefer water that is poorly oxygenated, where fish are forced to surface to breathe, and are thus more easily caught (Guillet 1978)<strong></strong>, which is why it is thought not to frequent swamps that are characterised by papyrus alone (Guillet 1978). In South Sudan it has been known to forage on rice fields and other flooded plantations (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992).<strong> Diet </strong>When feeding, it shows a preference for lungfish <em>Protopterus aethiopicus</em>, but takes a variety of fish species including Senegal Bichir <em>Polypterus senegalus</em>, catfish <em>Clarias</em> spp. and tilapia <em>Tilapia </em>spp. (Guillet 1979, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. It also preys on aquatic animals such as amphibians, young crocodiles and watersnakes (Briggs 2007<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">, </span>Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992), and may even take rodents and young waterfowl (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). Diet seems to vary geographically: lungfish and catfish are the main prey species in Uganda, and catfish and watersnakes the preferred diet in Zambia (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992, Mullers and Amar 2015a).<strong> Breeding site </strong>The nest is grassy construction, up to 3 m wide, on a mound of floating vegetation or a small island (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>, and often among dense stands of papyrus (Hancock <em>et al.</em> 1992). The maximum clutch size is three, although usually only one nestling will survive, with rare records of two chicks fledging (Mullers and Amar 2015b). The species can live for around 50 years (although it is likely to live less long in the wild [R. Mullers <em>in litt. </em>2016]),&#160;takes three to four years to reach reproductive maturity, and is monogamous.<strong> </strong> <p></p>","Throughout most of its range, the species is threatened by habitat destruction and degradation, disturbance, hunting, and capture for the bird trade (see Collar and Stuart 1985, Baker 1996, T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002). Suitable habitat is being converted for cultivation and pasture, and cattle have been known to trample nests (Briggs 2007), while in Uganda and the Sudd exploration for oil may impact this species by altering its habitat and the oil polluting the environment (Dodman 2013). Pollution may also be significant in Uganda, where agrochemicals and tannery effluents run off or are disposed of into Lake Victoria (Dodman 2013). The species is hunted for food and cultural reasons, for example it may be viewed as a bad omen. It is also captured for the zoo trade, which is a problem especially in Tanzania where trading of the species is still legal (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>. Interviews with people in the Bangweulu Wetlands (Zambia) indicate that eggs and chicks are taken for consumption and sale, probably to zoos or collectors (Roxburgh <em>et al. </em>2006). Five chicks per month were estimated as taken for trade in one district in 2011, with only two individuals surviving the transit (D. Ngwenyama <em>in litt</em>. 2011). In 2007, an undisclosed number of specimens, illegally imported from Tanzania, were confiscated by the Danish authorities in Copenhagen<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Dinesen <em>in litt</em>. 2007) and at least two birds were exported from Tanzania to a zoo in the USA (T. Dodman <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Small-scale trading poses a serious threat to small local populations rather than the global population (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>, though recent reports suggest that levels of disturbance and trade are not sustainable in Zambia (T. Dodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in litt. </span>2011). Breeding success may be as low as 10% annually in Bangweulu, mainly due to human disturbance (Mullers and Amar 2015b). During the 2011-2013 breeding seasons, only 10 out of 25 chicks successfully fledged: four chicks were killed in fires, one was depredated&#160;and 10 were taken by humans (R. Muller <em>in litt. </em>2016). In Zambia, fire and drought threaten habitat (especially in Bangweulu, where a decline is apparent) (T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002)<strong></strong>, there is some evidence for trapping and persecution (T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002)<strong></strong>, and nests are trampled by large herbivores feeding in the swamps (Renson 1998)<strong></strong>. Conflict in Rwanda and DRC has disrupted protected areas (e.g. Akagera National Park) that support the species (T. Dodman <em>in litt. </em>2002)<strong></strong>, and the proliferation of firearms has greatly facilitated hunting. In South Sudan, its stronghold, it has been said to be ""very much endangered by destruction of papyrus swamps by cattle and fire"" (Nikolaus 1987)<strong></strong>. Between 1952 and 1980 the area of the Sudd swamps of South Sudan increased (Howell <em>et al.</em> 1988)<strong></strong> from 6,700 km<sup>2</sup> to 19,200 km<sup>2</sup>. Whilst this habitat was earlier threatened by drainage due to plans for the Jonglei Canal, these plans are no longer supported, though canalisation and related schemes for the oil industry do pose a threat&#160; (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> 2008). The construction of several dams along the lower Nile will allow artificial manipulation of water levels in the Sudd (Briggs 2007)<strong></strong>. In the Malagarasi, large areas of miombo woodland adjacent to swamps are being cleared for tobacco farming and agriculture, and the human population, which includes fishermen, farmers and semi-nomadic pastoralists, has increased very rapidly in recent decades (Dinesen and Baker 2006). In this region, dry-season burning and cattle-grazing in the species's core area are severe and expanding, and the first rice paddies have appeared at the edge of the species's key swamps. Over four years only 7 of 13 nests were successful at this location (John <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;Also in Malagarasi, a railway line has bisected swamps and rice paddies in some of its core areas<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Dinesen <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Records of birds outside their core areas may be due to the displacement of birds by fires in dry years <strong></strong>(Dinesen and Baker 2006).<p></p>","The total population has been estimated at 5,000-8,000 individuals (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> 2002), and a total population estimate of fewer than 10,000 individuals is supported by Dinesen and Baker (2006). The range of 5,000-8,000 individuals roughly equates to 3,300-5,300 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Balaeniceps rex</em> is widely but very locally distributed in large swamps from <strong>South Sudan</strong> to <strong>Zambia</strong>. Approximate national estimates proposed by T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> to Wetlands International (2002) are: c.5,000 in South Sudan (50-80% of the total population [Briggs 2007]), 100-150 in <strong>Uganda</strong> (but possibly over 200 [Briggs 2007]),<strong>&#160;</strong><strong></strong>100-500 in western <strong>Tanzania</strong> (this figure also proposed by Dinesen and Baker [2006]), &lt;500 in<strong> Zambia</strong><strong> </strong>(Roxburgh and Buchanan<em> </em>[2010] gave a later estimate of 1,760, with 1,296 in the Bangweulu Swamps alone, but this is possibly an over-estimate [F. Willems <em>in litt. </em>2016]), &lt;1,000 in the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo </strong>(DRC), irregular visitors in the <strong>Central African Republic</strong>, &lt;50 in <strong>Rwanda</strong><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>&lt;50 in<strong> Ethiopia</strong>. In 1997, the population was estimated to be 12,000-15,000 individuals (Rose and Scott 1997), but a more recent review makes a conservative estimate of 5,000-8,000 individuals (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> to Wetlands International 2002). This figure may prove too low, depending on research into the South Sudan populations (T. Dodman <em>in litt.</em> to Wetlands International 2002). An estimate of 3,830 birds was given for the Sudd (including areas of Zeraf Reserve) by Fay <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2007).

136266699,9194,Giraffa camelopardalis,Vulnerable,A2acd,2018,2016-07-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Giraffe (<em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>) is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion A2 due to an observed, past (and ongoing) population decline of 36-40% over three generations (30 years, 1985-2015). The factors causing this decline (levels of exploitation and decline in area of occupancy and habitat quality) have not ceased and may not be reversible throughout the species’ range. The best available estimates indicate a total population in 1985 of 151,702-163,452 Giraffes (106,191-114,416 mature individuals), and in 2015 a total population of 97,562 Giraffes (68,293 mature individuals). Historically the species has been overlooked in terms of research and conservation, but in the past five years, considerable progress has been made in compiling and producing a species-wide assessment of population size and distribution by the members of the IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group. Some Giraffe populations are stable or increasing, while others are declining, and each population is subject to pressure by threats specific to their local country or region. The populations of Giraffes are scattered and fragmented with different growth trajectories and threats, but the species trend reveals an overall large decline in numbers across their range in Africa.","About one million years ago, multiple ungulate species, including at least three Giraffe species, spread over the African continent along with the emerging savanna/woodland biome (Mitchell and Skinner 2003, Robinson 2011). But between 600,000 and 800,000 years ago, only a single species, <em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>, is found in the fossil record. The adaptive radiation of Giraffes across Africa occurred during a period of environmental instability, climate change, and geological upheavals that produced distinctive lineages living in mostly disconnected areas of Africa (Bock <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014, Fennessy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, Groves and Grubb 2011, Brown <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007, Hassanin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007). Continued natural, as well as human-induced, changes in habitat have yielded a suture zone in Eastern Africa, as well as possibly Northern and Southern Africa, that impedes our ability to mark specific boundaries between the various kinds of Giraffes. Hence, Giraffes evolved an ability to adapt to a variety of ecosystems and, as they did so, lineages emerged in different regions where they evolved distinctive characteristics, but whether these traits are significant enough to consider the differences as species or subspecies is unclear at the moment.<br/><br/>Giraffes are most often found in savanna/woodland habitats, but range widely throughout Africa. They are browsers that subsist on a variable diet that includes leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. They do not need to drink on a daily basis. Across the continent, detailed records of Giraffe feeding ecology have noted that each population has a very diverse diet of up to 93 different species, but that usually a half dozen plant species comprise at least 75% of the diet. <em>Acacia</em> is fed on in high proportions wherever Giraffes are found, but during the dry season, the preferred plant species varies by location. <em>Faidherbia, Boscia, Grewia</em>, and <em>Kigelia</em> have all been identified as the most common plant species in the diet of giraffes in the dry season in different locations. Some populations have seasonal shifts in home ranges.","Four major threats to Giraffes can be identified, although the severity and presence of these threats varies by region and population: (1) habitat loss (through deforestation, land use conversion, expansion of agricultural activities and human population growth) (2) civil unrest (ethnic violence, rebel militias, paramilitary and military operations), (3) illegal hunting (poaching), and (4) ecological changes (mining activity, habitat conversion to agriculture, climate-induced processes). In Southern Africa, the main perceived threats are habitat loss and conversion of land for human development, and illegal hunting. In West Africa, the main threats are habitat loss due to increasing human populations and human-wildlife conflict. In Eastern and Central Africa the main threats are habitat loss through rapid conversion of land for farming and increasing human populations, drought, illegal hunting for meat and hide, and armed conflict throughout unstable regions.<br/><br/>Some of the highest human fertility rates in the world (&gt;4%) occur in countries where Giraffes are present. Natural habitat changes from weather irregularities result in situations generating human movement, sometimes into protected, or semi-protected, areas. Drought conditions have become more common and increase the prospects of bush fires, loss of habitat, and human population movements. Substantial human population migration also characterizes regions and areas with military operations in giraffe habitats. In some countries (e.g., Namibia, South Africa) the hunting of Giraffes is legal, but Giraffe population sizes there are increasing; in other countries (e.g., Tanzania) the poaching of Giraffes is associated with declines in Giraffe population size. Habitat fragmentation and degradation are probably the most widespread and greatest threats to African wildlife, including Giraffes, often arising as a consequence of mineral extraction and/or habitat conversion to agricultural crops.","Historically this species has been overlooked in terms of research and conservation, but in the past five years, considerable progress has been made in compiling and producing a species-wide assessment of population size and distribution by members of the IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group (IUCN SSC GOSG).<br/><br/>The generation length calculated by Pacifici <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2013) is not based upon lifetime data from field work. They report maximum longevity of 37.4 years, despite the consensus among field biologists that Giraffes live for less than 30 years in the wild (Dagg and Foster 1982, Estes 1991, du Toit 2009, Bercovitch and Berry 2010b). They suggest a reproductive lifespan of 32.4 years, which surpasses the interval between average age at first birth in the wild (6.4 years, Bercovitch and Berry 2010b) and the oldest documented age at giving birth in the wild (24 years, Bercovitch and Berry 2010b). Given that no age-specific reproductive rates have been published for Giraffes in the wild, and that the only lifetime data to have been published indicates a maximum breeding lifespan of less than 18 years, the IUCN SSC GOSG consensus is that a generation length of 14.4 years is inaccurate and assumes a more likely generation length of 10 years. Therefore this assessment is based upon the best information available from the last 30 years (1985-2015). However, because the species resides in discrete subpopulations living in different regions of Africa that have not been the subject of a systematic survey from a single date, we have based historic estimates on the best available information for each subspecies that was obtained the closest in time to 1985 (three generations).<br/><br/>Historic and current estimates adopted a variety of methods that included both aerial and ground surveys, as well as photographic capture/re-capture, interviews and best estimates. Therefore, whilst the accuracy and quality of the data are somewhat inconsistent, the population counts contain the most reliable information currently available. The historical and current estimates of population size in all nine recognized subspecies, and the global totals are summarized in Table 1 (see the Supplementary Material). Several populations of Giraffe, resident in northern Botswana, northwest Zimbabwe, northeastern Namibia and southwestern Zambia, are potentially either <em>Giraffa c. angolensis</em>, or <em>G. c. giraffa</em>. These are provisionally lumped into <em>G. c. angolensis</em> for purposes of establishing the total population counts, pending further taxonomic research.<br/><br/>These estimates show in total that numbers were 151,702-163,452 in 1985 and 97,562 in 2015. The IUCN SSC GOSG pan-African database revealed that approximately 70%  of individuals within a population could be considered ‘mature’ for  status assessment purposes (IUCN SSC GOSG meeting, August 2015). These figures therefore represent approximately 106,191-114,416 mature individuals in 1985 and 68,293 in 2015, representing a decline of 36-40% in the number of mature individuals over the three generations. The factors causing observed population declines (levels of exploitation and decline in area of occupancy) have not ceased and may not be reversible throughout the species’ range. Some Giraffe populations are stable or increasing, while others are declining, and each population is subject to pressure from threats specific to their local country or region, but the species-level trend reveals an overall large decline in numbers across their range in Africa.<br/><br/>The populations of Giraffes are scattered and fragmented with different growth trajectories and threats. Based upon the IUCN SSC GOSG population assessments and subspecies status surveys, the number of Giraffes in Eastern Africa is generally decreasing, while populations in Southern Africa are generally increasing. The only Giraffe population in West Africa is increasing, while those in Central Africa are, in general, decreasing. The population sizes of the nine subspecies varies widely, with two of them (<em>G. c. giraffa </em>and <em>G. c. tippelskirchi</em>) accounting for close to half of Giraffes living in Africa, while the other seven subspecies live in scattered, fragmented populations, with some numbering fewer than 1,000 animals.<br/><br/>Of the nine subspecies, four are increasing (<em>G. c. angolensis, G. c. giraffa, G. c. peralta,&#160;</em><em>G. c. rothschildi</em>), four are decreasing (<em>G. c. antiquorum, G. c. camelopardalis, G. c. reticulata, G. c. tippelskirchi</em>), and one is stable (<em>G. c. thornicrofti</em>). See Table 1 in the Supplementary Material.<br/><br/>One possible indicator of a continent-wide trend in population-wide declines over time relates to Giraffe herd sizes. Late 19th and early 20th century explorers and hunters commented on the large size of Giraffe herds, often some 20-30 animals. However, on average many Giraffe herds studied today contain fewer than six individuals (Brand 2007, Bercovitch and Berry 2010a, Carter <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013, VanderWaal <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). In the Seronera region of Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, from the mid-1970s to 2010 both the average herd size, and the maximum herd size, have halved, from nine to 4.3 and from 77 to 38, respectively (Strauss <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). However, smaller herd sizes need not reflect declines in population sizes, but could reflect more segmented and scattered groups resulting from human changes to the landscape. In general, larger herds are sighted in more open areas (Bercovitch and Berry 2010a), and over 50 animals are still sometimes recorded (M. Brown unpubl. data).<br/><br/>In Eastern Africa, <em>G. c. camelopardalis</em> has declined from an historic estimate of 20,577 individuals in 1979/1981 to the current estimate of 650 individuals (-97%, Wube <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. tippelskirchi</em> has declined from an historic estimate of 63,292 individuals to the current estimate of 35,000 individuals (-50%, Bolger <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. reticulata</em> has declined from an historic estimate of 36,000-47,750 individuals to the current estimate of 8,661 individuals (Kenya Wildlife Service in preparation, Doherty <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. rothschildi</em> has increased from an historic estimate of 1,331 individuals in the 1960s to the current estimate of 1,671 individuals within their natural range (26%, Fennessy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. thornicrofti</em> has stabilized at close to 600 individuals since 1973 (Berry and Bercovitch 2016), following an increase from approximately 300 giraffes in the early 1970s (Bercovitch <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>In Southern Africa, <em>G. c. angolensis</em> has increased from an historic estimate of 5,000 individuals to the current estimate of 13,031 individuals (+161%, Marais <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). <em>Giraffa c. giraffa</em> has increased from an historic estimate of 8,000 individuals to the current estimate of over 21,387 individuals (+167%, Deacon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016). The population resident in the north eastern Namibia, northern Botswana, northwestern Zambia and northwestern and central Zimbabwe are of uncertain taxonomic status and are considered as <em>Giraffa c. angolensis</em> for this report, and are estimated to have increased from approximately 10,000 historically to the current estimate of 17,551 (J. Fennessy, unpubl. data). <br/><br/>In Central Africa, <em>G. c. antiquorum</em> has decreased from an historic estimate of 3,696 individuals to the current estimate of 2,000 individuals (-46%, Fennessy and Marais 2016).<br/><br/>In West Africa <em>G. c. peralta</em> has increased from an historic estimate of at least 50 individuals to the current estimate of 400 individuals (+700%, Fennessy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).",Decreasing,"This species is the world's tallest land mammal and remains widespread across southern and eastern Africa, with smaller isolated populations in west and central Africa. Giraffes inhabit eighteen African countries and have been reintroduced to three others (Malawi, Rwanda, and Swaziland). Giraffes from South Africa have been introduced to Senegal. Giraffes appear to have gone extinct in at least seven countries (Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal). Giraffes have adapted to a variety of habitats, ranging from desert landscapes to woodland/savanna environments, but live in non-continuous, fragmented populations across sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Table 1 in the Supplementary Material summarizes the current conservation status of the nine subspecies. West African Giraffes (<em>Giraffa c. peralta</em>) are limited to an isolated population in the south-western corner of Niger and in 2008 this subspecies was categorized as Endangered on The IUCN Red List (Fennessy and Brown 2008). In Central Africa, <em>G. c. antiquorum</em> inhabit Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. East Africa is home to four subspecies of Giraffes, with three of them living in Kenya. <em>G. c. camelopardalis</em> occurs in both South Sudan and Ethiopia, although information regarding the area of occupancy of this population of Giraffes is limited. Giraffes living in north-eastern Kenya, and across the borders in south-eastern Ethiopia and south-western Somalia, are <em>G. c. reticulata</em>, those living in Uganda and introduced to central and southwest Kenya are categorized as <em>G. c. rothschildi </em>– and in 2010 this subspecies was categorized by the IUCN Red List as Endangered (Fennessy and Brenneman 2010), and those in southern Kenya, along with large tracts of Tanzania, are considered to be <em>G. c. tippelsckirchi</em>. In Southern Africa, the population living in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia, is <em>G. c. thornicrofti</em>. Angola, southern and northern Botswana, Mozambique, northeast Namibia, South Africa, and southwest Zambia are home to <em>G. c. giraffa</em>, whilst <em>G. c. angolensis</em> occurs in central Botswana and Namibia. Confusion still exists as to whether the giraffes in northern Botswana, north-eastern Namibia, south-western Zambia and north-western Zimbabwe are <em>G. c. angolensis</em> or <em>G. c. giraffa</em>, and for purposes of establishing the total population counts and trends here are lumped into <em>G. c. angolensis</em>.",Legal hunting of Giraffes occurs in parts of southern Africa. Illegal hunting for meat takes place in several parts of the range. There is some trade in live specimens between game ranches in southern Africa.,Terrestrial,"Given that some Giraffe populations are increasing, some are decreasing, and one seems to be stable, the conservation actions most useful and appropriate for Giraffes will differ as a function of Giraffe population dynamics, ecological stability, national policies, and legislation. Giraffes are subject to various degrees of legal protection in their range states. Large populations occur in national protected areas and on private farms, but many populations also exist in unprotected and communal areas. The main threats to the conservation of Giraffe populations are habitat loss, encroachment and conversion, and poaching.<br/>&#160; <br/>Conservation measures typically include habitat management and protection through law enforcement and community based conservation initiatives. Successful protection of habitat and cessation of habitat encroachment with the use of fences and border protection can result in large herds building up within an area. The continued growth of these populations however is limited by the ability of that ecosystem to support a particular number of Giraffes due to space, water and forage availability (i.e., limited carrying capacity).<br/><br/>In Niger, conservation projects and targeted community education and awareness programs have facilitated the re-bounding of the Giraffe population from a low of 49 individuals in the absence of official protected areas. However, habitat loss and drought remain as significant threats in this area. Importantly, the government was the first and remains the only range state to have developed a National Giraffe Conservation Strategy, and through this the conservation of the species has increased nearly eightfold in twenty years.<br/><br/>Kenya is finalising a National Giraffe Conservation Strategy which seeks to identify and implement a number of conservation interventions to conserve the three Giraffe subspecies (<em>Giraffa reticulata, G. rothschildi, G. tippelskirchi</em>) in the country. Rothschild’s Giraffes are accorded full protection under the Kenyan Wildlife (Conservation and Management) Act (Chapter 376) and in the Republic of Uganda Giraffe are protected under the Game (Preservation and Control) Act of 1959 (Chapter 198) and listed under Part A of the First Schedule of the Act as animals that may not be hunted or captured.<br/><br/>Throughout Eastern and Southern Africa, an increasing number of Giraffe translocations have repopulated former habitats with Giraffes, fostering wildlife enterprises including tourism and consumptive use, and maintaining genetic diversity given small, enclosed and fragmented populations.<br/><br/>Although one of the smallest populations in Africa lives in the Luangwa Valley, Zambia, the population has been stable for a number of years, so intervention as a conservation action is probably not warranted. Instead, continued monitoring of the population, combined with efforts to limit and control mineral extraction and land conversion, would be useful.<br/><br/>In Southern Africa, private ownership of Giraffes sometimes facilitates the gene flow between populations as animals are bought, sold and traded between farms. Perhaps a more controlled and systematic pattern of Giraffe translocations would help in the conservation of Giraffes.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

While Black Rhino numbers have more than doubled since bottoming out in the mid 1990s (due to increased protection and enhanced biological management to keep more subpopulations productive), the species qualifies as CR due to the scale of the decline in numbers over the past three generations as a result of very heavy poaching in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. Three generations ago (i.e., 44 years back in 1973) the point estimate for Black Rhinos was 37,807 rhinos and despite numbers more than doubling from a low of 2,354 were only 5,495 as of end 2017. This represents a decline over three generations of 85% qualifying as CR under criterion A2. An 83% reduction was projected one year (based on data up to and including 2017) into the future (from 1974–2018). This reduction was the same as observed in point estimates for these dates. The next worse projected reduction in point estimates over three generations was when modelling two years ahead from 1975–2019 (an 81% reduction from an estimated 28,674 in 1975). Numbers continue to increase at a continental-level although at a reduced rate due to the escalation of poaching since 2007.</p>","Black Rhino occur in a wide variety of habitats from desert areas in Namibia to wetter wooded areas. The highest densities of rhinos are found in savannas on nutrient-rich soils and in succulent Valley Bushveld areas. Black Rhino are browsers and favour small acacia's and other palatable woody species (<em>Grewia</em>'s<span style=""font-style: italic;"">,</span> Euphorbiaceae species, etc.) as well as palatable herbs and succulents. However, because of high levels of secondary plant chemicals, much woody plant browse (especially many evergreen species) in some areas is unpalatable. Failure to appreciate this, has in the past led to carrying capacities being over-estimated in some areas. Apart from plant species composition and size structure, Black Rhino carrying capacity is related to rainfall, soil nutrient status, fire histories, levels of grass interference, extent of frost and densities of other large browsers. To maintain rapid population growth rates and prevent potential habitat damage if the population overshoots carrying capacity, populations of Black Rhinos should be managed at densities below long term ecological carrying capacity (i.e., below zero growth densities). Surplus rhino that are removed from such established populations are routinely being profitably invested in new areas with suitable habitat and protection where populations can grow rapidly.","<p>Black Rhino face a variety of threats. The main threat to the species is illegal hunting (poaching) to supply the illegal international rhino horn trade. It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. While Black Rhino numbers continue to increase at a continental-level poaching has slowed overall growth. Some populations have also declined. Black rhino poaching peaked in 2015 and has been declining since. See Figure 2 and Table 2 and 3 in attached Supplementary&#160;Information&#160;file.<br/><br/>The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also reduce conservation budgets and incentives to conserve Black Rhino privately (both those privately owned and those managed for the state on a custodianship basis (due to declining live sales and greatly increased protection costs ). For more information on threats see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019 <a href=""http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf"">http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/156/1560170144.pdf</a>).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Throughout most of the 20th century, the Black Rhino was the most numerous of the world's rhino species. Relentless hunting of the species and clearances of land for settlement and agriculture reduced numbers and by 1960 only an estimated 100,000 remained. Between 1960 and 1995, large-scale poaching caused a dramatic 98% collapse in numbers with numbers bottoming out in the mid 1990s. Over this period numbers only increased in South Africa and Namibia (Emslie and Brooks 1999). From 1992–1997 total numbers remained relatively stable with increases in some countries (those with the best-protected and managed populations) being cancelled out by declines in others. However, since the lows of the mid-1990s, Black Rhino numbers at a continental level have more than doubled reaching and estimated 5,495 by end 2017 (Emslie&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2019) and 5,630 by end 2018 (Knight 2019).

Its current stronghold is Kenya. Smaller but growing numbers occur in northern Tanzania. The single animal that survived in Rwanda has died. One important free-ranging subpopulation occurs outside its range in a private game reserve in South Africa. Contractually, these <span style=""font-style: italic;"">D. b. michaeli</span> animals may only be translocated back to historical range and not elsewhere in South Africa. The repatriation of some of these animals back to four areas of former subspecies range in Tanzania commenced in 1997, with animals also subsequently going to found a subpopulation in Rwanda.<br/><br/><em>Diceros b. minor</em> is believed to have occurred from southern Tanzania through Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to the northern, northwestern and northeastern parts of South Africa (north of the Mtamvuna River). It also probably occurred in southern Democratic Republic of the Congo, northern Angola, eastern Botswana, Malawi, and Eswatini. Today, its stronghold is South Africa and to a lesser extent Zimbabwe, with smaller numbers remaining in southern Tanzania. The South-central Black Rhino is now thought to be extinct in Angola and only one individual has been sighted in Mozambique since the 2008 IUCN African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) meeting. The subspecies has also been reintroduced to Botswana, Malawi, Eswatini and Zambia. Based on very small sample sizes, Moodley <em>et al</em>.'s (2017) results suggested that perhaps the original historical Black Rhino&#160;that used to occur in Zambia but which had been wiped out by poaching by 1995 might be better classified as&#160;<em>D. b. michaeli </em>rather than&#160;<em>D.b.mino</em>r. However, on account of the small sample sizes, and given that the species was reintroduced with&#160;<em>D. b. minor&#160;</em>founders, and that historically Zambia had been considered&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;range, and climate and habitats are more similar to some&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;range; reviewers recommended that historical pre-1995 Zambian animals should continue to be allocated to&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;for this Red List revision (as has historically been the case). With further data this may change in future. As there were still significant numbers of Black Rhinos in Zambia in the early 1970s, how these animals are allocated influences the&#160;<em>D. b. minor</em>&#160;subspecies Red List assessment which would change to Endangered under criteria A2 and A4. The <em>D. b. michaeli</em> assessment remains the same whether or not the historical animals are classified as <em>D. b. minor</em> or&#160;<em>D. b. michaeli</em>.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> At the request of certain members and countries,  the IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG) has a policy of not  releasing detailed information (including maps) showing the whereabouts  and names of all rhino subpopulations for security reasons.

Black Rhinos, however, are currently only openly sold in South Africa and in all other Range States Black Rhino on communal or private land are managed on a custodianship basis for the state.  Black Rhinos are primarily threatened by illegal killing for horn.<br/><br/>Live specimens for translocation are invariably taken from natural habitat with the occasional zoo animal being reintroduced.",Terrestrial,"Black Rhino have been listed on CITES Appendix I since 1977. All international commercial trade in Black Rhinos and their products have been prohibited. To help reduce illegal trade, and complement CITES international trade bans, domestic anti-trade measures and legislation were implemented in the 1990s by a number of consumer states. Effective field protection of rhino subpopulations has been critical. Many remaining rhino are now concentrated in fenced sanctuaries, conservancies, rhino conservation areas and intensive protection zones where law enforcement effort can be concentrated at effective levels. Monitoring has also provided information to guide biological management decision-making aimed at managing rhino subpopulations for rapid population growth. This has resulted in surplus animals being translocated to set up new populations both within and outside the species' former range. Following a decline in breeding performance in some areas, increased effort has recently been given to improving biological management with a view to increasing metapopulation growth rates. Increasing efforts are also being made to integrate local communities into conservation efforts (most notably in the Kunene region of Namibia). Strategically, Black Rhinos are now managed by a range of different stakeholders (private sector and state) in a number of countries increasing their long term security. In contrast to Southern White Rhino, most Black Rhino on privately owned land are managed on a custodianship basis for the state. Since CITES CoP13 limited sport hunting quotas have been approved for the two Range States with biggest populations (South Africa and Namibia). Removal of specific individuals can enhance demographic and/or genetic conservation. In addition to local and, national initiatives, there are a number of regional African rhino conservation initiatives: the SADC Rhino Management Group, the Southern African Rhino and Elephant Security Group and the East African Community Rhino Management Group.

The sub-population that breeds in north-east Greenland migrates through Iceland, Britain and western France to arrive in its West African wintering grounds (specifically Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania) from late-July, returning again between March and early-April (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). European birds may gather in large congregations from the beginning of July in areas such as the Wadden Sea or the Wash to moult (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and some juveniles may remain in the non-breeding range all year (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species breeds dispersed or aggregated in loose colonies, and travels in group sizes of up to 1,500 on passage, remaining in large groups (up to hundreds of thousands of birds) throughout the non-breeding season (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).<strong> </strong>The species is active both diurnally and nocturnally (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Shepherd and Lank 2004). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> In the breeding season this species frequents moist boggy ground interspersed with surface water, such as tussock tundra and peat-hummock tundra in the arctic, as well as wet coastal grasslands, salt marshes and wet upland moorland (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> In the non-breeding season this species mainly prefer estuarine mudflats, but also frequent a wide variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), both coastal and inland, including lagoons, muddy freshwater shores, tidal rivers, flooded fields, sewage farms, salt-works, sandy coasts (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), lakes and dams (Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005). For roosting during high tides and at night this species prefers large fields of naturally fertilised short pasture or soil-based crops with few vertical structures that could be used by predators (Shepherd and Lank 2004). <strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> This species is omnivorous during the breeding season, consuming mostly adult and larval insects (dipteran flies, beetles, caddisflies, wasps, sawflies and mayflies), and also spiders, mites, earthworms, snails, slugs and plant matter (usually seeds) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> It is also omnivorous during the non-breeding season, consuming mostly polychaete worms and small gastropods, as well as insects (dipteran flies and beetles), crustaceans, bivalves, plant matter and occasionally small fish (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Breeding site</strong> Its nest is a scrape or shallow depression in the ground, concealed in vegetation and sometimes in a tuft or tussock (and thus raised slightly off the ground) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Management information</strong> The provision of well-surfaced paths in breeding areas that recieve &gt; 30 visitors a day has been shown to reduce the impact of human disturbance on this species' reproductive performance (Pearce-Higgins <em>et al.</em> 2007). It is also known to show increased hatching successes when ground predators have been excluded by erecting protective fences around nesting areas (Jackson 2001).","<em>Breeding</em> This species is significantly threatened by the loss of its breeding habitat though afforestation of moorland (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Lavers and Haines-Young 1997). It may also suffer from nest predation by introduced mammals (e.g. European hedgehog <em>Erinaceus europeaus</em>) on some islands (Jackson 2001). <em>Non-breeding</em> In the winter this species is restricted to a small number of estuaries, so it is vulnerable to any changes in this habitat for example through land reclamation (drainage) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996), and the invasion of alien plant species (such as the grass <em>Spartina anglica</em> which has spread on British mudflats, resulting in the reduction in size of feeding areas available) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (UK) (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton <em>et al.</em> 2002b). Important migratory stop-over habitats on the Baltic Sea coastline adjacent to the Kaliningrad region of Russia are threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for irrigation, peat-extraction, reedbed mowing and burning, and abandonment and changing land management practices leading to scrub and reed overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1 in particular) and is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global   population is estimated to number c.4,295,000-6,800,000 individuals (Wetlands   International 2015). The European population is estimated at 426,000-562,000 pairs, which equates to 853,000-1,120,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Therefore, the species is listed as Near Threatened.<br/><p></p>","<p>The species occurs near the timberline at elevations of 3,000-3,800 m in semi-humid/humid montane scrub and at the edge of elfin forest, apparently ranging only a few metres or tens of metres below the 'páramo' edge (Moynihan 1979, Ridgely and Tudor 1989, Fjeldså and Krabbe 1990, Parker <em>et al.</em> 1996). It favours <em>Polylepis</em> spp. with other small trees such as <em>Escallonia</em> or <em>Baccharis</em>. (O. Cortes <em>in litt</em>. 2011). Like most members of the genus, however, it does seem able to tolerate some habitat degradation and its population density is fairly high (Flórez<em> et al.</em> 2004).

G.  W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999, Koenen and Koenen 2000)<strong></strong>. A study in Ecuador found Black Flowerpiercer <em>Diglossa humeralis</em> to be significantly more abundant in páramo that had been unburnt for eight years than in páramo burnt two months before counts (Koenen and Koenen 2000)<strong></strong>. It is not known whether <em>Diglossa gloriosissima</em> uses the animal-pollinated flowers of herbs and shrubs in less-disturbed páramo (and largely replaced by grasses in frequently burnt páramos [Koenen and Koenen 2000]), but if so, it is likely to be significantly affected by frequent fires. Human settlement and extensive deforestation threaten the species's  habitat near Cerro Paramillo. A communication facility and associated  military activity near the top of Cerro Munchique and its timberline may  have a negative impact on the species (P. G. W. Salaman <em>in litt</em>. 1999).

The species went unreported for 40 years after a record from the páramo at Frontino in 1965 (Moynihan 1979), but more recently there have been reports from various high peaks in the north of the West Andes (Carantón 2014), south to the Serranía del Pinche (Cortés-Diago <em>et al.</em> 2007, Carantón 2014). The first record came from near Jardin, Antioquia, in October 2003 (Pulgarín <em>et al. </em>2005, Pulgarín and Munera 2006). It was followed by records made in August 2004 at the type locality (Flórez<em> et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>, and 70 km further south at Farallones del Citará (Pulgarín <em>et al. </em>2005, <strong></strong>P.

At the type locality, ten individuals were observed and three collected during six days of fieldwork, and the species was described as locally common (Flórez<em> et al.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>. It has since also been recorded at Tatamá National Park near Cerro Montezuma, and at Reserva Mesenia-Paramillo near Mesenia (O. Cortes <em>in litt</em>. 2011). The small number of sightings probably reflects the dearth of fieldwork at these sites and on high mountains between them (Parker <em>et al.</em> 1996), with the exception of the relatively well-known Cerro Munchique, and likely reflects the lack of exploration and difficulties related to gaining access to the highlands of the Western Cordillera.<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong></strong><strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong>Considered Vulnerable at the national level in Colombia (Renjifo <em>et al</em>. 2014).

The population is considered to be in decline due to various threats, but the rate of decline is not known. The species is therefore classified as Near Threatened. <br/><p></p>","Markham’s Storm-petrel breeds in dispersed colonies in saline areas, using fissures and holes created by saltpetre deposits for nesting (Tobias <em>et al</em>. 2006, Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 2015, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Paracas, the species breeds in small, dispersed colonies up to 5 km from the sea on sloping ground<strong> </strong>(Tobias <em>et al. </em>2006). The colonies in Chile are located on the east of the Cordillera de la Costa mountain range at up to 50 km distance from the sea (Barros <em>et al.</em> 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). In Chile, known colonies are located at 600-1,100 m a.s.l. (Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). Reproduction can be asynchronous within a colony (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Nevertheless, in the northern colonies in Paracas, near Arica and in Salar de Quiuña, most pairs lay eggs between April and August, and are with chicks between July and January (Jahnke 1994, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). Pairs breeding in the colonies of Pampa Perdiz, Salar Grande and Salar de Navidad further south lay eggs between November and January, while chicks hatch between January and April (Malinarich <em>et al</em>. 2018, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019, Medrano<em> et al</em>. 2019). The species feeds opportunistically both inshore and offshore on fish, crustaceans and cephalopods (Garcia-Godos <em>et al. </em>2002). Adults arrive at the colonies at least 45 min after sunset (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p></p>","The principle threat faced by Markham’s Storm-petrel is the mining of saltpetre from the salt plain on which it nests (Torres-Mura and Lemus 2013, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). This has resulted in the loss of considerable amounts of breeding habitat, as it destroys the burrows and crevices in which nests are placed (Schmitt <em>et al.</em> 2015, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Light pollution also represents a significant level of mortality, with 10-20 fresh corpses reported each morning next to a single light close to a breeding colony (Schmitt <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is assumed that fledglings are attracted to the lights of nearby cities during their first flights (Torres-Mura and Lemus 2013, Schmitt <em>et al</em>. 2015), and already few, strong light sources may affect large parts of a breeding colony (F. Medrano <em>in litt</em>. 2019). It has been estimated that each year around 20,000 fledglings die because of light pollution, representing 1/3 of the entire cohort (F. Medrano <em>in litt</em>. 2019). Light-pollution was found to be a severe threat to seabirds and Hydrobatidae in particular, which can potentially have a detrimental effect on the overall population size (Rodriguez <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further threats include infrastructure developments (roads, wind farms and power lines), military exercises and garbage (Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019). Overall, given the severity of the threats presented by mining and light pollution and their potentially detrimental impacts on the population size, the number of locations of occurrence (as defined by the most severe threat) is assumed to be relatively small.<br/><p></p>","A minimum of 2,305 pairs were present on the Paracas peninsula in 1992<strong> </strong>(Tobias <em>et al. </em>2006).

Between July and September, it is found over warm, equatorial waters, while between January and July it moves to cooler waters of the Peru Current and further west (Pyle 1993, Spear and Ainley 2007). It breeds on the Paracas peninsula on the coast of central <strong>Peru </strong>and in the Atacama Desert of southern Peru and northern <strong>Chile </strong>(Carboneras 1992, Barros <em>et al</em>. 2019).

Insufficient survey data preclude the estimation of a total population size for <em>Piliocolobus badius</em>; however, recent surveys report significant population declines and/or local extirpations. The scale of the decline is inferred from rates of human-induced habitat loss, and evidence of unsustainable rates of hunting. Already small and isolated Western Red Colobus populations are expected to continue declining given that these threats are ongoing and in most places are not being countered, and indeed are likely to increase, driven by the demand for natural resources from a rapidly growing human population in West Africa.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>                   </p>This is a predominantly arboreal species found in a variety of forest types including primary, secondary, and gallery forest, woodland savanna, tree and shrub savanna, mangroves and residential gardens (Starin 1991, Galat-Luong and Galat 2005, Struhsaker 2010, Butynski <em>et al</em>. 2013). In general Western Red Colobus prefer mature old growth moist forest, where they use the main canopy at 20-40 m height (50% of time, Galat-Luong 1983), and typically travel on the larger branches (McGraw 1998); however, the northern populations also spend time travelling, resting, playing, feeding and grooming on the ground (Starin 1991).<br/><br/>Their diet is dominated by fruit, seeds and young leaves (Galat and Galat-Luong 1985, Starin 1991, Davies <em>et al</em>. 1999, Korstjens 2001).

Estimates from surveys at bushmeat markets on the Liberia-Côte d’Ivoire border and around Sapo National Park in southeastern Liberia reveal that primates – including <em>P. b. badius </em>– are being hunted at rates that are almost certainly unsustainable (Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). In Côte d’Ivoire, where hunting is especially intensive, this monkey is reported to have disappeared from all areas except Taï National Park, and possibly the Cavally Classified Forest to the north of Taï National Park (Sanderson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and in relic forest in the Tonkpi region, near Côte d’Ivoire’s border with Guinea and Liberia (Kramoko <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>It is estimated that in Guinea-Bissau almost 200 red colobus are hunted during each dry season to supply the two urban bushmeat markets and the meat is consumed in dedicated bushmeat restaurants (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Guinea, the intensity of hunting has increased since 2000, with bushmeat also coming from Niokolo Koba in Senegal to supply the city of Conakry and large towns (Galat-Luong and Galat pers. obs. 1983–2000). In addition, skins are used in animistic practices and traded in dedicated markets (Sá <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Offtake levels are likely increasing due to increased hunting associated with significant human population growth and habitat degradation. Hunting has increased due to heightened demand for bushmeat, increasingly fragmented and smaller forest blocks, and improved access to forest interiors through logging (Laurance <em>et al</em>. 2015, Sloan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Indeed, the human population has increased by more than 100% in the seven range countries since 1990 (Worldometer 2020).<br/><br/>Deforestation through logging, charcoal production, mining and clearance for agricultural land, including industrial-scale plantations, has occurred over much of the species range (McGraw 1998, Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015, WCF 2015).<br/><br/>In the <em>P. b. badius</em> subspecies’ range, analysis of satellite imagery of tree cover shows that Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea were among the 10 countries with the fastest annual rate of forest loss in the world in the 2001–2014 period (Petersen <em>et al</em>. 2015). According to Global Forest Watch, Côte d’Ivoire lost about 17% of its forest cover between 2000 and 2015 with an annual deforestation rate of 2.69% – among the highest in the world. Many areas in Côte d’Ivoire designated as protected areas no longer contain forest and have been largely or completely converted to plantations (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2012, Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015). A list of countries with the largest increase in primary forest loss during 2018 includes two <em>P. badius badius</em> host countries in the top 10: Côte d’Ivoire was ranked second (26% increase) and Liberia (12% increase) was ranked sixth. When the world’s countries are ranked by the amount of primary forest lost as a percentage of the country’s total, Côte d’Ivoire is second (1.88%) and Sierra Leone is sixth (1.23%) (all forest loss data GFW 2019).<br/><br/>In the <em>P. b. temminckii </em>subspecies’ range, 16.2% (&gt;15,000 km²) of forest habitat has been lost in the past 17 years (2001–2018, GFW 2019; 1.7 generations for this taxon). Total forest lost during this period varied between 9.2% in Senegal and 16.6% in Guinea. With the exception of Gambia, rates of forest loss have more than doubled since 2013 in all range countries (GFW 2019). However, forest loss would have been occurring continuously long before 2001; extrapolating the lowest estimate of forest loss (9.2%) to the decade 1990–2000, gives an estimated total of 22% of suitable habitat lost over three generations.<br/><br/>Degradation and loss of natural habitat also lead to increasing human-wildlife-human conflict (e.g., Starin 1989; Struhsaker 2005, 2010; Galat <em>et al</em>. 2009). Furthermore, large areas in the range of <em>P. badius</em> were impacted by civil conflict between 1989 and 2011, and this negatively impacted Western Red Colobus populations in Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>For additional information on threats, see the two <em>Piliocolobus badius </em>subspecies assessments.<br/><p></p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>                   </p>Western Red Colobus are patchily distributed and many populations are small and isolated. No overall population estimate is available due to the paucity of survey data; however, a significant decrease in total population size since 1990 is inferred based on: (1) recent surveys have reported significant population declines and/or extirpation from certain areas (e.g., A. Galat-Luong and G. Galat pers. obs. 1974–2002; Starin 1989; Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2012, 2014; Wright <em>et al</em>. 2006; Bene <em>et al</em>. 2013; Bitty <em>et al</em>. 2015; M. Mayhew pers. obs. 2015–2019; Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2016; Bersacola <em>et al</em>. 2018); (2) unsustainable exploitation for bushmeat consumption or cultural/medical practices indicated by hunting and offtake rates (e.g., Galat-Luong and Galat pers. obs. 1983–2000; Starin 1989, 2007; N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012; Sá <em>et al</em>. 2012; Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013; Covey and McGraw 2014; Greengrass 2016); (3) increasing demand for natural resource driven by the growing human population, with a more than 100% increase in human population in the seven range countries since 1990 (Worldometer 2020); and (4) a significant decrease in suitable habitat (WCF 2015, Peterson <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In Côte d’Ivoire, the only forest certain to still contain red colobus is Taï National Park, with a population estimated at approximately 97,000 individuals (N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012). Additional surveys are needed to confirm reports that they still occur at other locations.<br/><br/>In Sierra Leone, red colobus are now rare in most of their former habitats, although recent work suggests there may be over 5,000 red colobus in Gola Rainforest National Park. They are still present on Tiwai Island, and reported in Loma Mountains National Park, Kambui Hills Forest Reserve and Kangari Hills Forest Reserve (Brncic <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2015).<br/><br/>In Liberia, a significant population is found in Sapo National Park, and their presence was recently confirmed in the Grebo-Krahn National Park (Furnell <em>et al</em>. 2015a) and the corridor linking it to Sapo (Furnell <em>et al</em>. 2015b). Elsewhere in Liberia, red colobus have been reported in North Loma National Forest (Barrie <em>et al</em>. 2007), Foya Natural Forest, Gola Forest National Park and the Tonglay and Norman Community Forests and the Putu Range adjacent to Gola Forest National Park (S. Jones pers. comm. 2018, J. Oates unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>In northwestern Guinea, a few individuals were reported in Boulléré/Sangarédi sub-prefecture during a rapid survey conducted by Eriksson and Kpoghomou (2006).<br/><br/>Based on surveys conducted over the last 20 years, the known population of <em>P. b. temminckii</em> is estimated to total approximately 2,500 individuals. Relatively large populations are still found in: Abuko Nature Reserve (Starin 2017) and the forest around Sambel Kunda, Central River Region (Mayhew <em>et al</em>. 2019) in Gambia; Cantanhez Forest National Park, Guinea-Bissau (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2016); Delta du Saloum National Park (Fathala Forest Reserve and nearby mangroves) and Niokolo Koba National Park, Senegal (A. Galat-Luong and G. Galat pers. obs. 2000, Galat-Luong and Galat 2005).

Hunters report that red colobus are easily hunted (Struhsaker 2005, Ferreira da Silva 2012). Commercial hunting has been reported in most range countries (Ferreira da Silva 2012, N’Goran <em>et al</em>. 2012, Sá <em>et al</em>. 2012, Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2013, Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016), although hunting is rare in Senegal (Galat-Luong and Galat pers. obs. 1983–2000). In Gambia, red colobus are rarely hunted for meat, but they are often killed as a crop-protection measure (Starin 1989), and their body parts are used for traditional practices (Starin 2007).<br/><br/>Bushmeat trade takes place in both rural and urban areas, and trade estimates strongly suggest unsustainable levels of exploitation that, if not controlled, will continue to result in&#160; extirpation of this taxon in parts of its range. Indeed, commercial hunting in Guinea-Bissau may have been contributing to its rarity in Cufada Lagoons Natural Park (Ferreira da Silva 2016) and disappearance of groups in Cantanhez Forest National Park (Minhós <em>et al</em>. 2016). Estimates from surveys at bushmeat markets on the Liberia-Côte d’Ivoire border and around Sapo National Park in southeastern Liberia reveal that primates are being hunted at rates that are almost certainly unsustainable (Covey and McGraw 2014, Greengrass 2016). For example, it was estimated that approximately 9.5% of the 9,400 primate carcasses brought annually from Liberia’s Konobo District to one bushmeat market on the Cavally River were red colobus (Covey and McGraw 2014).",Terrestrial,"This species is listed on Appendix II of CITES and on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.<br/><br/>Western Red Colobus have been recorded in a number of protected areas including: Taï National Park and possibly the Cavally Classified Forest in Côte d'Ivoire; Abuko Nature Reserve, Kiang West National Park, River Gambia National Park and Tanji Bird Reserve in the Gambia; Badiar National Park and the Forêt classée de N’dama in Guinea; Cantanhez Forest National Park, Cufada Lagoons Natural Park and Dulombi-Boé-Tchetche Complex in Guinea-Bissau; Gola Forest National Park, Grebo-Krahn National Park, North Lorma National Forest and Sapo National Park in Liberia; Niokolo Koba National Park and Saloum Delta National Park in Senegal; and Gola Rainforest National Park, Loma Mountains National Park, Outamba-Kilimi National Park and Tiwai Island Wildlife Sanctuary in Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>The first conservation action plan for red colobus monkeys will be published in 2020.

A relict subpopulation potentially occurs in the Ennedi Plateau in Chad but has not been collected recently. Local threats may affect certain subpopulations, but no major, widespread threats have been identified.&#160;This species is therefore listed as Least Concern.","<em>Enteromius apleurogramma</em> inhabits temporary and permanent streams, as well as in marginal water-lily swamps (Greenwood 1962), pools near papyrus vegetation (Okedi 1971), in smaller bodies of water or near the margins of rivers between the vegetation (Seegers 1996) and in fast-flowing water. It feeds on insect larvae (Greenwood 1966), but aquatic vegetation, molluscs and fishes are also consumed (Welcomme 1969). Spawning occurs in temporary streams when they are flooded during the rainy season (Greenwood 1962). Seegers (1996) reports spawning activities all year round with a maximum at the beginning of the rainy season. The maximum size is 5.4 cm SL (De Vos and Thys van den Audenaerde 1990).","Threats include increased water turbidity and siltation as a consequence of erosion and farming extension&#160;on the watersheds and floodplains, eutrophication as result of increased use of agrochemicals, water abstraction for agriculture, mining activities, fishing pressure, competition with introduced species and loss of riverine migratory routes.&#160;Pollution from future mining activities (nickel, gold) is also a threat in the upper Malagarazi catchment (West 2001). However, it is not though that these issues represent major, widespread threats.","The population size and trend are not known, but this species is very common in streams and rivers.",Unknown,"This species&#160;is widely distributed. It was described from Kisumu Bay in Lake Victoria (Boulenger 1911). It is reported to occur in the Aswa River (White Nile system), in the Lake Victoria basin including Lake Kanyaboli, affluent rivers and the Akagera River system, in the Lake Edward-George system, in Lake Kivu and associated rivers, and in the Lake Tanganyika basin (De Vos and Thys van den Audenaerde 1990). This small barb has also been found in the Rusizi and Malagarazi River basins (Banyankimbona <em>et al</em>. 2012), in the Lake Rukwa drainage (Seegers 1996) and in the Lukuga River (Congo River system) (Kullander and Roberts 2012).&#160;A relict subpopulation of <em>E. apleurogramma</em> is known to occur in the Ennedi plateau in Chad (Lévêque 1990, De Vos and Thys van den Audenaerde 1990) although recent expeditions did not collect this species (Trape 2013).

However, recent morphological and molecular studies showed that populations from the Amboseli swamps, Mzima Springs, and Athi River system were distinct and should be recognized as <em>E. amboseli</em>, Bannister 1980 (Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2018). This study also suggests that reported populations in the coastal rivers of Tanzania likely also distinct from <em>E. apleurogramma </em><u>(</u>Schmidt <em>et al.</em> 2018<em>)</em>.

163991139,15954,Panthera pardus,Vulnerable,A2cd,2020,2015-07-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Leopards are widely distributed across Africa and Asia, but populations have become reduced and isolated, and they are now extirpated from large portions of their historic range. Due to their wide geographic range, secretive nature and habitat tolerance, Leopards are difficult to categorize as a single species. Evidence suggests that Leopard populations have been dramatically reduced due to continued persecution with increased human populations (Thorn <em>et al.</em> 2013, Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2014), habitat fragmentation (UN 2014), increased illegal wildlife trade (Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008), excessive harvesting for ceremonial use of skins (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015), prey base declines (Hatton <em>et al.</em> 2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari and Carpaneto 2006, Datta <em>et al.</em> 2008, Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014, Selvan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and poorly managed trophy hunting (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2009). Throughout North, East and West Africa, Middle East, East and South-east Asia, Leopards have suffered marked reductions and regional extirpations due to poaching for illegal wildlife trade, habitat loss and fragmentation, and prey loss. Human populations have increased by 2.57 percent annually from 1994 to 2014 (UN 2014) driving a 57% increase in the conversion of potential Leopard habitat to agricultural areas from 1975 to 2000 (Brink and Eva 2009). Deforestation in South-east Asia has increased for palm oil and rubber plantations (Sodhi <em>et al.</em> 2010, Miettinen <em>et al.</em> 2011). These factors were not incorporated in the previous assessment and likely have a substantial impact on suitable Leopard range.<br/><br/>Comparison of the extent of extant range presented in this assessment (8,515,935 km², see map) with that produced by Red List Assessors in 2007 (21,953,435 km²: Henschel <em>et al.</em> 2008) yields a range reduction of 61%. However the severity of this reduction is inaccurate due to previous insufficient sampling (the 2016 map is much more detailed in resolution, see Methodology in the Supplementary Material), and the reduction has likely occurred over a longer time scale. Though our knowledge of the Leopard distribution is better today than in 2008, it is still limited at the national, regional and range-wide scales because reliable data on Leopard population trends are missing from large portions of their range. We suspect, however, that at least half of the reduction translates to real and relatively recent range loss. Also in southern Africa, the so called stronghold of the Leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that Leopard populations have remained stable (G. Balme pers. comm. 2015). In Zimbabwe, much Leopard range has disappeared due to the resettlement of private farmland and subsequent loss of prey populations (du Toit 2004). We estimate regional range loss of approximately 21% in southern Africa. We suspect that suitable Leopard range has been reduced by &gt;30% worldwide in the last three generations (22.3 years). We calculated generation length as 7.42 years (based on the formula presented in Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013 and data from wild Leopard populations presented in Balme <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Leopard population density across the species’ range is known to track the biomass of principle Leopard prey species, medium-size and large wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em>et al.</em> 2007). Prey species are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2013). A commercialized bushmeat trade has caused an estimated 59% average decline in Leopard prey populations across 78 protected areas in West, East and southern Africa between 1970 and 2005 (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Though ungulate populations have increased by 24% in southern Africa, potential prey numbers have declined by 52% in East Africa and 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em>et al.</em> 2010). Bushmeat poaching in Mozambique (Hatton <em>et al.</em> 2001, Fusari <em>et al.</em> 2006) and Zambia (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014) has severely reduced Leopard prey (Becker <em>et al.</em> 2013) inside and outside of protected areas. Many wildlife areas are suffering from substantial ungulate decline, including Zambian Game Management Areas and National Parks, maintain large mammal populations at 93.7% and 74.1% below estimated carrying capacity, respectively (Lindsey <em>et al.</em> 2014). With such reductions to Leopard prey, we infer a &gt;50% loss of Leopard populations across East and West Africa. Through extensive poaching pressure also in Asia many prey species, such as Sambar Deer in Malaysia, are threatened with regional extirpation throughout tropical forest systems (Corbett 2007, Kawanishi <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In South-east and East Asia, poaching for Leopard prey and targeted Leopard hunts for the wildlife trade market are taking place. A regional survey found that Leopards in India have been poached at a rate of four individuals per week for the illegal wildlife trade (Raza <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Nowell and Pervushina (2012) found the illegal trade of Leopard parts was comparable to that of Tigers in Asian range States and derivative seizures with an average of 3.5 Leopards seizure cases per month in India since 2000. Preliminary data suggest that the illegal trade in Leopard skins for cultural regalia is rampant in southern Africa. It is suggested that 4,500-7,000 Leopards area harvested annually to fuel the demand for Leopards skins by followers of the Nazareth Babtist (Shembe) Church only (Balme unpub. data).<br/><br/>Poorly managed trophy hunting adds to pressure on local Leopard populations. Balme <em>et al.</em> (2009) showed that trophy hunting was a key driver of Leopard population decline prior to intervention in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Similarly, Pitman <em>et al.</em> (2015) demonstrated that Leopards are over-harvested across much of their range in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The concern about unsustainable trophy hunting has lately increased, e.g. South Africa has banned trophy hunting for 2016. This followed an alert by its CITES Scientific Authority that the number of Leopards in the country was unknown, and that trophy hunting posed a high risk to the survival of the species.<br/><br/>Taken all together, the Leopard meets the A2cd criterion for Vulnerable, based on loss of habitat and prey, and exploitation. These causes of the suspected reduction are not well understood, have not ceased, and are likely to continue, and future decline is anticipated unless conservation efforts are taken.","<strong><em>Habitat Types and Range</em></strong><br/>Leopards occur in the widest range of habitats among any of the Old World Cats (Nowell and Jackson 1996). They are found in the desert and semi-desert regions of southern Africa in Namibia and Botswana. There are remnant populations in the arid regions of North Africa in Egypt, as well as the Arabian Peninsula. They persist in rugged montane regions of southwest Asia in Iran, in a varied range of landscapes in India and in the savanna grasslands of East and southern Africa. Leopards live in mountainous environments up to an altitude of 4,600 m on Mt. Kenya and 5,200 m in the Himalayas. They also thrive in the rainforests of West and Central Africa as well as Sri Lanka and southeast Asia. A remnant Leopard subpopulation also persists in the snowy regions of the Russian Far-East. Leopard subpopulations also occur in suburban and urban environments in India and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.<br/><br/>Leopards have survived outside protected areas in many parts of India since historical times (Daniel 1999) and even today high density of Leopards do occur among high human densities (Singh 2005, Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013), although associated levels of conflict can also be high (Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). Occupancy survey found that Leopards occupied 174,066 km² of forest habitat in India (Jhalla <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). Despite widespread occurrence they are killed in very large numbers in India (Raza <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards prefer to hunt in areas that provide sufficient cover despite higher prey densities elsewhere when sympatric with larger competitors (Balme <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). <br/><br/><strong><em>Diet</em></strong><br/>Leopard diet is related to prey availability and presence of larger competitors. Generally, Leopards prefer medium-sized ungulate prey (10- 40 kgs) where available (Hayward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). They have a highly varied diet, however, feeding on insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals up to large ungulates. Though the Leopard as a species has the reputation of being a generalist, often individuals will become adept specialists for a particular prey item. These individuals will feed almost exclusively on that prey, occasionally supplementing their diet with other food items when necessary. Where competitors are present Leopards will cache their kills under thick vegetation or hoist their prey into the limbs of a tree. Hoisting behaviour is more often recorded where intraguild competitors density is higher. Male Leopards tend to hoist more often than females, particularly in the dry season when available ground cover is scarce (Stein <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press). In the absence of larger competitors, leopards feed on larger prey (Ramakrishnan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999, Hayward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In many parts of its range, the importance of domestic animals in their diet is also evident with dogs, goats and cattle forming a large proportion of their diet (Mukherjee <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001) sometimes even dominating the prey items in the diet (Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Shehzad <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Dogs have been reported as important prey for Leopards (Edgaonkar and Chellam 2002, Athreya <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Overall studies on diet of Leopards are very scant across its Asian range.<br/><br/><strong><em>Home Range Size</em></strong><br/>Leopard home range size varies with prey availability and habitat structure. Leopards have the largest ranges within arid and semi-arid environs where prey density is low. The largest recorded Leopard ranges include the Central Kalahari (mean = 2,182 km², Bothma <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997). The smallest recorded ranges correspond to rainforest habitats in south and southeast Asia. In Thailand, Grassman (1999) recorded home ranges as small as 8.8 km² for a female and an average 17.7 km² for two adult males. In India three collared Leopards in human dominated landscapes exhibited home range sizes between 8 to 15 km² (Odden <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).","The primary threats to Leopards are anthropogenic. Habitat fragmentation, reduced prey base and conflict with livestock and game farming have reduced Leopard populations throughout most of their range (Nowell and Jackson 1996, Ray <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005, Hunter <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). The conversion of forest habitats and savanna systems to agriculture, livestock farming and urban sprawl have significantly reduced Leopard range. Though exceptions exist (Athreya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013), this conversion typically leads to the depletion of natural prey species through poaching thereby reducing the natural prey base in these areas.<br/><br/>Where livestock and game farms have been created, Leopards may feed on these commercially valuable prey causing conflicts with farmers. These farmers may be intolerant to Leopard conflict and kill the Leopards for real or perceived threats to their lives and livelihoods (Stein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010, Athreya <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Recent reports from northern Iraq suggest unsustainable levels of Leopard removal (Raza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b).<br/><br/>Leopards are also targets for trophy hunting. If poorly managed, trophy hunting can be detrimental to the population, especially when permits are focused in one geographic area and targeted individuals are in their prime, territorial, reproductively active (Balme <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Leopard trophy hunting has been reviewed or closed in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia within the last five years.<br/><br/>In Indo-Malaya and China, Leopards require better protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007) and recent reports estimate very high levels of Leopard removal at four individuals per week for 10 years (Raza <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012b). Leopards are also killed for their skins in traditional ceremonies and other parts for medicinal use in eastern cultures. These trades can have a substantial impact on local Leopard populations.<br/><br/>In the face of changing land-use, prey availability and direct mortality from humans, Leopards have persisted where other large predators have not. Their ability to live within human-dominated landscapes and feed on a variety of prey have given many people the impression that Leopards require little concern, however, recent trends have shown that current threats have substantially reduced Leopard populations throughout West and Central Africa, South-west and South-east Asia and China.","Highly adaptable and widely distributed, Leopards can persist in areas where other large carnivores have been extirpated. However, Leopards are declining throughout most of their range (Jacobson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in review). There are no robust estimates of the total number of mature individuals range-wide, but several Asian subspecies were assessed as Endangered and Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List in 2008 and should retain these listings in 2016 based on the following population estimates and a declining trend:<br/><ul><li>Amur Leopard (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(ii), D):&#160;&lt;60 (Jackson and Nowell 2008, Sugimoto <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Xiao <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).</li><li>Arabian Leopard (<em>P. p. nimr</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 45-200 (Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).</li><li>Javan Leopard (<em>P. p. melas</em>) - Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i)): 350-525, with &lt;250 mature breeding adults (Ario <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).</li><li>Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 700-950 (Kittle and Watson 2015).</li><li>Persian Leopard (<em>P. p. saxicolor</em>) - Endangered (EN C2a(i)): 800-1,000 (Khorozyan 2008).<br/></li></ul>[<strong>Note</strong> that although the Red List Categories and Criteria for the subspecies assessments published in 2008 have not changed, the assessments no longer appear on The IUCN Red List as the information they contain may be out-of-date or may contradictory to the information presented here.]<br/><br/>This current (2015) assessment looked at available information on Leopard status on a regional basis (as discussed below). Across the majority of range, leopards have declined substantially (&gt;30%) since the previous assessment as determined by extensive population surveys, expert input and indirect measures supporting our conclusion that Leopards be listed as Vulnerable (criteria A2cd). Over the past three generations (22.3 years) regional Leopard populations in the Middle East, East and South-east Asia, West, Central and East Africa have seen substantial range declines due to habitat fragmentation and forest clearing, prey reductions from the bushmeat trade, illegal harvest for skins and human-wildlife conflict and retaliation for livestock depredation. Leopards have completely disappeared from regions of North Africa where they were recorded in the previous assessment. In India, the Caucasus and the Russian Far-East, Leopards have maintained their populations or increased due to improved survey methods, expanded range or intensive conservation efforts.<br/><br/><strong>AFRICA</strong><br/>There are few reliable data on changes in the Leopard (<em>P. p. pardus</em>) status (distribution or abundance) throughout Africa over the last three generations, although there is compelling evidence that subpopulations have likely declined considerably. Robust longitudinal data on 47 Lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) subpopulations—a sympatric large carnivore—demonstrated a 42% decline in abundance across populations in the last three generations (22.3 yrs) (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Bauer <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> review). Lion population trends decreased in West, Central and East Africa, and increased in Southern Africa. Most of the factors driving Lion population declines (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, retaliatory killing due to conflict, poorly managed trophy hunting) also affect Leopards. Indeed, pressure on Leopard populations is likely greater as a larger proportion of their range extends beyond protected areas. The increase in Lion populations in southern Africa was primarily due to the reintroduction of &gt;800 Lions to small, protected reserves in South Africa. Similar reintroductions were not undertaken for Leopards. Fencing of protected areas was proposed as another significant factor contributing to the increase in Lion numbers in southern Africa (Packer <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). In contrast, fences are far less effective at reducing detrimental edge effects of ‘protected' Leopard populations (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and again, a far greater proportion of Leopard range falls outside protected areas (Swanepoel <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>One main factor for Leopard declines in Africa is related to prey declines. Leopard population density across Africa is known to track the biomass of their principle prey species, medium and large-sized wild herbivores (Marker and Dickman 2005, Hayward <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2007). The latter are increasingly under threat from an unsustainable and increasingly commercialized bushmeat trade, leading to collapses in prey populations across large parts of savanna Africa (Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Time series data from 1970 to 2005 on the main Leopard prey species in 78 protected areas in West, East and Southern Africa, revealed a 59% average decline in population abundance across the three regions. While ungulate and other large mammal populations increased by 24% in southern Africa, they declined by 52% in East Africa and by 85% in West Africa (Craigie <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). Considering the Leopard’s dependence on wild prey species within its African range, concomitant Leopard declines in the same order of magnitude (&gt;50%) in West and East Africa can be inferred for the same time frame.<br/><br/>Another main driver of range loss and population decline of Leopards in Africa is habitat loss. Leopards have limited levels of ecological resilience to human-caused habitat fragmentation in Africa, and as a result are more restricted to conservation areas. Although male leopards can successfully traverse fragmented and suboptimal habitat (Fattebert <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), in general Leopards in Africa require large contiguous habitats with low human impacts to reproduce successfully (Balme <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). However, from 1994 to 2014, the human population in Africa increased by 2.57 percent annually (from 0.699 billion to 1.139 billion) (UN 2014), which in conjunction with a 57% increase in agriculture areas (from just over 200 million ha to almost 340 million ha) from 1975 to 2000 and a 21% decrease in natural vegetation in the region (Brink and Eva 2009) likely have negatively impacted the leopard populations. These increases in human population and habitat fragmentation were not accounted for in the previous assessment. As a subspecies <em>P. p. pardus</em> potentially qualifies as Vulnerable due to suspected population declines.<br/><br/>Although African Leopards can be regarded as a single genetic grouping, geographically they are subject to different pressures that require area-specific categorizations and conservation status assessments. Therefore, we subdivided the African continent into regional units for more detailed and specific status assessments:<br/><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Since the previous assessment, remnant populations in Morocco and Algeria are likely extirpated as recent surveys have failed to confirm their presence (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). The Egyptian population is considered very small with only a few observed signs in Elba National Park in southeastern Egypt, whereas there has been no recorded sign in Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). Therefore, the North African subpopulation potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered on the basis of a very small and declining number of mature individuals, and a full assessment is recommended.<br/><br/><u>Sub-Saharan Africa</u>: Numbers of sub-Saharan Leopards are declining within large portions of their range, particularly outside of protected areas. The populations within Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa appear to be decreasing from previous estimates with Leopards disappearing from areas with increased human development and areas of intensive conflict with humans (Hatton <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, du Toit 2004, Fusari <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Lindsey <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Although urbanization is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (UN 2013), the majority of the population is rural, and about 60–70% of the population relies on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods, mostly at a subsistence level. As a result, a large portion of the growing human population is expected to depend directly on expansion of agriculture and livestock grazing to survive. By 2050, the population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to more than double to &gt;2 billion (UN 2013), and the area of cultivated land is project to increase by 51 million ha (approximately 21 %, Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012), which likely will contribute to the continued population decline of Leopards in Africa. In the absence of proactive management, populations of Leopards and other large carnivores generally decline in concert with increased human population growth (Woodroffe 2000, Linnell <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). In summary, the combination of widespread habitat loss (21% in sub-Saharan Africa in 25 years) and prey loss inside African protected areas (59% decline) is likely to have caused concomitant Leopard declines of &gt;30% over the last three Leopard generations. The Leopard subpopulation of sub-Saharan Africa potentially qualifies as VU (criterion A2cd).<br/><br/>Additionally, we strongly recommend detailed status assessments for other areas of Africa to address regional needs and requirements (e.g., Henschel <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<br/><br/><strong>ASIA</strong><br/><u>Indian Leopard (<em>P. p. fusca</em>)</u>: The known range of the Indian Leopard has increased compared to the previous assessment, but this is likely due to more intensive surveys conducted in previously unstudied wild and suburban environments. Poaching for wildlife trade is an increasing threat to Indian Leopards (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008). For example, Raza <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> (2012b) estimated that four Leopards per week have been poached for illegal wildlife trade over the previous 10 years. Additionally, high conflict is reported in some areas resulting in lethal control of problem individuals (Athreya <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Continuous decreases in wild prey are negatively impacting Leopard numbers in some regions (Datta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008, Selvan <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), indicating Leopard populations may decline in the future. Moreover, even in well protected areas, the recovery of Tiger numbers often results in lower Leopard numbers (Harihar <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011, Mondal <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012), as Tigers are known to kill and displace Leopards (McDougal 1988, Odden <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). The first ever scientific national census of Leopards around Tiger habitats in India (except the northeast) in 2014 estimated 7,910 individuals, with a speculated national total of 12,000-14,000 (Bhattacharya 2015). A full assessment is recommended for <em>P. p. fusca</em>, as it may potentially qualify as Vulnerable due to a suspected declining population containing fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/><u>North China Leopard (classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. japonensis</em>)</u>: A recent review of Leopard distribution shows a &gt;80% reduction in range considered extant in 2008 (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). This subspecies, endemic to China, now occurs only in parts of seven provinces, and the total population is estimated at &lt;500 individuals (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press), with the number of mature individuals likely less than that. Subpopulations are small (&lt;50 individuals) and fragmented, and occur mainly in isolated nature reserves, indicating subpopulations may not be viable in the long-term. Reasons for their decline include retaliatory killings due to conflict, poaching for wildlife trade, low prey numbers (especially ungulates), and habitat loss and fragmentation (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). These threats are expected to continue in the future, indicating that Leopard populations may continue to decline. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for <em>P. p. japonensis</em> or the subpopulation of North China, as it potentially qualifies as Critically Endangered or Endangered due to a small, steeply declining population.<br/><br/><u>Indochinese Leopard (classically described as the subspecies <em>P. p. delacouri</em>)</u>: A recent review showed a dramatic reduction of over 80% in range where Leopards are considered extant in South-east Asia compared to 2008 (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). This subspecies is now likely extinct in Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and Singapore, and only small fragmented populations remain in Cambodia, southeastern China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand, resulting in a total estimated population of &lt;2,500 individuals for all of Southeast Asia (S. Rostro-García and J. F. Kamler unpubl. data). Targeted poaching for wildlife trade is probably the greatest factor that contributed to the recent range collapse of Leopards in South-east Asia. Leopard parts are used as substitutes for Tiger parts for medicinal purposes in China and South-east Asia, and Leopard skins are highly sought after as luxury items (J. F. Kamler pers. obs.). Poachers in South-east Asia can get up to $3,000 for a Leopard carcass (S. Prum and R. Maharjan pers. comms. 2014), and this price likely will continue to increase. Other important factors include depletion of prey base, and habitat loss and fragmentation. Throughout all South-east Asian countries and southeastern China, primate and large (&gt;5 kg) ungulate populations are well below carrying capacity due to over hunting by humans, even within protected areas (Johnson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Steinmetz <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Kawanishi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), which may hinder recovery of Leopards in the region. Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to Leopards in South-east Asia, particularly because these are closely associated with prey depletion and high levels of human disturbance. The deforestation rate in South-east Asia is the highest of all tropical regions, and the rate is still increasing (Sodhi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Miettinen <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011). From 2000 to 2010, areas of primary or secondary forests decreased in all Southeast Asian countries, most of which was due to conversion to palm oil and rubber plantations, as the price of these commodities increased 130% and 333%, respectively, during the same period (Wilcove <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Because &lt;10% of South-east Asian forests are under some form of protection, and prices of luxury wood, palm oil, and rubber are expected to increase, habitat loss in the region is expected to continue (Sodhi <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and thus likely to have negative impacts on the leopard populations. Therefore, we recommend a full assessment for the Sout-heast Asian Leopard subpopulation (<em>P. p. delacouri</em>), as it potentially qualifies as Endangered due to a small declining population.<br/><br/><u>Other subspecies</u>: Leopards of the Arabian Peninsula (<em>P. p. nimr</em>), Java (<em>P. p. melas</em>), and Russian Far-East (<em>P. p. orientalis</em>) continue to require listing as Critically Endangered due to low population numbers and population fragmentation. Although the population of <em>P. p. orientalis</em> may have increased recently, especially on the Chinese side of the border (Xiao <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014), the total population remains &lt;60 individuals. With no noted population or range increase, the Sri Lankan Leopard (<em>P. p. kotiya</em>) should retain its current status as Endangered. The Leopard of southwestern Asia (<em>P. p. saxicolor or ciscaucasica</em>) has been recorded in previously undocumented areas of the Caucasus, such as Georgia and Azerbajian (Sarukhanova 2014, Voskyanyan 2014), however, due to overall low numbers and restricted range, this subspecies should remain listed as Endangered (Khorozyan 2008). See the individual Red List accounts for more details regarding these subspecies.<br/><br/><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: We acknowledge that additional data could reveal an increase or decrease in population size or range loss of Leopards, thus the status could change for segments of Leopard range as more data are collected.",Decreasing,"Our assessment of Leopard distribution has been divided into two geographic regions: Africa and Asia. In order to describe these regions, we have further divided Leopard distribution into sub-regions to address local population trends. A detailed discussion of the methodology used to produce the 2015 range map can be found in the Supplementary Material.<br/><br/><strong><em>Leopards in Africa</em></strong><br/><u>North Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in North Africa has been restricted by 97% of their former range with only remnant, isolated populations remaining (Durant <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). An adult male Leopard was killed in the Elba region of southeastern Egypt in retaliation for livestock depredation, though evidence of a breeding population is still uncertain (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2014). Continued camera-trapping efforts have failed to capture the presence of Leopard in the Sinai since 1995 (A. Nagy pers. comm. 2015). The presence of Leopards was confirmed in the Ahaggar Mountains of Algeria from the genetic testing of one scat sample in 2005 but no presence has been confirmed since (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2014). Leopards are thought to be extirpated from Morocco (F. Cuzin pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/><u>West Africa</u>: Leopard distribution in West Africa has been dramatically reduced. This reduction is likely due to habitat fragmentation, but also more rigorous survey efforts that have confirmed presence and likely absence across the region (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014). Leopards have been confirmed in Niger along the southwestern border with Benin and Burkina Faso (P. Henschel pers. comm. 2014) but previous reports in Air and Tenere National Reserves are unconfirmed. Leopards are generally restricted to a few protected areas from Senegal in the west to Nigeria in the east. Leopards have been reported in the south of Senegal including Parc National de Niokolo-Koba. In Sierra Leone, there are small remnant populations near Outamba Kilimi National Park and Gola National Forest as well as the eastern boundary with Guinea/ Liberia. Leopard populations in Liberia have been recorded in Lofa-Mano National Park in the west and Sapo National Park in the east. In Ghana, Leopards are found along the boundary with Côte d’Ivoire and Mole National Park in the north and west (<em>c.</em> Burton pers. comm. 2014). In Benin, Leopard are found along the northern boundary. Leopards are nearly absent from Nigeria.<br/><br/><u>Central Africa</u>: In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Leopard range was largely reduced in areas of increased human influence and areas relatively easy to access and therefore open to illegal hunting and bushmeat trade. In Cameroon, Leopards are found in the northern and southern portions of the country. In Gabon, Leopards are found throughout the country with small absent pockets in the southeast and southwest. In the Central African Republic (CAR) Leopards are found in the southwest, central and eastern portions of the country. Leopards are found throughout South Sudan with the exception of the Sudd wetland.<br/><br/><u>East Africa</u>: The distribution of Leopards in East Africa has been reduced, in particular in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and central Tanzania. There are possible remnant populations in Djibouti, Eritrea, and North Sudan. They are nearly absent from Somalia. Leopards are found throughout southern Ethiopia, parts of Uganda and the west, central and southern portions of Kenya (Z. Davidson pers. comm. 2014, I. Seme pers. comm.2014, G. Yirga pers. comm. 2014). In Tanzania, Leopards are found throughout the Serengeti-Ngorogoro Crater system and to the south and west. It is thought that Leopards are absent from the southeastern boundary of Lake Victoria to Central Tanzania.<br/><br/><u>Southern Africa</u>: Southern Africa likely has the healthiest Leopard populations of their entire range. It is generally thought that Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique have declining but healthy Leopard populations outside of human dominated areas (C.<em>&#160;</em>Begg pers. comm. 2014, A. Loveridge pers. comm. 2014, P. Schuette pers. comm. 2014). In Namibia, Leopards inhabit most of the country with the exception of the highly populated northern region, the arid southeast farmlands and the desert coast (Stein 2011). Botswana has a continuous Leopard population in the North and West. In South Africa, Leopards are found along the boundaries with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique with dense populations located in the Limpopo region. Leopards are also located in the Cape provinces of South Africa.<br/><br/><strong><em>Leopards in Asia</em></strong><br/><u>Middle East</u>: The main stronghold for the Arabian Leopard (<span><em>P. p. nimr</em>) is the continuous tract of the Dhofar area in southwestern Oman and the Hawf area in northeastern Yemen (Khorozyan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014, Spalton <em>et al </em>2014). There are also small, isolated populations in Saudi Arabia (Zaffar-ul-Islam <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). In 2006, Leopard populations were estimated at eight individuals in Israel's Judean Desert and Negev Highlands respectively, however, they have not been confirmed since (Perez <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). The species is likely extirpated in the Musandam Peninsula of Oman and UAE (J. Spalton pers. comm. 2014, Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards are probably extinct in Jordan (Qarqaz and Abu Baker 2006), UAE (Edmonds <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006, Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006) and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (Spalton <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006), with the possibility of rare forays from the Negev (Mallon <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/><em><strong>Southwest Asia and the Caucasus</strong></em><br/>Recent surveys found that Leopards have a wide distribution in Iran, mostly in the region of the two mountain chains consisting of Alborz running northwest to northeast and Zagros from northwest to the south (Sanei and Zakaria 2011). Their presence is also recorded in Golestan National Park, Iran which is located in the northeastern part of Iran near the border with Turkmenistan (Erfanian <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Hamidi <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). A few recently confirmed records from Iraq and Turkey are restricted to the mountainous areas of Kurdistan (B. Avgan and H. Raza pers. comms. 2014), where Leopard is known to be scarce. There are numerous camera-trap records dated 2013-2014 confirming the presence of a small population in the Zangezur Ridge shared by Armenia and Azerbaijan (B. Avgan and A. Malkhasyan pers. comms. 2014, Voskanyan 2014, Sarukhanova 2014). Two individuals are recorded in Talysh Mountains of southeastern Azerbaijan (Sarukhanova 2014). There is recent camera trapping evidence from Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, Azerbaijan (Avgan <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Recently, a Leopard was video-trapped in North Ossetia, Georgia (P. Weinberg pers. comm. 2014). There are no confirmed recent records in Dagestan although Leopards definitely lived here in low numbers in the 1980s and the last confirmed photograph was taken in 2009 (Yarovenko 2010, Y. Yarovenko pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/><u>South and Central Asia</u>: There is some indication of its presence in the Babatag and Kugitang mountains of Uzbekistan (N. Marmazinskaya pers. comm. 2014). A confirmed record of Leopard was obtained in Afghanistan in the Bamyan province in 2011 in a camera trap image (Moheb and Bradfield 2014). In Pakistan, Leopards also inhabits broken hilly or mountainous country throughout Waziristan, Baluchistan and Sindh Kohistan in association with acacia scrub forest (Roberts 1997). A recent study using DNA from scats found Leopard presence in northeast Pakistan from the Ayubia National Park (Shehzad <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Leopards occur widely in the forests of Bhutan and Nepal. Leopards are widespread across India (Athreya <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013, Harihar <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009) and Sri Lanka (A. Kittle and A. Watson pers. comms. 2014) occurring inside and outside Protected Areas.<br/><br/><u>Southeast and East Asia</u>: Leopard range has been significantly reduced in southeast and East Asia. The North China Leopard is restricted to small, isolated protected areas in Central China in the Ningxia, northern Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, northern Henan, western Sichuan, southern Qinghai and eastern Tibet regions (Laguardia <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in press). Leopards of southeast Asia have been confirmed in protected areas in Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia and southern China but are likely absent from Lao PDR and Viet Nam (S. Rostro-Garcia and J.F. Kamler unpubl. data). Some recent information indicates that they are still present in most forested regions of the island of Java, Indonesia but in very low numbers (H. Gunawan and H.A. Wahyudi pers. comms. 2015). In the Russian Far East, Leopards occur in a large area of about 7,000 km² along the eastern slopes of the East Manchurian Mountains on the border with China but their numbers are likely to be very low (Hebblewhite <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011).<p></p>","Leopards are targeted for trophy hunting and are illegally hunted for wildlife trade for their skins (used in traditional ceremonies), and bones and other parts (used for  medicinal purposes in eastern cultures).",Terrestrial,"The Leopard is included in CITES Appendix I. Trade of Leopard skins and products is restricted to 2,560 individuals in 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Recently, the practices within the hunting industry have been called into question by wildlife researchers and conservationists (Packer <em>et al.</em> 2011). In 2010, the government of Namibia conducted an assessment of trophy hunting in response to calls for an increase in permits amid reports of unethical hunting practices. Zambia placed a moratorium on Leopard and Lion hunting in 2013 due to concerns about the conservation status of the populations. In South Africa, Mozambique and Botswana, researchers have developed regional studies of the hunting quota systems that incorporate measures of trophy quality and regulate the geographic distribution of permits. These quota studies integrate previous hunting data to prescribe the number and distribution of hunting permits with local stakeholder participation.&#160; In 2014, sport hunting has been banned altogether in Botswana while South Africa suspended trophy hunting of Leopards&#160;for the year&#160;in&#160;2016.<br/><br/>Regulating trophy hunting will only address a percentage of Leopard mortality; human-Leopard conflict within livestock and game farming communities is likely the greatest source. In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, farmers are allowed to kill predators that are considered a threat to life and property with permits distributed retroactively. It is likely that a high percentage of Leopards are killed without reporting and therefore the exact numbers of Leopards killed through actual or perceived conflict is unknown. Generally, efforts to calculate mortality through human-wildlife conflict have been considered unreliable. Since the majority of Leopard range is outside of protected areas, conflict mitigation strategies such as livestock husbandry, compensation/ insurance programmes, alterations in trophy hunting permit distribution and public awareness have all been used to assist farmers and increasing tolerance for living with leopards (Balme <em>et al.</em> 2009, Stein <em>et al.</em> 2010). Where conflict Leopards have been identified, translocation has been tried often with negative results (Weilenmann <em>et al.</em> 2010, Athreya <em>et al.</em> 2011), however, effective translocation criteria have been developed based on suitable release site characteristics (Weise <em>et al.</em> 2015). Namibia and Botswana have promoted wildlife conservation through the devolution of wildlife management and the establishment of benefit sharing initiatives between photographic tour operators, professional hunters and communities through Conservancies and Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs; Jones 1993). These initiatives were modelled after previous efforts such as CAMPFIRE in Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>In North and West Africa, the Middle East and large parts of Asia, Leopards are restricted to protected areas where they are afforded refuge if poaching is not significant. However, many of these protected areas are not large enough to maintain genetically viable populations and will likely require intensive management. In Indo-Malayasia and China, Leopards require increased protection from illegal trade in skins and bones (Nowell 2007). In 2009, Leopards were protected from all hunting and trading within Afghanistan on the country’s Protected Species List (Zahler pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Since the previous status update, researchers have undertaken population surveys within protected areas throughout Leopard range. These surveys have improved our understanding of Leopard status with greater resolution and in some cases generated population estimates. We recommend increased population surveys for Leopards, in particular across Central Africa, Angola, South-east Asia and China.<br/><br/>To address the use of Leopard skins for traditional ceremonies, conservationists in South Africa have partnered with textile companies and communities to provide faux-fur alternatives (G. Balme pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>Leopard population recovery efforts are currently under way with reintroduction projects in Sochi, Greater Caucasus and the Russian Far East (C.

Their population is currently estimated at approximately 6,600 adults in 39 subpopulations, of which only 1,400 are mature individuals. Population size is continuing to decline as a result of ongoing habitat fragmentation, conflict with human activities, and infectious disease. Given uncertainty surrounding population estimates, and the species’ tendency to population fluctuations, the largest subpopulations might well number &lt;250 mature individuals, thereby warranting listing as Endangered under criterion C2a(i).","African Wild Dogs are generalist predators, occupying a range of habitats including short-grass plains, semi-desert, bushy savannas and upland forest. While early studies in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, led to a belief that African Wild Dogs were primarily an open plains species, more recent data indicate that they reach their highest densities in thicker bush (e.g., Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania; Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe; and northern Botswana). Several relict populations occupy dense upland forest (e.g., Harenna Forest, Ethiopia; Malcolm and Sillero-Zubiri 2001). African Wild Dogs have been recorded in desert (Lhotse 1946) (although most desert populations are now extirpated), but not in lowland forest. It appears that their current distribution is limited primarily by human activities and the availability of prey, rather than by the loss of a specific habitat type.<br/><br/>African Wild Dogs mostly hunt medium-sized antelope. Whereas they weigh 20–30 kg, their prey average around 50 kg, and may be as large as 200 kg. In most areas their principal prey are Impala (<em>Aepyceros melampus</em>), Greater Kudu (<em>Tragelaphus strepsiceros</em>), Thomson's Gazelle (<em>Eudorcas thomsonii</em>) and Common Wildebeest (<em>Connochaetes taurinus</em>). They will give chase of larger species, such as Common Eland (<em>Tragelaphus oryx</em>) and African Buffalo (<em>Syncerus caffer</em>), but rarely kill such prey. Small antelope, such as Dik-dik (<em>Madoqua</em> spp.), Steenbok (<em>Raphicerus campestris</em>) and Duiker (tribe Cephalophini) are important in some areas, and warthogs (<em>Phacochoerus </em>spp.) are also taken in some populations. African Wild Dogs also take very small prey such as hares, lizards and even eggs, but these make a very small contribution to their diet.<br/><br/><strong>Generation length</strong><br/>Data on lifetime reproductive success of 19 alpha (breeding) females in western Zimbabwe indicate that 50% of reproductive output was achieved by age 5.5 years (SD 1.35, range 3–8; G.S.A. Rasmussen, unpubl. data). An alternative method, considers the average age of mothers of known litters, without the need for data on lifetime reproductive success. This method gives good agreement with the IUCN recommendations on calculating generation length, indicating a mean female breeding age of 5.7 years from the Zimbabwe dataset. Using this method, data from 18 litters born in Kenya to known-age mothers suggest a mean generation length of 5.0 years (R. Woodroffe, unpubl. data). Both studies suggest a minimum age at first breeding of approximately three years. Based on these data, for convenience we have estimated changes in African Wild Dog populations using a generation time of five years.","The principal threat to African Wild Dogs is habitat fragmentation, which increases their contact with people and domestic animals, resulting in human-wildlife conflict and transmission of infectious disease. The important role played by human-induced mortality has two long-term implications. First, it makes it likely that, outside protected areas, African Wild Dogs may be unable to coexist with increasing human populations unless land use plans and other conservation actions are implemented. Second, African Wild Dog ranging behaviour leads to a very substantial ""edge effect"", even in large reserves. Simple geometry dictates that a reserve of 5,000 km² contains no point more than 40 km from its borders – a distance well within the range of distances travelled by a pack of African Wild Dogs in their usual ranging behaviour. Thus, from an African Wild Dog's perspective, a reserve of this size (fairly large by most standards) would be all edge. As human populations rise around reserve borders, the risks to African Wild Dogs venturing outside are also likely to increase. Under these conditions, only the very largest unfenced reserves will be able to provide any level of protection for African Wild Dogs. In South Africa, “predator proof” fencing around small reserves has proved reasonably effective at keeping dogs confined to the reserve, but such fencing is not 100% effective (Davies-Mostert <em>et al</em>. 2009) and is unlikely to be long-term beneficial for wildlife communities.<br/><br/>Even in large, well-protected reserves, or in stable populations remaining largely independent of protected areas (as in northern Botswana), African Wild Dogs live at low population densities. Predation by Lions, and perhaps competition with Spotted Hyaenas, contribute to keeping African Wild Dog numbers below the level that their prey base could support. Such low population density brings its own problems. The largest areas contain only relatively small wild dog populations; for example, the Selous Game Reserve, with an area of 43,000 km² (about the size of Switzerland), is estimated to contain about 800 African Wild Dogs. Most reserves, and probably most African Wild Dog populations, are smaller. For example, the population in Niokolo-Koba National Park and buffer zones (about 25,000 km²) is likely to be not more than 50–100 dogs. Such small populations are vulnerable to extinction. ""Catastrophic"" events such as outbreaks of epidemic disease may drive them to extinction when larger populations have a greater probability of recovery – such an event seems to have led to the local extinction of the small African Wild Dog population in the Serengeti ecosystem on the Kenya-Tanzania border. Problems of small population size will be exacerbated if, as seems likely, small populations occur in small reserves or habitat patches. As discussed above, animals inhabiting such areas suffer a strong ""edge effect"". Thus, small populations might be expected to suffer disproportionately high mortality as a result of their contact with humans and human activity.","<strong>Background</strong><br/>African Wild Dogs are rarely seen, even where they are relatively common, and it appears that populations have always existed at very low densities. Table 2 in the supplementary material (see below) presents estimates of the sizes of African Wild Dog subpopulations occupying all discrete areas of resident range identified by participants in the range-wide conservation planning process (IUCN SSC 2008, 2009, in prep.). These comprise a total of 39 distinct subpopulations estimated to range in size from two to 276 mature individuals.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Proportion of mature individuals</strong><br/>Estimating the number of “mature individuals” is challenging, because African Wild Dogs are obligate cooperative breeders: within a pack, the alpha male and female are the parents of the majority of surviving pups (Girman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1997). The IUCN Red List User Guidelines (IUCN 2010) define mature individuals as “individuals known, estimated or inferred to be capable of reproduction”, but do not specify the time period within which reproduction is considered possible. The User Guidelines go on to state “in many taxa there is a pool of non-reproductive (e.g., suppressed) individuals that will quickly become reproductive if a mature individual dies. These individuals can be considered to be capable of reproduction”.<br/><br/>In African Wild Dogs, a high proportion of individuals are indeed reproductively suppressed, but these animals do not always become reproductive “quickly” if an alpha individual dies. In a mature pack, most pack members are offspring of the alpha pair; for these animals, death of an alpha would usually not open up a breeding opportunity because no unrelated mates would be available within the pack. In our experience, death of an alpha often leads to disintegration of the pack, with no breeding until new packs are formed. Given these complexities, and in keeping with the spirit of capturing a “snapshot” of current conditions, we have chosen to define mature individuals as those considered capable of reproduction within the current breeding season. The number of mature individuals thus comprises the number of alpha males and females, and the number of sub-dominant (i.e. non-alpha) animals which breed successfully.<br/><br/>Table 1 in the supplementary material (see below) provides demographic data to allow the estimation of numbers of mature individuals (Nm) from the census population of adults and yearlings (Nc). Using these data, the number of alpha males (NaM) and females (NaF) would be estimated thus:<br/><br/>NaM = Nc x 0.55 x 0.176<br/>NaF &#160;= Nc x 0.45 x 0.215<br/><br/>Reassuringly, these equations return approximately equal estimates of the numbers of alpha males and alpha females.<br/><br/>No published estimate is available of the proportion of adults and yearlings which breed successfully as sub-dominants. However, Girman et al. (1997) report the proportions of surviving pups with sub-dominant mothers and/or fathers. Using a simple assumption that litter size was unrelated to social status, we therefore estimate the number of sub-dominant breeders (Nsub) as:<br/><br/>Nsub = (NaM x 0.10) + (NaF x 0.08)<br/><br/>The number of mature individuals is then calculated as&#160;<br/><br/>Nm = NaM + NaF + Nsub<br/><br/>We made exploratory calculations to investigate the effect of including the probability of currently-suppressed individuals surviving and breeding in subsequent years. These calculations became highly complex, and risked double-counting animals which might breed as sub-dominants in the current year and then attain alpha (dominant) status in later years. It is also important to note that, in the previous listing, the number of mature individuals was estimated simply as the number of alpha animals (i.e., NaM + NaF). These alternative ways of calculating numbers of mature individuals contribute to considerable uncertainty about African Wild Dog numbers.<br/><br/><strong>Current population size</strong><strong><br/></strong><strong></strong>Table 2 in the supplementary material (see below) presents estimates of the sizes of African Wild Dog subpopulations occupying all discrete areas of resident range identified by participants in the range-wide conservation planning process (IUCN SSC 2008, 2009, in prep.). These comprise a total of 39 distinct sub-populations estimated to range in size from two to 276 mature individuals. Few wild dog subpopulations have been systematically monitored, and these estimates are subject to considerable imprecision. This imprecision, combined with uncertainty about the calculation of mature individuals, and the species’ propensity for substantial population fluctuations, means that these population estimates should be viewed with great caution. Lack of precision has important consequences for Red List assessment; the two largest sub-populations (estimated at 268 and 276 mature individuals) are only slightly larger than one of the threshold sub-population sizes used by the Red List criteria (250 mature individuals: EN C2(i)). Had only alpha animals been considered mature individuals (as in the previous assessment), the sizes of these two largest sub-populations fall to 246 and 253 respectively. This uncertainty needs to be taken into account in comparing estimates of African Wild Dogs’ population sizes with IUCN Red List criteria.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Change in population size</strong><br/>Data on African Wild Dogs’ past global population size are taken from Ginsberg and Woodroffe (1997). It is important to note, once again, that few of these population estimates are based on systematic monitoring, and all should be viewed with caution. Assessing changes in population size is complicated by the fact that a less complete dataset was available in 1997 than in 2012. As a result of these improved data, the global estimate of African Wild Dog population size is in fact higher for 2012 than for 1997. However, this difference reflects the greater area surveyed in 2012.<br/><br/>To try to overcome this problem, Table 3 in the supplementary material (see below) compares estimates of subpopulation size in 1997 (taken from Ginsberg and Woodroffe 1997) with estimates of African Wild Dog subpopulations from the same areas in 2012. Subpopulations known in 2012 but not known in 1997 are excluded. However, sub-populations known to be absent in 1997 (e.g. the managed metapopulation in South Africa, and the sub-population in Laikipia District, Kenya) are included in Table 3 . Hence, Table 3 represents our best assessment of a like-with-like comparison of African Wild Dog numbers in 1997 and 2012<br/><br/><strong>Causes of decline</strong><br/>The causes of African Wild Dogs’ decline are reasonably well understood and include extreme sensitivity to habitat fragmentation as a consequence of wide-ranging behaviour, conflict with livestock and game farmers, accidental killing by people in snares and road accidents, and infectious disease. All of these causes are associated with human encroachment on African Wild Dog habitat and, as such, have not ceased and are unlikely to be reversible across the majority of the species’ historical range.<strong><br/></strong><strong><br/></strong><strong>Fluctuations in population size</strong><br/>Populations of African Wild Dogs are prone to marked fluctuations at a variety of temporal and geographical scales which are likely to both increase extinction risks and undermine the precision of population estimates. At the local scale, a combination of high mortality, high fecundity, and dispersal by both sexes means that pack size fluctuates substantially over short periods (Figure 1 in the supplementary material), although fluctuation in numbers of mature individuals would be less dramatic. Because African Wild Dogs are seasonal breeders across most of their remaining geographic range, fluctuations may be synchronised across packs (see Figure 1 in the supplementary material).<br/><br/>The same demographic characteristics – high mortality, high fecundity, and long-distance dispersal – likewise lead to fluctuations at the population scale. This pattern is further exaggerated by the species’ susceptibility to infectious disease which can cause rapid die-offs. Local extinctions are not uncommon, and are often both rapid and unanticipated. Figure 2 in the supplementary material presents data from three relatively well-documented cases of local extinction involving small wild dog subpopulations affected by rabies.<br/><br/>Similar die-offs have been documented in larger African Wild Dog populations. For example, five of 12 study packs in Botswana (Alexander <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010) and three of eight study packs in Kenya (Woodroffe 2011) have been reported as having died within short time periods during disease outbreaks. Although these relatively large study populations recovered, the majority of African Wild Dog sub-populations are estimated to comprise ≤20 mature individuals and could be severely compromised by outbreaks of this size.<br/><br/>For comparison, under good conditions African Wild Dog populations are also able to grow relatively quickly. African Wild dogs’ capacity for very long-range dispersal means that sub-populations sometimes reappear unexpectedly and grow rapidly; examples include natural recoveries in Samburu and Laikipia Districts, Kenya (Woodroffe 2011), Savé Valley Conservancy in Zimbabwe (Pole 2000), and the Serengeti ecosystem of Tanzania (Marsden<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2011). As an example of the speed of recovery, the subpopulation in Laikipia District, Kenya, grew from 0 in 1999 to 17 adults and yearlings in two packs by 2000, and by 2006 had increased 10-fold to 170 adults and yearlings (Woodroffe 2011).<br/><br/>On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that African Wild Dogs show substantial population fluctuations, but may not experience extreme fluctuations in sub-population size as outlined in the Red List guidelines. Nevertheless, the substantial fluctuations which do occur contribute to further uncertainty about sub-population sizes.",Decreasing,"Historical data indicate that African Wild Dogs were formerly distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, from desert (Lhotse 1946) to mountain summits (Thesiger 1970), and probably were absent only from lowland rainforest and the driest desert (Schaller 1972). They have disappeared from much of their former range. The species is virtually eradicated from North and West Africa, and greatly reduced in Central Africa and North-east Africa. The largest populations remain in southern Africa (especially northern Botswana, western Zimbabwe, eastern Namibia, and western Zambia) and the southern part of East Africa (especially Tanzania and northern Mozambique).<br/><br/>The current geographic distribution of African Wild Dogs was estimated using data compiled by the IUCN SSC range-wide conservation planning process for Cheetahs and African Wild Dogs, including regional strategies (IUCN SSC 2008, in prep.) and subsequent associated national action plans (<a href=""http://www.cheetahandwilddog.org"">www.cheetahandwilddog.org</a>). Current African Wild Dog range was considered to comprise only the “resident range” identified by participants in the IUCN SSC process: this represents land where participants were confident that African Wild Dogs had been confirmed to be resident within the previous 10 years. Land where residence was not confirmed (e.g., possible range, unknown range) was excluded.","Across most of its geographical range, there is minimal utilization of this species. There is evidence of localized traditional use in Zimbabwe (Davies and Du Toit 2004), but this is unlikely to threaten the species’ persistence. There are also some reports of trade in captive and wild-caught animals from southern Africa; the possible impact of such trade is currently being assessed.",Terrestrial,"Conservation strategies have been developed for the species in all regions of Africa&#160;Sillero-Zubiri&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Woodroffe&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997, (IUCN SSC 2008, 2009, in prep.), and many range states have used these strategies as templates for their own national action plans (Department of Wildlife and National Parks 2008, Wildlife Service 2010). Although each regional strategy was developed independently through a separate participatory process, the three strategies have a similar structure, comprising objectives aimed at improving coexistence between people and African Wild Dogs, encouraging land use planning to maintain and expand wild dog populations, building capacity for wild dog conservation within range states, outreach to improve public perceptions of wild dogs at all levels of society, ensuring a policy framework compatible with wild dog conservation. These strategies are accessible at <a href=""http://www.cheetahandwilddog.org"">www.cheetahandwilddog.org</a>.<br/><br/><strong>Gaps in knowledge<br/></strong>Several pieces of information are needed to enable more effective conservation of African wild dogs.

Since the total occupied area in India has been variously estimated at between 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Chauhan 2006) and 400,000 km² (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), or even more (Puri <em>et al</em>. 2015), it is impossible to gauge population trend from changes in occupied area. However, there is, throughout most of the range, a clear trend in deterioration of habitat, which has caused Sloth Bear populations to decline (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008). This deterioration in habitat is expected to accelerate in the future.<br/> <br/> Habitat outside of protected areas is under severe and growing pressure due to demands for natural resources and the ever increasing populations of both humans and livestock in the region (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006a). This problem is compounded by many factors including that in India, where the vast majority of Sloth Bear habitat is located: 1) the per capita forest area is only one-tenth of the world’s average; 2) there is a demand–supply gap for construction timber leading to over-harvesting and degradation of natural ecosystems; 3) an estimated 78% of forests are subjected to heavy grazing causing degradation of forest habitat; and 4) vast stretches of forest are still diverted for a variety of developmental and infrastructural projects (Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India 2009). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2015) reported that India had a 0.3% rate increase of forest area during 2010-2015, due to afforestation. However, the type and location of all the forest planted is unspecified. Much of this afforestation effort is occurring in more urban areas and it is not known how much is accessible to Sloth Bears.<br/> <br/> The human population growth in India is presently the greatest threat to Sloth Bears. It drives the loss and degradation of habitat and is likely the cause for growing human-bear conflicts in the country. The population of India is expected to increase by 366,000,000 people (roughly 30%) over the next 30 years&#160; (US Census bureau, International database <a href=""http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php"">http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php</a>). This extraordinary population growth is likely to have major direct and indirect impacts on Sloth Bear populations, especially those existing outside protected areas. The human population growth of India is particularly alarming because 90-95%of the range of Sloth Bears is in India. Likewise, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> (2007) predicted a future decline in Sloth Bear numbers in Sri Lanka due to burgeoning human densities and commensurate habitat deterioration and increasing conflicts.<br/> <br/> The recent extirpation of Sloth Bears in Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013) highlights serious concerns over persistence of small, isolated Sloth Bear populations, especially outside of protected areas, where half or more of the populations exist. Sloth Bears are particularly vulnerable to loss of habitat because of their reliance on lowland areas, which tend to be the places most readily used and developed by people. Moreover, the aggressiveness of this species makes them incompatible with high human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Given the lack of effective measures to control the rate of habitat loss and exploitation, Sloth Bear populations are expected to continue declining, at an increasing rate, resulting in a &gt;30% loss over the next 30 years (three generations).</p>","<p>Sloth Bears subsist primarily on termites, ants, and fruits. Sloth Bears are the only species of bear adapted specifically for myrmecophagy (ant and termite-eating; Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sacco and Van Valkenburgh 2004). Like other myrmecphagous mammals, they have especially small home ranges compared to other ursids (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2006b). The ratio of insects to fruits in the diet varies with the seasonal and geographical availability of each food (Baskaran <em>et al.</em> 1997, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1997, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Mewada and Dharaiya 2010, Sukhadiya <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fruits may comprise 70‒90% of the diet during the fruiting season, whereas termites and other insects may comprise &gt;80% of the diet the rest of the year (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears occupy a wide range of habitats on the Indian mainland including wet and dry tropical forests, savannahs, scrublands, and grasslands (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Sreekumar and Balakrishnan 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011, Ramesh <em>et al.</em> 2012). They are primarily a lowland species. Most Sloth Bear range in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka is limited to habitats below 1500 m, although the species may occur as high as 2,000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats (Johnsingh 2003, Seidensticker <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Sri Lanka, Sloth Bears are confined to the remaining dry forests in the north and eastern parts of the island, mostly below 300 m (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006). In areas where forest cover is sparse but daytime temperatures are high (a large part of the range), the bear is principally nocturnal or crepuscular and shelters in rock outcrops, thickets, and tree cavities during the heat of the day. Although some Sloth Bears may be active during the day in protected areas (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999), they tend to be almost exclusively nocturnal in disturbed and fragmented forests interspersed with human habitations (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004; Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2012).<br/> <br/> Studies in Nepal and Sri Lanka suggest that Sloth Bears avoid areas where human disturbance is high, so crop depredation by Sloth Bears is uncommon (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1995, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). However, in some parts of India, Sloth Bears routinely raid peanut, maize, and fruit crops (Chhangani 2002, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2004).&#160; In some of these areas the habitats are severely degraded and affected by human exploitation, including the extraction of several food sources of the Sloth Bear.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears typically breed May through July, and females give birth, usually to one or two cubs, from November to January (Laurie and Seidensticker 1977, Iswariah 1984, Gopal 1991, Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999, Chauhan <em>et al.</em> 2003, Spady <em>et al.</em> 2007). Cubs often ride on the mother's back during their first nine months, presumably to reduce the risk of predation. Cubs remain with their mothers for 1.5-2.5 years resulting in a 2 or 3 year interbirth interval (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999).</p>","<p>Major threats to this species are habitat loss or degradation (often related to human population growth), retaliation from human‒bear conflicts, and (to a lesser degree) poaching (Johnsingh 2003, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bargali <em>et al. </em>2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). Habitat has been lost, degraded, and fragmented by overharvest of forest products (timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, honey), establishment of monoculture plantations (e.g. teak, eucalyptus), over-grazing, extraction of minerals, quarrying, settlement of refugees, and expansion of agricultural areas, human settlements, and roads (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990).<br/> <br/> In some parts of the range, encounters between people and Sloth Bears have led to numerous serious human injuries and many deaths (Rajpurohit and Krausman 2000, Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014). Such incidents occur where people frequently use bear habitat, and where the habitat has become severely degraded, prompting bears to seek food and water in closer proximity to humans. Most attacks occur when people and bears surprised each other in thickets or around rock outcrops, where visibility is obstructed: the bear(s)—sometimes multiple adult bears are involved—rush at, pursue, and knock down the person, and often attack the face. Bears that attack or threaten to attack people may ultimately be killed. Sloth Bear attacks outside protected areas are increasing, and hostility of local people towards bears has made bear conservation more difficult (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005, Dharaiya and Ratnayeke 2009, Mardaraj 2014). Increasing numbers of Sloth Bear attacks appear to be related to rising human populations (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/> <br/> The only natural (non-human) threats to Sloth Bears are Tigers (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) and possibly Leopards (<em>P. pardus</em>). The threat of Tiger predation may account for the aggressive nature of Sloth Bears (Joshi <em>et al.</em> 1999). Sloth Bears have been observed fending off Tigers, but they are also occasionally killed by Tigers (Gopal 1991).</p>","<p>Information is available on the area of potentially occupied range in India (Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar<em> et al. </em>2012), Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a), and Sri Lanka (Ratnayeke <em>et al</em>. 2007a,b). The potential Sloth Bear distribution in India was estimated to be <em>ca.</em> 200,000 km² (Johnsingh 2003, Akhtar <em>et al. </em>2004, Chauhan 2006) but the more recent National Bear Conservation and Welfare Action Plan 2012 (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012) indicated that the occupied range is twice that large (400,000 km²). An even more recent survey suggested that Sloth Bears may occupy 52% of the land area of India (Puri <em>et al.</em> 2015). Notably, though, the latter study was based on very large sampling cells (2,800 km² across a sampling region of nearly 3 million km²), and any cell estimated to be occupied would have been considered as fully occupied; this would inflate the range area considerably. In short, the results of this study do not appear to reflect the reality of Sloth Bear distribution in India as they clearly do not occur in &gt;50% of the land area. Additionally, the model predicts Sloth Bear occurrence in specific places where they are known to be absent, such as Gir Forest. However, the study does demonstrate that Sloth Bears can live in relatively small degraded areas.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears can occur at high densities. However, there are few reliable Sloth Bear density estimates: most estimates have been based on opinions gleaned from interviews and questionnaires (e.g., Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006). The one robust density estimate for this species, which was based on mark–resight of radio-collared bears, yielded an estimate of 27 bears/100 km² for Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, and as high as 72 bears/100 km² in a core area of the park (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). Gopalaswamy (2006) attempted a rigorous estimate based on presence-absence records at camera traps (as per Royle and Nichols 2003), but detection rates were too low to produce a useful estimate.<br/> <br/> Attempts have been made to apply estimated densities in various protected areas to all occupied areas to obtain a range-wide population estimate. Depending on methods and data employed in this process, range-wide estimates have varied from &lt;10,000 to &gt;20,000 bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Chauhan 2006, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). None of these estimates are considered reliable enough to track changes in population size, especially since the total range area is not well defined. Estimates for individual Indian states are also not reliable enough to track population trends (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The population of Sloth Bears on the island of Sri Lanka is equally not well understood. Santiapillai and Santiapillai (1990) tentatively reported a population of 300–600 bears for the island. Ratneyeke <em>et al.</em> (2007a) estimated, based on home ranges of radio-collared bears that Wasgomuwa National Park alone may support more than 100-150 sloth bears. This national park only makes up roughly 5% of the known Sloth Bear range in Sri Lanka and therefore the population likely well exceeds the previous estimate.<br/> <br/> Increased habitat fragmentation and a decrease of occupied habitat have been observed in many parts of the Sloth Bear range (Akhtar and Chauhan 2008, Bargali 2012, Bargali and Sharma 2013). However, rigorous assessments of population change are rare. Jhala <em>et al.</em> (2011) compared occupancy of Sloth Bears in select areas from 2006 to 2010, during a comprehensive Tiger survey across India, and reported five decreasing, four increasing, and three stable bear populations; although the methods and short time span between surveys probably precluded a reliable indication of population trend.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sloth Bear’s historical distribution includes a large portion of India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, as well as the southern lowlands of Nepal and presumably Bhutan. Some unverified reports suggested that they once occurred in the western-most corner of present day Myanmar (Erdbrink 1953), but this was never confirmed and seems unlikely based on the mountainous habitat. Historically this species overlapped the distributions of Asiatic Black Bears (<span class=""sciname""><em>Ursus thibetanus</em>) in northern India (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2012), and with both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears (<em>Helarctos malayanus</em>) in northeastern India (Choudhury 2011).&#160;Historical records are confusing, though, because Sloth Bears and Asiatic Black Bears look alike and were often not reliably distinguished.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>India</u></strong><br/> At least 90% of the present Sloth Bear range occurs in India. Within India their distribution is constrained to the south by the ocean, to the northwest by deserts, and to the north and east by mountains. Although Sloth Bears were once common and even abundant throughout the Indian Peninsula (McTaggart Cowan 1972, Krishnan 1972, Brander 1982), their range has shrunk and densities reduced due to continuous habitat loss and human-caused mortalities. Although still found scattered across much of its former range, their actual distribution is now highly fragmented and confined mainly to five distinct regions, namely northern, northeastern, central, southeastern, and southwestern (Garshelis <em>et al</em>. 1999a, Johnsingh 2003, Yoganand <em>et al.</em> 2006, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> The northern distribution region occurs largely within the state of Uttarakhand (Bargali 2012), but also includes the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and the northwestern tip of Bihar. This northern region borders the southern and western areas of Nepal and includes trans-border populations. However, the northern region remains completely isolated from the other population regions in India due to large scale forest removal and agriculture and human settlements.<br/> <br/> The northeastern region is the farthest east that this species occurs and is perhaps the least understood region in terms of Sloth Bear distribution. The bulk of the distribution appears to occur in the state of Assam (Choudhury 2011, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), though Sloth Bears are also known from Manipur, Megalaya and Arunachal Pradesh (where it is very rare). The fact that the distribution of Sloth Bears in this region overlaps with that of both Asiatic Black Bears and Sun Bears has made reports of Sloth Bear occurrence less reliable.<br/> <br/> The central region is the largest region. The bulk of the distribution occurs in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, but includes the states of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Just south of this region, in the southern half of Andhra Pradesh, is the southeastern region, which occurs along the Eastern Ghats. It is not known whether bears move between the central and southeastern regions.<br/> <br/> The southwestern area follows the Western Ghats and principally falls within the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where there may be a connection to the southeastern region. They have been observed up to 2,000 m elevation in the Western Ghats (A.J.T. Johnsingh, personal communication, in Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a). They also stretch northwestward into Gujarat and Rajasthan.<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Nepal</u></strong><br/> In Nepal, Sloth Bears are most common within the narrow strip of lowland grassland–forest mosaic called the Terai. They also range into the lower Siwaliks (maximum elevation is unknown). The bears are mainly in protected areas in the central and western portions of the Terai. Since the mid-1980s, they were thought to have been extirpated from the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve in western Nepal, an area containing the largest patch of continuous grassland in Nepal (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999b). However, during a 2013 Tiger camera trap study in the reserve a photo of a Sloth Bear was captured. Then in 2014 Sloth Bear tracks and scat were recorded in the reserve as well (Babu Ram Lamichane, National Trust for Nature Conservation—Suklaphanta Conservation Program, pers. comm., 2015). Therefore, it appears that Sloth Bears have recolonized Sulka Phanta Wildlife Reserve, likely from adjacent Piliphit Tiger Reserve in Uttar Pradesh, India, which is known to have Sloth Bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012); alternately, Sloth Bears persisted in such small numbers that they went undetected for several years (Johnsingh 2003). Some of the Sloth Bear populations in Nepal remain connected with the Indian northern region (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bangladesh</u><br/> </strong>Sloth Bears have been extirpated from Bangladesh (Islam <em>et al.</em> 2013). The last documented records are from the mid-1990s (NCSIP-1 2001, Sarker 2006). Although they had been present in the southeastern, eastern and northeastern parts of the country, the forest patches in which they persisted have been largely removed (Sarker 2006).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Bhutan</u></strong><br/> Recent investigations suggest that if Sloth Bears occupy Bhutan, they are very rare. Garshelis <em>et al.</em> (1999a) mapped two populations of Sloth Bears in Bhutan, including Royal Manas National Park (RMNP) and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary. Their range map was based on habitat-elevation information and purported documentation of presence.&#160; However, due to frequent confusion in distinguishing Sloth Bears from Asiatic Black Bears, it is now apparent that this range map was wrong. Sloth Bears appear to have a much narrower range in Bhutan, if at all. One camera trap photo in RMNP, taken in 2009, 2 km from the Indian border, is the only current verified record of presence (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015). Grasslands, which are preferred habitat for Sloth Bears (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999 a,b; Choudhury 2011) are present in both RMNP and Phipsoo Wildlife Sanctuary, and both of these protected areas are connected to protected areas in India, known to contain sloth bears. However, it is not known whether a true trans-boundary population exists anywhere along this border, or if just a few vagrant bears occasionally come across to the Bhutan side (Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> <strong><u>Sri Lanka</u></strong><br/> The Sri Lankan Sloth Bear subspecies is distributed in the north and east sides of the island and is closely tied with forest cover (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007a). Sloth Bears occupy roughly 17% of the island and there is still a high connectivity between occupied areas. However, recent civil war activities largely occurred in the northern and eastern sides of the island, which are home to the largest contiguous forest patches and which historically supported healthy Sloth Bear populations. These areas have gone largely unprotected and it is still unknown how sloth bear distribution may have been affected (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2006, 2007a).</p>","<p>Poaching of Sloth Bears for trade in parts has been reported (Servheen 1990, Garshelis <em>et al.</em> 1999a, Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012), but its current extent and impact on bear populations is uncertain. Compared to other Asian bear species, commercial trade in Sloth Bear parts appears to be relatively low (Burgess <em>et al.</em> 2014). Poaching also occurs for local use: male reproductive organs used as aphrodisiac; bones, teeth and claws used to ward off evil spirits; bear fat used for native medicine and hair regeneration (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997, Chauhan 2006). Occasional rashes of poaching incidents have been reported. For example, in Madhya Pradesh in 2014, at least eight male bears were found professionally poached, as indicated by the skilful removal of their reproductive organs, gall bladders and claws (Basu 2014, Naveen 2014). Two of the dead bears were found near the buffer area of Khana Tiger Reserve, while the others were found in less protected forests in the state. The manner in which the bear parts were removed led many to speculate that that the poaching may be taking place on a larger scale and that the parts may have been removed for illegal international trade.<br/> <br/> The capture of cubs, which often includes the killing of the mother bear, for use as street-show ""dancing bears"" (Seshamani and Satyanarayan 1997) used to be a threat in some parts of India, but has been controlled to a significant level (D’Cruze <em>et al.</em> 2011). This practice has been illegal in India since 1972, though it continued in earnest until 2009. However it persists to a small degree in southern Nepal. It is unclear if the practitioners were always in Nepal or if they crossed the border to Nepal from India due to the political pressure to end the practice in India. Several dancing bears have been confiscated at the Nepal-India border while they were being brought into India (K. Satyanarayan, Wildlife SOS, personal communication, 2015). Additionally, a cub was rescued that was being smuggled into Nepal with clear signs that it was to be sold for use as a dancing bear (Wildlife SOS 2015).</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Sloth Bears are listed in Appendix I of CITES and are completely protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. They are also protected to varying degrees by national laws in the other range countries. However, they can be killed to protect life or property.<br/> <br/> Sloth Bears are reported to exist in 174 Protected Areas (PAs) in India, which include 46 National Parks and 128 Wildlife Sanctuaries (Chauhan 2006). Populations appear to be reasonably well protected when inside these PAs, but face deteriorating habitat conditions outside (Santiapillai and Santiapillai 1990, Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dharaiya, 2009). Reduced cover and food resources outside PAs (Akhtar <em>et al.</em> 2004) have led to increased human–bear conflicts, including frequent maulings (Bargali <em>et al.</em> 2005). It is estimated that half to two-thirds of the Sloth Bears in India live outside PAs. Roughly half the occupied range in Sri Lanka occurs outside PAs (Ratnayeke <em>et al.</em> 2007b).<br/> <br/> Human-bear conflicts, both crop raiding and bear attacks, are a growing concern for this species. Given the aggressive nature of this animal, and the increasing number of encounters between bears and people, these bears are widely feared. Although education may help reduce human-bear conflicts and enhance a conservation ethic among locals, the root of the problem is largely related to the expansion of human settlement and deteriorating habitat, which increases the chance of interaction between people and bears. Thus, habitat improvements (government or community-based reforestation) would be helpful in alleviating such conflicts. Potential solutions to this problem have not been studied in depth and further research on this issue is critical to getting this problem under control. The planting of fruit trees, to provide both food and cover, has been undertaken in several states in India.<br/> <br/> Other projects to help ameliorate human-bear conflicts will probably need to be implemented for a number of years to produce useful outcomes; long-term funding will thus be needed to advance the science of human-bear conflict resolution. Where sufficient human resources and funding exist, conflict rapid-response teams (staffed by NGOs, government personnel, and local people) can be effective. Safety guidelines can be devised and disseminated, based on knowledge of bear behaviour and ecology, to help people avoid bears or minimize chances of being attacked. Better methods to deter bears are also needed. Additionally, educational efforts to increase awareness and promote greater tolerance are likely to be keys to success.<br/> <br/> Aside from the global Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan for this species, published by the IUCN in 1999 (Servheen <em>et al.</em> 1999), India developed a National Conservation Action Plan for bears (Sathyakumar <em>et al.</em> 2012). This action plan was developed through a wide range of consultations with stakeholders and covers all four species present in India. The plan emphasizes mitigation of human-bear conflicts, increased habitat management, enhanced research and information gathering, capacity building, and improved communication and education. Priority actions in the action plan include: strengthening methods of crop and livestock protection; reducing bear-caused human injuries, creating rapid response teams to investigate conflicts with bears (and possible claims for monetary compensation); enhancing human tolerance toward bears; identifying critical habitats and corridors used by bears, especially those outside PAs; increasing habitat protection and restoring degraded habitats outside PAs; reducing dependency of local communities on resources needed by bears; discouraging shifting agriculture; developing methods to track population size and trends; involving communities in bear monitoring programs; equipping forest and wildlife staff with adequate knowledge and modern equipment to manage all types of human-bear interactions; and developing an advocacy program for bear conservation through active communication to the public and pressure on corporations and politicians.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
166520460,7951,Equus hemionus,Near Threatened,,2020,2015-05-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is assessed as Near Threatened (NT) because a population decline of at least 20% is projected over the next three generations, based on old prevailing and newly emerging risks, thus approaching Vulnerable (VU) under A3bcd. <br/><br/>Although the global population is large and currently appears stable, the rapid infrastructure development and the associated influx of people in large parts of the species range could quickly result in the re-emergence of old threats (e.g. increased competition with livestock for water and pasture, high poaching levels). Furthermore, linear infrastructure (e.g. roads, railways, canals) - if not carefully designed and mitigated - are likely to result in high mortalities if Wild Asses are impeded in their long-distance movements and become cut-off from important resources or refuge areas. Mongolia, which currently houses over 75% of the global population, is at a crossroad and the outcome will depend on Mongolia’s ability to become “a global model for demonstrating that major economic development projects can proceed without degrading ungulate migrations” (Batsaikhan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Though global dynamics are primarily driven by the large Mongolian population, locally there are both increasing and decreasing trends with some populations in Turkmenistan, Iran, Kazakhstan and China being threatened with immediate extinction. Furthermore, several population estimates are rather old and methods are rarely standardized. Consequentially, the different subspecies have also been assessed individually.","Asiatic Wild Asses inhabit mountain steppe, steppe, semi-desert and desert plains, but nowadays have become mainly confined to the low productivity semi-desert and desert plains (Bannikov 1981, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a). Wild Asses can be found in hill country and are able to cross over mountain ranges, but generally seem to avoid steeper terrain, particularly slopes &gt;20° (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have a feeding strategy similar to that observed in other equids in xeric environments. When grass is plentiful, Asiatic Wild Asses are predominately grazers. During the dry season and in drier habitats, Asiatic Wild Asses will supplement their diet with shrubs and switch to become mixed-feeders during certain seasons (Bannikov 1981, Xu <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Burnik-Sturm in prep.). Wild Asses, like all equids, need regular access to water and in captivity drink 1,020 litres daily, although they seem to be able to go without water for two to four days depending on ambient temperature and moisture content of the feed (Bannikov 1981, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010). Water availability is a key resource and in summer months the species primarily occurs within 10-15 km of standing water. In Mongolia where the ground water level is high, Asiatic Wild Ass have been observed digging holes as deep as 60 cm in dry riverbeds to access water (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2005).<br/><br/>Wild Asses are highly mobile, in the Mongolian Gobi collared animals covered average daily straight line distances of 11.9 km (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2006) or cumulative distances of 21.8 km (Kaczensky unpubl. data) within 24 hours. Wild Ass movements do not seem to follow easily predictable patterns (classical migration), but are rather nomadic. This is likely the result of the unpredictability in the availability of pasture and water in space and time (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, von Wehrden <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). In the past, when Wild Asses still occurred on mountain steppe and steppe habitats, they made seasonal migrations between summer ranges on the productive steppe habitats in the north to winter ranges in the drier, but less snowy areas in the south (Bannikov 1981).<br/><br/>Asiatic Wild Asses in Mongolia have huge annual ranges, the size of which increase from east to west, likely as a result of increasing unpredictability of pasture and water availability. In the Dzungarian Gobi annual ranges averaged 5,860 km<sup>2</sup>, in the Transaltai Gobi they ranged between 14,695-16,907&#160;km<sup>2</sup>, but in the southeast Gobi ranged from 18,186-69,988&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;(Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a, Batsaikhan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Age at first reproduction seems to be three years for mares and five years for stallions. Mares can produce a foal annually under favourable conditions up to at least 15 years of age. Sex-ratio at birth is close to 50/50 (Bannikov 1981, Saltz and Rubenstein 1995, Volf 2010). Area specific data of Asiatic Wild Ass population dynamics parameters are largely lacking or anecdotal. For the re-introduced and intensively studied population on Barsa Kelmes Island average fertility of adult mares was estimated at 66.6%, but varied depending on pasture condition and winter severity (Bannikov 1981). Foal survival in the wild likely is in the magnitude of 50% and yearling survival is lower than adult survival (Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Nowzari <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, Kaczensky pers. obs.). Age determination of 350 skulls of Asiatic Wild Ass carcasses from the Mongolian Gobi documented a mean age of 9.1 years (for animals ≥3 years) and a maximum age of 29 years (Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Lkhagvasuren <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). Average annual foal rates seem to be somewhere in the range of 1,020% (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001, Stubbe <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012). The species is polygynous and thus only a portion of the adult males contributes to reproduction, though what percentage is unknown, particularly as there is still limited understanding of the social organization of the species (Solomatin 1973, Bannikov 1981, Rubenstein 1986, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994, Klingel 1998 Shah 1993, Feh <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002 Neumann-Denzau and Denzau 2007, Rubenstein <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Shah and Qureshi, 2007, Sundaresan <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2007, Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Data on population composition and age specific mortality rates are unavailable and most surveys did not state if and how foals were included in the estimates. Without more robust population dynamics data we assumed that the number of mature individuals roughly equals 50% of the total population making for a global population of mature animals of 27,900 animals.<br/><br/>We also compared our estimate with the known population composition of one re-introduced Przewalski’s horse (<em>Equus ferus przewalski</em>) population that shares part of the range of Asiatic Wild Asses in the Mongolian Gobi and nine Cape mountain zebra populations in South Africa. In the Przewalski’s horse population the proportion of mature individuals (≥3 years for mares and ≥5 years for stallions) averaged 61% (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpubl. data 2009, 2014) and for the Cape Mountain zebra populations ranged between 55-65% (S. King pers. comm. 2014, based on H. Hrabar unpubl. data).","Threats to Asiatic Wild Asses stem from illegal hunting for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties (Bannikov 1981, Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007), competition with humans and livestock over water and pasture use (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006), and crop depredation (primarily in India, Iran and Turkmenistan; S. Esmaeili pers. comm. 2013, N. Shah pers. comm. 2014, N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014, Feh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Other threats are habitat loss as a result of human settlement and cultivation, overgrazing and degradation, and limited access to open water sources (the mere presence of people and their livestock at water points can limit or block access for wild ass; Denzau and Denzau 1999, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Of increasing concern is the continued habitat fragmentation by linear infrastructure development projects (mostly roads and railways) associated with the booming extractive industry in Mongolia and China. Asiatic Wild Asses are unable to cross fences (e.g. along the border between Mongolia and China or Iran and Turkmenistan, or fenced transportation corridors like the Ulaanbaatar-Beijing railway), have long flight distances from vehicles in areas with a high poaching pressure, and suffer from vehicle collisions (e.g., from 2009-2013, 26 Wild Asses were killed by traffic in Israel; Waner 2014). If not mitigated, fenced and/or high volume traffic corridors can be expected to create serious movement barriers (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Wild Asses have become largely confined to semi-desert and desert areas with a high variability in water and pasture availability. To cope with this unpredictable environment and track the scarce resources available, Wild Asses need to have access to large tracts of land. This is particularly true in times of weather extremes, when&#160;Wild Asses&#160;need to outrun summer droughts or extreme winters (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b). Although protected areas may provide important refuges, long-term conservation of&#160;Wild Asses&#160;will have to happen on the landscape scale. New planning tools are needed, like the “planning for a moving target” approach suggested for Saiga (<em>Saiga tatarica</em>) in Kazakhstan (Singh <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Bull <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Small, isolated populations are demographically and genetically vulnerable and prone to extinction, particularly in habitats with frequent environmental extremes (Kaczensky <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Small and localised populations also have limited resilience to disease outbreaks&#160;or climate change. For example, a disease outbreak of African horse sickness in the 1960s resulted in a major decline and the extinction of small Khur populations (Gee 1963).<br/><br/><strong>Specific threats to particular populations are outlined below:</strong><br/><br/>The main threats to Khulan in <strong>Mongolia </strong>remain competition for water and pasture with livestock. The temporally high illegal offtake in Mongolia seems to have largely ceased, but could be resumed if the economic situation becomes unstable. Newly emerging threats are rapid infrastructure development particularly in connection with resource extraction industries (mining) that could result in barriers to migrations/nomadic movements (Batsaikhan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014) and habitat loss and degradation. The impacts of mining operation tapping into “ancient” aquifers on the active ground water table are not fully understood. The situation is complicated by a lack of capacity and funding to implement landscape scale planning and conservation. Furthermore, an estimated 60,0000 illegal “ninja” miners are degrading the habitat, polluting water sources and causing huge disturbance, though initiatives are under way transforming ninja mining into a formal sub-sector and developing mercury free processing techniques.<br/><br/>Threats in northern <strong>China </strong>stem from intensified resource extraction which already resulted in the de-gazetting of parts of Kalamaili Nature Reserve, fencing and competition with local herders and their livestock (Xia <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The situation in Gansu province is data deficient and potentially Wild Asses no longer occur in that region. The situation in Inner Mongolia is also unclear, the fence along the international border with Mongolia currently inhibits population exchange between the two countries.<br/><br/>Threats to Khur in the Little Rann of Kutch in <strong>India </strong>stem from increasing human activities. Land use patterns have changed since the Mega Narmada Dam Project which resulted in the Sardar Sarovar canals all around the protected area (Goyal <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). Uninformed release of Sardar Sarovar canal excess waters into the Rann is having an impact on the micro-habitat, the short grasslands and is restricting the movement of Khur and other species across the saline desert. Increased agricultural practices have converted fallow lands into irrigation fields, resulting in shrinking habitat for the existing Khur population. Religious activities, cattle breeding and influx of people have accelerated on the Islands or Bets of the Rann.<em> Prosopis juliflora</em> invasion is an additional threat to the habitat. An estimated 30-35% of the Khur population lives outside the protected area and human-Khur conflicts are increasing, particularly crop raiding. In recent years Khur have also been increasingly hit on the major express highway. The International Boundary with Pakistan has been fenced thus restricting any possibility of Khur movement beyond borders. Although the population has somewhat increased over the past years, foaling rates in Khur have been on the decline in recent years (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014). <br/><br/>In <strong>Kazakhstan </strong>Kulan in Altyn Emel National Park are thriving, but are believed to have reached carrying capacity. Transfers to Andassay Sanctuary have been resumed, but the status and whereabouts of the reintroduced animals is largely unknown due to a lack of post-release management. Poaching still seems to be a threat outside of Altyn Emel National Park.<br/><br/>In <strong>Iran </strong>upgrading the core zone of Bahram-e-Goor protected area to Qatrouiyeh National Park and providing water supplies and occasional hay resulted in an increase of the Onager population. In contrast, the large adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area seems to act as a sink for the population due to occupation of water sources and productive ranges by livestock coupled with insufficient capacity for ranger presence and patrolling. As a result, the Onager population is concentrated in Qatrouyeh national park, which is starting to show signs of high herbivory pressure from Onagers. In Touran protected area the distribution range and abundance of Onagers have been decreasing. Occupation of suitable Onager habitats by livestock, poaching (usually by chasing the animal by motorbike) and insufficient protection are the most important threats to the species in this reserve.<br/><br/>The situation of Kulan in <strong>Turkmenistan </strong>and <strong>Uzbekistan </strong>is largely data deficient. The accuracy of population estimates and the distribution range are unclear. The border fence with Iran and Afghanistan does not allow for cross-border movements to the south any more. The autochthonous population in the Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area is declining. Large parts of the Wild Ass population in Badkhyz leave the Strictly Protected Area in summer to access water sources like the Kuska or Islim rivers close to the Afghan border. Outside the protected area, competition with livestock and crop raiding leads to conflicts with the local population. Poaching remains a problem and harassment by shepherds and their dogs and overgrazing by livestock limits Kulan access to pastures and water outside the reserve (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The reintroduced wild ass population in <strong>Israel </strong>lives in an extremely arid environment prone to droughts and in summer there are only three permanent water sources (all artificial) within the current distribution area. Presently the major known mortality cause is Wild Ass vehicle collisions. Although population size has doubled since 1999, an increase in the probability of extreme events under the predicted climate change scenario may still make this population vulnerable to extinction as modelled by Saltz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2006). Another simulation model, based on changes in allele frequencies, suggests that a strong polygynous mating system is leading to increased genetic drift (Renan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).","Population estimates of Asiatic Wild Asses are based on a wide variety of different field methods and estimation techniques ranging from attempted total counts based on ground transects or counts at strategically important habitat features (e.g. water points, winter range), population estimates based on strip transects or line transects either from the ground or air, and sign surveys. Details on survey design or details on the statistical procedures that lead to the final population estimates were rarely available. Funds and capacity for monitoring are often very limited and several population estimates are rather old. Consequently, estimates provided should be treated as best available information on the magnitude of the Wild Ass populations and their trends in the respective countries.<br/><br/>Free ranging Asiatic Wild Ass populations currently occur in eight countries in 17 more or less isolated populations with an estimated global population of 55,000 animals.<br/><br/>The largest remaining Wild Ass population, found in southern Mongolia and parts of adjacent China, had been estimated at 18,411 (± 898) for Mongolia in 2003 based on ground transects (Lhagvasuren 2007). However, new counts suggest that this survey greatly underestimated the population due to methodological constrains of covering such a huge area on the ground. A large-scale aerial survey estimated 32,843 (± 10,571) Wild Asses over 150,000 km<sup>2</sup> in the southeast Gobi in 2013 (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015) plus likely an additional 1,723 Wild Asses in the no-flight buffer zone along the Mongolian-Chinese border based on a parallel ground survey (Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Three large-scale spring time ground surveys resulted in comparable population estimates of 35,899 (18 %CV) in 2013, 39,998 (27%CV) in 2014, and 36,298 (27%CV) in 2015 (Buuveibaatar <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> in prep.) A simultaneous point count in 2010 estimated another 5,671 (3611–8907) Wild Asses over 11,027 km<sup>2</sup> in the Dzungarian Gobi (Ransom <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). These data suggest a population of over 40,000 individuals in Mongolia, with likely an additional 1,500 in the Transaltai Gobi as there have been no reported changes there since the 1997 aerial survey (Reading <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2001), plus further animals in the eastern Gobi, giving an estimate of over 42,000 animals. Based on these updated population estimates, Mongolia houses 75% of the global population of Asiatic Wild Ass. Genetic analysis of samples collected from 2002–2005 suggested gene flow over the entire range in Mongolia (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011), but this may have been compromised by recent infrastructure development.<br/><br/>An additional ~5,000 Wild Asses are believed to occur in adjacent China, primarily in Xinjiang province (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). With the upgrading of the fence along the international border in the 1980s and 1990s, population exchange between Mongolia and China has likely ceased or at least become minimal (Kaczensky <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011a, Kaczensky unpubl. data). Consequently, the Chinese populations should be regarded as separate from Mongolia.<br/><br/>The third largest population is found in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007). In 2009 the official estimate for this population was ~4,000 animals (N. Shah pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>The fourth largest population is found in Altyn Emel National Park in southeast Kazakhstan. This population was re-established via reintroductions and is currently estimated at ~2,500-3,000 animals (Plakhov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012, S.V. Sokolov pers. comm. 2011, R. Habibrakhmanov pers. comm. 2014). Two additional, isolated reintroduced populations are found in Kazakhstan: 1) on Barsa-Kelmes Island with an estimated ~347 animals (Meldebekov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010) and 2) in Andassay Sanctuary with an estimated ~35 animals (Levanov <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The total population in Kazakhstan is approximately 3,100 animals.<br/><br/>The fifth largest population is found in Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in south-central Iran, estimated at 632 (429-939) individuals of which 15% were foals in summer 2014 (M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014). While the Bahram-e-Gour population has shown a positive trend in recent years, the second population in the Touran protected area complex in northern Iran seems to have severely decreased to a mere ~145 animals (summer census 2014 - M. Hemami pers. comm. 2014, Hamidi <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). Any potential exchange with the population in adjacent Turkmenistan is inhibited by the fence along the international border. A recent reintroduction resulted in 12 free-ranging animals in Kalmand protected area. The total population in Iran is around 790 animals.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan Wild Asses only survived in Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area, bordering Iran and Afghanistan. The 2013 estimate for Badkhyz was ~420 individuals (N. Khudaykuliyev pers. comm. 2014), a 50% reduction in the population since the 2008 assessment. Rapid assessments from 2012, 2014 and 2015 suggest that the population may be even lower than 420 individuals (Kuznetsov pers. comm. 2015, Kaczensky and Linnell 2015). From Badkhyz Wild Asses were reintroduced to multiple other localities within Turkmenistan (Pavlov 1996, Lukarevskiy and Gorelov. 2007). The reintroduction to the Sarykamysh reserve was the most successful and the population is estimated at ~300-350 animals, also spreading into adjacent Uzbekistan where another ~50 animals are believed to live (Kuznetsov 2014, N. Marmazinskaja unpubl. data 2012/2013). The other reintroduction sites are all in the south, with an estimated ~100 animals in Meana Chaacha Reserve, ~13 in Western Kopetdag, and ~10-15 in Kuruhaudan (V. Kuznetsov unpubl. data 2012 and 2013). The total population in Turkmenistan and adjacent Uzbekistan is about 920 animals.<br/><br/>The reintroduced population in the Negev in Israel is currently estimated at 250 animals (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Two projects reintroduced Wild Ass populations into large enclosures – so called semi-reserves. The Dzheiran Ecocentre in Uzbekistan is 51 km<sup>2</sup> and houses a population of 98 animals (N. Soldatova unpubl. data 2013) and the Birjutschii peninsula in Ukraine is 100&#160;km<sup>2</sup>&#160;and houses 91 animals (Pavlov 1996, O. Yaremchenko pers. comm. 2014). However, these populations were not included in the IUCN Red List assessment. The planned reintroduction in Taif, Saudi Arabia never happened and no animals remain at the enclosure (Denzau and Denzau 1999, Int. Studbook Of Asiatic Wild Asses - Onager Studbook).<br/><br/>The population trend since the last Red List assessment in 2008 seems more or less stable in Mongolia, is data deficient in China, seems stable or slightly increasing in India, shows a mixed trend in Iran (with Touran dramatically decreasing, but Bahram-e-Goor increasing), is increasing or stable in Kazakhstan,&#160;data deficient&#160;in Turkmenistan (decrease in Badkhyz, but increase in Sarykamysh Reserve), increasing in Uzbekistan from Sarykamysh Reserve, and increasing in Israel.<br/><br/>See Table 1 and Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material.",Stable,"In historic times the Asiatic Wild Ass ranged throughout the steppes and desert steppes of the Russian Federation, Mongolia, northern China, northwest India, Central Asia, the Middle East, including Iran, the Arabian Peninsula and Asia Minor (Bannikov 1981, Heptner <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>1988, Denzau and Denzau 1999). Today the species' main stronghold is southern Mongolia and adjacent China. All other remaining populations are small and largely isolated from each other. One subspecies, the Syrian Wild Ass (<em>E. h. hemippus</em>), became extinct in 1927.<br/> <br/> <em>Equus hemionus</em> may have lost as much as 70% of its range since the 19th century and is now regionally extinct in most of its former range countries primarily due to competition with livestock for pastures and water and severe over-hunting (Bannikov 1981, Feh <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002). The largest remaining population is found in southern Mongolia (Reading <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Ransom <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2012, Norton-Griffiths <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013,Norton-Griffiths&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015) and parts of adjacent China (Q. Cao pers. comm. 2014 based on Bi 2007, Chu 2008). The species also survives as isolated populations in the Little Rann of Kutch in India (Shah and Qureshi 2007), the Badkhyz Reserve in Turkmenistan (Lukarevski and Gorelov 2007) and in the Touran protected area complex and Qatrouiyeh National Park and the adjacent Bahram-e-Goor protected area in Iran (Tatin <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2003, Hemami and Momeni 2013). <br/> <br/> The species has been re-established via reintroductions in Kazakhstan and Israel. Additional reintroductions have somewhat re-expanded its range in Turkmenistan (also spreading into Uzbekistan) and established two populations in large enclosures in Uzbekistan and Ukraine. The re-established population in Israel is not of the subspecies that originally occurred there, but rather of mixed <em>E. h. kulan</em> and <em>E. h. onager</em> origin (Gueta <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> </em>2014).<p></p>","Illegal trade seems to happen primarily on a national level and stem from poaching for meat, hides and fat, which like liver is believed to have apparent medicinal properties.<br/><br/>Illegal off-take in Mongolia peaked in the early 2000s and also included large scale market hunting (Wingard and Zahler 2006, Stubbe <em>et al.</em> 2007), but currently seems to be much reduced. However, illegal off-take has been identified as a key threat in parts of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iran and China and may well drive some of the small populations into extinction if not stopped.",Terrestrial,"The Asiatic Wild Ass is legally protected in all range countries. CITES has listed the subspecies <em>E.h. hemionus</em> (Mongolian Khulan) and <em>E.h. khur</em> (Indian Khur) on Appendix I and all other subspecies on Appendix II since 1975. The full species is listed on Annex A of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations since 2013. The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) listed the species on Appendix II in 2002 (UNEP/CMS 2002b). The&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;is one of the key species in the Central Asian Mammals Initiative (CAMI) of CMS (Karlstetter and Mallon 2014).<br/><br/>In all range countries protected areas have been established with the goal to protect&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses. However, almost all protected areas seem too small to sustain a population year-round or accommodate population recovery. At the fringes of protected areas conflicts with the local population tend to be increasing and/or Asiatic Wild Asses are subject to high levels of illegal killing. Consequently, landscape scale planning and integrative approaches that also take local people’s needs into account are needed for future conservation planning. Unfortunately China just de-gazetted substantial parts of the Kalamaili Nature reserve, a major stronghold of wild asses in Xinjiang, to allow coal mining (Xia <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>On the other hand, Badkhyz Strictly Protected Area in Turkmenistan (M. Day pers. comm. 2014) and the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia (T. Jaeger pers. comm. 2014) have been listed as possible candidate sites for nomination as UNESCO world heritage sites. For Badkhyz an expansion of the State Nature Reserve, additional adjacent nature reserves and an ecological corridor safeguarding the seasonal migrations of&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are being currently implemented. A ‘transboundary ecological corridor’ connecting Kalamaili Nature Reserve in Xinjiang province in China, and Great Gobi A and B Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia via the limited entry border area of northern Xinjiang and southern Mongolia has been suggested to re-establish transboundary&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;movements (Kaczensky <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011a, Xu <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012), but will likely fail without political lobbying.<br/><br/>Although rapid infrastructure development is likely creating one of the biggest challenges for the conservation of migratory and nomadic ungulates, No Net Loss (NNL) or Net Positive Impact (NPI) policies adopted by industry, and newly emerging standards on Biodiversity Offsets (BBOP 2012) are powerful tools that may enable economic development to combine with biodiversity conservation, and offsets may actually provide a more flexible tool to conserve nomadic species (Bull <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). In Mongolia, the largest mine Oyu Tolgoi is operating on a NPI policy and&#160;Asiatic Wild Asses are a key species of concern.<br/><br/>Reintroductions have re-established the&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Israel and somewhat expanded its range in Turkmenistan. The reintroduced populations contribute ~8% to the global population, but only managed to reoccupy a tiny fraction of the species former range. New reintroductions are currently discussed in Kazakhstan and Iran. However, care has to be taken that reintroduction projects do not distract attention and funds from conserving the remaining autochthonous populations.<br/><br/>Whereas increasing monitoring and research efforts are made in Mongolia, Israel, Xinjiang province in China, India and Bahram-e-Goor in Iran, little systematic information is available from Inner Mongolia and Gansu province in China, Touran protected area complex in Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Furthermore, major research gaps exist regarding: i) the human dimension of&#160;Asiatic Wild Ass&#160;management and conservation, ii) site specific population dynamics parameters, iii) triggers, drivers, and scale of nomadic or seasonal movements, iv) impact and mitigation of barriers.<br/><br/>A Programme of Work for the CMS Central Asian Mammal Initiative (CAMI) was agreed during the Stakeholder Meeting on the Conservation of Large Mammals in Central Asia, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (2325 September 2014) and included a recommendation to develop a single-species action plan for the Asiatic Wild Ass as a high priority.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Its long-term future will be closely linked to the preservation of substantial areas of relatively unmodified equatorial forest.","Inhabits primary and relatively unmodified equatorial forests ranging from lowland to mid elevations. While it shows a preference for high primary rainforest, it may occupy patches of forest within savanna mosaics; also occurs in old farmbush and old secondary forest (Kingdon and Feer 2013).","The major threats to this species include bushmeat hunting, which takes place across its range (using both cable snares and nets) and habitat loss and degradation (particularly in the face of expanding human settlement), especially given its preference for primary forest. The combination of systematic habitat destruction and the commercialization of hunting and trapping likely will ensure the eventual elimination of Bay Duiker outside protected areas (Kingdon and Feer 2013). Even then they are unlikely to survive in smaller protected areas because of habitat degradation and poaching: in Ghana, for example, this species has been extirpated from six parks and protected areas (Kingdon and Feer 2013), and Van Vliet <em>et al. </em>(2007) recorded its likely extirpation from Ipassa Natural Reserve in NE Gabon.","Population densities are summarized by Wilson (2001) and Kingdon and Feer (2013). East (1999) produced a total population estimate of 725,000. While its numbers are generally stable in the less disturbed forests where hunting pressures are relatively low, its overall numbers are in decline because of loss of habitat and over-hunting for meat in other parts of its range (East 1999).",Decreasing,"The Bay Duiker has a disjunct distribution, occurring in the forests of West Africa from Guinea-Bissau to Togo; and in Central Africa, east of the Niger River to the montane forests in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and south to north-east Angola to about 11°S.

A suspected population decline caused by significant and accelerating rates of deforestation is projected to continue and perhaps accelerate. Combined with the facts that more than 90% of the population is believed to occur outside of protected areas, and the species continues to be hunted for food and medicinal purposes, a population loss equalling or exceeding 50% can be anticipated over three generations (between the years 2000 and 2045).<br/></p>","<p>This gibbon is a forest-dweller that inhabits primary evergreen, scrub and semi-deciduous hill forest, as well as mountainous broadleaf forest, but it cannot survive in pine-dominated forest. It ranges up to 2,700 m in elevation in Mt.&#160;Gaoligong&#160;(P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013). The annual mean temperature is 13.3&#160;°C and 13.1°C&#160;at two sites of Mt.&#160;Gaoligong.&#160;Gibbon habitat can be covered by snow in cold winters.<br/> <br/> Two habituated groups are well studied by Fan Peng-Fei. and his team. Annual diet of a group in Mt.&#160;Gaoligong&#160;comprised 49.1% fruit (non-fig fruit 35.6%and fig 13.5%), 43.3% leaves (buds, young and mature leaves), 5.3% invertebrates and bird chicks, 1.8% flowers, and 0.6% others. Individuals prefer ripe fruits when they are available. They shift their diet to leaves and buds and&#160; increased feeding time when fruits and figs are not available (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2013). Groups use large home ranges (93 and 178 ha for two groups), and use different sections monthly (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>., 2017; Zhang <em>et al</em>., 2014). Their daily travel distance varied from month to month (group&#160;BB: mean&#160;=&#160;1,308 ± SD 735 m, range&#160;=&#160;272–3,705 m, N = 60 days; group NA: mean&#160;=&#160;1126 ± SD 488 m, range&#160;=&#160;345–2,606 m, N = 52 days (P.-F. Fan <em>et al</em>. 2017), mostly depends on their diet and food availability. They decrease travel distance when they eat more leaves (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Adults live in pairs and coordinate their singing to produce duet bouts that lasted for an average 25.5 min. Paired adults never produce solo bouts unless they are separated by human disturbances. The singing rate (number of bouts/number of monitoring days) of four groups in Mt.&#160;Gaoligong&#160;range from 7.5% to 31.4% which was lower than other gibbon populations, presumably due to low group density and prevalence of hunting at the study site (Yin <em>et al.</em>, 2016).&#160;&#160;One group stop calling for 68 days after at least 30 gunshots were heard from its home range.<br/><br/>Like other gibbons, Skywalker Hoolock Gibbons sleep in tall trees, and rarely use the same tree on consecutive days. They travel very fast to enter sleeping trees 2-3 hours before sunset. They mostly sleep on branches of diameter less than 10 cm and close to tree tops. Anti-predation is an important factor that affects Skywalker Hoolock Gibbon’s sleeping behavior (P.-F. Fan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Neighbouring groups rarely fight along territory borders. Only one inter-group conflict was recorded in four years (Yin <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>","<p>In China, although commercial logging has been banned, <em>Hoolock tinxiang</em> is threatened by small-scale habitat loss, degradation, fragmentation, and hunting (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2011, Yin <em>et al</em>. 2016). Local people believe that the brain of&#160;hoolock&#160;gibbons can be used to cure epilepsy. Nearly half of the remnant population now live in agro-forestry complexes (e.g., cardamom cultivation)<em></em>. Although cardamom cultivation causes some negative effects on gibbons, these agro-forestry complexes provide important gibbon habitat provided they are not too fragmented and hunting is prohibited (Zhang <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, <em>H. tinxiang</em> remains threatened by habitat loss due largely to slash-and-burn agriculture, gold mining and logging, and secondarily by hunting for food and medicinal purposes (Ni <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160; Unfortunately, the species is not known to occur in any protected areas in this country.&#160; According to the most recent Global Forest Watch (2019) data for Myanmar, the six administrative divisions in which <em>H. tinxiang</em> is believed to occur - Shan, Mandalay, Kayah, Bago, Kayan and Mon - have lost nearly 9% of their forest cover since 2000, are collectively losing forest at a rate above the national average, and that rate has accelerated significantly in recent years. The previous gibbon generation (2000–2015) could have been expected to decline at a corresponding rate, and the present generation (2016–2030) and subsequent generation (2031–2045) can be expected to decline at a corresponding rate as well - this would result in a population decline related to habitat loss of at least 30%.&#160; Should the current rate of loss continue to accelerate, which it appears to be doing, and hunting continue as well, a decline in population approaching or exceeding 50% can easily be anticipated.<br/></p><p>  </p><p></p>","<p>In China, the population is estimated to be approximately 200 individuals in nine (9) subpopulations<em></em> (Fan <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, population estimates have ranged between 10,000 and 50,000 individuals (Geissmann <em>et al.</em> 2013).

Like all other red colobus species (Struhsaker 2005), Oustalet’s Red Colobus is slow moving and is easily hunted. Hunting threatens populations in a number of areas, including portions of the range with low human population densities. At the northern and eastern edges of its range, the primary threat to this species is habitat loss and degradation. Large areas of the range comprise areas of rapidly advancing deforestation and agricultural expansion (Harris <em>et al.</em> 2017) and the species now appears to be absent in a number of locations where it was recorded historically. Further loss, degradation and fragmentation of the species’ range are expected into the foreseeable future. Projected to 2035, it is suspected that the population decline will exceed 30% over 30 years (equivalent to three generations), thus qualifying <em>P. oustaleti </em>as Vulnerable under criterion A4cd.","<p>Oustalet’s Red Colobus&#160;shows at least three distinct ecological modes, each covering significant portions of the range<em>. </em>It<em>&#160;</em>is found in contiguous, mature primary lowland tropical moist forest; seasonally- or permanently-inundated swamp forest, and in gallery forest and isolated forest islands in savanna woodland.</p><p>Large contiguous lowland forest blocks that contain important populations of this red colobus are found in Ituri, Rubi Tele and Aketi in DRC and in northern Congo. In these areas, this red colobus is recorded mostly in primary evergreen forest, though it also uses older secondary forest, and appears to prefer riversides and swamp forests. The species uses a range of mature forest types. In the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, they are found in monodominant stands of <em>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei</em>, where they feed on flower buds and immature seeds during periods of mast flowering and fruiting (J. Hart, unpublished observations 2007). They do not occur in younger secondary forest. In lowland evergreen forests, <em>P. oustaleti</em> can form large groups where they are not hunted. Counts of up to 70 animals were made in some groups in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the past (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2008); up to 50 in 2011, but the more recent dataset (which only covers about a quarter of the reserve at the time of writing) suggests that group sizes are now smaller (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2018).</p><p>In the Ngotto Forest in CAR, this species only occurs in flooded riverine forests (Gautier-Hion &amp; Brugière 2005). Galat-Luong &amp; Galat (1979) reported that they spent 30% of their time below 10 m above ground and regularly enter into water to collect bulbs of aquatic plants. Large blocks of seasonally- or permanently-inundated forest are found in the west of the species range, in the confluence region of the Congo, Sangha and Ubangi rivers, including Lac Télé in Congo.</p><p>The eastern-most populations of <em>P. oustaleti </em>occupy small isolated forest islands and galleries on the Lake Albert escarpment. Semi-deciduous tree species dominate the high elevation gallery forests where <em>P. oustaleti </em>has been studied recently (Laudisoit <em>et al</em>. 2016, Scholier 2017). Home range size in some of these blocks is highly constrained, suggesting that these populations, which have no means of dispersal, are likely under periodic resource stress.</p>","<p>Habitat loss and hunting are the primary threats to this species. Habitat loss is particularly severe for the populations that occur in small forest islands and galleries at the northern and eastern limits of the range. Sources of deforestation in this environment include growing numbers of small holder farmers, expansion of nomadic pastoralism, small-scale logging and charcoal production. These latter threats are growing in a zone where ready sources of timber and fuel wood are scarce. Even low levels of firewood, house pole collection and timber harvest could have severe impact on populations in these areas, as they are constrained to very small home ranges and may be exposed to periods of stress exacerbated by the removal of key resources.</p>  <p>In parts of DRC, in portions of the range originally covered by contiguous forest, there are growing halos of deforestation around the population centres of Bunia, Isiro, Buta, Lisala and Gemena. A band of forest loss and degradation up to 100 km wide now isolates <em>P. oustaleti</em> populations in the Abubumbazi forest block. Commercial scale oil-palm plantations established in the Lisala area have led to permanent loss of habitat. Areas showing high rates of deforestation affect about 25% of <em>P. oustaleti’s</em> range (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss in the current geographic range of the taxon totaled around 15,000&#160;km²&#160;between 2001 and 2016 (Global Forest Watch/WRI 2018).</p>  <p>Hunting, usually with shotguns, is a threat to <em>P. oustaleti</em>&#160;in a number of areas, including Buta and the Rubi-Télé Hunting Domain (T. Hart, pers. comm. 2007), and across the whole of northern Congo and southwestern CAR outside the areas protected by wildlife guards. Though hunting is not yet common in the Ituri forest, it appears to be a growing threat in the Ituri landscape, in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve and the adjacent, unprotected Mai Tatu forest (R. Mwinyihali, pers. comm. 2018). Widespread hunting was recorded in the Abubumbazi Forest in the northwest extreme of the species range in DRC, where no red colobus were recorded during a brief survey (J. Hart pers. obs. 1989). The bushmeat trade is active around Buta-Aketi (Hicks <em>et al</em>. 2010). Two red colobus were amng 169 monkey carcasses recorded for sale during 2007 and 2008 surveys (Hicks, unpublished data). One red colobus was among 21 identified monkey carcasses encountered between Banalia-Buta-Titulé in 2012 (Hicks 2014).</p>","<p>Given the size of its geographic range,&#160;Oustalet’s Red Colobus&#160;is likely to be among the more numerous of the red colobus taxa (Struhsaker and Grubb 2013). No estimates of <em>P. oustaleti</em>&#160;density are available; however, it has been recorded as common by a number of large-scale surveys. <em>Piliocolobus oustaleti</em> was the third most observed species in the flooded forests of Ngotto in southwestern CAR (Brugière <em>et al</em>. 2005), and was classified as common at eight of 12 survey sites covering the central portion of its range (Buta-Aketi Region) from 24 to 26° E (Hicks 2010, 2014, unpublished data). The species was among the most commonly recorded primates in surveys of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve between 1993 and 2011 (Grossman <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart <em>et al</em>. 2008, Vosper <em>et al</em>. 2011) although the most recent information shows that its abundance has fallen relative to other species (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2018). A large area in the eastern Ituri forest (Mai Tatu) also harbours this red colobus, although again it is now one of the least commonly recorded (Wildlife Conservation Society, unpublished data 2008, 2014).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Piliocolobus oustaleti</em>&#160;occurs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Republic of Congo (Congo), and has been recorded historically or marginally in South Sudan. It is also present in the extreme southwest of the Central African Republic (CAR). Its extent of occurrence (EEO) is estimated at 766,035 km². The eastern limit of its range is at about 31°E and includes the gallery forests and forest islands on the escarpments above Lake Albert. The northernmost record for the species is 4.50 N is northeastern DRC (Garamba National Park; Groves 2007). North of the Uélé River headwaters, the species has been historically recorded sporadically in gallery forests and forest islands in savanna from northern DRC to southern South Sudan. The Uélé River defines the northern limit of the range from about 210 through 270 E.&#160; Historically, the species was recorded near the forest-savanna boundary between Lisala and Gemena (M. Collet unpublished data 1983). The southern limits of its range are the Aruwimi (Ituri) River and the Congo River to its confluence with the Sangha river at 1013’ S.

Smith pers. comm. 2018). Contrary to Gautier-Hion <em>et al</em>. (1999), <em>P. oustaleti</em> does not occur north of the Uélé River west of 27 0 E. This includes large undisturbed blocks of closed forest in the Bili-Gangu region where recent surveys documented a rich forest primate fauna, but failed to find this species (Hart 2012; Hicks 2010, 2014). It appears that the populations that have been documented in small forest islands and galleries in the northern Uélé headwaters, never ranged west across the open savannas of the Ango-Digba region to reach these closed forests. The Uélé River, at this longitude, apparently represents a major barrier to dispersal by populations from the forest blocks to the south.</p><p>  </p><p>&#160;</p>  <p><br/></p>  <br/><p></p>",This species is hunted illegally.

Poaching of this species for the bushmeat trade is intensifying, and much of the forest in its range is now almost “empty” of large mammals. Because of its relatively large body size, the Black Mangabey is more attractive to hunters than the smaller <em>Cercopithecu</em>s monkeys with which it shares its range. The species is also threatened by habitat loss and is suspected to have declined by at least 30% over the past three generations (30 years).</p>","<p>This species is found in primary and secondary moist forests. In Salonga National Park, the Black Mangabey also uses swamp forests, but does not occupy swamp in Lomako (McGraw 1994). It uses all forest strata (especially the middle canopy layers), but seldom descends to the ground (Horn 1987, McGraw 1994). Its diet consists largely of fruits and seeds, with high rates of nectarivory in some months of the year. Foraging activity is concentrated in the early morning (Horn 1987, Gautier-Hion &amp; Maisels 1994, McGraw 1994).</p>","<p>Little is known about the status of this species. However, it is subject to intense, uncontrolled poaching for its meat in most parts of its range. It is also threatened by loss of forest habitat in the south of its range. Bushmeat data collected along the Congo River suggest that very few of these monkeys have been sold at the markets during the past decade; implying that very few are left in the forest (Laudisoit, pers. obs. late 2010s). Black Mangabeys are large-bodied, and provide more meat per unit effort than the smaller guenons (<em>Cercopithecus</em> spp.) with which they share the habitat. They are, therefore, more attractive to hunters, especially if shotguns are used (a shotgun cartridge costs about US$1 in the region). Quantitatively, a recce survey between the two sectors of the Salonga National Park in 2009 (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2009) showed that monkeys in general, and Black Mangabeys in particular, were very rare to the west of the park headquarters at Monkoto, and increasingly rare to absent at the western extreme (where the highest concentrations of people are located in the corridor). Overall encounter rate was 0.13 groups/km. A recce survey carried out at the same time and using the same survey method in the unprotected Sankuru Reserve (Liengola <em>et al</em>. 2010) recorded the species only 10 times in 400 km of survey effort – an encounter rate of only 0.025/km walked, and one-fifth of that recorded in the Salonga corridor, which was (and still is) at least partially protected by forest guards.</p>  <p>In Salonga in 2016–2017, encounter rate of groups on transects varied between 0.2 (southern sector of the park) to 0.3 (northern sector) (Wildlife Conservation Society unpublished data 2016 and 2017, Ikati <em>et al</em>. 2017), so still an order of magnitude greater than encounter rates outside the park. It is likely that most unprotected forests in the range of this species are defaunated of the larger-bodied species, including Black Mangabeys. They had completely vanished from the Swa-Kabula Reserve in the southwest of the country before 1990 (Dino 2014). The same is likely to have occurred throughout their range, especially where human populations can travel freely and rapidly through the habitat (the case in savanna-forest mosaics south of the Kasai River).</p>  <p>Rates of forest loss differ in the geographic ranges of the two subspecies.

A total of 3.7% of the forest cover that existed in 2001 was lost between 2001 and 2016 (GFW/WRI 2018). In <em style=""font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;"">L. a. aterrimus </em>range, in the more closed-canopy continuous Congo Basin forests further north, the forest cover loss was only 2% during the same period – just over half of the rate of loss further south (of the subspecies' total range of 585,300&#160;km²).</p>","<p>Although <em>Lophocebus aterrimus</em><strong> </strong>is widespread, its total population size is unknown and surveys are needed. Several decades ago, densities of around 70 individuals/km² were recorded in Lomako and Lac Tumba in DRC (Horn 1987, McGraw 1994). The population is suspected to have undergone a reduction of at least 30% over the last 30 years (three generations) based on intensifying hunting pressure on this species for the bushmeat trade and habitat loss in the south of its range.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Lophocebus aterrimus&#160;</em>occurs&#160;south of the Congo River in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in lowland rainforest areas of the southwest Congo Basin.

South of the Kasai River, the taxon is limited to the west by the Kwango River, and to the south by the forest-savanna boundary.</p>  <p>There are two subspecies (following Grubb <em>et al</em>. 2003): <em>L. </em><em>aterrimus<em> aterrimus</em></em> is found in the central Congo basin; <em>L. a. opdenboschi</em> is/was found in a very small area of northeastern Angola (Machado 1969, Gautier-Hion 2013), and in southwestern DRC. The two subspecies are separated by the Kasai River, which cuts diagonally across the range at roughly 3°&#160;to 4°&#160;S. The Black Mangabey was extirpated from the Swa-Kibula Reserve, a protected area on the Angolan border, before 1990 (Dino 2014).

Data summarised by FAO (2015) show that in the 1990–2015 period there was a 22.5% reduction of forest across the eight West African countries where the Olive Colobus occurs. When combined with evidence of continued heavy hunting pressure for the bushmeat trade, those data can be used to suspect at least a 30% reduction in population size in a 27-year period. The cryptic nature of the Olive Colobus, and its ability to survive in riverine forests and small forest fragments, and to adapt to some anthropogenic disturbance, have no doubt enabled the species to persist in many parts of their range. However, their decline is expected to continue in the future and, given an accelerating loss of forest habitat in West Africa (which already has one of the highest rates in the world) and continuing hunting pressure, both of which are related to continued high rates of human population growth in West Africa, <em>Procolobus verus</em> is evaluated as Vulnerable under both A2cd and A4cd.    </p><p><br/></p>","<p>This species, the smallest of all colobine monkeys, inhabits the forest zone of West Africa and is often associated with areas of secondary growth within high forest, and with swamp forests. The Olive Colobus has also been observed in forest galleries in dry forest regions. It can survive in quite small and degraded forest fragments. Olive Colobus are arboreal and most commonly occupy the lower and middle forest strata, but they will occasionally descend and move on the ground. They are cryptic in colouration and behaviour, live in small social groups, and typically associate closely with other forest monkeys, especially <em>Cercopithecus</em> species (Oates and Whitesides 1990, Nobimè and Sinsin 2003, Oates 2011, Oates and Korstjens 2013). The monkeys prefer dense growth below 20 m, but may ascend higher when feeding or moving in the company of other species. The diet of the Olive Colobus is comprised mainly of leaves and leaf parts (75-90%), especially young leaves, along with flowers and unripe seeds (Oates and Korstjens 2013).</p>","<p>This species is almost certainly declining due to loss of its forest habitats and hunting. Although the Olive Colobus can live in disturbed forests, even secondary forest is being replaced by farms and plantations in many parts of West Africa, and other species of monkey with which the Olive Colobus typically associates are being eliminated by hunting. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are among three of 10 countries in the world that had the fastest annual acceleration of tree cover loss in the 2001–2014 period, based on an analysis of satellite imagery, with Sierra Leone (once a stronghold for this species) recording the world’s second greatest annual forest loss rate of 12.6% (Petersen <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Nigeria, in the most easterly part of the species range, <em>P. verus</em> can be considered Endangered as a consequence of heavy hunting pressure and escalating habitat loss (R. Ikemeh pers. comm. 2016); data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization show a 5% per annum loss of forest cover in Nigeria in the 2010–2015 period compared with 2.7% per annum in 1990–2000 (FAO 2015).&#160;The same data analysis (FAO 2015) shows that in the eight countries in which Olive Colobus populations have been found (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo) there was a combined total forest loss in the 1990–2015 period of 22.5%. A separate analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey’s EROS Centre shows a total forest loss in the Upper Guinea region (excluding Benin and Nigeria) of 25% between 1975 and 2013 (CILSS 2016). Given the continuation of uncontrolled hunting of monkeys across much of this species’ range, it is suspected that <em>P. verus</em> has suffered a population reduction of at least 30% in the last three generations, and that this decline will accelerate in the future.</p>","<p>Although quite secretive, Olive Colobus are still present in many parts of their range; however, they have naturally low population densities (McGraw 2007) and are almost certainly declining in numbers. Surveys in Kakum Conservation Area, Ghana, in 2009–2010 encountered this species at a lower rate than reported from surveys in 1993 (Wiafe 2016). Surveys in southwestern Ghana in 2012 reported its presence in the forest reserves of Krokosua Hills, Ayum, Subin, Bia North, Mpameso, Bia-Tano and Bokoni, at encounter rates of between 0.03 and 0.13 groups per km, and in Bia National Park at 0.23 groups per km (Danquah <em>et al</em>. 2012). In Côte d’Ivoire, recent surveys reported the presence of the species in several protected and unprotected areas, but at very low densities (Gonedelé Bi <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Côte d’Ivoire the most important populations occur in the Tanoé Forest and in Taï National Park, where estimated densities are 1.9 groups per sq. km (S. Gonedelé Bi pers. obs. 2009) and 2.65 groups per&#160;km²&#160;(Covey 2009) respectively. In the 1980s, the density in secondary and riverine forest at Tiwai Island, Sierra Leone, was 1.2 groups per&#160;km²&#160;(Oates <em>et al</em>. 1990). A recent survey of Benin found them to have a more widespread distribution than previously known (Djego-Djossou <em>et al</em>. 2014), but with a small total population; none were observed during a 2015 survey in neighbouring Togo (G. Segniagbeto pers. comm. 2016).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Olive Colobus is confined to the forests of West Africa, and is discontinuously distributed from southern Sierra Leone and Guinea to south-east Nigeria (Oates 1981, 2011). The main discontinuity in their recent distribution appears to be in western Nigeria, between the border with the Republic of Benin and the River Niger; populations are known in the Niger Delta and in southern Benue State, Nigeria, just east of the Niger. However, the species’ distribution in eastern Ghana, and Togo and Benin also appears to be very patchy.

The primary drivers of these threats—human population growth and the expansion of artisanal mining—are likely to increase into the foreseeable future. Most of the species’ range is in a region of endemic and ongoing human conflict, which has exacerbated known threats, and weakened organised efforts to protect these primates. It is suspected that the population decline of <em>C. hamlyni</em> will continue, resulting in an overall population reduction of more than 30% over a 30-year time frame from 2003 to 2033 (given a 10-year generation length). The taxon thus meets the Vulnerable threshold for criterion A4cd.","<p>A predominantly terrestrial species recorded from lowland to mid-montane tropical moist forest and montane bamboo forest. In the lowland forest zone (450–1,000 m), which comprises the major portion of the range, <em>C. hamlyni</em> occurs mainly in primary forest areas. The species occupies older secondary forest in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, but does not favour young secondary forests, and is not known to occur in gallery forests in savannas at the southern limit of its range (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013). The isolated forest blocks south of the species’ contiguous EOO, where <em>C. hamlyni</em> have been recorded historically, range in size from 200–450&#160;km²&#160;and are located on small chains of hills. There is no evidence that these blocks were isolated due to historic human activities, and they may represent relictual range areas, isolated by climate-induced habitat change during the Quaternary or Holocene. In any case, they suggest that isolated populations of <em>C. hamlyni</em> may be able to persist even in a fragmented landscape. Further investigation of the current status of these populations, and exploration of other isolated forest massifs in this region for presence of the species is urgently needed.</p>  <p>Mean group size in the Kahuzi-Biega lowlands and Ituri Forest is 2–3 animals (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2002-2003), In Nyungwe National Park group size averaged 3.6 animals (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011). These estimates are based on sightings of animals from line transects. However, given the difficulties of directly observing these monkeys, this may be an underestimate of group size. The species feeds primarily on the ground. Diet is poorly documented but known to include fruits and seeds. In the Ituri Forest (elevation 700–750 m) <em>C. hamlyni</em> forages opportunistically on sprouting seedlings when&#160;<em>Gilbertiondendron dewevrei</em>&#160;undergoes&#160;<a style=""mso-comment-reference:eaw_1;mso-comment-date:20180408T1956"">mast</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;fruiting. Fungi and herbaceous vegetation are eaten during periods of fruit scarcity (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Nyungwe population feeds extensively on bamboo shoots, and this is likely to be the case in other montane locations such as Kahuzi-Biega and Mt. Tshiaberimu, where the species occurs in the bamboo zones. Given the range of habitats occupied<em>, C. hamlyn</em>i appears to have a wide dietary tolerance with specialization based on local and seasonal food availability.</p><p><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Leopards and crowned eagles are known to prey on<em> C. hamlyni</em> in the Ituri Forest; nonetheless, the species was recorded at a low frequency in one study of leopard diets (Hart <em>et al</em>. 1996).</span></p>","<p>This species is threatened by habitat loss and poaching. Habitat loss and degradation, due primarily to deforestation by shifting cultivators and small holder farmers, is the most significant threat at present and is growing rapidly. Forest loss in DRC increased by a factor of 2.5 between 2011 and 2017 (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017). Forest loss and associated degradation have been particularly intense in the eastern and southern portions of <em>C. hamlyni’s</em> range. The impact is most severe in the submontane and montane portions of the range, where human population densities are highest.</p>  <p>Factors promoting habitat loss include rural population growth and expansion of artisanal mining. These will continue to prevail into the foreseeable future. Within the range of <em>C. hamlyni</em>, high rates of forest loss are particularly evident around growing settlements of Beni, Kalima, Kindu, Kisangani, Lubutu, Mambasa,&#160;Opienge and Punia. Deforestation and forest degradation are expanding along networks of abandoned roads emanating from these centres, leading to fragmentation of previously intact forest blocks. East of Kisangani, and in the peripheries of Kahuzi-Biega and Maiko national parks, large roadless forest blocks have been invaded by artisanal miners leading to new clearings in remote areas. A recent deforestation hotspot analysis (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017) indicates that about 40% of <em>C. hamlyni</em> range has been affected by moderate to severe forest loss and degradation. Vast areas of newly-emerging deforestation hot spots intersect with intact primary forests and extend into several protected areas (Harris <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>For the past two decades, eastern DRC has been the theatre of entrenched conflict promulgated by a multiplicity of rural militia, a number of whom are based in national parks. The militia attack and loot villages, and exploit artisanal mining or are involved in it themselves. The conflict has led to large movements of internally displaced people (IDPs) and has contributed to the opening of new settlements and expansion of existing settlements. In 2017, over 850,00 unsettled IDPs were registered in administrative territories within the geographic range of <em>C. hamlyni</em> (UNOCHA 2018).</p>  <p>Expanding settlement and artisanal mining are associated with increased hunting and poaching. <em>Cercopithecus hamlyni</em> is shy and difficult to detect. Although this species is not a frequent target of hunters, its terrestrial habits make it vulnerable to snares set for other species. A recent survey of bushmeat market vendors in Kalima, a mining centre in the southern portion of its range, revealed only one fresh <em>C. hamlyni</em> carcass among 38 primates (dried and fresh) on sale. According to vendors interviewed, as recently as five years ago, they could expect to offer 3–5 fresh <em>C. hamlyni</em> per day. Four hunters in three villages to the south and west of Kalima, bordering the region’s remaining forest areas, stated that snare captures of <em>C. hamlyni </em>have been declining for the past 15 years, and are now uncommon. (J. Hart unpublished data 2018).</p>","<p><em>Cercopithecus hamlyni</em> is widespread and variably abundant. Important populations have been documented in the lowland sector of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, with densities of 5-7 individuals per km² (Hall <em>et al. </em>2002-2003) and the species persists throughout this park (Kujirakwinja <em>et al. </em>2015; Spira <em>et al. </em>2015a, 2015b, 2017). Populations surveyed at montane sites at the species’ altitudinal limit appear to be small. In Nyungwe Nation al Park, encounter rates&#160;averaged 0.08 groups/km (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011). <em>Cercopithecus hamlyni</em> is a cryptic and quiet species, which is difficult to census and characteristically moves away from observers before detection, therefore population estimates based on visual contact probably underestimate population sizes. Surveys at dawn in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve of “booming” male vocalisations suggest that <em>C. hamlyni</em> is locally common, and that this is a stronghold for the species (J. Hart, unpublished data 2012). Methods&#160;appropriate for estimating&#160;<em>C. hamlyni</em>&#160;population size, such as camera trap surveys, show&#160;promise (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011), but have not yet been conducted.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>The range of&#160;<em>Cercopithecus</em>&#160;<em>hamlyni </em>resembles that of <em>Allochrocebus lhoesti</em>, with a continuous EOO from the Congo/Lualaba River in the west, through the forested basins of the Lindi, Ituri, Maiko, Lowa, Ulindi and Elila rivers in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the bulk of the range falls, into the submontane and montane forests of the Albertine Rift, where a small portion of the range is located. The range is bounded in the north by the Lindi-Nepoko river system and in the south by the southern limit of tropical moist forest (about 4° S). The only known population outside DRC occurs in an area of about 32 km² in Rwanda's Nyungwe National Park (Easton <em>et al</em>. 2011). A second Rwandan population in Gishwati is now likely extirpated due to habitat loss (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013). Historically, populations of <em>C. hamlyni</em> have been reported from several small, isolated forest blocks, south to nearly 6° S (Hart <em>et al</em>. 2013); however, its current status in these areas is unknown. The eastern-most highland populations of <em>C. hamlyni </em>are now isolated in fragmented habitat islands, some of which have been recently extirpated, such as the forest islands between Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Masisi. The species has not been reported from areas of Burundi adjoining the Nyungwe population and its possible former occurrence in Uganda is not supported by museum specimens.</p><p></p>  <p>We estimate that the species’ elevational range extends from 450 m, where C. hamlyni has recently been recorded east of Kindu, 40 km from the Congo/Lualaba River&#160;(Hart pers. obs. 2018), to 3,200 m on Mt.

In Odzala-Kokoua National Park in Congo, they use seasonally-inundated and riverine habitats and occasionally the Marantaceae-dominated terra firma forests (Maisels 1995, 1996). In the area east of Makokou in Gabon, they were found in riverine forests (Quris 1975). By contrast, a study group at Mondika in CAR spent most of its time in terra firma mixed forest, and was never observed along the Mondika River, nor in swamp forest along the Ndoki River (Shah 2003), whereas a group at Bai Hokou, also in CAR, spent some time along rivers and streams (N. Shah pers. obs. 2003). <em>Cercocebus agilis</em><strong> </strong>also uses open-understorey <em>Gilbertiodendron dewevrei </em>dominated forest (Shah 2003, Devreese 2011).

These monkeys are usually active in lower strata (0–10 m) of the habitat (Quris 1975, Shah 2003), although they spend less time on the ground than other <em>Cercocebus</em> spp. (Shah 2003).

Because these monkeys spend a fair proportion of time on the ground, they are vulnerable to snaring – a method of hunting used throughout its geographic range. Snares are usually set for forest antelopes and rodents, but can catch any terrestrial animal.<br/><br/>At the western, northern and eastern edges of its range, this species is threatened by habitat loss caused by deforestation for timber and firewood. An analysis of forest loss suggests that 1.3% of the forest in its range was lost between 2001 and 2016 (13,368 km²&#160;of the 1 million km² range). However, because this taxon occurs primarily along rivers, this may be an underestimate of the true loss of habitat, as forest loss in the savanna-forest mosaic will be concentrated along rivers and galleries.</p>","<p><a name=""_GoBack""></a>Few data exist on abundance relative to human pressure, but even in 1996, in the more westerly part of its range (Lobéké NP, Cameroon), the abundance of <em>C. agilis</em> was an order of magnitude lower than the smaller-bodied, sympatric guenons at that site, and it was recorded only at distances of over 20 km from a road (an indicator of high hunting pressure), whereas smaller-bodied primate species still occurred close to the road (WCS unpublished data 1996). In the most easterly part of its range, in the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, encounter rates on surveys declined by an order of magnitude (WCS unpublished data 2018) over the last decade. This is attributed to increased hunting pressure, due to easier access along a much-improved main road, to the influx of large numbers of people into the area for artisanal mining, and to ongoing civil unrest in eastern DRC.</p><p>Densities of Agile Mangabeys appear to be highly variable, presumably influenced by both habitat type and hunting pressure.

At Mondika in Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park (Congo), density was 6.9 individuals/km²&#160;(Shah 2003). In Odzala-Kokoua National Park (Congo), group size was usually at least 20, and there were between 0.5 and 2 groups/km²&#160;(10–40 animals/km²), depending on the habitat type (Maisels 1996). In the Ituri Forest (DRC), densities varied between 2 individuals/km²&#160;(Thomas 1991) and 38 individuals/km²&#160;(Kambale Saambili 1998). In the Ngotto Forest (CAR), densities varied between 7.2 and 41 individuals/km²&#160;– variation here was related to hunting intensity by humans (D. Brugière pers. comm. 2013).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The&#160;geographic&#160;range of&#160;<em style=""font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"">Cercocebus agilis</em>&#160;is not well known, despite covering about 1,010,000&#160;km².&#160;This species occurs&#160;in Cameroon, Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), northeast Gabon and northern&#160;Republic of&#160;Congo.

Consequently it is classified as Vulnerable. <p></p>,"In Morocco and Tunisia, it typically occupies open plains, shrub-steppe and high steppe dotted mainly with alfa grass steppes (<em>Stipa&#160;</em>spp.). Abundant also in non-degraded wormwood (<em>Artemisia </em>spp.) and other species-mixed shrub vegetation patches, on hard or pebbly soils, avoiding sand (<strong></strong>Isenmann and Moali 2000, Thévenot <em>et al</em>. 2003, Isenmann <em>et al</em>. 2005)<strong></strong>. In Spain, it occurs mostly in areas with low bushes (Seoane <em>et al.</em> 2006, Vögeli <em>et <a>al</a>.</em> 2010, Perez-Granados <em>et al.</em>&#160;2017a, Gomez-Catasus <em>et al</em>. 2019). It may also occur in cereal fields outside the breeding season (Suárez <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is found from 50-1,880 m but mainly over 1,000 m. It feeds on the ground on insects and seeds. Breeding takes place in March-July (Herranz <em>et al. </em>1994, Perez-Granados <em>et al</em>. 2017b). Breeding in the North African populations starts earlier, at the end of January-February.&#160;<p></p>","In parts of its range, overgrazing or undergrazing and agricultural development have caused a reduction in its preferred habitats and a considerable decrease in numbers (M. Smart<em> in litt</em>. 2004,&#160;Isenmann&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Traba <em>et al.</em> 2019). Reforestation schemes also lead to a loss of suitable habitat and infrastructure development has led to fragmentation of habitat, particularly by the construction and development of windfarms in Spain. In Tunisia, the fight against desertification has led to reforestation with <em>Eucalyptus </em>spp. and <em>Optunia </em>spp., which has caused a severe, rapid reduction in the halfa steppes. In Morocco, the loss of the traditional way of life for the nomadic grazers has led to increased sedentary agricultural pressures like the increase in livestock herds.&#160;<br/>The limited dispersal  capabilities of the species and its fragmented distribution reduce the exchange of individuals between  populations and increases their extinction risk (<span lang=""EN-US"">Méndez <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;&#160;<br/><span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US"">The shrinking of its available habitat may be leading to territory saturation, which in turn can lead to agonistic behaviour and nest failure (Vögeli&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010; Pérez-Granados and López-Iborra 2013, 2015). A recent Spanish study has shown that the species's occurrence is principally determined by geographic isolation (extinction events were exclusively related to isolation), landscape matrix and patch size, rather than habitat quality (Vögeli <em>et al</em>. 2010). Isolation of local populations and reduced patch size has a compounding effect on population density since smaller populations suffer reduced singing repertoires which in turn reduce the rescuing from others (receiving immigrants), thus  compromising population persistence (Laiolo and Tella 2008,&#160;Pérez-Granados <em>et al. </em>2016). Wildfires can lead to the local extirpation of the species (Pérez-Granados <em>et al.</em> 2013b), although they can have long term benefits (Perez-Granados <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018b). Additionally, wind farms may have negative impacts on the distribution of this lark (Gomez-Catasus <em>et al. </em>2018b). Political unrest in some of its range may be impacting the species, but the effect this has had on the species is essentially unknown (D. Serrano and J. Traba <em>in litt. </em>2016). Solar farms have also demonstrated negative effects on local occupancy and persistence of the species (Gomez-Catasus <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018b).<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/></span></span></span>","García <em>et al.</em> (2008) estimate 15,400 singing males in Morocco, while in Spain t<span lang=""EN-US"">he most recent estimate suggests around 3,700-4,000 males (Traba&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;The Tunisian population was estimated to be c.600 singing males in 2007 (Suarez, Garcia and Vinuela&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020).<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><br/><span lang=""EN-US""><p><span class=""author"">It has a 0.61 male-biased sex ratio, and the global estimate is currently placed between 25,000 – 35,000 individuals (J García&#160;<em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>2020,&#160;J Traba&#160;<em>pers. comm.&#160;</em>2020). This equates to roughly 19,500 – 27,300 mature individuals (assuming that there are roughly 9,750 – 13,650 females based on the sex ratio, and that pairs are strictly monogamous).</p></span></span>",Decreasing,"There are two recognised subspecies: the nominate is found in <strong>Spain </strong>(mainly east Castilla y León and Aragón, also west Castilla y León near the Portuguese border, east Castilla-La Mancha, west Valencia, and south-east Andalucía), <strong>Morocco </strong>(mostly in Hauts Plataux of the eastern Oujda Province, and centre-north Rekkam region, high plains between the Middle and High Atlas mountain ranges (particularly the Midelt-Missour surroundings). It is also found in&#160;<strong>Algeria </strong>(Hauts Plateaux), and north-west Tunisia; <em>margaritae </em>is found in Algeria (south slopes of Atlas Mountains east to Biskra), south-east <strong>Tunisia</strong>, northern <strong>Libya </strong>and coastal west <strong>Egypt.&#160;<br/></strong><br/>Currently in Europe, the species is only found in continental Spain, which hosts around 13% of the global population (Suárez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). The Spanish population declined by more than 20% during 1970-1990 (<strong></strong>Tucker and Heath 1994)<strong></strong>, and this rate of decline is continuing, with a 41.4% reduction in 92 subpopulations between 2004 and 2015 (Gomez-Catasus <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018a). The mean probability of extinction for the whole Spanish metapopulation in 20 years has been estimated to be 0.879 (Traba <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The species has also gone extinct at multiple localities in Spain over the past two decades, with a 44% range contraction (Garcia-Anton <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This contraction is associated with higher temperatures and lower precipitation, and a decrease in human population density which renders this species vulnerable to rural abandonment (Garcia-Anton <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The total Spanish population was estimated at 13,000-15,000 pairs following surveys in 1988 (Garza and Suárez 1990)<strong></strong>. However, the original survey may have dramatically overestimated the size of the Spanish population, which may have comprised as few as 1,900 pairs in 1988 (<strong></strong>Garza <em>et al</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Based upon census data collected in 2004-2007, the population was assessed as c.3,500-4,450 singing males (Suárez and Garza 2007, Suárez 2010) with declines noted in most areas (Garza&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. The most recent estimate for the Spanish population suggest around 3,700-4,000 males (Traba <em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>Taking into account that the sex ratio is approximately 0.61 (Suárez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et  al. </span>2009), these results would mean the existence of roughly  2,200-2,700 pairs. Some authors consider that the sex ratio is even more  biased towards males (Tella <em>et al</em>. 2004, Vögeli <em>et al</em>. 2007) which  would lead to an even smaller population estimate. The European population declined by more than 40% between 2004 - 2015 (Gomez-Catasus <em>et al</em>. 2018a). A study using autonomous sound recorders discovered several previously unnoticed populations, suggesting that the distribution range is not fully known (Perez-Granados <em>et al</em>. 2018a).<br/><br/>With the exception of Morocco and Tunisia, there is a lack of precise information on distribution and boundaries of both subspecies in North Africa. It is sparsely distributed and uncommon in most areas of its relatively small and fragmented range. In Morocco, the species has a scattered and uneven distribution, and is not recorded in large areas of apparently suitable habitat. Work in Morocco calculated an effective area of suitable habitat of 1,645 km<sup>2</sup> <strong></strong>(García <em>et al</em>. 2008). This area was estimated to support a population of 15,400 singing males (García <em>et al</em>. 2008), although recent studies highlight a large variation in numbers at a local scale between 2008-2020. In Tunisia, fewer than 600 singing males were estimated in 2007, and the extent of suitable habitat was drastically reduced to &lt;100km<sup>2</sup> (Suarez, Garcia and Vinuela&#160;<em>in litt.</em> 2020), compared to previous data in Isenmann <em>et al.</em> 2005). As well as declines noted in Spain, habitat loss has been recorded within the Moroccan breeding range, but its impact and overall trends are not well understood.<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>EU Birds Directive Annex I.

The nest is a grass bowl on the ground (Collar <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008). In its Somalian range the species is known from an area&#160;with 300-400 mm rainfall per year. Habitat at its two known sites varies: one is open grassland and the other fairly open, rocky country with scattered and sparse bush and limited grass cover (Ash and Miskell 1998). It avoids open spaces, creeping through grass cover, and flies reluctantly (Ash and Miskell 1998). Its diet is unknown. Nests have been observed in June, and clutch-size is three (Ash and Miskell 1998). Currently, nest success is likely to be low, due to the lack of dense grass to conceal the nests. Surveys also suggest there is a heavily male-skewed adult sex ratio (Spottiswoode <em>et al.</em> 2009, Donald <em>et al.</em> 2010, Collar and Donald 2018).&#160;<br/><br/><p></p>","The Negele plateau is being degraded by human activities, leading to loss of grassland habitat and encroachment of bush, mainly <em>Acacia drepanolobium</em><strong>&#160;</strong>(Coppock 1994, M.

Shrub encroachment has probably been exacerbated by the fire suppression that has been enforced in the area since the 1980s<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(L. Borghesio <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. Refugees from drought-stricken and tribal conflict areas are augmenting the dense local human population, and nomadic pastoralism is giving way to permanent cultivation, which is the principal threat to the species (M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2005). A watering point has been developed in the core of the species's range, leading to concentrations of livestock and consequent disturbance, overgrazing and trampling<strong> </strong>(M. Wondafrash <em>in litt.&#160;</em>2005). Remaining grassland had become even more degraded between the 2007 and 2008 surveys, leaving no real cover for the species, and potentially leading to high predation of females on the nest, reducing breeding success to zero and further lowering the effective population size (N. J. Collar <em>in litt. </em>2009). Further fieldwork in 2009 confirmed that habitat degradation was continuing, probably due to overgrazing, and that grassland was still being lost to cultivation<strong> </strong><strong></strong>(Donald <em>et al</em>. 2010). Between 2010 and 2011, around a third of the grassland on the northern side of the Liben Plain was lost to agriculture (P. F. Donald <em>in litt</em>. 2012).  The operation of a military training area (near the Bogol Manya crossroads) was previously listed as a potential threat (I. Sinclair <em>in litt</em>. 1999)<strong></strong>, but this had been abandoned by July 2005 (L. Fishpool <em>in litt</em>. 2006)<strong></strong>. Drought may compound these threats, and rising temperatures may pose a longer-term threat to the survival of the species.<br/><br/>The original grassland site in Somalia was settled and cultivated by refugees (J. S. Ash <em>in litt</em>. 1999), resulting in the disappearance of the tussocky perennial grasses described as the species's habitat in 1922 (J. Miskell <em>in litt</em>. 2004). The refugees left over two decades ago, but the area is now more intensively farmed and grazed than ever before (J. Miskell <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008, A. Jama <em>in litt</em>. 2010). People have staked out land claims on the plain, and these plots are being surveyed and registered, and the owners issued with title deeds (J. Miskell <em>in litt</em>. 2007, 2008). Habitat has also been lost and degraded through the establishment of settlements, fires and invasion of alien shrubs and herbs (A. Jama <em>in litt</em>. 2010, Mills <em>et al. </em>2015).","The total population is now likely to number fewer than 250 individuals, with fewer than 50 individuals in each of the two subpopulations.",Decreasing,"The species occupies mid-altitude grassland in&#160;<strong>Ethiopia</strong> and <strong>Somalia</strong>.

Between 1973 and 2002 the area of tall-grass prairie decreased by about 30%, and in 2003 much of it was being rapidly encroached by agriculture and shrubs (<em>Acacia drepanolobium</em>and others) that are probably favoured by excessive grazing pressure and the suppression of seasonal fires&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(L.

By 2007-2008 it appeared to be restricted to a single grassland patch 30-36 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;in area, and the global population was estimated at just 90-256 mature individuals, with the effective population size perhaps even smaller owing to a potentially skewed sex ratio caused by predation of females on the nest&#160;<strong></strong>(Spottiswoode&#160;<em>et al. </em>2009). Results of survey work to date indicate that the species has fewer than 100 territories (the number of pairs is unknown: females seem to be much scarcer than males, so many territories may be held by bachelors) (Donald&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010, N.

Between 1970 and 2008 fifteen visits to the Somalian type locality or areas adjacent to it failed to find the species. In 2010, a search for the species in the Wajale Plains and surrounding area in Somalia was unsuccessful and the habitat there was found to have changed dramatically due to grazing and mechanised agriculture, with no natural grassland thought to remain&#160;(A. Jama&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2010, Spottiswoode <em>et al</em>. 2013, Mills <em>et al. </em>2015)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. Predictive modelling based on the characteristics of the Liben Plain suggested that apart from a smaller and highly politically unstable area c.500 km to the north-east near the Somalian border there is no other suitable habitat for the species within the Horn of Africa (Donald&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.&#160;</span>2010). In 2011 a survey in grassland east of Jijiga in north-east Ethiopia (close to the area that the predictive model suggested [Donald <em>et al</em>, 2010]) found more than 10 individuals in heavily degraded grassland (Spottiswoode&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). The area of suitable grassland at Jijiga is apparently very limited (maximum estimated extent of 20 x 12 km), with &gt;80% grass cover under 5 cm in height (Spottiswoode <em>et al</em>. 2013). Niche modelling suggests that apart from a few small scattered sites in central Ethiopia, the Liben Plain and Jijiga are the only occupied sites for the species (Spottiswoode <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>A three-year Darwin project commenced in 2015 (Anon. 2015). The project aimed to create approximately 1,000 ha of grazing reserves on the Liben plain, managed by the pastoralist community and capable of supporting 10,000 pastoralists during the dry season (Ward-Francis 2015). The project also raised awareness of the importance of protecting and restoring grassland resources for the lark as well as for pastoralist livelihoods (A. Ward-Francis <em>in litt. </em>2016). This project finished in 2018, and a return visit in 2019 revealed that the grasslands had fallen into disrepair since the project finished, and ongoing degradation was continuing (Wotton, 2019).&#160;Fieldwork has been taking place since 2007 to investigate the species's status (M.

The total population is believed to be approx. 1,800 individuals (less than 1,080 mature individuals), including the population in northeastern Afghanistan; the population decline over the last three generations is believed being 30% or more.</li></ul><p></p>","<p>Urials inhabit moderately to very arid habitats at an altitude range from below the sea level in the Trans-Caspian lowlands to above 4,000 m a.s.l. in the Pamirs, Hindu Kush and Himalayas. They prefer hills, undulating terrain and gentle slopes, but also use cliffs. Urials occur in grasslands and open woodlands, e.g., of almond<em> Amygdalus sp.</em>, pistachio <em>Pistacia</em> <em>sp. </em>and juniper <em>Juniperus sp.</em>, as well as cold deserts with scarce vegetation dominated by subshrubs. Urial may also forage at crop fields. They use cavities in slopes or cliffs for shelter or rest under shrubs. <br/><br/>Urial are gregarious with group sizes reaching more than hundred individuals, where local population sizes is sufficiently large. The average Urial group size in Golestan National Park, Iran with over 4,000 individuals was around 29 individuals (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Urial densities were higher (21.77 vs. 0.15 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) near ranger stations, which provide protection from poaching (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Herds are smaller and often sexually segregated during spring and summer. They are sexually dimorphic, non-territorial and promiscuous. The reproductive cycle begins with the rut in late November. Females give birth to one or less often two lambs (Michel <em>et al</em>. 2019) in April-June. Rut and lambing periods vary between different parts of the range. Main predators are large felid and canid carnivores and occasionally golden eagle on lambs (Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016). Females typically give first birth after two years, males are sexually mature at three years, but are fully mature at eight years. Maximum lifespan in the wild is 11 years (Baskin and Danell 2003). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arkal</em><br/></strong>The plateau Ustyurt and Mangyshlak peninsula represent clay deserts at elevations of 150-175 m asl. The climate is sharply continental. Sheep inhabit clay and Cretaceous cliffs (“chinks”) and ravines or hill slopes of a different steepness. Males prefer more open parts of a relief whereas females and young animals are attracted to the broken relief (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei bochariensis</em><br/></strong>Habitats of the Tajik Urial are characterized by aridity and continental climate. This subspecies occurs at altitudes between 500 and 2,200 m asl. It prefers the pistachio woodlands or other shrubs located on hilly watersheds of low ridges with obligatory presence of deep gorges with steep slopes (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>Afghan Urial usually use rounded, broken mountain terrain, plateau, gentle slopes and hills with gorges and at lower altitudes between 600 and 2,500 m, in southern Pakistan below 1,200 m asl but readily access precipitous terrain as escape cover. Most habitats are open woodlands with some shrub vegetation, but they occur as well in degraded habitats (Groves and Leslie 2011, Fedosenko 2002). In the Hazarajat, Afghanistan, local people have indicated that Urials appear to remain permanently within some specific areas and move throughout these with predictable seasonal migrations. There are two major migrations – one into the lambing areas in late May and one into the rutting area in mid-November. Rutting behaviour occurs from mid-December to mid-January (WCS Afghanistan 2014; <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabiensis</em><br/></strong>The habitat of Punjab Urial is the scrub forest in Salt and Kala Chitta Ranges. In the Salt Range it is typically associated with lower rounded stony hills sparsely covered with wild olive <em>Olea ferruginea</em> and phulai <em>Acacia modesta</em>. The distribution of the subspecies in Pakistan is between the Indus and Jhelum rivers at elevations of 250-1,500&#160;m. The reproductive cycle begins with the rut in mid-October and November with a peak of activity in the first half of November. Females give birth to one or two lambs in early April. Main predators are leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> and jackal <em>Canis aureus</em>. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>The habitats of this form are relatively gentle slopes at high altitudes of more than 2,500 m, up to 4,000 m asl. and more, characterized by aridness, severity of climate and semi-desert vegetation with scarce forage and almost complete lack of shrubs (Fedosenko 2002, Siraj-Ud-Din <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Ladakh, Urial primarily use rolling and moderately steep slopes along the lower portion of the Indus and Shyok valleys, rarely using the steeper mid and higher elevation areas occupied by ibex and blue sheep (Namgail <em>et al</em>. 2010). Increasingly however, Urials seem to be taking refuge in possibly suboptimal steep areas in the lower valleys as the gentler ones are coming under different land use (Raghavan <em>et al</em>. 2003, Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006).</p>","<p>Overall, this species is threatened mainly by poaching (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a, 2019), competition with livestock on forage, space and disease spillover risk and predation of lambs by shepherd dogs. Urials avoid rugged mountainous terrain where it might gain some protection, and is thus particularly prone to poaching, competes for food directly with livestock that seasonally shares its habitat and is threatened by infectious diseases transmitted by sheep and goats. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arkal</em><br/></strong>Poaching was the cause of the latest decline in the ex-Soviet republics. It was carried out by locals, especially around the limited waterholes used by the Urial, using both firearms and snares (Fedosenko 1986, Gorbunov 1986). Fedosenko and Weinberg (1999) reported excessive (trophy) hunting and intensive livestock grazing as threats in the Northern Aktau (Kazakhstan). In the Aktau-Buzachin Nature Reserve, Kazakhstan, Frisina (2002) found that historical overgrazing, which had ceased about ten years before his survey has caused serious habitat degradation, still affected the condition of the Urial. Given recovery of the livestock numbers in Kazakhstan (see <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TA"">http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TA</a>) a serious risk of increasing overgrazing can be assumed. During the last two decades, poaching became more and more common, with the growth of extractive industries in the Mangystau Province and people having access to modern firearms and off-road vehicles as well as drones, which are used for detecting and chasing Urials in the narrow cliffs they inhabit. Extractive industries with road development and seismic exploration cause habitat fragmentation and disturbance.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei bochariensis</em><br/></strong>The decrease in numbers is attributed to commercial hunting during the Soviet Union, poaching and competition with domestic livestock, coupled with droughts and severe winters. Some key habitats in Babatag and Hazratishoh have been affected by the civil war in Tajikistan (1992-1997) when poaching was totally uncontrolled. Poaching had also been attributed to border violations from Afghanistan (Michel, 2010). Newborn lambs are captured as pets but the impact on the population is not known. In Tajikistan, Urial have been kept in a large enclosure together with European mouflons <em>O. aries</em> (media reports, R. Muratov, pers. comm. 2018), thus potentially risking hybridization and in case of escapes genetic pollution of the wild population.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan, poaching of Urial is reported to be still commonplace in the Urial habitat. Some Urials also become habituated to grazing barley fields and are shot (WCS Afghanistan 2014, <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). Capture of lambs indicated the existence of a Urial population east of Kabul in 2015. In Iran, the main threat to ungulates is rampant poaching (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019). Poaching usually happens by local communities or by people from bigger cities with the guidance of locals. The main incentives for poaching in Golestan National Park have been identified as subsistence, pleasure, tradition, trade of wild meat, and conflict with conservation regulations and bodies (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019). Disease transmitted by livestock could also be of serious threat to Urials. In 2011, Peste des Petits Ruminants virus was the suspected cause of 550-700 deaths among Urial in Sarigol National Park (Marashi <em>et al</em>. 2017). Other threats such as habitat loss, competition with livestock, diseases and climate change are of importance for this species in Iran. In Pakistan, poaching, livestock overgrazing, and habitat degradation caused by fuelwood gathering and by agriculture, are the main threats to this Urial. Afghan Urial may be more susceptible to such threats than are wild goats <em>Capra sp.</em> inhabiting the same areas because of species-specific differences in habitat preferences (Edge and Olson-Edge 1987). Throughout its range in Baluchistan, Urial faces severe poaching pressure and competition from domestic sheep and goat, and lives in extremely scattered and small populations (Virk 1991). In Turkmenistan, poaching is the main threat but there is also competition from domestic livestock for forage and water (Annabayramov 2011, Kaczensky and Linnell 2015, E. Rustamov, pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabensis</em><br/></strong>The main threats for Punjab Uial are poaching, decline of habitat area because of agriculture, urbanization, roads and other human developments and loss of habitat in quality because of overgrazing by domestic livestock (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Arshad and Hussain 2018). Lambs are illegally taken at birth to be kept as pets (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2006) and in some areas almost 50% of the lambs are collected by poachers within one week of parturition (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2015). They are a status symbol and although capture is illegal, the Pakistani government had been selling licences to keep Urial as pets (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2015) but it is not clear if this practice continues (Khan <em>et al.</em> 2015) Some are hybridized with domestic sheep. Adult rams are poached for their trophy value. Apart from the protected population in the Kalabagh Game Reserve, the Punjab Urial suffers heavy poaching pressure and the remaining range of this species is under continuously increasing human pressure (Awan <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, forage competition and transmission of diseases from domestic animals are major threats. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>In the Wakhan and adjacent areas in Afghanistan poaching by local people is limited thanks to conservation efforts and customary hunting rules (S. Michel, own observations and stakeholder interviews 2008-2013). Poaching is currently on the rise in Afghanistan due to militarization of the area related to border guard deployment as a result of growing insecurity in Badakhshan Province (S. Ostrowksi, pers. comm. 2019). Community rangers in Wakhan have also reported that shepherd dogs are a danger to Urials during lambing season. Opportunistic poaching on Urials moving to Tajikistan may prevent recolonization there. Hunting is banned in India and has been relatively strictly controlled recently (especially in the Indus valley), but the Urial’s habitat is highly accessible and susceptible to overuse by livestock herding and other human activities (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006, Raghavan <em>et al</em>. 2003). Urials occupy the low, relatively accessible areas along the major valley corridors, all of which have, or soon will have, roads and expanding human settlements. The resulting effects of increased poaching and eventual human settlement associated with irrigation projects and increased livestock numbers will require effective conservation and management actions if Ladakh Urial is to survive (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1994, Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006). Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2018) reported that poaching by locals and security forces seems to be relatively common in Kargil. In Pakistan, most Urial habitat is close to human settlements and also not very steep, therefore easily accessible to poachers and for grazing by increasing numbers of livestock leading to widespread habitat degradation and displacement of Urial into marginal habitat (Siraj-Ud-Din <em>et al.</em> 2016). Compared to the highly priced markhor <em>Capra falconeri</em>, which is more numerous in several areas, Urial received less attention in community-based conservancies and authorities in Pakistan are reluctant to authorize regulated trophy hunting of Ladakh Urial because of its rarity and concerns over the engagement and capacity of beneficiary communities to protect the species (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2020). In general, small size and high fragmentation of Urial populations may seriously impact their survival in India and Pakistan (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006).</span></p>","<p>The global population of this species might be in the range of 30,000 animals. The population numbers do not include suspected species hybrids between <em>O. gmelini </em>and <em>O. vignei</em>, occurring in Iran. Hereby, we considered entire provinces if not otherwise indicated. The population trend across its range is likely to be decreasing, probably as much as 30% over three generations.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arabica</em><br/></strong>No information is available about this population and if it is still extant.<em> <br/><br/><strong>Ovis vignei arkal</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>The total number estimated in ex-Soviet republics at the beginning of the 1990s was ca. 6,000 animals (Weinberg <em>et al.</em> 1997). Numbers had declined sharply before the mid-1960s, when 3,000 were estimated for Kazakhstan, and continued to decline to 2,000 by the 1970s and 1,500 at the beginning of the 1980s (Lankin 1982; Savinov and Bekenov 1977). However, since the early 1990s the populations appear to have temporarily increased but more recently once more declined (see below paras about Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan). <br/><br/>In Kazakhstan, 130 urials were counted in the Karagiye Depression and 869 at the mesas of Northern Aktau in 1997 (Fedosenko and Weinberg 1999). In the Aktau-Buzachin Nature Reserve in Kazakhstan, during a survey in 2000 a total of 491 urials were observed, a density of 4 per km² in suitable habitat and providing the basis for an estimated population size of ~1400 animals (Frisina 2002). The Red Book of Kazakhstan (Bekenov, Kasabekov 2010) provided the following figures, indicating a massive decline: 1991 (5,500-5,600); 2000 (3,500);<span lang=""EN-US""> 2002 (2,000-2,500); and 2007 (700-1,000). In the protected areas, which cover most of the current habitat of the species, estimates in 2016 and 2017 yielded 1,354 and 1,514 animals, respectively, with the largest populations in Ustyurt State Strict Nature Reserve and in the Zhabayushkan reserve (Institute of Zoology, 2017). Similarly, the authorities of Mangystau Province for 2018 reported 1,550 animals. Local sources indicate, however, substantial local declines and extinctions. N. Ismailov (pers. comm., 2019) guessed a population of around 2,500 animals across the range in Kazakhstan in 2000 and suggested declines by more than 70% during the last 20 years (<em>ca</em> 1,150 in 2018/2019). <br/><br/>We present here all available population information for Iran under <em>O. v. cycloceros</em>, following Fedosenko (2002), who included all urials in Iran in this subspecies but considered only urials in Kazakhstan and northwestern Turkmenistan as <em>O. v. arkal</em>. <br/><br/>In the early 1980s, 800 were estimated in Turkmenistan, of which 500 were found along the shores of Kara-Bogaz Gol and 300 in the southern ravines (Zarkhidze 1983). Following protection resulting from its listing in the USSR Red Data Book, numbers of this subspecies began to increase in the latter half of the 1980s with some populations reestablishing themselves naturally. Rustamov (pers. comm. 2018) reported 250 urials for the region of Kaplankyr and Kazakhly Shor and another 20 south of Kara-Bogaz-Gol, a substantial decline compared to 1,600 reported for the Turkmenistan part of the Ustyurt in the 1990s (Annabayramov 2011). <br/><br/>About 300 animals of this subspecies were thought to inhabit Uzbekistan in 1983 but numbers have since declined (O. Tsaruk, <em>in litt</em>. 1994), with ca. 40 near the border with Turkmenistan (B. Dyakin, pers. comm. to E. Mukhina 1995). In Uzbekistan, Central Asian Desert Initiative expeditions (2012-2014) recorded Urial&#160;observations, tracks and skulls north of Kazakhly Shor, northwest of Kaplankyr Strictly Protected Area, along the western shore of Sarykamysh Lake and northwest of it. Based on 52 direct observations and 72 individuals identified on camera traps overall numbers might be in the range of 100 animals (Marmazinskaya <em>et al.</em> 2016). <em><br/><br/><strong>Ovis vignei bochariensis</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>Numbers have fluctuated slightly since the 1970s (Frolov and Golub 1983; Luzhevsky 1977), and by the late 1980s the total number estimated was only 1,000 animals (Prisyazhniuk 1990). However, Sokov (1993) mentioned &gt;1,000 for Tajikistan alone, so together with Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan there might have been up to some 1,200 animals. Numbers are believed to be decreasing, and in some areas, populations are very small. For example, in Uzbekistan on the western slopes of the Kugitangtau on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, there were as few as 100 individuals (B. Dyakin Department of Hunting Management, Uzbekistan pers. comm. to E. Mukhina), with only five counted in May 1993 in the Surkhan Nature Reserve (Chernogaev <em>et al.</em> 1995). Weinberg <em>et al</em>. (1997) observed 36 animals at the Turkmenistan side of the mountain range, in Koytendag Strict Nature reserve. Numbers might have recovered since as Kholikov (pers. comm., 2014) in 2013 recorded 45 urials in Surkhan Strictly Protected Area in Uzbekistan. Rustamov (pers. comm. 2018) assumes that about 250 urials exist at the Turkmenistan part of the mountain range. <br/><br/>In the Uzbekistan part of the Babatag Mountains at the border with Tajikistan in the early 2000s about 40 Bukhara urials were assumed to exist and Normatov (2016) mentioned that locals until around 2012 annually caught about 10 urial lambs as pets. Since then such information is missing, possibly indicating a massive decline in the population numbers. Urial is known from the nearby Aktau range in Tajikistan, which hosts a population of likely more than 100 urials (Michel, various local reports, own observations 2018). <br/><br/>For Tajikistan, the country with the largest population of the subspecies, reliable data on overall urial numbers in the past and present are not available. Figures for specific areas vary largely. Baskin and Daniell (2003) provide numbers ranging from 820 to 1,550 individuals for the three range areas Surkhkuh, Hazratishoh and Karatau. Surveys in the frame of the Tajikistan Mountain Ungulates Project since 2008 yielded much lower numbers (Garibmamadov and Amirov 2015, Michel 2014); most recent in 2014: Southern Hazratishoh Range 31, Panj Karatau 10 and Aktau 117 and Surkhkuh 16. Further animals are known from unsurveyed areas in Baljuvan and the Babatag Range in the immediate border region with Uzbekistan. The total population in Tajikistan is likely substantially below 500 animals. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan no numbers are available for the overall population or certain locations. Despite local people have indicated that Urial&#160;remain numerous in certain areas of the Hazarajat Plateau, discussions with hunters and other communities suggested a significant decrease in numbers and even their local extirpation (WCS Afghanistan 2014; Afghanistan.wcs.org, accessed 19-01-2014). <br/><br/>In Iran, the population was estimated to be at least 20,000 animals in the mid-1970s (Valdez and DeForge 1985), of which around 10,000-15,000 were estimated to inhabit Golestan National Park alone (Kiabi 2004, Decker and Kowalski 1972). However, a scientific population assessment in 2013/2014 using line transects and Distance sampling in this national park showed around 66% decline in urial population compared to 1970s (4,275 individuals 95% confidence interval 2,117-8,632; Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019). A comparable or even more severe decline in the population of urial in a similar time window is anticipated for other protected areas (Ghoddousi <em>et al.</em> 2019). The density of urial in Golestan National Park was around 12.57 individuals/km² (Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a). Recent population estimates by Iranian Department of Environment from protected areas do not distinguish between urial, mouflon and hybrids. The total of figures from annual census by Department of Environment for the protected areas in the provinces with only <em>O. vignei</em> occurring (i.e., Golestan, North Khorasan, Razavi Khorasan, South Khorasan, and Sistan and Baluchistan) in 2009 was approx. 13,000 and in the census of 2016 yielded around 18,000 individuals (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016). However, there may be more <em>O. vignei</em> populations in provinces of Kerman, Semnan, and Yazd adding up to around 11,000 additional urials to the total population (Iranian Department of Environment unpublished data 2016). However, due to the uncertainty in the presence of urial, hybrids with mouflon or both in these provinces, we refrain from reporting these numbers in the urial global population. <br/><br/>No total population census based on surveys is available for Pakistan. In the past, Roberts (1985) estimated that perhaps 2,500 to 3,000 Afghan urial lived in Baluchistan, with 1,000 (0.2/km²) inhabiting the Torghar hills of Toba Kakar range (District Zhob) according to Mitchell (1988), about 150 in the Takatu hills near Quetta (A. Ahmad, unpubl. Data), and more in the Dureji hills, District Zhob (Virk, 1991). Malik (1987) estimated a total of 310 to 340 Afghan urial for the whole of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (former North West Frontier Province (NWFP)), whereas the NWFP Forest Department (NWFP 1992) reported a total of only 80 urial (68 from Kohat, two from Mardan and 10 from Abbottabad), suggesting a severe decline over five years. For Sindh Province, a census carried out by Mirza and Asghar (1980) estimated a population of 430 urial for Kirthar National Park. Based on a census in the Mari-Lusar-Manghtar range and in the Karchat mountains in 1987, K. Bollmann (unpubl. data) estimated between 800 and 1,000 urial (0.26-0.32/km²) for the whole of Kirthar NP. About 150 to 200 animals lived in the Mari-Lusar-Manghtar range, and 100 to 150 in the Karchat mountains; i.e., 1.7 to 2.5 urial/km² (Edge and Olson-Edge, 1987). In Dureji Game Management Area, Baluchistan Province, Frisina <em>et al.</em> (2006) observed 504 urials and produced a population estimate of 858. During the fall survey 2008 Arshad and Khan (2009) estimated a population of 1,637 urials for the Torghar Conservation Project area, with substantial differences between high quality habitat (4.44/km²) and low quality areas (1.06/km²), and showing an overall decline, particularly in the buffer areas. In 2017, Shah Noorani Game Reserve in Baluchistan reported a population of 2,500 to 3,000 animals in 2016/2017. The Conservator Wildlife &amp; National Parks of Baluchistan, (A. Ali, pers. comm. 2019), reported for Hingol National Park and five community game reserves a total of 9,700 to 11,750 urial, with 3,000 in Torghar, but only 1,500 to 2,000 in Shah Noorani. An article on the website <span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.tribune.com.pk"">www.tribune.com.pk</a> in January 2020 stated that 14,000 urials exist in protected areas in Sindh, including Halalo, Pachran, Uth Palan and Mol, but the figures could not be verified from official sources. <br/><br/>The estimate for the total population in Turkmenistan in the late 1980s and early 1990s was between 10,000 and 12,000 urials (Korshunov 1995). Numbers then had increased slightly from the estimates of 8,000 to 10,000 made in the 1970s (Babaev <em>et al.</em> 1978), when there were 2,000 in the Kopet-Dagh Reserve, with about 1,500 in the Badkhyz Reserve (Gorelov 1978). A significant decline in numbers was reported for the period until the late 1990s in the eastern Kopet Dagh and in Badkhyz, with only 150 to 200 in Big Balkhan and 300 to 350 in the western Kopet Dagh (V. Lukarevskiy, in lit., 1994); about 2500 – 2800 in the Eastern Kopet Dagh and about 3500 – 4000 for Turkmenistan in total, with a declining trend (Lukarevskiy <em>et al.</em> 2010). Rapid declines happened during the last decade, with Rustamov (pers. comm. 2018) reporting an overall decline from around 4,000 in 2010 (Annabayramov 2011) to less than 1,600 and local declines by up to 60%. The larger share of these animals still occurs within protected areas, while outside of them urial exist mainly in relatively low densities. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabiensis</em><br/></strong>Schaller (1977) estimated a total world population of ~2,000 Punjab urial and a complete census made in 1976-77 by Mirza <em>et al</em>. (1979) estimated 2,157. Estimates by Chaudhry (unpubl. data) in 1992, gave a minimum total population of 1,550 throughout its whole range. For Punjab, Chaudhry <em>et al</em>. (1988) reported a significant decline in urial numbers over only one year; from 733 in 1986 to 528 in 1987. A total of only 12 were reported for Chinji National Park (Chaudhry and Sarwar, 1988). Awan <em>et al.</em> (2004) estimated a total population of about 860 urial in the Salt Range, suggesting a 56% decline from 1976, when Mirza <em>et al.</em> (1980) estimated 1,968 urial in the same area. Frisina <em>et al.</em> (2001) recorded 259 urials in Kalabagh Game Reserve in the Salt Range. Awan <em>et al.</em> (2006) found that this area was the last remaining stronghold for wild ungulates in the Punjab Province, while in neighboring unprotected areas in the Eastern Salt Range poaching, in particular of newborn lambs, caused a decline. Arshad and Hussain (2018) suggested some recovery in Jhelum District in Punjab, based on distance sampling of five sites in 2007, but did not estimate the population size. Khan <em>et al.</em> (2015) surveyed five sections of the Soan valley in the Salt Range and estimated a population of 110 urials (1.39/km²). A media article in November 2019 claimed that surveys revealed increases in the population of Punjab urial (<span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/2093549/1-survey-punjabs-urial-population-completed/"">https://tribune.com.pk/story/2093549/1-survey-punjabs-urial-population-completed/</a>). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan, the population in the Wakhan National Park might be attributed to this subspecies. The population in Wakhan was estimated stable between 2011 and 2015 and Moheb <em>et al.</em> (2012) recorded 400 urial there. However, results of sample counts carried out in 2018 may suggest a population decline compared to 2015 of as much as 30% (S. Ostrowski, pers comm. 2020). Simms <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported observations of 260 urials from the neighboring districts Ishkashim and Zebak. <br/><br/>The total population of <em>O. v. vignei</em> in India was previously estimated to be between 1,000 and 1,500 animals (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1991a; Mallon 1983, 1991), in a range spread over less than 2,000 km² (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006). The Ladakh urial had declined dramatically in the last 60 years, especially during the military conflicts between 1947 and 1962 (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1991a; Mallon 1983). Raghavan <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the urial population in surveyed areas in Ladakh in 2002 to number around 690 (540-840) individuals. During a study in 2002-2003 in total 834 individuals were recorded (not including off-trail sightings). The Nindum-Fotula area, followed by Likir and Hemis Shukpachen had the highest proportion of urial sightings. As urial habitat overlaps with the areas of land use for livestock grazing, crop cultivation and infrastructure development, Raghavan <em>et al.</em> (2003) concluded that “it is unlikely that urial population in Ladakh is increasing. In fact, it seems more probable that they are actually facing, if not already on, a decline.” A recent survey by Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> (2018) estimated 753 urial within 625 km² of surveyed area in Upper Shyam and Kargil landscapes. Density estimates from about 70 km² area in the Fotu La region of Kargil landscape had been nearly four times higher in 2003 (Raghavan <em>et al.</em> 2003), indicating that urial population may have suffered drastic decline in the areas bordering Kargil and Leh Districts. The Kargil and Upper Shyam landscapes seem to be supporting the last refuges of relatively large populations of urial in Ladakh currently. In rest of Leh and Kargil districts, urial was found to be scattered in small populations (Ghoshal <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>According to some reports from around 1900, <em>O. v. vignei</em> used to be a common animal of northern Pakistan. Schaller (1976) estimated that &lt; 1,000 were left in Pakistan and Roberts (1985) gave “intelligent guesses” of 500 to 600 animals for Baltistan and 700 to 800 for Gilgit-Hunza. All these estimates are much greater than more recent numbers. Hess (1990) estimated the total population of <em>O. v. vignei</em> in Pakistan for 1987-88 to be only 200 to 400 animals. In 1992, a total of 57 urial were estimated in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (NWFP, 1992); 29 in Dir and 28 in Chitral. The total estimated for the Gilgit-Baltistan (former Northern Areas) for 1993 was 400 to 500 urial (G. Tahir, Wildlife Wing, Northern Areas Forest Dept., in lit. to G. Rasool). Khan and Zahler (2004) saw only one herd of 13 animals and gathered reports on observations by local hunters and herders; they concluded that small scattered populations existed in southern Gilgit and Diamir districts. Siraj-ud-Din <em>et al.</em> (2016) from January to September 2013 in Gilgit-Baltistan recorded a directly observed minimum population of 172 individuals, and estimated the overall population comprising <em>ca</em> 432 individuals (4.79 urial/km²) taking into account local information as collected through questionnaires. They found the population being declining and have been extirpated from at least six previously known localities during the last decade. Surveys carried out by the Wildlife Conservation Society between winters 2018 and 2019 tallied minimal numbers ranging 62 to 146 in Bunji, where Siraj-ud-Din in 2013 had observed 109 animals, and 5 to 8 animals both in Nanga Parbat and Doyan. Information from other areas in Baltistan, Nagar and District Gilgit support less than 50 animals in total, but several areas have not been investigated for decades. Overall the remaining population of urial in Gilgit-Baltistan is likely less than 350 individuals in 2019 (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2020).</span></p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species occurs in Afghanistan, northwestern India (Ladakh), central and eastern Iran, southwestern Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Wild sheep reported from Oman (where it has possibly been introduced) have been considered as urial. In Iran, following Rezaei <em>et al</em>. (2010) (and unlike Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016 or Yusefi <em>et al</em>. 2019, which assigned the Ovis in all areas to either of the two species), we considered a zone of occurrence of hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em>. The exact extent of this hybrid zone and the status of certain populations of wild sheep there are uncertain. Therefore, we opted for the most conservative scenario at the province level (due to data limitations) and delineate the species boundaries accordingly. We considered the easternmost provinces (i.e., Golestan, North Khorasan, Razavi Khorasan, South Khorasan, and Sistan and Baluchistan) as the 'confirmed' range of urial as we had higher certainty about urial presence. We suspect that, for example, Kerman or parts of Semnan provinces could also be included in urial range, but we opted for being more conservative as higher phenotypic diversity in wild sheep in these provinces is observable. Our tentative hybrid zone is also included in the description of the geographic range in this assessment and mapped as 'Presence Uncertain' with a note that there is a higher possibility of hybridization in this area.<br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arabica</em> (Arabian or Oman Urial)</strong><br/>There is no recent information available on the occurrence of wild sheep in the Jebal-Akhdar mountains in northern Oman, which had been attributed to urial (Fedosenko, 2002). This population is not mentioned by Damm and Franco (2014), it is unknown if it still exists and what its origin (autochthonous or introduced) had been (S. Ross, pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei arkal </em>(Ustyurt or Transcaspian Urial or Arkal)</strong><br/>The distribution range of this subspecies is not clearly delimitated from the range of <em>O. v. cycloceros</em>. Groves and Grubb (2011) merge both subspecies in one species, but distinguish two subspecies. They consider the urial in Turkmenistan and northeastern Iran as belonging to this subspecies. Other sources (e.g., Fedosenko 2002) distinguish the urial in the Large and Small Balkhan and Kopet-Dagh mountain ranges in Turkmenistan and further to the south in northeastern Iran as <em>O. v. cycloceros</em> and consider only the urial in the Ustyurt as <em>O. v. arkal</em>. Following the latter determination, the subspecies is found in southwest Kazakhstan, northwest Turkmenistan and northwest Uzbekistan (Karakalpakstan) where it inhabits the western part of the Ustyurt plateau north and east of Kara-Bogaz-Gol Gulf, including Kaplankyr Plateau, Kazakhly-Sor, the low mountains on the Mangyshlak Peninsula and other areas with cliffs and ravines in Mangystau Province. <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei bochariensis</em><br/></strong>The Bukhara urial occurs in Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is found north of the Amu Darya and Panj rivers, where it inhabits the Kugitang and Baisuntau mountains, the Babatagh, Aktau and Panj Karatau ranges, the Surkhkuh, the Vakhsh range on the east bank of the Vakhsh river and the Hazratishoh Range (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei cycloceros</em><br/></strong>In Afghanistan, urial populations were known to occur throughout the Hindu Kush and the mountains of central Afghanistan, extending from the Zebak mountains in the north to the Seyah Koh range in the southwest. Urial occurred in the Ajar Valley Reserve, from where animals were known to migrate into distant valleys near the Band-e Amir National Park (both in Bamiyan Province). Its presence was established in Zebak area during 1976 surveys, but it was not known how far the species ranged into Badakhshan Province. In the east of Kabul, the urial was found in the Kohe Safi region of Kapisa Province (Petocz 1973). Specimens collected from hunters show that its range extended towards the Lataband Pass area near Kabul. Pictures of two captured urial lambs, kept in Khak-e Jabbar and reports by local people confirmed that the species was still extant there in 2015 (A. Kh. Khaurin, pers. comm. 2017). Other photographed poached animals in 2015 also confirmed its presence in Takhar Province (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2020). The subspecies was also reported from the Safed Koh range in Herat and Badghis Provinces. Wildlife Conservation Society surveys since 2006 have confirmed urial presence within the Bamyan Plateau bounded roughly by Band-e-Amir, Saighan, Ajar Valley, southern Samangan, southeastern Saripul and Yakawlang-Sulej, although numbers are very low or even absent altogether in parts of their previous range within Badakhshan and the eastern forests (<span lang=""EN-US""><a href=""http://www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). <br/><br/>In Iran, this subspecies (often referred as subspecies <em>O. v. arkal</em>) occurs in rolling hills and on gentle mountain slopes in the eastern country. There are remarkable populations in protected areas of the northeastern country including Golestan National Park, Sarigol National Park, Serany Protected Area and Tandureh National Park (Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2018, Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019, Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016, Yousefi <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>For Pakistan, a distribution map for urial in the North West Frontier Province (now Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa) is given by Malik (1987), showing its scattered occurrence in the Districts of Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Northern Waziristan, Karak, Kohat, Orakzai, Kurram, Peshawar, Mardan, Abbottabad, and Swat. According to the report by Roberts (1985) in Baluchistan <em>O. v. cycloceros</em> were widely distributed up to 2,750 m on gentler slopes of the major mountain ranges. The Conservator Wildlife &amp; National Parks of Baluchistan confirmed urial occurrence in protected areas for Hingol National Park, and the community game reserves Torghar, Dureiji, Shah Noorani, Baran Lakh and Talo Band (A. Ali, pers. comm. 2019). In Sindh, the Afghan urial occurs in the Kirthar mountains, especially in the Mari-Mangthar range (District Karachi) and in Dumbar, Kambuh and Karchat mountains (District Dadu) (Virk 1991). <br/><br/>The subspecies is found in Turkmenistan, where its distribution stretches south-eastwards in scattered populations from the Large (about 39°40’N and 54°30’E) and Small Balkhan mountains north of Nebit-Dagh, through the Kopet-Dagh mountains, in the mountains on the right bank of the Tejen, in an area between the Kushka and Murgab rivers, and in the ravines and rolling hills of Namansaar, Yer Oilanduz (Badkhyz) as far east as Southern Karabil (about 36°20’N and 64°30’N) (Fedosenko 2002). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei punjabiensis</em></strong> <br/>The distribution area of this subspecies in Pakistan is enclosed by the Indus and the Jhelum rivers and the forest belt of the Himalayan foothills. The taxonomic status of urial living along the west bank of the Indus, adjacent to the Punjab urial’s range, is uncertain (Schaller and Mirza, 1974). The subspecies is found in small scattered populations in the Kala Chitta and in the Salt range in Punjab Province up to 1,500 m a.s.l. Frisina <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported 14 subpopulations in two areas: Kala Chitta Range (estimated area of occupancy 100 km²) and Salt Range (estimated area of occupancy 1,265 km²). <br/><br/><strong><em>Ovis vignei vignei</em><br/></strong>The taxonomic status of the urial population recently reported in Wakhan, Ishkashim and Zebak districts of Badakhshan, Afghanistan (Michel <em>et al</em>. 2009, Simms <em>et al.</em> 2014) and Baroghil National Park, Pakistan (Khurshid Ali Shah, pers. comm. 2019), and until the early 2000s in the southern slopes of Shakhdara Range at the right bank of Panj River (southwestern part of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province, Tajikistan) (Luzhevsky 1977; Sapozhnikov 1976) is uncertain. These populations form scattered groups, isolated from the range area of <em>O. v. bochariensis</em> and possibly also from the range of <em>O. v. cycloceros</em> in Afghanistan, but likely connected to urial populations in the very northern part of Pakistan (Michel <em>et al</em>. 2009). <br/><br/>In India, this subspecies occurs only in the Union Territory of Ladakh (erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir Province), where it is distributed discontinuously in a narrow band along the valley-bottom, to the foothill boundary of the Indus and Shyok-Nubra rivers, and some of their major tributaries. Most urial are found along the Indus valley westward from the village of Likchey to that of Khalsi, with additional herds around the junction of the Nubra and Shyok valleys (Fox <em>et al.</em> 1991a; Mallon 1983, 1991), where they appeared to be restricted between Panamik and Diskit (Bhatnagar &amp; Wangchuk 2001). Ghoshal <em>et al. </em>(2018) found urial scattered in small patches across the Leh District mainly along the Indus River and in Shyok-Nubra valley primarily along the right bank Shyok and Nubra rivers, with scattered populations along their left bank. Further, in Kargil District, urial seemed missing across vast areas of potential habitat but distribution was highly clustered in Heniskot and Takmachik areas. One of the best areas for urial in Ladakh was the Nindum-Fotula area where herds of close to <em>ca.</em> 100 urial were reported (Raghavan and Bhatnagar 2006). <br/><br/>In Pakistan, Schaller (1977) and Roberts (1985) gave the major river valleys of the Kunar, Chitral river, Indus, Gilgit river and Shyok as the main range of Ladakh urial. Ladakh urial is still widely distributed, mainly in Gilgit-Baltistan, but only in very small isolated populations. In Khyber-Pakhtunkwa, Chitral District, it still inhabited the right bank of the Kunar river, from Chitral southwards to Drosh (Anonymous, 1986). Localities on the east bank of the Kunar river, as well as from north of Chitral (Anonymous 1986; Zool. Surv. Dept., 1987) were not confirmed. Michel <em>et al.</em> (2009) quote reports from local people about urial presence in the upper Yarkhun Valley, close to the border with Afghanistan at Baroghil Pass. In Gilgit-Baltistan, Gilgit District, Hess (1990) was able to locate only one locality where urial survived in 1985-86; reliable informants indicated a population of around 27 animals on the right side of the lower Miatsil river (Hispar valley). Khan and Zahler (2004) confirmed the existence of small populations of Ladakh urial in southern Gilgit and Diamer districts Along with Siraj-ud-Din <em>et al.</em> (2016), which more recently confirmed the species’ presence mainly in Bunji, and also in Nanga Parbat, Nagar and Skardu areas. <br/><br/><strong><em>Hybrid populations</em><br/></strong>The hybrid population, Alborz red sheep (<em>Ovis gmelini gmelini</em> x <em>Ovis vignei arkal/cycloceros</em>) (Valdez <em>et al</em>. 1978) occurs in north-central Iran in the Alborz Mountains in Tehran and Alborz provinces (Varjin Protected Area, Central Alborz Protected Area, Khojir National Park, Sorkheh Hesar National Park), east to the Parvar Protected Area and south into the Kavir National Park. The exact western, eastern and southern limits of its distribution are undetermined, but generally sheep in central Alborz Mountains are considered as belonging to this hybrid form. <br/><br/>The Kerman sheep occurring east of 55°E in the Khabr National Park and Baft mountains in Kerman Province has been suggested to be a hybrid population (<em>Ovis vignei cycloceros [blanfordti]</em> x <em>Ovis gmelini laristanica</em>). (Valdez 2008).<br/><br/>Hybrids between <em>O. gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em> may occur also in other areas of Iran, including the provinces central and northern Fars, eastern Hormozgan, eastern Isfahan, Qom, eastern Semnan, and Yazd.</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Ovis vignei</em> has been listed on CITES Appendix I (<em>O. v. vignei</em>) and II (all other subspecies). Between COP 17 (2016) and COP 18 (2019) <em>O. vignei</em> had been listed in Appendix I as <em>O. aries vignei</em>, and in Appendix II as <em>Ovis aries </em>[except the subspecies included in Appendix I, the subspecies <em>O. a. isphahanica</em>, <em>O. a. laristanica</em>, <em>O. a. musimon</em> and <em>O. a. orientalis</em>, which are not included in the Appendices, and the domesticated form <em>O. a. aries</em>, which is not subject to the provisions of the Convention]). At CITES COP18 (2019) the Parties decided to divert from Wilson and Reeder 2005 and adopted as standard reference the taxonomy of the genus <em>Ovis</em> in Valdez and Weinberg (2011), leading to the listing of <em>O. vignei</em> as several species: <em>O. v. vignei</em> as <em>O. vignei</em> in Appendix I and all other subspecies as <em>O. arabica</em>, <em>O. arkal</em>, <em>O. bochariensis</em>, <em>O. cycloceros</em>, and <em>O. punjabiensis</em> (CITES 2020).<br/><br/>In Afghanistan, Urial reside seasonally or permanently in Bamyan Plateau Protected Area, Wakhan National Park and occasionally in Band-e Amir National Park and Wakhan National Park. So far, these protected areas are poorly enforced against poaching and unregulated livestock grazing. In Afghanistan, <em>O. vignei</em> was placed on the country’s first Protected Species List in 2009, prohibiting all hunting and trading of this species within the country. The Government of Afghanistan supported technically by the Wildlife Conservation Society continues to search for other currently unidentified populations of Urial, and is also beginning to put into place protection and enforcement measures around existing strongholds to ensure that Urial will continue to survive in Afghanistan (WCS Afghanistan 2014, <a href=""www.afghanistan.wcs.org"">www.afghanistan.wcs.org</a>, accessed 19-01-2014). Conservation measures implemented: 1) Extensive surveys of Urial populations and distributions in potential habitats and monitoring of populations in protected areas; 2) Involvement of local traditional hunters and other community members in protection activities as community rangers; 3) In Wakhan awareness raising on national and local regulations amongst communities and armed forces in the area; 4) Preventive vaccination of livestock against diseases transmissible to Urial in Wakhan National Park and Bamyan Plateau Protected Area; and 5) Support local communities in preventing damage to crops (e.g., protective measures, adapted selection of crops). In the future ecotourism, Urial viewing and hunting tourism could also be explored as sources of revenue for local people and incentive to protect the species.<br/><br/>In India, the Ladakh Urial is as a threatened species by the Government of India under its Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and its subsequent amendments. Hemis National Park (Ladakh) contains the only Urial population currently found in a protected area in India. Raghavan and Bhatnagar (2006) suggest that Ladakh has limited arable land, pasture, food and water resources that are shared between humans, livestock and wild animals. Therefore, people living in close contact with the wild animals are the primary stakeholders in any conservation and management action adopted for these animals. They propose the following conservation measures: 1) Research and monitoring with regard to Urial population, their ecology and rangeland use by Urial and livestock; 2) strict enforcement of the hunting ban, by improving effectiveness of protection staff; 3) Community-based conservation action, including active involvement of local people in conservation of Urial and its habitat, education, reduction of people’s dependence on pasture resources. Further, the country’s national landscape level, participatory conservation strategy, the Project Snow Leopard, will focus on Urial conservation outside wildlife protected areas too. Further, two new Wildlife Sanctuaries, Suru Valley Wildlife Sanctuary and Zanskar High Altitude Wildlife Sanctuary, are being set up in the Kargil district of the newly designated Union Territory of Ladakh, which will enhance Urial conservation in the country.<br/><br/>In Iran, Urial is a protected species that can be hunted under licences issued by the Department of the Environment. Unfortunately, the exact numbers of Urials shot each year by hunters are not available and differ substantially from year to year due to contrasting policies of promoting trophy hunting or blanket bans on all hunting according to change of leadership and conservation vision at the Department of Environment. When authorized by the DoE leadership hunting under a special licence is permitted in a number of protected areas (e.g., Heidary Protected Area). Urial occurs in several protected areas in Iran (Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018; Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2016a; Karami <em>et al</em>. 2016; Yusefi <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, even so the government invests significantly at combating it, poaching prevails in most protected areas (Jowkar <em>et al</em>. 2016; Ghoddousi <em>et al</em>. 2019) in spite of the hefty fines of around 1,785 Euro (i.e., 250,000,000 IRR; 1 Euro ~ 140,000 IRR 2020).<br/><br/>In Kazakhstan, Urial is listed in the Red Book and thus formally protected from any extractive use. The species is found in Ustyurt Strict Nature Reserve and in several reserves and provincial parks. In the area of the sacred site Beket-Ata Urial is traditionally protected from poaching and the animals are habituated to visitors. In the Aktau-Buzachin Reserve limited hunting based on a quota of annually 5 to 20 rams had been used as a source of funding for conservation activities (Fedosenko and Weinberg 1999). This quota seemed sustainable (Frisina 2002), but the program ended in the early 2000s and since then no legal hunting takes place in Kazakhstan. Discussions are ongoing, if the introduction of a legal hunting program, based on sound monitoring and conservatively set quotas, directly benefiting protected areas and local rural people might help to reduce poaching and to recover Urial numbers.<br/><br/>In Pakistan, Urial is a protected species, but permits for hunts in managed areas can be issued at provincial level. Several protected areas have mostly very small numbers of Urial and the level of effective protection is unclear. Managed game reserves have been effective in restoring and conserving of Urial including, e.g., Torghar (Frisina <em>et al</em>. 2004, Arshad and Khan 2009) and Dureji (Frisina <em>et al</em>. 2006) areas in Baluchistan (<em>O. v. cycloceros</em>), Kalabagh (Awan <em>et al</em>. 2006) in Punjab (<em>O. v. punjabensis</em>), and Bunji in Gilgit-Baltistan (<em>O. v. vignei</em>). Some of these areas not only prevent poaching but also prohibit or regulate livestock grazing, like Kalabagh Game Reserve (Awan <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Bunji Conservancy, the possibility of trophy hunting revenues play an incentive role to better protect the Ladakh urial, as it does for markhor. The main challenges are the vastness of an area difficult to control from outsiders, the large number of people and communities inhabiting the area and anticipated conflicts, and currently the lack of significant investment at protecting the species in anticipation of possible revenues from trophy hunting (S. Ostrowski, pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>In Tajikistan, Urial is legally protected as species listed in the Red Book. A limited number of permits is annually issued for trophy hunting. Urials occur in the Dashtijum Strict Nature Reserve but had been under pressure from poaching there and in the adjacent areas. Also, other protected areas have limited effect in terms of protection of Urial from poaching and impact of livestock. The establishment of game management areas managed by communities or local family businesses where trophy hunting locally benefits Urial conservation and community well-being has potential to be expanded (Michel 2014). Breeding enclosures, as the one already established in Khatlon Province, may have rather adverse impact if they distract attention from the conservation of free ranging populations, are not attractive for responsible hunters and bear risks of inbreeding, disease and hybridizing with European Mouflon if kept in the same area.<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, the three subspecies (<em>O. v. arkal,</em> <em>bochariensis </em>and <em>cycloceros</em>) are all listed under Category II of the national Red Book and thus legally protected. In the 1990s, Turkmenistan issued a limited number of permits for Urial hunts in the Kopet Dagh Mountains at USD 14,900 per animal (Weinberg, Valdez <em>et al</em>. 1997). Urial occurs in the Kaplankyr, Kopet Dagh, Siunt-Khasardag, Badhgyz and Koytendag Strict Nature Reserves.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, Urial is protected due to its Red Book status. A small number of permits for trophy hunting is nevertheless issued and currently Urial hunts are offered on the internet. Urial (<em>O. v. bochariensis</em>) occur in the Surkhan Strict Nature Reserve and its buffer zone in the Kugitang Mountain Range. The creation of additional protected areas in the Babatag and Baysuntau has been proposed. Uzbekistan plans the establishment of a strict nature reserve in the southern Ustyurt, benefiting the subspecies <em>O. v. arkal</em>. Protected areas’ effectiveness in preventing poaching and at least controlling livestock grazing needs to be improved.<br/></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Analysis of estimates from 334 localities across their global range indicates a reduction of more than 50% of the continental population in the past three generations (75 years) that is understood to be continuing and likely irreversible. The continental trend is not, however, spatially uniform; some subpopulations are increasing or stable while others are declining significantly faster than the continental rate. Many local subpopulations have been extirpated.<br/><br/>A generation length (GL) of 25 years is used; calculated in the standard format as the average age of mothers in the population (IUCN SPC 2019, p. 29). This figure is based on analysis of the life table of culled Savanna Elephant family groups in South Africa (Whyte 2001) and a 14-year study of Savanna Elephants in Kenya (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2013) which generated a range of 24.1–25 years.<br/><br/>Subcriterion A2 is applied because some of the major causes for population reduction, such as habitat loss due to human population expansion, have not ceased and are projected to increase in coming decades as well as unlikely to be reversible. The population reduction assessment for subcriterion A2 (considering three generations back) is inferred from published survey data using a modelling approach described in the Supplementary Information document. Density and distribution estimates for the African Savanna Elephant vary in methodology, completeness, regularity, date of first survey and confidence limits. Few credible estimates exist prior to the 1970s, and there is no credible estimate for the continental population more than two generations back. For this Red List assessment, an attempt was made to model the data three generations back to 1940 (see the attached Supplementary Information for description of data that is current as of and up to the end of 2015); however, given the sparseness of information available to inform the model, such modelling was of limited value. Therefore, rather than projecting declines well beyond the available data, we made the assumption that the continental African Savanna Elephant population of three generations back (1940) was equal to that of two generations back (i.e., 1965). Additional assumptions, necessary to fill gaps in the dataset, are detailed in the attached Supplementary Information document.<br/><br/>Subcriterion A3 has not been applied, because although the major threats to the species are known, projecting the level of such threats 25 or more years into the future (i.e., three generations, up to a maximum of 100 years) would likely introduce high levels of uncertainty.<br/><br/>An assessment of population reduction according to subcriterion A4 considering two generations back and one forward is in progress by this team of Assessors (Edwards <em>et al</em>. in prep.). Analysis of poaching and human influence in the recent past and anticipated in the future based upon available data of two representative indices (i.e., proportion of illegal killed elephants (PIKE) and the human footprint index) are being included as covariates in the projection.<br/><br/>Criteria B, C and D are not relevant to the threatened status as the species currently occupies more than 20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and there are more than 10,000 mature individuals. No quantitative analysis of the probability of extinction in the wild was conducted, and therefore criterion E does not apply.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Previous Assessments of African Elephant:<br/></strong>This is the first assessment of the African Savanna Elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) as a species separate from the African Forest Elephant (<em>L. cyclotis</em>).<br/><br/>The African Elephant, as a single species, was listed as Vulnerable (VU A2a) in the 2004 and 2008 updates of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, under the same IUCN Categories and Criteria used in this assessment (Version 3.1; IUCN 2001).<br/><br/>Previously the African Elephant, as a single species, was listed as Endangered (EN A1b) under the IUCN Categories and Criteria Version 2.3 (IUCN 1994), in an assessment conducted in 1996 by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group.</p>","<p>African Savanna Elephants are found over a wide latitudinal range between the northern tropics in Mali (16° North) to the southern temperate zone (34° South) in South Africa. They occupy a variety of habitats ranging from montane forest, miombo and mopane woodland, thicket, savanna and grasslands to arid deserts and a wide altitudinal range from mountain slopes to oceanic beaches.<br/><br/>See also the list of habitats.<br/><br/>African Savanna Elephants are capable of moving long distances and naturally do so in arid ecosystems and in response to climatic conditions (e.g., seasonality and drought). Depending on productivity, and water availability African Savanna Elephants demonstrate range residence, migratory, semi-migratory and near nomadic movement patterns in different regions of the continent. Home range sizes vary by several orders of magnitude primarily in relation to plant productivity and human activity in different ecosystems (Loarie <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wall <em>et al</em>. 2013). Thirty African Savanna Elephant subpopulations (eight of which number more than 1,000 individuals) span international boundaries, including the more than 200,000 elephants in the five-country Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017, KAZA Secretariat 2018).<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services:<br/></strong>Ecosystem services provided by African Savanna Elephants vary and depend to a large extent on the ecosystem (forest, savanna, grassland or desert), specific conditions on the ground and the geographical context under consideration. In general, they play an important ecological role as bulk processors of plant material (Owen-Smith 1989). In savannas, African Savanna Elephants are manipulators of woody vegetation structure which in turn influences the tree to grass ratio with knock-on consequences for the fire regime and potentially species composition in the area (Dublin <em>et al</em>. 1990, Augustine and McNaughton 2004, Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2008, Holdo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, Goheen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Pringle <em>et al</em>. 2016). Where they are associated with wetlands African Savanna Elephants can be important in maintaining channels and open water ways. Soil fertility can be maintained by the transport of nutrients by large herbivores from nutrient rich sources (e.g., eutrophic soils in flood plains and termite mounds) to dystrophic soils (e.g., upland miombo woodlands) (Cumming <em>et al</em>. 1997, Doughty <em>et al</em>. 2016, Malhi <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p><br/>The charismatic nature of African Savanna Elephants plays an important role in attracting tourism into national parks. They also hold important symbolic significance within the cultures of many African communities. African Savanna Elephants are one of the few iconic species that occur in the majority of African countries, and innumerable stories, songs, and cultural traditions revolve around them.</p>","Poaching of African Savanna Elephants for ivory is a major cause of individual death and population decline (Wittemyer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). After a sustained period of intense poaching between the late 1970s and 1989, many African Savanna Elephant populations (e.g., in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda) experienced two to three decades of recovery. Some northern African Savanna Elephant populations, however, experienced persistent poaching pressure through the last three decades (Bouche <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012). Data collected as a part of the CITES Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants programme (MIKE), indicate that poaching significantly intensified across the continent starting in 2008 and peaking in 2011 – an unsustainably high level of poaching has continued into current times in some areas of the continent (CITES 2018, 2019), and may be increasing in some of the historically less-affected southern African populations (CITES 2018, 2019). Rapid land use change by humans is driving the direct loss and fragmentation of habitat for African Savanna Elephants and is an increasing threat to populations across their range (Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016, Mpakairi <em>et al</em>. 2019). Land conversion is a product of the ongoing expansion of the human population and associated agriculture and infrastructure development, which in turn are driven by economic and technological advances. A manifestation of this trend is the reported increase in human-elephant conflict (e.g., Pozo <em>et al</em>. 2018). Human population growth projections suggest land conversion will accelerate rapidly in the coming decades across Africa (see <a href=""http://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/"">https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/</a>) which will likely increase this threat.","<p>Over the past century, African Savanna Elephant subpopulations have declined across most of their range. The African Elephant Status Report 2016&#160;estimated a continental population of 415,428 (+/- 95% C.I. 20,111) for both African Savanna and African Forest Elephants combined and reported a continental decline of approximately 111,000 elephants since 2006 (Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). For a similar time period, following a survey of approximately 90% of their range, a decline of 30% of African Savanna Elephants was reported (Chase <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p><br/>For further information about this species, see the attached Supplementary Information document.</p><p><em></em></p>",Decreasing,"<p>African Savanna Elephants once occurred across all of Africa (Sikes 1971) and currently are found in 24 countries (see range map). Although knowledge of African Savanna Elephant distribution varies spatially and temporally, it is evident that the species’ distribution is retracting and becoming increasingly fragmented across their range in the continent. African Savanna Elephants occupy an estimated 15% of their historic pre- agricultural range (Chase <em>et al</em>. 2016). African Savanna Elephants are considered nationally extirpated in Burundi and Mauritania. In Eswatini, the once extirpated population has been re-established through reintroductions that began in the 1980s. Recent range expansion is evident in Kenya and Botswana (Douglas-Hamilton 1979; Said <em>et al</em>. 1995; Barnes <em>et al</em>. 1998; Blanc <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2007; Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The species' range map associated with this assessment is complete with the exception that some small private reserves in South Africa with less than 50 elephants each are absent as they were excluded from the African Elephant Database due to concerns about the census techniques.</p>","<strong>Ivory:</strong> Use of African Savanna Elephant ivory is entrenched in numerous cultures across the globe, primarily for ornamental and decorative items. Historically, demand for African Savanna Elephant ivory has been high in Europe, the USA and Asia. For example, beginning in the 1920s, Japanese carvers turned to African elephant ivory as Asian supplies diminished through the 1970s when Japan accounted for about 40% of the global ivory market (Martin 1986; Nishihara 2003, 2012).<br/><br/>In 1989, the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) banned the international commercial trade of ivory in response to a steep decline in African elephants across a substantial portion of their range. Thereafter, two CITES-sanctioned sales of national ivory stockpiles occurred in 2002 and 2008 with Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa selling ivory to China and Japan. At the same time, a nine-year moratorium (ending in 2017) on any new ivory sale proposals from the four African countries followed (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>). In the 2000s, Chinese demand for ivory greatly surpassed that of Japan where demand for ivory appeared to substantially decline (CITES 2014). As a consequence, prices rose steeply in China and in Africa (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Debates about the benefits and consequences of the sale of national ivory stockpiles are highly polarized with limited consensus (Stiles 2004, 't Sas-Rolfes <em>et al</em>. 2014, Bennett 2015, Biggs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Analysis of ivory seizure data indicates that the volume of illegally trafficked ivory has increased substantially since 2006 (Underwood <em>et al</em>. 2013; Milliken 2016; CITES 2018, 2019). Undercover investigations and DNA forensics point to the laundering of illegal ivory in legal domestic ivory markets. Seizure analyses indicate that the majority of illegally trafficked ivory is destined for Asia, especially China, Viet Nam and Thailand (CITES 2016, 2018 and 2019; Lui 2015; Krishnasamy 2016). In response to this and other concerns, China closed its legal domestic ivory market in 2017; Hong Kong SAR took steps to do the same by 2021 (<a href=""http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm"">https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm</a>), and Thailand tightened its domestic Asian Elephant ivory trade regulations in 2015 (<a href=""http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.htm"">http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.html</a>). A substantial drop in ivory prices in mainland China has been associated with this action (Vigne and Martin 2017, Meijer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Significant illegal ivory markets remain in several Southeast Asian countries, such as Lao PDR and Viet Nam (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>; Vigne and Martin 2017).<br/><strong><br/>Non-consumptive Tourism:&#160;</strong>African Savanna Elephants have significant tourism draw for wildlife watching and photographic tourism throughout their range substantially contributing to local economies (Naidoo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Tourism operations occur in national and local government protected areas, as well as on land under private or communal tenure.<br/><br/><strong>Trophy Hunting:</strong>&#160;In some range states sport hunting of African Savanna Elephants is legally permitted and forms an integral element of those countries’ wildlife management and community support programs (e.g., Naidoo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe have trophy hunting industries and in 2020 applied to CITES for a combined quota of 2,404 tusks <a href=""http://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php"">(https://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php</a> Accessed 16 August 2020). Depending on the governance and management structures, government bodies, private operations and local communities derive revenue from trophy hunting.<br/><br/><strong>Other Trade:</strong> A legal domestic trade in African Savanna Elephant hides is present in South Africa. There have been limited reports of African Savanna Elephant poaching for other body parts beyond ivory, such as meat, bone, skin and hair (Blignaut <em>et al</em>. 2008). International live trade in African Savanna Elephants occurs between South Africa and other countries, mainly in an effort to re-establish or fortify dwindling populations in some protected areas. Live trade in young African Savanna Elephants from Zimbabwe (Russo and Cruise 2016) and Eswatini (Madowo 2019) to Asia and elsewhere for zoological collections also occurs. Controversy surrounds these transactions as the conservation benefit to the species has been questioned. Domestic trade in African Savanna Elephants exists in South Africa at a low level for reintroduction purposes between reserves (Pretorius <em>et al</em>. 2018).",Terrestrial,"<p>The African Savanna Elephant was listed in CITES Appendix I in 1989 when all African elephants were considered a single species. Subsequently, the populations of Botswana (1997), Namibia (1997), South Africa (2000) and Zimbabwe (1997) were transferred to Appendix II, each with specific annotations. These annotations have been recently replaced by a single annotation for all four countries, with specific sub-annotations for the populations of Namibia and Zimbabwe. A separate CITES listing for each species has not occurred yet because a formal designation as two separate species (i.e.,&#160;<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>L. cyclotis</em>) is still in progress.<br/><br/>The African Elephant Action Plan (AEAP; developed and adopted by African elephant range countries) was adopted by CITES in March 2010 and is a statement by all range countries regarding the most important and immediate activities which require implementation and funding if Africa’s elephants are to be conserved. The African Elephant Fund was established to support the implementation of the African Elephant Action Plan. It should be noted that the AEAP does not distinguish different taxa of African elephant. The African Savanna Elephants which occur in transboundary populations introduce complications (e.g., matters of sovereignty) when considering national populations for CITES purposes (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>A number of CITES-initiated instruments were created to monitor and combat illegal trade in ivory. The CITES MIKE programme, which was established in 2002, has 66 designated sites across African elephant range and provides the most detailed and reliable data available on continental poaching pressure (CITES 2018, 2019); this includes 39 sites in 18 range countries of the African Savanna Elephant (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/prog/mike"">https://cites.org/eng/prog/mike</a>, Accessed 16 August 2020). Eswatini, South Sudan, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia do not have MIKE sites for their African Savanna Elephants. The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), established in 1996, is managed by TRAFFIC as a comprehensive information system for tracking illegal trade in ivory and other elephant products (CITES 2016, 2019). At a national level National Ivory Action Plans (NIAPs) are a tool designed to track significant and timely action to combat the illegal trade in ivory. Currently 24 African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries, as identified by ETIS analyses, are required to produce and implement a NIAP (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/niaps"">https://cites.org/eng/niaps</a>, Accessed 16 August 2020); 11 of these are range countries of the African Savanna Elephant.<br/><br/>At a national level the African Savanna Elephant is subject to varying degrees of legal protection in the 23 range states, with most countries granting the species the highest protection status. Providing this protection is complicated by the fact that over half of the species’ range may extend beyond the boundaries of protected areas (Taylor 2009). This point is emphasized by the evidence that the degree of protection is an important predictor of African Savanna Elephant’s presence and density (de Boer <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Conservation measures usually include habitat management and protection through policy, legislation and law enforcement. Successful anti-poaching and management at a site level has contributed to the re-establishment or recovery of a number of populations of African Savanna Elephants. In instances where protection efforts have failed, the African Savanna Elephant population was reduced by 70% or more in a matter of a decade (Chase <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the context where management culling was undertaken (mainly southern Africa) up until the late 1980s or early 1990s, culling has largely ceased and population density management is being attempted through actions such as translocation, contraception and range manipulation such as closure of artificial water point (Scholes and Mennell 2008). Fire management is being attempted in some transboundary situations to mitigate further habitat and/or woodland modification as a consequence of African Savanna Elephant activity (Starfield <em>et al</em>. 1993, Mapaure 2013, Eastment 2020).&#160;</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Analysis of estimates from 161 localities across the species range indicates a reduction of more than 80% of the continental population in the past three generations (93 years) that is understood to be continuing and likely irreversible. The continental trend is not, however, spatially uniform with some subpopulations increasing or stable while others are declining significantly faster than the continental rate. Many local subpopulations have been extirpated.<br/><br/>A generation length (GL) of 31 years is used; calculated in the standard format as the average age of mothers in the population (IUCN SPC 2019, p. 29). This figure is based on findings from demographic studies on GL for African Forest Elephants on the basis of a 23-year study in Central African Republic (Turkalo <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Subcriterion A2 is applied because some of the major causes for population reduction such as habitat loss due to human population expansion have not ceased, are projected to increase in coming decades and are unlikely to be reversible. The population reduction assessment for subcriterion A2 (considering three generations back) is inferred from published survey data. Density and distribution estimates for the African Forest Elephant across its continental range vary in methodology, completeness, regularity, date of first survey and certainty. Few credible site-specific estimates exist prior to the 1980s, and there is no available estimate for the species' population across its combined central and west African range. For this assessment, an attempt was made to model the data three generations back to 1922 (see Supplementary Information for description of data that is current as of and up to the end of 2015); however, given the sparseness of information available to inform the model, such modelling was not informative. Therefore, rather than projecting declines well beyond the extent of the survey data used in the assessment, we made the assumption that the continental population of three generations back (1922) is equal to that of one generation back (1984). Additional assumptions, necessary to fill gaps in the dataset, are detailed in the attached Supplementary Information document.<br/><br/>Subcriterion A3 has not been applied, because although the major threats to the species are known, projecting the level of such threats 31 to 93 years into the future (i.e., three generations, up to a maximum of 100 years) would likely introduce high levels of uncertainty.<br/><br/>An assessment of population reduction according to subcriterion A4 considering one to two generations back and one to two forward is in progress by this team of Assessors (Edwards <em>et al</em>. in prep.). Analysis of poaching and human influence in the recent past and future based upon available data of two representative indices (i.e., proportion of illegal killed elephants (PIKE) and the human footprint index) are being included as covariates in the projection.<br/><br/>Criteria B, C and D are not relevant to the threatened status as the species currently occupies more than 20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and there are more than 10,000 mature individuals. No quantitative analysis of the probability of extinction in the wild was conducted, and therefore criterion E does not apply.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Previous Assessments of African Elephant:<br/></strong>This is the first assessment of the African Forest Elephant (<em>Loxodonta cyclotis</em>) as a species separate from the African Savanna Elephant (<em>L. africana</em>).<br/><br/>The African Elephant, as a single species, was listed as Vulnerable (VU A2a) in the 2004 and 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, under the same IUCN Categories and Criteria used in this assessment (Version 3.1; IUCN 2001). In the 2008 Assessment, the Central African region, which consists mainly of Forest Elephant range plus Savanna Elephant range in Cameroon, Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was considered Data Deficient.<br/><br/>In an assessment conducted in 1996 by the IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group, the African Elephant was listed as Endangered (EN A1b) under the IUCN Categories and Criteria Version 2.3 (IUCN 1994).</p>","<p>African Forest Elephants are found across the Guineao-Congolian tropical forests of west and central Africa stretching from remnant habitat in the northwest in Guinea and Sierra Leone (10 ° North, 12° West) to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (4° South, 29° East). They occupy a variety of forest habitats including lowland humid forest on terra firma, swamp forests, the lower reaches of Afro-montane forests, dry forests and forest-savanna mosaics. They have a wide altitudinal range from the littoral forests along the Atlantic coast to about 2,000 metres in the Albertine Rift.<br/><br/>African Forest Elephants are capable of moving long distances and may do so regularly, usually depending on fruiting events and a requirement for mineral salts. African Forest Elephants also demonstrate range residence and regular movement patterns with home ranges varying between less than 10 km<sup>2</sup> to more than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2008, Schuttler <em>et al</em>. 2012). Their movements are largely predicted by human pressure such as roads and villages rather than by vegetation type (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2008, Molina-Vacas <em>et al</em>. 2019). Fifteen African Forest Elephant subpopulations (seven of which number more than 1,000 individuals) span international boundaries, including more than 25,000 African Forest Elephants in the three-country TRIDOM landscape where a transfrontier management agreement is formalized between Cameroon, the Republic of Congo and Gabon (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017). Such management agreements also exist for the WAP complex in Burkina-Faso, Benin, and Niger, and for the Sangha Tri-National Landscape in Cameroon, Congo, and the Central African Republic.<br/><br/><strong>Ecosystem Services:<br/></strong>Specific ecosystem services provided by both species of African elephants vary and depend to a large extent on the ecosystem (forest, savanna, grassland or desert) specific conditions on the ground and geographical context under consideration. In general, they play an important ecological role as bulk processors of plant material (Owen-Smith 1989). African Forest Elephants are highly frugivorous and are instrumental in dispersing many tree species (Blake 2009, Terborgh 2016). They are obligate seed dispersers for some tree species (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2009, Campos Arceiz and Blake 2011, Beaune <em>et al</em>. 2013) and particularly the seeds of large trees which tend to have high carbon content (Stephenson<em> et al</em>. 2014). The loss of the largest herbivores has repercussions on carbon storage in Amazonia (Doughty <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2016) and the same may occur in Africa. African Forest Elephants create and maintain forest clearings in mineral-rich soil on which a wide variety of African forest fauna depend; they distribute the limited micronutrients available in “bais” to outlying areas (Turkalo and Fay 1995, 2001; Turkalo <em>et al</em>. 2013; Cromsigt <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>African Forest Elephants are an important symbol within the cultures of many African communities. African elephants (both species combined) are one of the few iconic animals that occur in the majority of African countries, and innumerable stories, songs, and cultural traditions revolve around them.</p>","Poaching for ivory is currently the principal cause of death of African Forest Elephants (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2014, Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016) with persistent poaching pressure at many sites evident from their first surveys in the 1970s to the present day (Douglas-Hamilton 1989, Barnes <em>et al</em>. 1993, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013). Data collected as a part of the CITES Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants programme (MIKE), indicate that poaching significantly intensified across the continent starting in 2008 and peaking in 2011 – an unsustainably high level of poaching has continued into current times (CITES 2018, 2019).<br/><br/>Rapid land use change, driving the direct loss and fragmentation of habitat, is an increasing threat to African elephants across their range. Land conversion is a product of the ongoing expansion of the human population and associated agriculture and infrastructure development, which in turn are driven by economic and technological advances. A specific manifestation of this trend is the reported increase in human-elephant conflict (e.g., Ngama <em>et al</em>. 2016). Human population growth projections suggest land conversion will accelerate rapidly in the coming decades across Africa (see <a href=""http://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/"">https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/</a>) which will likely increase this threat.","<p>Over the past century, African Forest Elephant populations have declined across most of their range. The African Elephant Status Report 2016 estimated a continental population of 415,428 (+/- 95% C.I. 20,111) for both African Savanna and African Forest Elephants combined and reported a continental decline of approximately 111,000 elephants since 2006 (Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). An assessment of African Forest Elephants in the central African range (representing approximately 95% of their present geographic range) estimated an overall decline of 62% between 2002 and 2011 with 72% of the remaining population being located in Gabon and the Republic of Congo (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>For further information about this species, see the attached Supplementary Information document.</p><p><em></em></p>",Decreasing,"<p>African Forest Elephants once occurred across the entire humid forest area of western and central Africa, and currently are found in 20 countries (see range map). Their range is decreasing and is highly fragmented in western Africa where seven range countries are reported to have fewer than a hundred African Forest Elephants each (this includes Senegal subject to genetic confirmation of its very small population as <em>Loxodonta cyclotis) </em>(Bouche <em>et al.</em> 2011, Thouless <em>et al</em>. 2016). Recent observations in Angola and South Sudan indicate African Forest Elephant presence though no population survey data is available. African Forest Elephants are considered nationally extirpated in the Gambia. The majority of the remaining population is found in six central African countries where they occupy an estimated 25% of their former range (Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;</p>","<strong>Ivory:</strong>&#160;Use of African elephant ivory is entrenched in numerous cultures across the globe, primarily for ornamental and decorative items. Historically, demand for African elephant ivory has been high in Europe, the USA and Asia. For example, beginning in the 1920s, Japanese carvers turned to African elephant ivory as Asian supplies diminished through the 1970s when Japan accounted for about 40% of the global ivory market with a particular preference in Japan for African Forest Elephant ivory due to its hardness, suitable for hankos and the large plectrums for shamisen (Martin 1986; Nishihara 2003, 2012).<br/><br/>In 1989, the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) banned the international commercial trade of ivory in response to a steep decline in African elephants across a substantial portion of their range. Thereafter, two CITES-sanctioned sales of national ivory stockpiles occurred in 2002 and 2008 with Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa selling ivory to China and Japan. At the same time, a nine-year moratorium (ending in 2017) on any new ivory sale proposals from the four African countries followed (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>). In the 2000s, Chinese demand for ivory greatly surpassed that of Japan where demand for ivory appeared to substantially decline (CITES 2014). As a consequence, prices rose steeply in China and in Africa (Wittemyer <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Debates about the benefits and consequences of the sale of national ivory stockpiles are highly polarized with limited consensus (Stiles 2004, 't Sas-Rolfes <em>et al</em>. 2014, Bennett 2015, Biggs&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Analysis of ivory seizure data indicates illegally trafficked ivory has increased substantially since 2006 (Underwood <em>et al</em>. 2013; Milliken 2016; CITES 2018, 2019). Undercover investigations and DNA forensics point to the laundering of illegal ivory in legal domestic ivory markets and seizure analyses indicate that the majority of illegally trafficked ivory is destined for Asia, especially China, Viet Nam and Thailand (CITES 2016, 2018 and 2019; Lui 2015; Krishnasamy 2016). As a result of this and other concerns, China closed its legal domestic ivory market in 2017, Hong Kong SAR took steps to do the same by 2021 (<a href=""http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm"">https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201706/02/P2017060100655.htm</a>), and Thailand tightened its domestic Asian elephant ivory trade regulations in 2015 (<a href=""http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.html"">http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/media-center/14/52929-Thailand-Submits-First-Progress-Report-on-Implemen.html</a>). A considerable drop in ivory prices in mainland China was associated with this action (Vigne and Martin 2017, Meijer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Significant illegal ivory markets remain in several Southeast Asian countries, such as Lao PDR and Viet Nam (<a href=""http://www.cites.org"">www.cites.org</a>; Vigne and Martin 2017).<br/><strong><br/>Non-consumptive Tourism:</strong>&#160;African Forest Elephants potentially have a significant tourism draw for wildlife watching and photographic tourism along with other iconic species that share their habitat such as western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees. National parks in Gabon, Republic of Congo and Benin among others, are actively developing tourism opportunities despite the species’ cryptic nature and often closed canopy habitat. Unlike the African savanna elephant, tourism does not contribute substantially to the conservation of African Forest Elephants in central Africa (Naidoo <em>et al</em>. 2016) and little documentation of its success in west Africa exists.<br/><strong><br/>Trophy Hunting:</strong>&#160;Trophy hunting for African Forest Elephant is rare; Cameroon is the only range country to submit trophy quotas (80 individuals annually) in recent decades but it has ceased to do so since 2019 <a href=""http://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php"">(https://cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php</a>, Assessed 26 January 2019).<br/><strong><br/>Other Trade:</strong>&#160;There have been limited reports of African Forest Elephant poaching for body parts other than ivory, such as tails, bone, skin and hair (e.g.,&#160;<a href=""http://www.enca.com/africa/tusks-and-elephant-tails-seized-in-ivory-coast-ngo"">www.enca.com/africa/tusks-and-elephant-tails-seized-in-ivory-coast-ngo</a>). The bushmeat trade is thriving in parts of west and central Africa and likely includes a considerable volume of African Forest Elephant meat as indicated in hunter interviews (Stiles 2011, Abernethy <em>et al</em>. 2013). No live trade of African Forest Elephants is known to occur.",Terrestrial,"<p>The African Forest Elephant was listed in CITES Appendix I in 1989 when all African elephants were considered a single species. Subsequently, the populations of Botswana (1997), Namibia (1997), South Africa (2000) and Zimbabwe (1997) were transferred to Appendix II, each with specific annotations. These annotations have been recently replaced by a single annotation for all four countries, with specific sub-annotations for the populations of Namibia and Zimbabwe. A separate CITES listing for each species has not occurred yet because a formal designation as two separate species (i.e.,&#160;<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>L. cyclotis</em>) is still in progress.<br/><br/>The African Elephant Action Plan (developed and adopted by African elephant range countries) was adopted by CITES in March 2010 and is a sanctioned statement by all range countries regarding the most important and immediate activities which require implementation which require implementation and funding if Africa’s elephants are to be conserved. The African Elephant Fund was established to support the implementation of the African Elephant Action Plan. It should be noted that the AEAP does not distinguish different taxa of African elephant. The African Forest Elephants which occur in transboundary populations require that matters of sovereignty are considered when national populations are being presented for CITES purposes (Lindsay <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>A number of CITES-initiated instruments were created to monitor and combat illegal trade in ivory. The CITES MIKE programme was established in 2002, has 66 designated sites across the range of both African elephants; this includes 29 sites in 15 range countries of the African Forest Elephant (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/prog/mike"">https://cites.org/eng/prog/mike</a>, Accessed 21 July 2020). Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone and Nigeria do not have MIKE sites for their African Forest Elephant populations. The MIKE programme provides the most detailed and reliable data available on continental poaching pressure (CITES 2018, 2019). However, metrics used by the MIKE programme that depend on carcass finds are less statistically sensitive and reliable in the closed canopy forest habitat because detection of carcasses is difficult and decomposition in humid environments is relatively rapid. The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) established in 1996, is managed by TRAFFIC as a comprehensive information system for tracking illegal trade in ivory and other elephant products (CITES 2016, 2019). At a national level the implementation of National Ivory Action Plans (NIAPs) are a practical tool designed to track significant and timely action to combat the illegal trade in ivory. Currently 24 African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries, as identified by ETIS analyses, are required to produce and implement a NIAP (<a href=""http://cites.org/eng/niaps"">https://cites.org/eng/niaps</a>, Accessed 21 July 2020); six of these are range countries of the African Forest Elephant.<br/><br/>At a national level African Forest Elephants are subject to varying degrees of legal protection in the 20 range states, with most granting them the highest possible protection status. However, up to 70% of the animals may live outside protected areas (Maisels <em>et al.</em> 2013) and are vulnerable to poaching, as the degree of protection (by anti-poaching agents) and road access are both important predictors of their density (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2008, Yackulic <em>et al</em>. 2011, Maisels <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Conservation measures usually include habitat management and protection through legislation, policy and law enforcement. Successful anti-poaching and management has resulted in the maintenance of numbers of African Forest Elephants in some localities. In other instances where protection efforts have failed, African Forest Elephant numbers have been reduced by 70% or more in a decade (ANPN, WCS, and WWF 2013; Nzooh Dongmo <em>et al</em>. 2016; Poulsen<em> et al</em>. 2017).</p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

This species is therefore listed as Vulnerable.<br/><p></p>","This species inhabits open, arid and sparsely vegetated steppe and semi-desert (Launay <em>et al.</em> 1997, Osborne <em>et al.</em> 1997, Mian 2003, Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003). It favours scattered shrubby vegetation, typically comprising xerophytic or halophytic plants (Collar 1996). Those wintering in Iran have been shown to prefer more densely vegetated bush-steppe to sparser shrub-steppe; however, within those bush-steppe habitats they favour areas with reduced vegetation cover (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Bush-steppe is thought to contain a higher abundance of food sources such as<em> Salsola</em> spp. and arthropods (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). Birds wintering in Iran also routinely visit neighbouring farmland where alfalfa and salad rocket is grown, but avoid pistachio crops (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Although dense vegetation may provide a sanctuary from danger, as well as thermal protection when overnight temperatures drop in winter (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al.</em> 2010), more open, unvegetated areas are often favoured as night-time roosts in order to minimise the risk of ambush by nocturnal predators (Combreau and Smith 1997). On the breeding grounds, nesting females may also favour sites away from vegetation patches, which could provide cover for predators (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2003, Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2012). Abundance of breeding males has been found to be higher in flat areas with shorter shrub vegetation which is likely to be more suitable for displaying (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a).<br/><p>The species feeds throughout the day, but is most active at dawn and dusk (Combreau and Launay 1996). It has an eclectic diet, mainly comprising plants and invertebrates (especially ants Formicidae and beetles Tenebrionidae: Tigar and Osborne 2000), but also including vertebrates such as rodents, lizards, small snakes and even young birds (Collar 1996, Tourenq <em>et al</em>. 2003). <br/></p><p>Males attract their mates with an extravagant courtship display which they perform at the same site each year. The display begins with a period of strutting and culminates with the male retracting his head within an ornamental shield of erected neck feathers and then running at speed in either a straight or curved line. The display is often accompanied by a series of subsonic booming calls (Gaucher <em>et al</em>. 1996). Males play no part in rearing the young, and a brood may contain young sired by several different individuals (Lesobre <em>et al</em>. 2010). Females create a shallow scrape in the ground in which they typically lay 3-4 eggs, and occasionally up to six eggs in long-distance migrants (Collar 1996, Combreau <em>et al</em>. 2002). The incubation period is typically 24 days, whilst fledging takes around 35 days.<br/></p><p></p>","The principal threat is from hunting (primarily using falconry), largely but not exclusively on the species's wintering grounds (Judas <em>et al. </em>2009). Large numbers are also trapped, mainly in Pakistan and Iran, and shipped to Arabia for use in the training of falcons (Combreau 2007); hunting and trapping are responsible for more than 50% of mortality in Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;In 2014 an illegal shipment of 240 birds was intercepted en route from Pakistan to Bahrain (Shafaeipour <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Arab countries, the meat of this species is considered an aphrodisiac, attracting hunters of high status (Nabi <em>et al., </em>2019); in 2017-2019, permits for hunting of the Asian Houbara were given by Pakistan to royal Arabs, and unregulated hunting seems to be continuing. Eggs are also collected during the breeding season (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021). In recent years the species has been heavily hunted in Iraq, as the country has opened up to visits by hunters from other countries (R. Porter&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>In parts of the region, fast-paced development related to the growth of the petroleum industry has reduced the availability of undisturbed habitats and further exacerbated the species's decline. Oil exploration, road building, oil and water pipelines, mining and quarrying activities, powerlines and the general disturbance caused by four-wheel drive vehicles have all been identified as significant auxiliary threats.  Powerlines in particular may be a significant threat (M. Koshkin <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Preliminary data from Uzbekistan suggests that powerlines may contribute to species mortality (Burnside <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Livestock grazing is reported to have a negative impact on the species, both indirectly, by degrading the desert vegetation on which birds rely for food and concealment, and directly, through the trampling of nests and disturbance of nesting females (Lavee 1988). Recent research on the effects of pastoralism on this species in the Kyzylkum Desert in Uzbekistan, however, has found that low intensity livestock grazing may not widely degrade rangelands at a landscape scale (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has no effect on male abundance and female nesting success (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2016a,b). In Iran, loss of habitat to croplands, mainly through the planting of pistachio, has been judged to be a significant threat (Mansoori 2006); however, it has also been found that the species exploits other crops such as alfalfa and salad rocket (Aghanajafizadeh <em>et al</em>. 2010). Yousefi (2017) reported a high degree of dependence on habitats in the vicinity of croplands, with habitats more than 6 km away losing their suitability. In Saudi Arabia, eggs and nests are predated by a range of mammalian predators (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<p></p>Habitat modelling and climate projections predict an increase in suitable habitat in the future, including shifts in geographic distribution of suitable habitat (Yousefi <em>et al., </em>2017); however, the probability of chick survival may decrease in areas with relatively higher temperatures (Koshkin <em>et al., </em>2016), and higher mortality has been reported from Iran in harsh wintering conditions (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).<br/><br/>The primary conservation approach for this species has been captive-breeding and release, however this may be unsustainable and detrimental to wild populations. Over reliance on supplementation of wild populations with captive-bred individuals risks domestication and replacement, rather than conservation reinforcement, with the potential of release of less-fit individuals causing a long-term reduction in the size, genetic diversity and viability of wild populations (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018). With the current extent of unregulated harvest, one model reports that wild populations would require releasing over 3000 captive-bred females a year, more than the initial wild stock, to attain population stabilisation (Dolman <em>et al., </em>2018).&#160;Releasing captive-bred stock may also create the allusion that mitigation measures are successful, which can lead to increased hunting pressure.","The population was last estimated to be between 78,960 and 97,000 individuals globally (O. Combreau&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2014, BirdLife International 2014), and stated as poorly known in 2016 (BirdLife International). Studies since have primarily focused on nest site selection and reintroduced populations; available data on breeding parameters of wild populations are insufficient (Azar&#160;<em>et al.,&#160;</em>2018). Accurately establishing the global population is extremely challenging. The population is expected to fall within the population band for 50,000-99,999 individuals, which is assumed to equate to c.33,000-67,000 mature individuals. The breeding population in Kazakhstan has been estimated at c.49,000 individuals (Riou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/><br/><p></p>",Decreasing,"This species&#160;extends from <strong>Egypt</strong> east of the Nile, through <strong>Israel</strong>, <strong>Palestine</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, <strong>Yemen</strong>, <strong>Oman</strong>, <strong>U.A.E.</strong>, <strong>Bahrain</strong>, <strong>Qatar</strong>, <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Kuwait</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, <strong>Pakistan</strong>, <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Turkmenistan</strong>, <strong>Uzbekistan</strong>, <strong>Tajikistan</strong>, <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong>, <strong>Kazakhstan</strong> and <strong>Mongolia</strong> to<strong> China</strong>.

The species is considered Critically Endangered on the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015). Studies have been conducted into the status, ecology and migration of the species in various parts of its range, most notably Kazakhstan (Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2002, Tourenq <em>et al. </em>2004,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt</em><em>.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004, Riou <em>et al</em>. 2011) and Uzbekistan (Koshkin <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2016a,b). Through its network of breeding facilities in the U.A.E., Morocco and Kazakhstan, the International Fund for Houbara Conservation (IFHC) has a long-term goal to produce 35,000 Asian Houbaras each year for reintroduction into the wild (IFHC 2014). The first releases were made in Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area in central Saudi Arabia in 1991. This population is currently estimated to number 250–300 individuals. Further releases have taken place elsewhere in Saudi  Arabia (including at Saja Umm ar Rimth with c.50 individuals [M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016]) and also in U.A.E., Qatar, Kuwait, Yemen, Jordan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. By the end of 2016, 13,504 houbara had been released into the UAE (Azar <em>et al., </em>2018). It is not yet clear what impact the releases of captive-reared birds have on the demographics and genetic integrity of the overall population,&#160;however according to Burnside <em>et al.</em> (2016), in order to compensate for the loss of wild adults to hunting, the number of released birds may need to be as much as 10 times higher than hunting quotas. At least three birds have been satellite tracked from Saudi Arabia to the breeding grounds in Kazakhstan (Zafar-ul Islam <em>et al</em>. 2014). The CMS Asian Houbara Agreement (2005) urges all range countries to take necessary measures to prevent the extinction of any population of Houbara and maintain a favourable status.&#160;<p></p><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>The most urgently needed conservation measures are those that will reduce exploitation to a biologically sustainable level. This will require precautionary and scientifically determined limits on the number of birds that can be harvested legally and stricter enforcement of bans on illegal forms of trade and hunting; it also requires in-depth studies of natural productivity in Asian Houbaras in relation to habitat selection and predator abundance. Carry out further surveys to gain an improved estimate of the overall population size and trend; continue research to determine the migration routes, schedules and strategies of all populations. Survey the species throughout the wintering range (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Produce a range-wide action and recovery plan, based on agreement under the Convention on Migratory Species; the CMS Asian Houbara Agreement has been drafted but has not been opened for signature. Develop and implement national and regional species action plans (M. Zafar-ul Islam <em>in litt</em>. 2016).&#160;Create managed protected areas and review current protected areas. For example, approximately 85% of suitable habitat are outside the existing protected area network of Iran (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;Where they can be shown to be detrimental, reduce grazing and other farming pressures (Goriup 1997, Combreau <em>et al.</em> 2001,&#160;O. Combreau and M. Lawrence <em>in litt.</em> 2004, F. Launay pers. comm. 2004). Establish long-term, range-wide population monitoring studies. Study the overall demographic and genetic consequences of releasing captive-reared birds. Engage local communities in the protection of houbara through education, such as is provided by the IFHC, and through entrepreneurship developments like ecotourism (Pakniat <em>et al., </em>2021).&#160;<br/><p></p>",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Given that encroachment upon natural ecosystems continues unabated across its range, it is possible that some large regionally-significant colonies may be subject to disturbances or have already been extirpated. This conservation status will need to be reassessed when new taxonomic and distributional information is available.","This species roosts in limestone caves, tunnels, and rock crevices. It congregates in clusters within the roost, often with other species of <em>Miniopterus</em>. Clusters of around 10,000 individuals have been observed on the island of New Britain (Bonaccorso 1998). It forages for insects in primary and secondary forest. One of the five adult females captured at the Ulatawa Plantation in January 1997 was in early term pregnancy (Bonaccorso 1998).","Across its range there are various activities that threaten the integrity of roost sites and disturb colonies, including limestone quarrying, land modification associated with other mining activity, and guano mining. The removal of natural forest habitat also reduces the foraging habitat of this and other <em>Miniopterus </em>species.","It is locally abundant in the highlands of the western half of Papua New Guinea, and in lowland areas with caves on the islands of New Britain and New Ireland (Bonaccorso 1998).",Unknown,"Taxonomic investigations underway may provide a more accurate  understanding of the distribution limits of this species. Until then,  the species is considered to range from southern Thailand and the Malay  Peninsula, to Java, with scattered localities on the islands of Borneo  and New Guinea (Papua New Guinea only), as far east as Buka Island,  Papua New Guinea (Bonaccorso 1998). It is perhaps also present in the  Solomon Islands. On Borneo, there are three records from Sabah (Tepadong  caves, Batu pute and Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary; Lackman-Ancrenaz  and Ancrenaz 1997), and at least two records from Kalimantan - Betung  Kerihun National Park (Soedjito 1999) and from Gunung Niut Nature  Reserve, West Kalimantan (Simons 1987). On Java, it has been recorded  from the Cibodas Botanical Gardens, Mount Gede Pangrango National Park.  It has been recorded from sea level to 2,600 m.",,Terrestrial,"A common assumption for common and widespread species is that they are secure, and that adequate numbers occur in multiple protected areas. For species of Miniopterus that congregate seasonally to breed, a single catastrophic event can remove a significant fraction of a regional population. In addition, insidious processes and minor disturbances can function to cause declines both at breeding roosts and other areas where bats are present seasonally. Effective protection and strategic management of known roost sites, especially of the largest colonies, should be a priority for government land managers, ideally working with local authorities and communities. Broader-reaching policies that take steps to protect ever-dwindling natural forests and decrease the use of chemicals in agricultural areas will also help this species persist. In environmental impact assessments, so-called ‘localised effects’ may in fact have regional consequences, given the number and spatial extent of suitable protected caves available for colonies, particularly large seasonal breeding congregations. Assessments of the risk of developments to known large colonies therefore need to be informed by the broader context of habitat available for the species. The conservation status of all small <em>Miniopterus </em>needs to be reassessment in the light of new taxonomic and distributional information.",Australasian|Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
