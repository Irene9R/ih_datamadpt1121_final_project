2623523,199970,Ambystoma mavortium,Least Concern,,2015,2015-08-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><a name=""OLE_LINK28""></a><a name=""OLE_LINK7""></a></p><p>Listed as Least Concern in view of the large extent of occurrence, large number of sub-populations and localities, large population size and use of a wide range of habitats.</p>","This species occurs in a variety of habitats, including grass prairies, open prairies, aspen parkland, boreal, deciduous and coniferous forests and woodlands, alpine and sub-alpine areas, semi-deserts, and deserts, and because of this it is considered to be quite adaptable (CARCNET 2010, AmphibiaWeb 2011). It breeds in a wide range of environments, including permanent or semi-permanent ponds or lakes (COSEWIC 2012),&#160;from clear mountain ponds to temporary, manure-polluted pools in the lowlands, usually in sites where predatory fishes are absent. In the mountains of western Colorado, it is associated with ponds that have silty bottoms, low alkalinity, and no fish (Geraghty and Willey 1992). Aquatic breeding habitats must hold water for the 3 to 7 months required to complete development up to metamorphosis (COSEWIC 2012), and the species can be found in many breeding sites throughout the year (Hammerson 1999).","Besides use as live bait, this species is thought to be affected by deforestation and loss of wetland habitat (AmphibiaWeb 2011). However, the species commonly occurs in highly altered habitats, and it often breeds in ponds constructed for livestock use.(Hammerson 1999). Introduced predatory fish could potentially also be a cause of declines (AmphibiaWeb 2011, COSEWIC 2012), as could acid rain (Harte and Hoffman 1989). Cases of road mortality are high where roads intersect migration routes to and from breeding sites (COSEWIC 2012). Ambystoma tigrinum Virus (ATV)&#160;has been identified as the causative agent in localized mass mortality events of Western Tiger Salamanders in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta (COSEWIC 2012).<br/><br/>Many mountain lakes, formerly inhabited by tiger salamanders, now have few or none as a result of the stocking of trout which consume and deplete the larval populations (Blair 1951 pers. obs.). Geraghty and Willey (1992) found that fish absence was the most important factor influencing tiger salamander presence in Gunnison County and vicinity, and Corn, Jennings, and Muths (1997) reported that trout and tiger salamanders rarely occur together in Rocky Mountain National Park. Trout and tiger salamanders do occasionally coexist in some lakes (Dartt 1879, Blair 1951), but only where vegetated shallows provide habitat not easily accessible to the fishes.&#160;<br/><br/>Under certain conditions, larval populations might be vulnerable to bacterial infections associated with livestock grazing. In the mountains of Utah, Worthylake and Hovingh (1989) observed recurrent mass mortality of larvae associated a bacterial infection and suggested that increased nitrogen levels due in part to sheep grazing might have been involved. Bryant (1995) observed a mass mortality event in the summer of 1993 that appeared to be associated with an opportunistically pathogenic bacterium. In Arizona, similar die-offs, apparently associated with bacterial pathogens, have been reported (Pfennig, Loeb and Collins 1991). Cannibal morphs seemed particularly vulnerable, probably due to their feeding on diseased larvae. Again, fecal contamination of ponds by introduced livestock was suggested as a possible cause of the fatal outbreaks. In contrast to these reports, larvae sometimes do thrive in large numbers in manure-laden ponds in Colorado (Hammerson 1999). Nevertheless, die-offs of larvae, apparently associated with pathogenic bacteria, have been observed in Colorado (Hammerson 1999).","This is one of the most abundant&#160;<em>Ambystoma&#160;</em>species. The total adult population size is unknown but surely exceeds 1,000,000. Tiger Salamanders occur throughout their historical range in the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains of Colorado and adjacent states. They remain easy to find and locally abundant in suitable habitat. Ponds often contain up to several thousand larvae. Recent surveys found no evidence of significant declines in distribution or abundance (Corn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1989; Hammerson 1989a, 1992; Corn&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997). In the Rocky Mountains, a local decline in numbers over several years, reported by Harte and Hoffman (1989), turned out to be a temporary fluctuation from which the population subsequently recovered (Wissinger and Whiteman 1992). Hovingh (1986) reported that tiger salamanders remain quite common in aquatic systems in glaciated portions of the Uinta Mountains in northeastern Utah. The widespread creation of small, fish-less artificial bodies of water has provided much suitable habitat where previously there was little, and these salamanders have been quick to colonize it (Norris 1973, Hammerson 1999). Declines of the Southern Mountain sub-population in British Columbia, northern part of the disjunct sub-population, have been observed and predicted based on habitat loss and degradation, road mortality, and&#160;other threats (COSEWIC 2012).",Unknown,"This species has a widespread distribution through western and central Canada including British Columbia, central and southern Alberta and Saskatchewan to southern Manitoba (COSEWIC 2012). In the United States it has a broad north-south distribution, extending from Montana and the Dakotas to Oklahoma and Texas (AmphibiaWeb 2011).&#160;The eastern distribution extends through Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, continues west along the northern Mexican states of Coahuila and Sonora, and then north through Arizona along the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains. There is a disjunct distribution in the northwest, extending from extreme northern Oregon, through Washington and Idaho panhandle&#160;into the southern Okanagan region of British Columbia&#160;(COSEWIC 2012). The species has been introduced in numerous localities west of the native range (Stebbins 2003); for example, some sub-populations in southern Arizona were introduced for use as fish bait (AmphibiaWeb 2011).","It is reported to be used widely as live bait in fishing (CARCNET 2010, AmphibiaWeb 2011).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<strong><em>Conservation Actions</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong>In most of the range in the United States, this species is of relatively low conservation concern and does not require significant additional protection or major management.<p></p>The Canadian range of this species includes the South Okanagan Grasslands Provincial and White Lake Grasslands Provincial Parks (COSEWIC 2012).

Breeding takes place via direct development, with the eggs attached to the underside of leaves.","This species is threatened by the conversion of native forest to cultivated areas (including tea and cardamom estates), as well as pollution from agro-chemicals.&#160;<br/><br/>Climate change also poses a threat, as annual rainfall is declining steeply across this region, especially on the perhumid western slopes. This area is becoming markedly drier and more seasonal. From an annual average rainfall of about 2,500 mm of rain a century ago, the highlands now receive around 1,900 mm, and years with less than 1,500 are increasingly common (De Silva and Sonnadara 2016).&#160; This reduction in rainfall occurs largely during the first intermonsoon in March-April, extending the duration of the usual December-February dry period. There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran <em>et al. </em>2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1° C (De Costa 2008).&#160; These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests). The preponderance of amphibian species in the highlands are <em>Pseudophilautus</em> shrub frogs which, being direct developers, are independent of bodies of standing water.

Gunawardena<em> </em><em>et al</em>. (1998) and Jayalal <em>et al. </em>(2017) suggest that high acidity in mist- and rain-water may present a significant risk to the highland biota in Sri Lanka.

The dramatic stock decline began in the late 19th century and continues to the present day. From the late 19th century to 1992 the population has experienced a decline of more than 80%. During the last ten to fifteen years a very large decrease in the abundance of this species has occurred. The average age of fishes is subsequently decreasing as a result of catch of adults by poachers for caviar. This has resulted in females reproducing only once in their lifetime. This species has therefore been assessed as Critically Endangered.,"Habitat: All types of benthic habitats in large rivers and lakes of the Amur River basin. <br/><br/>Biology: Semi-anadromous (anadromous fishes spend at least part of their life in salt water and return to rivers to breed). The Kaluga Sturgeon spawns in lower reaches of the Amur River in strong-current habitats in the main stream of the river on gravel or sandy-gravel bottom. Spawning peaks from the end of May to July. Adults spawn many times during their life cycle. Spawning periodicity is 4-5 years in females and 3-4 years in males. The generation length of the species is not less than 20 years (Krykhtin and Svirskii 1997, Berg 1948).","The causes of the population decline are still overfishing, both legal and poaching (Vaisman and Fomenko 2007).

Within these streams they are often found in the slower more open sections, away from waterfalls (Hodgkison and Hero 2002). Individuals can be found on rocks, logs and vegetation in or adjacent to streams (Hero and Fickling 1994). There are differences in habitat use between males and females of the species. Females and juveniles use streamside vegetation more frequently than males. In contrast, males display strong fidelity to the rocky stream environment. Calling males and gravid females have been observed throughout the year (Liem 1974b). Breeding has been observed in most months, except during cold winter nights, and seems to reach a peak between November and March (Liem 1974b; Dennis and Trenerry 1984). Males call from rocks or boulders in creeks or from vegetation overhanging water along streams and creeks (Liem 1974b). The males also appear to display inter-male spacing, with males rarely found within 1m of each other, which is possibly a territorial response to low availability of females (Hodgkison and Hero 2002). A number (46-63) of unpigmented eggs (2.4-2.6mm in diameter) are laid in compact gelatinous clumps under rocks in water (Liem 1974b; Hero and Fickling 1996). Larvae can be found in fast-flowing sections of streams and adjacent pools in highly oxygenated water, clinging to rocks and other substrates (Liem 1974b; Hero and Fickling 1994). Liem (1974b) described the larvae of this species as torrent dwelling, having flattened bodies, large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tails. Richards (1992) and Hero and Fickling (1994) also provided detailed information on the larvae of this species.","The reason(s) for the decline of this species are unknown. Richards, McDonald and Alford (1993) reject drought, floods, habitat destruction or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals. The habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988; therefore, habitat destruction is no longer a threat (McDonald and Alford 1999). Current research is examining the possibility that disease, such as a viral infection or chytrid fungus, may have contributed to the decline of this species (Berger, Speare and Hyatt 1999). In recent experiments involving the translocation of larvae and adult frogs to sites previously occupied by the species, a clear pattern was evident in the disease results, and nearly all of the animals found dead showed signs of chytridiomycosis (Retallick 1999, 2000, 2001). It is unknown as to whether this disease was solely responsible for the disappearance of <em>L. rheocola</em> at these sites. Feral pigs are a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989-1992 in an area previously inhabited by <em>L. rheocola</em> (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). However, there has been very little research into the impact of feral pigs on native frog populations (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993).","This species was first noted to have declined in 1989 (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). In 1990 several sites were sampled between the Kirrama Range and Cooktown. <em>L. rheocola</em> was common at all foothill and lowland sites and was recorded at some upland sites in the Kirrama Range in April and on the Carbine Tableland in January of that year (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). It was abundant in Danbulla State Forest (at 700m asl) in September 1982, but was not recorded there during monitoring between 1989 and 1992 (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). It has since disappeared from most upland sites south of the Daintree River (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). Richards, McDonald and Alford (1993) reported only two adults at Bobbin Falls on the Atherton Tableland, although the species has been found regularly in that area between 1998 and February 2000 (R. Retallick pers. comm.) and 2001-2002 (K.R. McDonald pers. comm.). At O’Keefe Creek, Big Tableland, this species has occasionally reappeared near a 400m asl site, but has not established resident populations and is absent at another monitoring site at  600m asl (McDonald and Alford 1999). Adults and larvae remained common at upland sites north of the Daintree River (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993) but disappeared in 1993 (M. Cunningham pers. comm.).

It is most often associated with permanent water, ie. ponds, dams, lakes, creeks and waterholes. It calls year round. Males call from ground up to several metres from water or on vegetation near water. About 500-1,000 eggs are laid in jelly clumps attached to submerged vegetation in ponds. L.v. alpina occurs mainly in woodland, heath, grassland and herb field at montane, sub alpine and alpine altitudes (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 1995). Breeding populations occur on plains or open valleys where there are stream side pools, fens and bogs (Gillespie <em>et al.</em> 1995) but are also be associated with artificial waterbodies such as small dams and reservoirs (e.g. four of the seven extant populations of L. v. alpina located in Kosciuszko NP) (Osborne <em>et al.</em> 1999).

During the breeding season (September-December), calling males, gravid females and egg masses have been recorded, along seepage lines within or at the periphery of sub-alpine wet heathland and in gullies within montane vegetation communities (Malone 1985a; Hollis 1995). Calling activity has been recorded in early September, continuing as late as the last week in December (Malone 1985a; Hollis 1995; G.J. Hollis. pers. comm.). Oviposition (egg laying) appears to be confined to a shorter interval of 2-3 weeks during this period, when a peak in calling activity occurs (Malone 1985a, b; Hollis 1995). The timing of this peak in calling activity varies between breeding seasons (Hollis 1997). Calling activity may occur at any time of the day or night, with the greatest levels of activity being recorded during relatively warm, humid conditions (Hollis 1997). Very little calling activity occurs at temperatures near freezing (Malone 1985a) or when temperatures are high with low humidity (Hollis 1997). Egg masses are deposited in a transparent foam nest (8cm diameter and 3-4cm high) at the calling site, or nearby, during inguinal amplexus (Littlejohn 1963). The foam nest is produced by the female beating air bubbles into the mucous and eggs with flanged fingers during egg laying (Littlejohn 1963). The egg mass may be deposited at varying depths in vegetation, or below the ground surface, depending on the structural attributes of the site (Hollis 1997). Depths of over a metre have been observed, whilst others are deposited in vegetation very close to the surface (Hollis 1997). Clutch sizes reported in the literature range from 50-185 (see Littlejohn 1963; Malone 1985a, b; Tyler 1992). Ova are white and unpigmented and measure on average 4mm in diameter (Malone 1985b). Oviposition of more than one clutch may occur at a single site (Malone 1985b; Hollis 1997). It is also possible that females deposit a portion of their eggs at more than one site (Malone 1985a). Under natural conditions the embryonic period varies from 5-8 weeks, with individuals hatching at Gosner stages 22-23 (Malone 1985a, b). The larvae are non-feeding, hatching with a residual yolk mass that maintains them through to metamorphosis (Malone 1985a, b). Larvae usually remain at oviposition sites through to metamorphosis (Barker, Grigg and Tyler 1995; Hollis 1997). Upon hatching, however, larvae have also been observed to move small distances in shallow water from oviposition sites, while remaining covered under vegetation and/or woody debris (Hollis 1997), or to be washed into nearby pools (B.S. Malone pers. comm. in Hollis 1997).","The dearth of information available on the population dynamics and demography of the Baw Baw Frog makes it very difficult to interpret the observed decline in the adult male population. This decline coincides with a recent global phenomenon of declining amphibians (e.g., Barinaga 1990; Blaustein and Wake 1990; Tyler 1991), and perhaps of more concern, with the reported decline of species restricted to mountain-top and alpine environments in Australia (e.g., Osborne 1990; Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993) and overseas. Numerous hypotheses have been generated to explain these declines, but few as yet have been investigated thoroughly. Those that have, or are currently being investigated, include climate change (Osborne 1990; Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993), ultraviolet radiation (Blaustein <em>et al.</em> 1994), atmospheric pollution (Blaustein <em>et al.</em> 1994) and pathogens (such as chytridiomycosis) (Blaustein <em>et al.</em> 1994; Trenerry, Laurance and McDonald 1994), but there is growing scientific consensus that chytridiomycosis is often implicated. No thorough investigation of these hypotheses has yet been undertaken for the Baw Baw Frog. Forestry operations might also represent a threat to the species where it occurs in State Forest (W.S. Osborne pers. comm.). Willow (<em>Salix cinerea</em>), cattle, rabbits, Sambar deer, foxes, dogs and cats have been identified as invasive species that might be impacting the species (G.J. Hollis pers. comm.).","Malone (1985a) estimated the adult male population on the plateau to be over ten thousand individuals. During a series of extensive annual surveys carried out since 1993, a considerable reduction in the abundance of the species has been observed (Hollis 1995, 1997; Osborne, Hunter and Hollis 1999). Malone (1985a) recorded calling males in 73% (64 of 88) of frost hollows surveyed in 1983 and 1984, compared with 46% (22 of 48) recorded by Hollis (1995) in 1993. In a subset of 35 frost hollows surveyed in both 1983 and 1993, Malone (1985a) recorded 3,694 males compared with 83 by Hollis (1995). Similarly, in a subset of 19 frost hollows surveyed in both 1984 and 1993, 885 males were recorded in 1984 compared with 19 in 1993. Hollis (1995) and Osborne, Hunter and Hollis (1999) only recorded 2.2% and 2.1% of the number of males recorded by Malone in 1983 and 1984, respectively. Surveys during subsequent years (1994-1997) indicate that the species is currently restricted to the western half of the Baw Baw plateau (particularly to steeper montane-forested areas on the edge of the western plateau (W. Osborne pers. comm.), with a contraction of the distribution from eastern and western areas (Osborne, Hunter and Hollis 1999). Twenty-four sites surveyed on the Baw Baw plateau originally by Malone (1985a) were re-surveyed annually by Osborne, Hunter and Hollis (1999) for numbers of calling males present. At all sites, there was a very large reduction in the numbers recorded. The mean number of calling males recorded at 24 sites declined from 124 individuals in 1983 to between 1.5 and 3.3 individuals over the five years 1993 to 1997. In 1983-1984 the maximum population size recorded at a monitoring site was 667 individuals; by contrast, between 1993 and 1997 the largest population recorded was 41 individuals. In 1997 frogs were recorded at only six of the 25 monitoring sites. Overall, the current population size is estimated to be less than 250 adults, a tiny fraction of the number estimated only 20 years earlier by Malone (1985a).",Decreasing,"This species is restricted entirely to the Baw Baw Plateau, located approximately 120km east of Melbourne, Victoria (Malone 1985a; Hollis 1995). Despite searches in close proximity to the plateau, and in similar environments (e.g., Mount Useful, Mount Torongo), the species has not been found elsewhere. Encompassing an area of approximately 80km², the Baw Baw Plateau between approximately 1,260 and 1,560m asl is contained within the Baw Baw National Park, except for approximately 3.5km² near Mount Baw Baw that is managed by the Victorian Alpine Resorts Commission (Hollis 1997). At lower elevations, between 960 and 1,300m asl, records of the species occur from montane forest along the south escarpment of the Baw Baw Plateau (G. Hollis pers. comm.). In 1983 and 1984, Malone (1985a) undertook a comprehensive assessment of the distribution of the species. It was found to be widely distributed and abundant in the west (Mt Baw Baw), central (Mt St Phillack) and north-west (Mt Whitelaw) parts of the plateau. There were fewer records from the east region (Mt St Gwinear), and the species was conspicuously absent from the south-east region.

Deterioration of talus and the accumulation of organic matter might allow incursion of Eastern Red-backed Salamander into Shenandoah Salamander habitat. Recent work indicates that human-related factors, including acid deposition (direct effects and vegetation defoliation) and tree defoliation caused by introduced insect pests, such as gypsy moths and woolly adelgids, might be more important threats (draft recovery plan, 1994).

Breeding sites are associated with shallow pools, fens, seepages, wet grassland, and wet heaths. Non-breeding habitat occurs in forest, woodland and heath adjacent to breeding sites. It breeds in shallow pools or seepages. Osborne (1990b) summarised the main features of their reproductive ecology (after Pengilley 1966, 1971, 1973; W.S. Osborne unpubl.). Field measurements (Pengilley 1973) suggest that the species reaches sexual maturity at three years of age (i.e., one year as an embryo/tadpole and two years as a juvenile/sub-adult), which is consistent with observations of captive-reared individuals (Osborne 1990b). It is unlikely that many adults survive for more than one breeding season (Osborne 1990b). Breeding occurs from January to February (Pengilley 1966, 1973; W.S. Osborne unpubl.) and 16-40 eggs (Pengilley 1973) of ovum diameter 3.1-3.6mm (capsule diameter 6.0-10.0mm W.S. Osborne unpubl.) are deposited terrestrially (Pengilley 1966; W. Osborne unpubl.). Tadpoles develop within the egg capsule and hatching occurs when high ground-water levels after rain cause the nest to become flooded (Osborne 1990b). Hatching occurs at four to six months (W.S. Osborne unpubl.) and the tadpole development period is six to eight months (Pengilley 1966, 1973; W.S. Osborne unpubl.). Metamorphosis occurs between December and early February (Pengilley 1966, 1973; W.S.

Osborne, Hunter and Hollis (1999) reviewed some of the possible factors contributing to population declines at high altitudes including long-term weather patterns and pathogens such as the chytrid fungus (Berger, Speare and Hyatt 1999). Chytrid fungus has recently been detected in museum specimens of the Corroboree Frog by R. Speare, although the level of virulence in wild populations is unknown (W.S. Osborne pers. comm.). Planting of exotic trees, such as Willows (<em>Salix</em> spp.), has been widespread in the Snowy Mountains (Osborne 1990b). Although no breeding sites are directly threatened by willow invasion, in the longer-term the spread of willows by vegetative growth along seepages and streams might present a problem for the management of some sites (Osborne 1990b). Excavation by feral pigs has also been identified as a potentially threatening process (Osborne 1990b; W.S. Osborne pers. comm.). The bushfires of 2002/2003 destroyed over 90% of the species' habitat.",The population size in the wild is now believed to number fewer than 250 mature individuals.,Decreasing,"Prior to the detailed survey undertaken by Osborne (1989), there were museum records of <em>P. corroboree</em> from only seven locations, all in the Snowy Mountains of southeastern New South Wales, Australia (Guthega, Smiggin Holes, Happy Jacks Plain, Round Mt., Alpine Hut, Pretty Plain and Tooma Swamp). Osborne (1989) subsequently recorded the species at most of these sites (although was unable to find the species near Guthega and Alpine Hut) in a survey that included 257 potential breeding sites, recording the species at 63 locations. The extent of occurrence of the species was reported to be about 400km² in a relatively narrow band between 1,240 and 1,710m asl (Osborne 1989). Osborne, Hunter and Hollis (1999) surveyed 170 potentially suitable breeding sites across the known historical range of the species and detected <em>P. corroboree</em> still inhabiting 63 sites during the period 1995-1998. However, in this survey only a single individual was found in the southernmost extent of the former range, few extant populations were found along the entire eastern edge of the former distribution and only a single individual was found at low-altitude sites near Tooma Dam in the northern Snowy Mountains.

It hibernates in mud at the bottom of ponds and in spring-water saturated ground up to at least 75m from ponds (Briggs 1987). It prefers quiet ponds for breeding and usually lays eggs in shallow open water. Non-breeding habitats are often more than 100m from breeding sites, sometimes substantially more. Non-breeding habitats can be streams in lower altitudes. It is not clear how adaptable this species is to habitat degradation.","Observed declines in Lassen Volcanic National Park are apparently due to a combination of local factors, including (1) the presence of non-native predatory fish that have restricted available habitat and limited dispersal of frogs; (2) gradual loss of open meadows and associated aquatic habitats; and (3) loss of breeding habitat due to a five-year drought (Fellers and Drost 1993). Pesticide drift via prevailing winds might also have contributed to losses in California (Davidson, Shaffer and Jennings 2002). Introduced fish are implicated as limiting distribution in montane areas (Hayes and Jennings 1986; Jennings and Hayes 1994; Adams, Schindler and Bury 2001). UV radiation shows negative effects in experimental settings, but effects at landscape scale are unclear (Adams, Schindler and Bury 2001; Palen <em>et al.</em> 2002).

An examination of preserved specimens from a 1970 die-off found multiple pathogens, but no single pathogen was present in more than 25% of the specimens, suggesting that the animals suffered from suppressed immune systems (Green and Kagarise Sherman 2001). Davidson, Shaffer and Jennings (2002) found a weak pattern between declines at sites and amount of agricultural land upwind (suggesting that windborne agrochemicals may have contributed to declines). Livestock grazing may have detrimental impacts on Yosemite Toads through trampling, alteration of meadow habitat, and possible lowered water quality (D. Martin pers. comm.). Other factors that may have contributed to declines are the 1980s California drought, and predation by introduced trout.

It breeds in bog pools at high altitudes (above 1,400m asl) and in shallow seepage pools in gullies at lower altitudes (1,000-1,400m asl) (Osborne 1990a). Osborne (1990a) summarized the main features of the reproductive ecology of this species (after Pengilley 1966, 1971, 1973; W. Osborne unpubl.). Field measurements (Pengilley 1973) suggest that the species reaches sexual maturity at three years of age (i.e. one year as an embryo/larva and two years as a juvenile/sub-adult), which is consistent with observations of captive-reared individuals (Osborne 1990a). It is unlikely that many adults survive for more than one breeding season (Osborne 1990a). Breeding occurs from January to March (Pengilley 1966, 1973; W. Osborne unpubl..) and 16-40 eggs (Pengilley 1973) of ovum diameter 3.1-3.6mm (capsule diameter 6.0-10.0mm, W. Osborne unpubl.) are deposited terrestrially (Pengilley 1966; W. Osborne unpubl.). Larvae develop within the egg capsule and hatching occurs when high ground-water levels after rain cause the nest to become flooded (Osborne 1990a). Hatching occurs at 4-6 months (W. Osborne unpubl.) and the larval development period is 6-8 months (Pengilley 1966, 1973; W. Osborne unpubl.). Metamorphosis occurs between December and early February (Pengilley 1966, 1973; W. Osborne unpubl.).","The Northern Corroboree Frog is one of a number of Australian alpine amphibian species that have experienced pronounced population declines for unknown reasons (Osborne, Hunter and Hollis 1999). There is no single aspect of the field biology of these species that stands out as a feature in common that may help explain the declines (Osborne, Hunter and Hollis 1999). Osborne, Hunter and Hollis (1999) reviewed some of the possible factors contributing to population declines at high altitudes including long-term weather patterns and pathogens such as the chytrid fungus (Berger, Speare and Hyatt 1999). Chytrid fungus has recently been detected in some museum specimens by R. Speare (W. Osborne pers. comm.). Management of Buccleuch State Forest in the northern Fiery Range and exotic conifer plantations, which cover a considerable extent of the northern part of the region, is also a concern (Osborne 1990a). Osborne (1990b) noted that invasive exotic plant species occurred at a number of breeding sites in the Fiery Range and northern Brindabella Range. The two most prominent species in terms of their potential to cover large areas of breeding habitat were Blackberry <em>Rubus fruticosus</em> and Monkey Musk <em>Mimulus moschatus</em>. Blackberry has the potential to completely smother and shade breeding habitat rendering it unsuitable for frogs. In contrast, Monkey Musk, a short, broad-leafed herb, forms dense patches in seepages where it often occurs with a similar-sized native species, <em>Gratiola latifolia</em>. Breeding was observed in areas with Monkey Musk and it is not known if it has any detrimental affect. Excavation by feral pigs and trampling by horses have also been identified as potentially threatening processes for the species (Osborne 1990a; W. Osborne pers. comm.).","Between 1994 and 1998, restricted surveys were undertaken (mainly along vehicle tracks) throughout the known range in the Fiery Range and Mount Bogong. More extensive surveys were conducted in the Brindabella Range and Bimberi Range (Osborne and Hunter unpubl.). The species was still relatively abundant and widespread in the Fiery Range; however, it was not found in the Yarrangobilly-Peppercorn Hill area where it was previously recorded by Pengilley (1966) and Osborne (1989). It was found at breeding sites (often remote from each other) throughout suitable parts of the Brindabella and Bimberi Range, both in the Australian Capital Territory and contiguous areas of New South Wales (Osborne, Hunter and Hollis 1999). The numbers present at breeding sites in the region were considerably lower than was recorded by Osborne (1989 and unpubl.). Long-term monitoring was only undertaken in the Brindabella Range. Only one population, Ginini Flats-a sub-alpine site (1,600m asl) in the Australian Capital Territory was subject to annual monitoring. Numbers present at Ginini Flats declined substantially during the first few years of monitoring and have remained low ever since. Less-regular monitoring was undertaken at Coree Flats (980m asl) in New South Wales. By contrast, the Coree Flats population has supported a larger number of calling males (at least during the years the survey was carried out). However, monitoring at Coree Flats commenced after a major drop in numbers had occurred at other sites. Earlier collecting and observations by Pengilley (1966 and pers. comm.) at this site indicated that the population was very large (perhaps over 500 individuals). The low numbers detected in 1998 are likely to be a direct response to the extreme drought conditions prevailing during the breeding season. The Northern Corroboree Frog has declined at higher altitudes (above 1,400m asl) but remains common at montane altitudes in the Fiery Range (Osborne, Hunter and Hollis 1999). The species is known from Namadgi National Park (Australian Capital Territory), Kosciuszko National Park (New South Wales) and Buccleuch State Forest.",Decreasing,"Examination of museum records indicate that this species, an Australian endemic (recorded at the time as the northern form of the Corroboree Frog <em>Pseudophryne corroboree</em>; see Pengilley 1966; Osborne, Zentelis and Lau 1996) was most frequently collected in the Brindabella and Bimberi Ranges near Canberra. Specimens were examined from Snowy Flats, Ginini Flats, Bulls Head, Lees Spring, Coree Flats, California Flats and Hume Sawmill. Osborne (1989) found that the species was still present at most of these sites, but was unable to find frogs in the vicinity of Hume Sawmill at the northern extremity of its range. Osborne (1989) also found the species to be widely distributed and common throughout the Fiery Range and Mount Bogong. This species occurs in two allopatric populations (Osborne 1989): the Fiery Range population occurs from Yarrangobilly to Buccleuch State Forest at 960-1,520m asl (Osborne 1989), while the Brindabella Range population occupies only 60km² from California Flats to Mount Bimberi at 1,090-1,840m asl (Osborne 1989).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),It is listed as endangered in Australian legislation.

Plunge pools in canyons with low mean flows (<0.2 cubic feet per second) and relatively steep gradients (>60m per km of stream) provide the best breeding sites (Hale and May 1983, Hale 2001). Permanent water is necessary for metamorphosis.

Airborne pollutants from copper smelters might have been responsible for toxic levels of cadmium in streams inhabited by Tarahumara Frogs (Hale and Jarchow 1988); however, frogs found during die-offs exhibited symptoms that are now associated with chytridiomycosis, a fungal disease known to affect amphibians globally. Histology of frogs collected during die-offs in Arizona and Sonora from 1974-1999 revealed the presence of chytrids (Hale 2001, Rorabaugh and Hale 2005, T.R. Jones and P.J. Fernandez pers. comm.). Cold weather can be a contributing factor in mortality (Hale and Jarchow 1988) and might be associated with chytridiomycosis-related mortality (Hale 2001). Other threats include introduced predatory fishes (e.g. green sunfish and bluegill) and bullfrogs (Hale and Jarchow 1988). The Tarahumara Frog is now apparently replaced by the bullfrog in the Pena Blanca area in Arizona (Clarkson and Rorabaugh 1989). Poor agricultural practices at Arroyo El Cobre in southern Sonora resulted in erosion from slopes and sedimentation of pools inhabited by the Tarahumara Frog.

This species is listed Vulnerable under A3cde because a population reduction of 30% is suspected for the next three generations (15 years), and there is no perspective of cessation of the impacts that are causing this reduction. This suspected decline is caused by edge effects in the small forest remnants occupied by the species, poaching, predation by domestic dogs, agrochemicals and diseases acquired from domestic ungulates.","Recent and historical data suggest that <em>Mazama nana</em> is associated to the Araucaria moist forests (Mixed Ombrophilous Forest) and its ecotones with the adjacent ecoregions: Paraná-Paraíba interior forests (Semideciduous Seasonal Forests); Serra do Mar coastal forests (Ombrophilous Dense Forest) and Cerrado (Abril <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Some authors mention its preference for mountainous habitats (Cabrera and Yepes 1960, Duarte 1996, Di Bitetti <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008), but presence in plain and soft hilly landforms is common throughout its distribution.<br/><br/>Brazilian Dwarf Brocket is sympatric with other <em>Mazama </em>species, at least along its ecotonal areas. In Paraguay, Argentina and the western parts of Brazil, this species appears to be partially segregated of <em>M. americana</em> by using habitats with dense lower strata, abundant bamboo understory and secondary growth forests (Chebez and Varela 2001, Vogliotti 2008).<br/><br/>There is no specific information about its spatial, behavioural or feeding ecology, which are probably similar to the general pattern of <em>Mazama</em>, including: nocturnal, solitary, territorial and sedentary habits on small home ranges (Abril <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Small subpopulations still persists in forest remnants among agricultural landscapes where they are subject to population decline, extinction and recolonization processes. Non-invasive studies using faecal DNA markers are in course to access initial information on population ecology of <em>M. nana</em> in protected or fragmented areas in Brazil.","In spite of all the uncertainties in ecological and biological aspects, it is the most threatened deer of Brazil and possibly of the Neotropical region. The subpopulation isolation caused by habitat loss in the past must be the main threat to the maintenance of the remaining subpopulations at the present time. The fragmentation tends to increase pressures, such as hunting, predation by dogs, exposure to the diseases of domestic species, and the progressive degradation of small forest fragments (edge effects; Galindo- Leal and De Gusmão Câmara 2003). Cytogenetic analysis of this species found extensive intraspecific chromosome polymorphism that could affect the reproductive efficiency and population sustainability (Abril and Duarte&#160;2008). In Paraguay, the subpopulations are also threatened due to loss of habitat (J.L. Cartes pers. comm.). One of the major conservation problems is hunting, mainly in the provincial parks and private forests. Moreover, the construction of roads has increased the number of road-kills and this could be affecting the subpopulations.","There is no precise information on the population size in any of the areas where it has been observed nor on the degree of connectivity between them, but it is likely that its subpopulations are decreasing due to the decline of the moist lowland forests within its range. Although it seems to be tolerant to fragmented and secondary forest formations, it is likely that its subpopulations are declining or will be declining due to issues including feral dogs, hunting and ruminant diseases that are boosted by the fragmentation process.",Unknown,"Known from a small sample of specimens in museums, this species was formerly included within the Little Dwarf Brocket,<em> Mazama rufina</em> (Redford and Eisenberg 1992).

This would explain the recent records in the east of Parana and Santa Catarina (Montane Forest and Submontane Ombrophilous Dense Forest; Margarido and Braga 2004, J.M.B.

It also hibernates underground or in rotting logs. In some areas it can be found in caves in (e.g. West Virginia) (Green and Pauley 1987). Eggs are attached to sticks and plant stems in ponds and pools with adjacent deciduous or mixed upland forest. Presence of fishes and newts reduces reproductive success. It is not found in floodplains, swamps or marshes in New Jersey (Nyman <em>et al.</em> 1988). In central Pennsylvania, embryonic mortality was high in ponds below pH 4.5, though this was affected by the availability of other larval amphibians as prey (Sadinski and Dunson 1992).&#160;Courtship and egg deposition, which occurs in early spring, may occur under the ice of vernal pools. Females deposit several egg masses on sticks or emergent vegetation. The duration of egg and larval development is variable and temperature-dependent. Carnivorous larvae normally transform in July or early August and leave the pond (COSEWIC 2010).","It is vulnerable to detrimental alteration of vernal pool breeding sites, especially as a result of residential development. Threats to local populations probably include intensive timber harvesting practices that reduce canopy closure, understory vegetation, uncompacted forest litter, or coarse woody debris (moderately to well-decayed) in areas surrounding breeding sites (deMaynadier and Hunter 1999). Some local populations incur heavy road mortality during migrations to and from breeding sites (Klemens 1993). Increased acid deposition is a potential threat.","Estimation of&#160;<em>A. jeffersonianum&#160;</em>population size<em>&#160;</em>is difficult due to the presence of morphologically similar unisexuals which share their habitat.

Furthermore, at some sites where both&#160;<em>A. jeffersonianum&#160;</em>and unisexuals did still exist in 2003-04, there was a notable reduction in the number of egg masses compared to numbers found in the earlier surveys (COSEWIC 2010).",Stable,"This species' range was mapped by Conant and Collins (1991) as encompassing an area in the USA from southeastern New York through Pennsylvania and eastern and southern Ohio to southern Indiana, and southward to south-central Kentucky and northern Virginia, with an extensive area of hybridisation with <em>A. </em><em>laterale</em> northward of this range to eastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, Upper Peninsula of Michigan, southern Ontario, southern Quebec, and eastward to Nova Scotia.

The core of the range of pure <em>A. </em><em>jeffersonianum</em> populations likely extends from Pennsylvania southwestward to Kentucky. The <em>jeffersonianum</em> genome is widely distributed in eastern North America but exists primarily in hybrids (Bogart and Klemens 1997). Individuals that have solely the <em>A. </em><em>jeffersonianum</em> genome occur in many hybridised populations. Although Klemens (1993) mapped distinct ranges for <em>A. jeffersonianum</em> and <em>A. </em><em>laterale</em> in Connecticut and adjacent regions, he included in the range of each species populations that were dominated by the pertinent genome, including hybrids. Data presented by Bogart and Klemens (1997) indicate that the few populations in New England and New York represented by only the <em>A. </em><em>jeffersonianum</em> genome had sample sizes of only 1-3 individuals, so these actually might have been hybrid populations. Phillips (1991) extended the range of <em>A. </em><em>jeffersonianum</em> into east central Illinois, based on one juvenile raised from a larva, but since only one specimen was examined (and he did not indicate what identification criteria were used), it is unclear whether or not the population represents pure <em>A. </em><em>jeffersonianum</em> or a hybrid population.

In New York, distribution apparently is influenced by soil pH (Wyman 1988). Eggs are usually attached to submerged stems or other objects in vernal pools and semi permanent or permanent ponds in or adjacent to forest. In many areas, the species breeds mainly in ponds inaccessible to predatory fishes; however on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the southeastern USA, spotted salamanders breed in sloughs or backwater lowland areas along streams that frequently contain or are easily colonized by predatory fishes that opportunistically feed on amphibian larvae (Semlitsch 1988). Eggs may be laid in ponds when they are ice-covered if salamanders already are present in the pond (States <em>et al.</em> 1988). Egg masses often exhibit an aggregated dispersion pattern.","Threats to local sub-populations include intensive timber harvesting practices that reduce canopy closure, understorey vegetation, uncompacted forest litter, or coarse woody debris (moderately to well-decayed) in areas surrounding breeding sites (deMaynadier and Hunter 1999). Negative impacts of intensive timber harvesting extend at least 25-35 m into uncut forest (deMaynadier and Hunter 1998). Many sub-populations are becoming increasingly isolated as deforestation and loss of vernal pools reduce gene flow among demes (Petranka 1998). This might result in inbreeding depression and reduce the probability of re-establishment of extirpated sub-populations. Local sub-populations might be heavily impacted by excessive mortality of adults caused by vehicles on roads near breeding sites. Roads negatively impact salamander abundance in roadside habitat and might serve as partial barriers to movement (deMaynadier and Hunter 2000). Embryo mortality generally decreases as pH deceases below 6.0, though in some areas successful reproduction has occurred at a relatively low pH (Cook 1983, Blem and Blem 1989). In central Pennsylvania, low pH was associated with deleterious sub lethal effects on larvae (Sadinski and Dunson 1992). High concentrations of various chemical elements, unfavourable temperatures, or low oxygen content might result in reproductive failure; see Blem and Blem (1991) and Albers and Prouty (1987). De-icing salts that contaminate roadside vernal pools result in reduced embryonic survival (Turtle 2000).","Total adult population size is unknown but is very large, surely greater than 100,000 and probably exceeds 1,000,000.

Water temperature in the streams range between 16.9–18.6 degrees C (17.8 ± 0.5 degrees C) and the depth of water varies from 40–80 cm. Individuals have been commonly observed on the moss-covered boulders by, next to, and in streams. Most boulders have accumulated leaf litter on the surface, under which individuals and amplectant pairs have been found (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). All juveniles were observed near stream banks covered with leaf litter and gravel. All other individuals were found on the land within ~1-2 m of water. Of the males observed, 89% were found on boulders (2–4 m circumference, 30–50 cm above the water level) in mid-stream (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). When disturbed, individuals of this species dive into the streams and retreat into submerged rocky crevices, remaining underwater up to 15–25 minutes without emerging. Ten pairs in amplexus have also been found underwater, but no details of egg laying and development have been noted (Gabadage&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It is expected to breed in streams by larval development,&#160;as with its congeners.&#160;This species is not likely to tolerate habitat disturbance (Sri Lanka Red List Assessment Workshop February 2020).","Within the Peak Wilderness Nature Reserve, Sripada Peak is a place of worship of all religions in the country of Sri Lanka, with millions of visitors, especially during the six-month-long peak tourism season. During this time, a large amount of garbage collects, light pollution increases, and the forest is exploited (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em> 2013). A stream at one of the popular tourist sites, 'Seethagagula', has been blocked in one place by a private company, and the water has been diverted to an artificial tank to facilitate a place for visitors to bathe (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020).&#160;Downstream from this site large amounts of domestic chemicals (e.g., shampoo) are being disposed of in the stream, and it is suspected that this could negatively impact amphibian populations given that large aggregations of tadpoles (not of this species) were observed at higher elevations of the same stream, but in areas below the polluted site low densities or no individuals were observed (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. February 2020). Furthermore, during the dry season the reduced volume of water in the stream may lead to greater concentrations of chemicals in the breeding pools (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm.

This area is becoming markedly drier and more seasonal. From an annual average rainfall of about 2,500 mm of rain a century ago, the highlands now receive around 1,900 mm, and years with less than 1,500 are increasingly common (De Silva and Sonnadara 2016).&#160; This reduction in rainfall occurs largely during the first intermonsoon in March-April, extending the duration of the usual December-February dry period. There has been a decline in rainfall of about 4 mm per year during the first intermonsoon and southwest monsoon over the past century, with a lesser decrease of 0.5 mm per year during the northeast monsoon. Additionally, the percentage of wet days during the southwest monsoon has decreased from 59% to 47% over the past century (Thavakaran <em>et al.</em> 2019). Added to changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is the fact that the climate is also warming, with average annual temperatures rise of about 0.8° C across the country over the past century, and temperature in the highlands rise by about 1.1° C (De Costa 2008).&#160; These factors combine to increase the risk of forest fires (natural fires are unknown in rainforests).&#160;<span><br/><span><br/><span id=""docs-internal-guid-a6ef881a-7fff-ab3c-8644-7da02d2b74d6"">Forest dieback could be an additional threat to this species.

Gunawardena<em> </em><em>et al</em>. (1998) and Jayalal<em> et al.</em> (2017) suggest that high acidity in mist- and rain-water may present a significant risk to the highland biota in Sri Lanka. While there is no direct evidence to date (see Silva <em>et al.</em> 2019) that amphibians are negatively affected; it is thought to be a threat for species that inhabit areas where mist persists for long periods, and for species found in open habitats with aquatic life history stages in shallow lentic habitats (M.

Occurring in the Agua Dulce, which is located within the course of the Sonoyta River, it is a section of approximately 3 km and is characterized by the outcrop of waters due to a basement of rocks, forcing underground water to the flow at the surface and creating conditions of an oasis in the desert (Ramsar Secretariat, Site No.1813, 2000).&#160;Agua Dulce looks like an extensive riparian vegetation corridor typical of this type of environment within the Sonoran Desert.

Its original habitat was probably marshes and flood plain pools along the lower Colorado River and springs throughout the Salton Sink (Lee <em>et al</em>. 1980, Moyle 2002, Page and Burr 2011). This fish tolerates low oxygen levels, high temperatures, and high salinity. Males establish small territories prior to spawning, usually in water less than 1 meter deep (sometimes deeper). Eggs are laid on substrate of sand, mud, or perhaps preferentially on algal mat (Schoenherr 1988).<br/><br/>Most re-established populations are in human-constructed environments (USFWS 2010).","Populations are now drastically reduced due to marsh drainage, groundwater mining, deforestation, overgrazing, agricultural use of water, dam building, real estate development, encroachment by non-native vegetation such as <em>Tamarix </em>(Schoenherr 1988), pesticide blowover, and perhaps most importantly, introduction of exotic predators and competitors (especially <em>Tilapia zilli</em>, <em>Oreochromis </em>spp., and mosquitofish).<br/><br/>Threats identified at the time of listing and in the recovery plan continue unabated. New non-native aquatic species continue to establish within the Desert Pupfish's range, and previously existing nonnative species increase in numbers and distribution (Minckley and Marsh 2009). Human demands for water are unending, with the Salton Sea and Lower Colorado River suffering water level declines and the associated threats to the Desert Pupfish from water depletion, such as habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat quality still ongoing. Water availability to the Desert Pupfish will continue to interact with predicted trends for warmer, drier, and more extreme hydrological conditions associated with climate change (USFWS 2010).<br/><br/>This species is relatively intolerant of competition and predation; it is easily displaced by introduced fishes. It is tolerant of a limited amount of nondestructive intrusion (e.g. swimming), but reproduction can easily be disrupted.","This species is represented by 4 naturally occurring metapopulations in 11 known locations (USFWS 2010). However, only one naturally occurring population (San Felipe Creek, California) is relatively secure (USFWS 2010). About 16 transplanted populations exist in the wild (all in Arizona); the number fluctuates with establishment and failure of populations (Moyle 2002). Long-term viability of these populations is uncertain (USFWS 2010).<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but presumably exceeds 1,000,000; the population at Cerro Prieto is apparently large.

Hendrickson and Varela (1989) estimated that about 95% of the habitat has been lost in the past century. Present historical range represents only a small, peripheral, and fragmented portion of the species' former distribution within the lower Colorado and Gila River systems (USFWS 2010). The populations in and around the Salton Sea irrigation drains and shoreline pools wax and wane over time (Martin and Saiki 2005).<br/><br/>The population as a whole is presently stable in terms of distribution, though it is still small, disjunct, and vulnerable to stochastic events that could result in local extirpations; local populations may be far more variable due to a variety of factors such as amount of habitat, presence of nonnative species, and other threats (USFWS 2010).",Decreasing,"Historical range included the lower Colorado and Gila river drainages, southern Arizona to southeastern California, and the Salton Sea and Laguna Salada basins, California and Mexico (Minckley and Marsh 2009).

It appears to be associated with permanent waterbodies though it is unclear whether, like <em>Litoria aurea</em>, the species also utilizes ephemeral pools (Mahony 1999). It occurs both in woodland and areas of improved pasture (Gillespie&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). Little is known about the biology of this species; however, it is likely to be similar to that of <em>L. aurea</em> (Gillespie&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995). Males call from August to April (Hero <em>et al.</em> 1991). The species breeds in permanent ponds or swamps, usually with extensive areas of sedges and rushes from which adults call (Gillespie&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995).

Investigations of disappearances among the group have primarily focused on <em>L. aurea</em> and <em>L. castanea</em> and two major directions in research have been pursued: the role of increased ultraviolet radiation; and the impact of the introduced fish, <em>Gambusia</em> (Mahony 1999). As for <em>L. aurea</em>, <em>L. raniformis</em> has disappeared from sites where <em>Gambusia</em> is present (Mahony 1999, W. Osborne pers. comm.). The dates of introduction of <em>Gambusia</em> to many regions are not well documented and this lack of information has hampered research into declines (Mahony 1999). Introduced <em>Gambusia</em> fish are also a threat to the introduced populations in New Zealand. It is also possible that disease, such as a viral infection or chytrid fungus, may have contributed to the decline of some species (W. Osborne pers. comm.). Chytrid fungus was detected in this species in Mount Compass, South Australia, but was first identified in New Zealand from populations of this species in Christchurch. The drainage of wetlands in Tasmania is a particular threat.","It was once a common species, but serious declines have occurred in sections of the range (Mahony 1999). Ehmann and White (1997) noted that in New South Wales the species had disappeared from sites in the central and southern highlands. It is currently widespread throughout the Murray River valley but has disappeared from a number of sites along the Murrumbidgee River (Mahony 1999) and there are no recent records from the Monaro District near the Victorian border (G.

121745669,712,Ailuropoda melanoleuca,Vulnerable,C2a(i); D1,2016,2016-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) produced an estimated range-wide population of 1,864 Giant Pandas, excluding dependent young &lt;1.5 years of age (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although no formal demographic analysis is available, there are demographic data available to enable estimation of age-related population composition (Sichuan Forestry Department 2015): if the population consists of 9.6% cubs, then the total population of Pandas is approximately 2,060. Mature adults are estimated to compose 50.5% of the total population, yielding an estimate of 1,040. Although this estimate does not contain confidence intervals, clearly the lower confidence interval would fall below 1,000 mature individuals, which meets the small population size criteria (D1) for Vulnerable.<br/><br/>Additionally, the species falls under criteria C2. The Panda population is fragmented into subpopulations, each of which contains &lt;1,000 adults (given that the total population is &lt;1,000 adults); however, the size of the largest population is unknown given uncertainty in how much connectivity remains. It appears that at least one distinct populations in the Minshan mountains contains &gt;400 mature individuals (State Forestry Administration 2015), so the species does not meet the criteria for Endangered (EN). The most tentative part of listing under C2 is a continued population decline.<br/><br/>Evidence from a series of range-wide national surveys indicate that the previous population decline has been arrested, and the population has started to increase (State Forestry Administration 2015). Although inconsistencies in data collection methods, analysis, and sampling area make direct comparisons from survey results difficult, population estimates have consistently increased across survey since the Second National Survey conducted during 1985-1988. Initial uncertainties regarding whether modest population increases observed in the Third National Survey (2000-2004) were real warranted maintaining the Endangered status for the Giant Panda in the previous Red List assessment. Recent data from the Fourth National Survey (2011-2014) remove this uncertainty (State Forestry Administration 2015), and it is widely believed that the population has stabilized and has begun to increase in many parts of the range.<br/><br/>An increase in available habitat and an expanding occupied range provide further support for the contention that Panda numbers are increasing. Forest protection and reforestation measures have increased forest cover in China (FAO 2010), and have supported an 11.8% increase in occupied habitat and 6.3% increase in unoccupied but suitable habitat between the Third and Fourth National Surveys (State Forestry Administration 2015). A survey of expert opinion among Giant Panda experts in the IUCN Bear Specialist Group was consistent with the results of the national survey: all believed that the Panda population was stable or increasing and that available habitat was increasing.<br/><br/>Although the population is currently increasing, climate change is predicted to eliminate &gt;35% of the Panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years, and thus the Panda population is projected to decline (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Under this scenario, the species fits the criteria for VU under C2a(i).<br/><br/>Whereas the decision to downlist the Giant Panda to Vulnerable is a positive sign confirming that the Chinese government's efforts to conserve this species are effective, it is critically important that these protective measures are continued and that emerging threats are addressed. The threat of declining bamboo availability due to climate change could, in the near future, reverse the gains made during the last two decades. The Giant Panda will remain a conservation-dependent species for the foreseeable future. The Chinese government's plan to expand existing conservation policy for the species (State Forestry Administration 2015) should receive strong support to ensure its implementation.","A member of the order Carnivora, Giant Pandas have evolved to specialize on a diet of bamboo (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Bamboo is a poor food source, low in protein and high in lignin and cellulose, and wild Giant Pandas can only digest an average of 17% of dry matter and about 27% of hemi-cellulose (Dierenfeld <em>et al.</em> 1982, Schaller <em>et al</em>. 1985). Thus, to meet their daily energy requirement, Giant Pandas must consume a large amount of bamboo, up to 12.5 kg per day, and defecate more than 100 times daily (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Pandas have large, muscular jaws with skeletal features to accommodate the musculature and its famous “pseudothumb” used to hold and manipulate bamboo for processing. However, compared with other herbivores, the Panda has very low digestive efficiency because its digestive tract still resembles that of its carnivorous ancestors. The Panda’s feeding strategy emphasizes volume, requiring it to allocate much of its time to foraging (approximately 14 hours daily).<br/><br/>While morphological and behavioural adaptations provide some compensation for poor digestive efficiency, the Panda’s ability to survive on such a low-quality food source remained mysterious for decades. Even whole-genome sequencing found no specific genes responsible for the digestion of cellulose and hemi-cellulose (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010). An explanation was uncovered in a recent metagenomics study that found the Panda’s gut microbes play an important role in digesting bamboo fibers (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011a). Additional adaptations to poor quality diet are found in the Panda’s extreme strategy of energy conservation, with daily energy expenditure comparable to that of a sloth or reptile (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Pandas demonstrate a suite of adaptations to reduce energy expenditure. The thick pelage conserves energy lost through body heat, and it has long been known that pandas are conservative in movement and physical activity. Smaller than expected organs also are indicative of energy-conservation adaptation, and down-regulation of resting metabolic rate has been achieved through a mutation in the synthesis pathway for thyroid hormones.<br/><br/>Giant Pandas also compensate for digestive inefficiency by selecting the most nutritious parts of bamboo plants and by altering diet selection seasonally commensurate with changes in nutritional profiles of bamboo species (Schaller<em> et al.</em> 1985, Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015b). They demonstrate strong preference for seasonally available new bamboo shoots, rich in nutrition and energy and low in fibre. Outside the late spring bamboo shoot season, Pandas favour leaves, although more stems are incorporated into their diet during the winter months when leaf quality and quantity diminishes. This convergence of foraging strategies across variations in climate, bamboo species, and topographic profile indicates an adaptive strategy that serves the species well. Still, as an energy-limited species that spends more than 50% of its time foraging, Panda numbers may be limited by the availability of high quality bamboo and the time required to process bamboo in the digestive system.<br/><br/>Early coarse-scale radio tracking using VHF transmitters provided foundational data on home range size and documented the solitary nature of the Panda’s existence (Schaller<em> et al</em>. 1985, Yong <em>et al. </em>1994, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). Although Panda home ranges overlap generously, direct encounters between individuals are rare. Seasonal elevational migration has been documented in the Qionglai (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985) and Qinling mountains (Yong <em>et al.</em> 1994, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2002, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). At both sites, the seasonal movements track changes in resources, providing access to bamboo species that provide greater nutritional value. Research integrating behavioural, nutritional, and movement data provide new insights into these seasonal migration patterns, demonstrating that these movements facilitate consumption of higher concentrations and/or a more balanced intake of key nutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Calcium (Ca) (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014). Female-biased dispersal has been demonstrated with genetic data in the Minshan and Liangshan Mountains (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007, Hu <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Fine-scale documentation of |Panda movement behaviour had to await the advent of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Published accounts using high-resolution GPS telemetry revised and added to previous findings (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Hull <em>et al. </em>2015). VHF-based radio tracking inevitably leads to large amounts of missing data when animals at more distant locations are not detected, thus it is unsurprising that GPS tracking substantively revised home range size upwards, and that core area overlap and opportunity for social interactions is now understood to be greater than previously believed. Other interesting phenomena were also detected, such as the documentation of female-biased dispersal (confirmed with genetic data; Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007), and sudden, large movements that temporarily took a female far outside of her home range during the mating season. Fine-scale movement data showed that Pandas exhibited individualistic and multiphasic movement paths within seasonal core habitats and large-scale movements between habitats. Tortuous movement paths indicated when pandas searched for and found foraging resources. Pandas frequently return to the same foraging patches, indicating that they likely have well-developed spatial memory.<br/><br/>Using various measures of habitat suitability, efforts to map Panda habitat have proven valuable for guiding the establishment of the Panda reserve system (Shen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Feng <em>et al.</em> 2009, Qi <em>et al.</em> 2012). Giant Pandas typically occupy temperate montane forests at altitudes of 1,500–3,000 m (Hu and Wei 2004). Range-wide analysis of ecological covariates associated with Panda presence suggested that Giant Pandas are associated with old growth forests, a finding previously unrecognised in studies implemented on smaller spatial scales (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). As an obligate bamboo specialist, the Giant Panda’s reliance on this resource is clear, yet it has usually been ignored in habitat suitability models because mapping bamboo understory using remote sensing techniques is difficult (Linderman<em> et al. </em>2005). Including understory bamboo in habitat models dramatically decreases estimates of available habitat and increases measures of fragmentation. Advances in remote sensing techniques, such as Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), combined with new analytical techniques, such as artificial neural network analysis, have helped remove obstacles to including bamboo understory in maps of habitat suitability (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2009; Viña <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). Enhanced understanding of Panda habitat requirements and improvements in mapping technologies provide managers and policy makers with better tools for conservation decision-making (Loucks <em>et al.</em> 2003, Xu <em>et al.</em> 2006, Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Qi <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>Giant Pandas are a solitary and seasonal-breeding mammal, only coming together during the breeding season, from March to May, for reproductive purposes (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Male Pandas occupy large home ranges overlapping several females and are known to congregate around oestrous females. Male Pandas are able to locate females across large areas, and demonstrate fierce and injurious aggression in competition for access to females. Early in these encounters escalated aggression is common, but, in a possible strategy to conserve energy and minimize risk of injury, once dominance is established, contact aggression is largely replaced with non-contact aggression. Individual males are able to locate and mate with multiple females sequentially, so the mating system might be considered scramble competition polygyny.<br/><br/>Because Pandas live a solitary existence, they must rely heavily on chemosignals to communicate with one another without necessitating face-to-face encounters. Giant Pandas make use of a system of traditional communal scent mark stations that provide them with reliable locations they can visit to deposit signals and investigate signals left by other Pandas (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985). Studies documenting habitat characteristics of preferred marking sites, including tree species and microhabitat (Nie <em>et al. </em>2012a), extend our understanding of habitat requirements for the species. If habitat that promotes communication is not maintained, then poor communication may hinder breeding in the wild, as has been shown for captive Pandas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Denning ecology is an important field of study among ursids, and other species giving birth in dens, because access to adequate dens can be important for offspring survival. Forest management practices that affect the availability of suitable dens can either significantly harm or enhance cub survival (White<em> et al. </em>2001). Ursid young, being extremely altricial, are particularly vulnerable. The Giant Panda lies at the extreme end of this continuum, with the mother weighing nearly 1,000 times the cub’s weight at birth (Gittleman 1994). Den quality may therefore be critical for Pandas. Giant Pandas do not hibernate, but females use rock caves or tree cavities to rear offspring that are produced every 2–3 years (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Zhu <em>et al. </em>2001). Preferred dens are characterized by a small opening to buffer against the elements and provide a warmer and drier environment for rearing offspring (Zhang<em> et al. </em>2007). Dens tend to be located close to water, presumably so the mother can leave the vulnerable cub (almost always a single cub) unattended for a shorter period of time while she drinks. It has also been proposed that tree dens, once more numerous in primary forests before logging converted many forests in Panda habitat to second growth, are a limiting resource for Giant Pandas (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). The importance of this resource may explain why national survey data indicate that pandas are more often found in primary than secondary forest.<br/><br/>It was once believed, and sometimes still mis-stated, that Pandas’ biological deficiencies were responsible for their own decline. Because of early problems with captive breeding, Pandas gained a reputation for having notoriously low levels of interest in mating; however, Pandas in the wild experience no mating problems and have high reproductive rates (Wei and Hu 1994, Pan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Once a better understanding of the biology and behaviour of the species was incorporated into husbandry practices, captive Pandas began to mate naturally and experienced exponential population growth (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2006, Zhang and Wei 2006, Martin-Wintle <em>et al.</em> 2016). Moreover, its well-known specialization on bamboo is not (as once thought) an evolutionary cul de sac, as it opens up a foraging niche with plentiful resources and few competitors (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014). Dietary specialization is often seen as an extinction risk factor, but this may not be the case for the Panda, which specializes on widespread and abundant bamboo. Thus, pandas are well-adapted to their environment and have reproductive rates sufficiently high to explain the recovery of populations once bans on poaching and habitat restoration efforts commenced (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014).","The primary threat facing Giant Panda populations is the continuing effects of previous habitat loss, resulting in highly fragmented habitat and, in many cases small, isolated populations. According to the Fourth National Survey (State Forestry Administration 2015), the Panda population is composed of as many as 33 subpopulations, 18 of which contain fewer than 10 individuals. The extent to which these are demographically separate populations remains uncertain, but this fragmentation certainly increases vulnerability to extinction through environmental and demographic stochasticity and loss of genetic diversity.<br/><br/>Although microsatellite analysis (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Shan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and genomics (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013) have now determined that the Giant Panda has substantial genetic variability, without increased migration and connectivity, many of these smaller populations will have rapidly eroding evolutionary potential. Three genetic clusters have been recognized: the Qinling Mountains population (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007) which diverged ~0.3 million years ago; the Mishan mountains, which diverged ~2,800 years ago into the Mishan and Qionglai populations (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013); and the other four combined populations, including Qionglai, Daxiangling, Xiaoziangling, and Liangshan (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, in this larger cluster, further sub-structuring is manifest (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011b). Population divergence is the product of several operating factors, including climate change, natural barriers, and anthropogenic habitat loss.<br/><br/>Threats associated with edge effects, human disturbance, and small population size are most severe in these small, isolated populations. Increased fragmentation from roads, hydroelectric dams, mining, and other infrastructure projects further threaten Panda populations (State Forestry Administration 2015), but these trends are partially counterbalanced through the successful implementation of ecocompensation programs that curtail some activities such as fuel wood collection (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007) and efforts to increase habitat connectivity between some populations (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Tourism is increasing in some areas and if not managed properly, could negatively impact Panda populations (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2012). Pathogens and parasites may be an emerging problem compromising Giant Panda health and survival, particularly in areas where dogs, livestock, and other domesticated animals may introduce novel pathogens (Qin <em>et al.</em> 2010; Zhang, L. <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2015). Air- or water-borne environmental contaminants may also exert negative impacts on Panda populations, but little is known about their prevalence. Livestock grazing, inside and outside of protected areas, represents another, potentially growing threat (Hull <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wang <em>et al.</em> 2015). It should also be noted that protected status of nature reserves does not always confer protection, and some threats have continued even after Panda reserves were gazetted (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2001). These continuing human activities may have cumulative effects that further degrade Panda habitat.<br/><br/>Pandas' reliance on bamboo as a primary food source puts them at risk during this plant's characteristic mass synchronous flowering and die-off events, which occur at intervals of 15 to 100 years (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1989). Before human expansion confined Pandas to high elevations, Pandas had access to more species of bamboo adapted to different elevation zones. When one bamboo species experienced a die-off, Pandas could easily migrate up or down slope to access a different species that was not affected. Confined to its more limited elevation range today, Pandas are sometimes put at risk of starvation, especially when more than one bamboo species flowers at the same time. Although past bamboo die-off events were alarming and caused starvation and mortalities in Pandas, populations recovered (Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and these population bottlenecks did not compromise genetic diversity (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>These primary threats associated with habitat fragmentation and degradation may be exacerbated by climate change-mediated effects on Panda habitat in the future. Several models indicate significant losses to Giant Panda habitat, with estimates of loss of bamboo habitat ranging from 37% to 100% by the end of the century (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although these models are simplifying and may not adequately account for distributional shifts of bamboo species adapted to lower elevations and southern latitudes to replace current habitat that might be lost (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a), managers should be concerned about large-scale environmental changes facing Panda populations in the future. In addition, climate change may alter the agricultural value of current Giant Panda habitat and bring about intensified human pressure for cultivation. For example, some models indicate that much of Panda habitat will become suitable for viticulture, a high-value crop (Hannah <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Although poaching impacted Pandas in the past (Li <em>et al.</em> 2003), its impact declined rapidly since the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act, which bans poaching and carries severe punishments. However, Pandas may sometimes be caught in snares set for musk deer or other species.","The Giant Panda is the subject of one of the largest, most intensive efforts to estimate population size for an entire species. The Chinese government has carried out four national surveys, approximately every 10 years since 1974. The most recent, the Fourth National Survey conducted from 2011 to 2014, mobilized more than 2,000 people who spent more than 60,000 person-days surveying 4.36 million ha. The population estimates derived from these surveys should be considered rough estimates due to difficulty associated with extrapolating sign survey data to determine the number of individuals. Idiosyncratic feeding styles among individual pandas produce bamboo fragments that vary somewhat distinctively in size (“bite-size”) between individuals and thus provide some information that helps distinguish faeces from different individuals, especially when combined with information about home range size. However, as a population census tool, this method has never been fully validated (Pan<em> et al. </em>2014). Evidence suggests that sign survey data may have under-estimated population size in one reserve (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2006, Wei <em>et al. </em>2012), but it is not known to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other reserves. Although DNA has been extracted from faeces collected during the Fourth National Survey, these data have not yet yielded a population estimate because most of the faeces collected were not sufficiently fresh to provide adequate DNA. Thus, the best available population estimate for the species relies on bite-size analysis.<br/><br/>Another limitation of the national survey data is that the methods have been altered and improved since they commenced in 1974, and the range and effort of the survey have been inconsistent. The same methods were used for the third and fourth national surveys; although survey effort increased in the fourth survey, most of this increase can be attributed to the larger area covered to capture the expanding range that Pandas now occupy. Thus, comparisons between surveys may not be completely valid, but they are still informative. The first survey (1974–1977) produced an estimate of 2,459 pandas, which decreased dramatically in the second survey (1985–1988) to 1,216 individuals. This approximately 50% drop in population size provided the impetus for the 1988 Wildlife Protection act, which banned Panda poaching, and China’s <em>National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat</em>, which established a reserve system for Pandas (Reid and Gong 1999). By the time of the third survey (2000–2004), the population estimate increased to 1,596, indicating that these protective measures may have been successful. However, uncertainties remained due to the inconsistencies in the methods by which the surveys were implemented (as well as a lack of confidence limits on the point estimates). Although these same limitations still apply, the recent fourth survey showed the Panda population increased further to 1,864, removing most remaining uncertainties regarding population trend. Additionally, Pandas have been documented in many areas outside their known range, including an animal shot in 2015 in Yunnan Province, where they have not been recorded for centuries. An increasing population was not surprising, given that available and occupied habitats have increased. <br/><br/>The optimism engendered by these positive trends is dampened by evidence indicating that some Panda populations are decreasing, particularly those found in the smallest and most degraded habitat patches such as Liangshan, Xiangling and Niuweihe. Approximately 223 pandas occupying 23 isolated habitat patches are considered at high risk of local extinction, and will require increased protection and management (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011b; State Forestry Administration 2015).",Increasing,"Once widespread throughout southern China, and as far north as Beijing and south into Southeast Asia, the Panda’s distribution is now confined to its previous western extremity in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Pleistocene range shifts were associated with the disappearance of the Panda’s principal source of food, bamboo, due to warming climate; whereas rapid range contraction in the past several hundred years is attributed to the conversion of bamboo forests to agricultural cultivation and rapid expansion of human populations (Li <em>et al.</em> 2015). The largest populations are currently found in the Minshan, Qinling, Qionglai mountain ranges, and smaller, more isolated populations remain in the Liangshan, Daxiangling, and Xiaoxiangling mountain ranges (State Forestry Administration 2015).<br/><br/>The Giant Panda’s range is highly fragmented, resulting from centuries of human encroachment and loss of forested habitat at lower elevations. Rapidly expanding industrialization, beginning in the early 1900s and accelerating since 1949, is associated with severe contraction of the Panda’s range (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li<em> et al. </em>2015). While they once occupied forests below 1,000 m in elevation, current populations are restricted to mountain ranges, separated by valleys and flatter landscapes that have been altered by human activities. China lost more than 30% of its forests between 1950 and 2004, coinciding with a precipitous drop in Panda populations, but forest cover has increased in the past two decades (FAO 2010).","Although historically the Giant Panda was sometimes hunted for its pelt, law enforcement mechanisms appear to have eliminated this trade.",Terrestrial,"The Giant Panda has been the focus of one of the most intensive, high profile efforts to recover an endangered species. In 1981, China joined the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which made trade of Panda skins illegal. Enactment of the 1988 Wildlife Protection Law banned poaching and conferred protected status to the Giant Panda (listed as Category I, the highest level of protection). The National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat of 1992 laid out a masterplan for Panda conservation and established a Panda reserve system, which today has grown to 67 reserves. Enlarged by more than 50% since the Third National Survey, this reserve system currently protects 67% of the Panda population and nearly 1.4 million hectares of Panda habitat (State Forestry Administration 2015). The biological diversity of these reserves is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems (Mackinnon 2008), thus making the Panda an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on many other sympatric species (Noss 1990).<br/><br/>These efforts to end poaching and protect Panda habitat played a significant role in Panda recovery. The Chinese government also invested in infrastructure and capacity building for reserve staff, established anti-poaching patrol, curtailed human activities inside reserves, and in some cases relocated human settlements from inside to outside of reserves. Other measures directed at broader conservation problems also benefited the Panda. The Natural Forest Conservation Program was implemented in 1997 to reduce the devastating impacts of flooding on human communities due to deforestation and erosion. The program banned logging in most forests in Panda habitat, slowing habitat degradation. Additionally, the Grain-to-Green Program incentivized farmers to plant trees on steep slopes to slow erosion. The result of these policies was the addition of 3 million hectares of forest cover in China annually, an increase of 1.6% per year from 2000 to 2010 (FAO 2010). As a consequence, Panda habitat is recovering and the total occupied habitat has increased by 11.8% between the Third and the Fourth National Surveys; an additional 6.3% increase in suitable but unoccupied habitat was also observed. In the Wolong Nature Reserve, implementation of the Grain-to-Green Program brought about measurable increases in connectivity of Panda habitat (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007). Thus, these habitat conservation policies are associated with increasing Panda population size, increasing range, and better habitat connectivity. Efforts have also commenced to restore habitat corridors (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a) and to reintroduce captive-born pandas to increase genetic diversity in small, isolated populations.<br/><br/>Ecocompensation has been proposed as an important component of a conservation strategy for pandas (Yang <em>et al.</em> 2013, 2015; Liu <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2015; Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2015). Approximately 15% of the remaining unprotected habitat occurs in collectively-owned forests. Payment for ecosystem services, which has already been shown to benefit Panda conservation under the Grain-to-Green Program, could extend conservation measures into these unprotected areas.<br/><br/>Finally, the Giant Panda has been the beneficiary of a massive scientific effort conducted in partnerships between the Chinese government and institutions and international conservation NGOs and zoos (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2010, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a, State Forestry Administration 2015). Once poorly understood, there has been an explosion of scientific studies across many disciplines, and this knowledge has increasingly been applied management and policy decisions. Future directions would benefit from even better coordination between science and policy, and the application of adaptive management principles in which experiments are conducted to evaluate management actions that may increase carrying capacity inside protected areas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a).<br/><br/>China's State Forestry Administration, while rightfully proud of its accomplishments, fully realizes that more work needs to be done to further Panda conservation and to avoid losing ground so painstakingly gained. They plant to continue investing in habitat protection, population monitoring, and protection patrols, and to further develop capacity of reserve staff (State Forestry Administration 2015). They recognize the challenges the future holds, and in particular will seek to address problems of habitat connectivity and population fragmentation.",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It has also, though, been found in secondary woodland and occurs in degraded woodland (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>, including dead juniper habitat. It is shy, elusive and occurs in small parties in dense vegetation (Madge and McGowan 2002)<strong></strong>, hence it is not recorded in dead or dying juniper habitats which are more open (Bealey and Rayaleh 2006)<strong></strong>. The presence of a population in the Mabla Mountains, where juniper is effectively absent, may indicate that habitat structure rather than species composition of woodland may be a key ecological factor (Welch <em>et al. </em>2009a)<strong></strong>. A detailed survey in the Forêt du Day suggested that the presence of closed-canopy forest may be more important to the species than juniper health (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). It feeds on seeds, berries and termites, and also figs from the forest edge (Fuller <em>et al.</em> 2000)<strong></strong>. The breeding season is from December to February (McGowan 1994)<strong></strong>. It is probably monogamous, laying a clutch of 5-7 eggs; the only known nest was a shallow grass-lined depression on an inaccessible mountain ledge (Madge and McGowan 2002)<strong></strong>.  <p></p>","At Forêt du Day, juniper woodland is in poor condition, with virtually all trees dead or dying by now. The reasons for this are unclear, but the high level of grazing by cattle, camels and goats is certainly a problem in much of the woodland, possibly exacerbated by acid rain, climate change and fungal disease (Magin 2001). Most local people (57%) interviewed in the Forêt du Day attribute high juniper mortality to drought (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). A survey in 2007 showed that in areas of high tree cover or poor juniper condition, the presence of <em>P</em><em>. ochropectus</em> was negatively correlated with grazing intensity, especially that of cattle (Fisher <em>et al</em>. 2009). Within 18 months of the restoration of an exclosure, juniper seedlings (which were non-existent elsewhere) were found to be frequent under living juniper trees, suggesting grazing has indeed been the main cause of the decline of the forest (Ford 2008)<strong></strong>. Other concerns include collection of firewood on lower slopes (Magin 2001), hunting, egg harvesting (McGowan <em>et al</em>. 2014) and human disturbance (G. R. and H. J. Welch <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. At Mabla, there are signs of significant human disturbance in the remaining stands of woodland, which have been heavily exploited for firewood and grazing (Magin 2001).

Potential limitations of that study might mean that the population lies in the lower half of the range estimate, i.e. 285-450 individuals. A 2009 survey estimated the size of the Mabla population at 108 individuals.

Anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater.</p><p><a name=""_Hlk31280999"">The IUCN Red List criteria prioritise indices of mature animals at their breeding area. I</a>n the absence of such data for the eel, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of European Eels, leaving ‘continental’ waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of (pre-) spawning stock biomass, but such data sets for migrating silver eel are low in number, spatially limited and only recent (most only since 2010). The index data best representing the geographic range of <em>A. anguilla</em><em>, </em>over adequate time scales to apply the Red List criteria<em>,</em><em> </em>relate to glass eels, but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood (Westerberg <em>et al</em>. 2018). While there are hypotheses that certain regions may have greater importance for the spawning stock (e.g. Dekker, 2004, Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011), evidence is lacking to support such hypotheses and to deviate from the common view that the European Eel is a panmictic species, i.e. all individuals come from a single spawning stock. As such, escapement from a specific river/country/region will not be directly reflected in subsequent recruitment as this relies on the spawning stock as a whole, irrespective of escapement location. Furthermore, it is most precautionary to assume that each and every part of the continental distribution area potentially contributes to the reproductive process, or that each part may be the key part (Dekker 1999). Therefore, the IUCN Red List criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which provides the most comprehensive estimate.</p><p>Yellow and silver eel data for <em>A. anguilla </em>have an uneven geographical spread and do not fully represent the stock across its range. Nevertheless, a cursory analysis of these data found that over three generation lengths (39 years; see Habitat and Ecology), the mean decline in yellow and silver eels was found to be greater than 50% (see Population). Both analyses on yellow and silver eels indicated declines within the range of Endangered (EN) category. <a name=""_Hlk26366036""></a></p><p>Compounding these declines in escapement of maturing eels, are strong correlations between recruit series from sites over the range showing substantial declines during the period of the last three generations (Bornarel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The ICES recruitment index is 98.6% lower in the ‘North Sea’ series, and 94% lower in the ‘Elsewhere’ series, compared to the 1960–1979 reference level (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). It is noted, however, that the most recent statistical analyses conducted on these recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Due to the period of time eels spend feeding and growing prior to silvering and migrating to spawn, the numbers of silver eels may continue to decline, reflecting past declines in recruitment. </p><p>Sampling for leptocephali in the Sargasso Sea was undertaken in 2011, and results compared with previous sampling across the same area occurring in 1983 and 1985 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). The reduction in catch rate was 89% between 1983 and 2011, and 64% between 1985 and 2011 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation indicates a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding grounds over this time period, suggesting a lower abundance of spawners, higher egg and/or larval mortality and/or a reduction in spawning success. Thus, data on leptocephali and recruits to continental waters indicate declines within the range of Critically Endangered (CR). </p><p>A suite of threats have been implicated in the decline of European Eel recruitment and stock: barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines and pumps; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly&#160;<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>); exploitation of glass, yellow and silver eels; changing hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation.&#160;The significance of these threats individually or synergistically may vary across spatial range of the eel. Further research is required to fully quantify and understand the complexities of individual and combined threats.</p><p>Eel Management Plans (EMPs) have been developed in European Union Member States after implementation of the EU Council Regulation No 1100/2007 relating to the recovery of the European Eel (EU 2007). The Regulation set the objective of each EMP to be to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock” (EU 2007), and that EMPs would be prepared with the purpose of achieving this objective in the long term. </p><p>A number of management measures are being implemented in line with EMPs,&#160;including control of fisheries, bypassing turbines and pumps, easing of barriers and restocking - transfer of eel from one watershed to another. Quantifying the effects of these measures on silver eel escapement biomass is complicated in many cases because (i) measures are not implemented in isolation, making it difficult to identify individual contributions, and (ii) measures affecting earlier life stages will take years to influence silver eels, and ultimately spawning stock. There remains a great deal of debate as to whether restocking benefits the eel spawning stock and thus enhances future recruitment. Regulations and management actions currently focus on increasing escapement from continental waters, although these do not take account of eel condition or quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). &#160;&#160;</p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). It was concluded that the Regulation has been important in catalysing activity towards the recovery of the European Eel and remains a relevant document (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). However, despite progress, the eel remains in a critical condition and recovery could take decades, and further ambition is required (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>).</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2007,&#160;&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;was listed in Appendix II of CITES (the&#160;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species&#160;of Wild Fauna and Flora)&#160;due to concerns over the impact of international trade on this species (this listing came into force in March 2009).&#160;In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded it was not possible to perform a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF) for this species (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). Exports out of, and imports into, the European Union (EU), have since ceased due to ongoing concerns over the decline in recruitment and stocks. However, trade continues within the EU and from non-EU countries within its range to other non-EU countries. In 2014, <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> was also listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).</p><p>The limited understanding of the complex relationship between recruitment, growth phase, and escapement makes it difficult to determine how declines in one will affect the other. However, it has been concluded that low recruitment will very likely ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement for, at least one generation length (13 years; see Habitat and Ecology). Further, since there is a short time period (~two years) between spawning and subsequent glass eel abundance, low recruitment has been proposed to be indicative of low breeding stock. As such it was deemed appropriate to assign&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;a Critically Endangered (CR) listing under current observations and future projected reductions of mature individuals (A2bd+4bd).</p><p>This category status remains unchanged from the previous assessment. Ultimately the CR category accounts for a proportional decline in population over a continental scale and this species has undergone a substantial decline over the last three generations. Although implementation of management measures has shown improvement, there is still concern over the effectiveness of EMPs to generate recovery to historic reference state within an appropriate timeframe, in the context of multiple threats (European Commission 2020). Continued, and ideally increased, effort will be essential in promoting recovery. A drive to fill data gaps – particularly in relation to the southern range of this species – would allow a more spatially comprehensive assessment in the future. </p><p>                          </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from the 5<sup>th</sup>–9<sup>th</sup> November 2018.</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach continental waters, before developing into pigmented elvers and then the growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.</p><p><strong>Habitat:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is found in a range of habitats from small streams to large rivers and lakes, and in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters (ICES 2015). It also occupies open ocean areas during migrations but is rarely observed in this habitat. Under natural conditions, it only occurs in water bodies that are connected to the sea; it is stocked elsewhere.<br/> <br/> <strong>Ecology:</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The species is facultatively catadromous, living in fresh, brackish and coastal waters but migrating to pelagic marine waters to breed (Tsukamoto <em>et al. </em>1998, Tzeng <em>et al</em>. 2000). While there is some understanding of the eel’s continental life history, relatively little is known about its marine phase. The migrations in the European Eel’s life cycle are the longest and most oceanographically complex of the Anguillid species (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2002). </p><p>There are no exact data about specific spawning sites, however, it is hypothesised that spawning takes place in an elliptic zone, about 2,000 km wide in the Sargasso Sea, in the West Central Atlantic (from 70° W and eastward to 50° W) (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2019). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). The adults are assumed to die after spawning (Tesch 2003). Oceanic migration of leptocephali is estimated to take about two years on average before they arrive at the continental shelf (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The mechanisms by which leptocephali reach the European and N. African coasts are not well understood. In the Atlantic region, recruitment has been found to follow a South to North gradient over a period of around four to five months (ICES 2020). This starts in September in the North-West and occurs progressively later in the Channel and North Sea (ICES 2020). Recruitment to the Mediterranean is slightly more complex, publications suggest most eel ascent occurs between December and March, and landings suggest a peak in January. Although in some areas, recruitment occur over a wider period, even year-round (ICES 2020). <br/> <br/> Glass eels enter freshwater as sexually undifferentiated individuals. Development and differentiation of the sexual organs are thought to be closely correlated with body size and associated with the yellowing phase of the life history. Sex determination is principally driven by environmental factors with density-dependence producing more males at high densities (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Male European eels initially grow faster than females, however, females achieve a greater age and size than males when sexually mature. Furthermore, the mean length increases significantly with latitude in females but not males, whereas age increases significantly in both (Durif <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. Aprahamian unpub. data). Male fitness is maximised by maturing at the smallest size that allows a successful spawning migration (a time minimising strategy) such that males tend to emigrate at a length of &lt;450 mm (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Conversely, females adopt a more flexible size-maximising strategy prior to migration that trades off pre-reproductive mortality against fecundity (Davey and Jellyman 2005). There is considerable geographic variation in mean length at metamorphosis of male and female European eels (Vøllestad 1992). Dekker <em>et al</em>. (1998) described the extreme sizes in each of the life stages of the European eel from data at a long-term capture locality in the Netherlands, this paper also discussed the international situation, finding no more extreme values (sizes (cm): Min–Max, glass eels: 5.4–9.2, yellow: 6.9–133.0, silver (Male): 21.2–44.4, Silver (Female): 26.4–101.0). Driven by density-dependence, there are often skewed sex ratios at individual localities as well as geographic bias associated with latitude.<br/> <br/> Eel growth increases with temperature, as documented in aquaculture (Sadler 1979, Dosoretz and Degani 1987, Holmgren 1996, Ciccotti and Fontenelle 2001), and growth rate is generally faster in saline water than fresh (Acou <em>et al</em>. 2003, Daverat and Tomas 2006, Cairns <em>et al</em>. 2009). Furthermore, those individuals produced in saline waters usually have significantly higher fat content and contain lower loads of the swim bladder parasite, <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> and thus may have improved chances of reaching their spawning grounds (ICES 2009, Marohn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Body burden of toxic compounds, that are thought to affect migration and reproductive success, are also variable over regions and river basins, dependent on local pollution pressure (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016). During the growth phase, dependent on size, eels feed on a variety of organisms including fish, amphipods and decapod crustaceans. In saline muddy-bottomed habitats, eels forage on bivalves, shrimp, small fish and polychaete worms. The tendency towards piscivory has been linked to eel length: there is evidence that eels &gt;40 cm have the ability to consume larger prey such as fish or crustaceans (Moriarty 1974, Mann and Blackburn 1991, Yalçın-Özdilek and Solak 2007). Lammens <em>et al</em>. (1985) observed periods of low chironomid biomass to be a factor resulting in eels switching to prey on fish. In a comparison of two lakes in Germany, piscivory in eels was also concluded to be controlled by macrozoobenthos density (Dörner <em>et al</em>. 2009). </p><p>      </p><p>The age at which eels undergo the transformation to the silver stage and undertake their spawning migration, is hugely variable and dependent on latitude and temperature of the environment in which they have grown, food availability, physical barriers that block migration routes, growth rate and sex differences. Estimates for average ranges of the continental growth phase were suggested as approximately 2–15 years for males and 4–20 years for females (Tesch 2003) – noting that much older individual eels occur especially in the latter. Durif <em>et al</em> (2009) examined a number of data sets from across the species range in relation to age at silvering which indicated a range of 2 to 15 years for males and 2 to 30 years for females. From these ranges, an estimated generation length of 13 years was used for this assessment, inclusive of a two-year larval migration and one-year spawning migration of silver eels (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016). It has however been stated that there is variability in the accuracy of the methods used to age eels (ICES 2015). Assessment of available data on generation length during the IUCN Red List process highlighted that defining the required single generation length value for species with a broad range of ages-at-maturation such as eels was extremely difficult. Factors that can significantly affect this parameter include longitude and latitude, sex, growth rates, habitat quality and resource availability.&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is susceptible to a number of natural and anthropogenic threats. These threats include but are not limited to; barriers to migration, climate change, habitat loss/degradation, invasive species, parasitism, pollution, predation and unsustainable exploitation (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). The occurrence and significance of these threats varies considerably from area to area across the species range. The significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood (Dekker 2004, Jacoby <em>et al. </em>2015, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is therefore important to highlight that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures (listed below), are less likely to have a significant positive effect on the stock than a combined approach. </p><p>There is a significant body of information including a great deal of contradiction in peer-reviewed and grey literature, and in expert opinion, relating to these threats. The assessment process and accompanying external review indicated that a comprehensive discussion of these threats and their impacts was significantly beyond the scope of this assessment. Below, all suspected threats are listed (in alphabetical order), with some (but not all) key references and a very brief synopsis of these threats. This is by no means comprehensive and does not attempt to fully dissect the wide range of views and data on these pressures.

In the AMBER (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers) project has begun tracking barriers across Europe, compiling them into a ‘Barrier Atlas’ to better inform management and conservation (AMBER International 2019). The project is ongoing, but so far around 415,000 barriers - complete or partial, with degree of obstruction not often fully quantified - have been recorded within this tool (AMBER International 2019). Relating in particular to hydropower, 21,387 plants are recorded currently in existence in Europe, with a further 278 under construction, and 8,507 planned (Schwarz <em>et al</em>. 2019).<span class=""MsoCommentReference""> In the Iberian Peninsula, 80% of eel habitat had been lost when compared to a 19<sup>th</sup> century baseline, as a result of dams causing fragmentation (Clavero and Hermoso 2015). A full life cycle model developed by Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. (2015) suggested the decline of the European Eel between 1975 and 1985 may be somewhat attributed to habitat loss. The model projected a reduction in suitable eel habitat, by 16% in the Mediterranean and 71% in the North and Baltic seas (Bevacqua <em>et al</em>. 2015). Degradation and loss of available habitat is also exacerbated by development, flood control, water-level management and the abstraction of surface and ground water for both domestic and commercial use (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018). For example, Portugal, Spain and Morocco have been impacted by dam construction and/or drought in recent decades (Kettle <em>et al.</em> 2011). Further, it has been hypothesised, that the decline in good quality habitat and associated resources may be causing a decline in body condition of escaping silver eels in parts of the range which may have effects on the success of migration and/or spawning due this species’, particularly the female’s, reliance on fat stores for reproductive success (van Ginneken and van den Thillart 2000).</p><p>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in <em>A. anguilla</em> – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding area (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p><p>The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American Eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif <em>et al</em>. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to larval metamorphosis being impeded due to the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Miller and Tsukamoto 2016). <a name=""_Hlk13652216"">Using a high-resolution ocean model, Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. (2014) found ocean current variations to be a major driver in the onset of decline in European Eel recruitment that occurred in the early 1980s. Although after this period, the correlation between oceanic fluctuations and eel recruitment was lost, and lack of recovery was likely a result of other pressures (Baltazar-Soares <em>et al</em>. 2014). </a>Pacariz <em>et al</em>. (2014), however, found that the overall success of larval drift from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958–2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson <em>et al</em>. (2012). Politis <em>et al</em>. (2017) found 18°C to be optimum temperature for spawning of <em>A. anguilla</em> under experimental conditions. The results suggested <em>A. anguilla</em> may inhabit a deeper layer of the Sargasso Sea during early life stages and may be vulnerable to changes in temperature as a result of ocean warming. A recent ICES WGEEL report described climate change and increasing ocean temperature under “new and emerging threats”, due to unusually warm and dry periods occurring throughout European countries (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). This warm and dry period resulted in higher water temperatures, reduced levels of dissolved oxygen, and in some cases habitat loss through drought, creating stressful conditions for eels and other freshwater biota (ICES 2018<em>c</em>). There were several reports of eel mortalities from European countries, connected to warmer water, increased instances of disease, or deaths that could not be explained (ICES2018<em>c</em>).</p><p>The parasite nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>), introduced when the Japanese Eel (<em>A. japonica</em>) was imported to Europe for culture in the early 1980s, is also thought to impact the ability of the European Eel to reach its spawning ground. There multiple proposed impacts which include a negative effect on silver stage physiology (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012); swimbladder damage which impairs swimming performance (Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007); and a reduced ability to cope with high pressure during their reproductive migration (Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sjöberg <em>et al</em>. 2009). Prevalence of <em>A. crassus</em> has been found to be higher in smaller eels (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017, Hafir-Mansouri <em>et al</em>. 2018), with the proposal that smaller eels feeding mainly on invertebrates have a greater infection intensity than larger, piscivorous eels, because of increased chance of encounter with infected invertebrate hosts (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p><p>Lipophilic pollutant contaminants and metals act as stressors within the continental stage of the European Eel life cycle (Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). This can result in damage to the respiratory system, tissues and organs, alter the regular function of endocrine processes, osmoregulation, and haematological dynamics, as well as decreasing protein content, reducing the ability of an eel to cope with physiological stress (Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019, De Meyer <em>et al</em>. 2018). Lipids are essential for allowing normal migration and reproduction (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). As pollutants impair lipid metabolism and storage, it may reduce the ability of silver eels to migration (Belpaire <em>et al. </em>2019). Chemicals stored by eels and released when fat stores are broken down during migration, could subsequently limit the capacity of the silver eels to complete their spawning migrations due to metabolic disruption (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Belpaire <em>et al</em>.&#160; 2019). Further, there is concern that even if the spawning migration is completed that lipid stores containing xenobiotics may result in disrupted gonadogenesis and/or low-quality gametes, as well as transmission of pollutants to the larvae (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Sühring <em>et al</em>. 2015, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016;,Freese<em> et al.</em> 2017, 2019, Drouineau <em>et al</em>. 2018, Nowosad <em>et al</em>. 2018). Ultimately, pollutants may be affecting eels at molecular and individual levels, but also scaling to population and community wide effects (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2019). Lipophilic chemical pollutants have been identified as a cause of recruitment failure, although current policies focusing on increasing escapement from continental waters do not consider eel quality (Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). To mitigate impacts of contaminants, it may be valuable for management to integrate methods to improve the condition and quality of both habitats and escaping eels (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019). This may also be considered in relation to stocking activities, by ensuring eels have suitable, unpolluted rearing habitat (Freese <em>et al</em>. 2016, Belpaire <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Predation also represents a threat to <em>A. anguilla</em> and is increasingly being discussed in relation to competition with commercial and recreational fisheries. Cormorants in particular have been a focus of recent research, which has found eel consumption by cormorants to be of a similar quantity to that of fishery landings in both the Baltic Sea (Hansson <em>et al</em>. 2018) and some lakes in Sweden (Ovegård 2017). Human factors may exacerbate the threat. Under experimental conditions, acoustic disturbance has been found to reduce anti-predation behaviour in eels, affecting likelihood of survival (Simpson <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>Unsustainable exploitation is a threat to the species. Fishing for the European Eel began with small scale fisheries up to the late 1800s, before shifting during the mid-1900s to larger scale, commercial exploitation, with production peaking between 1960–70 (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016, Dekker 2019, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Across its distribution, all continental stages of the European Eel are currently exploited although data from different regions varies in quality and period of collection. Trade of European Eel continues within the European Union (EU) for consumption, culture and stocking, although export from the EU has been banned since 2010 although over this time period commercial landings of yellow and silver eels have remained relatively consistent (around 2000–3000 tonnes) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>) (see Conservation). Indeed, it seems that yellow/silver eels are declining while glass eel catches increase (European Commission 2020<em>a</em>).</p><p>                          </p><p>Despite the ban on trade outside of the EU, under-reporting, illegal fishing (poaching) and illegal trade are believed to occur throughout the range of the European Eel fisheries (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is little information regarding illegal exploitation of the European Eel, which is thought to be driven mainly by demand from East Asia for use as a substitute for <em>Anguilla japonica</em>, due to the reduced abundance of glass eels of this species (Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). Assessment of the impact of this component of fishery exploitation is therefore extremely difficult. Export of European Eel outside of EU borders is visible through trade statistics, and enforcement agencies report the tonnage of successful operations where shipments have been intercepted, and seizures made (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018, Kaifu <em>et al</em>. 2019). A review of exploitation, including an attempt to understand the scale of eel trafficking for the European Eel was conducted by Stein and Dekker in Kaifu <em>et al</em>. (2019).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p></p><p>Determining changes in the stock of European Eel is difficult due to limited data and the poor understanding of the relationship between recruitment, eels in continental waters, and escapement. Not only can there be a large time lag (10's of years) between the recruitment of glass eels to fresh and brackish water and the subsequent escapement of silver eels, but given that <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> is panmictic, escapement from one area does not translate directly into returning larval recruitment at the same locality. Indeed, for all intents and purposes it is assumed that practically nothing is known about the population dynamics of the oceanic phase of <em>A. anguilla</em> (ICES 2013<em>a</em>). </p><p>Assessment of datasets using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria took into account the following: consistency of sampling; longevity of the data set; whether data were eel-specific or multi-species; whether the collection methods were active or passive; whether the watershed the data related to was subject to restocking activity; and/or whether, in the case of fisheries independent data, there was exploitation in the region.</p><p>There are more available datasets for <em>A. anguilla</em> in northern, central and southern European countries compared to North Africa. For the purposes of analysing recruitment trends, ICES often refers to the North Sea subpopulation in separate terms to the rest of Europe. This is because the rate of decline in abundance of <em>A. anguilla </em>recruitmen<em>t </em>has been shown to be substantially greater for this area compared to elsewhere (ICES 2012), although this declining trend can be mostly accounted for during the period between 1980 and 1985. Declines in both the North Sea and elsewhere indices are presented and considered. Unless otherwise stated, data were accessed through relevant contacts in the EIFAAC/ICES/GFCM Working Group on Eels (WGEEL).<br/> <br/> </p><p><strong>Glass and Yellow Eel Recruitment:&#160;</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Glass eel and young-of-year recruitment data used to inform this assessment were taken from the analysis provided in ICES (2019<em>a</em>). Data used in the ICES recruitment index were from Norway, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium in the “North Sea” series, and UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy in the “Elsewhere” series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment is based largely on data from the Baltic area where only yellow stage eels are recruited (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). <br/> <br/> Since the early 1980s, a steady and almost continent-wide decline has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels. The ICES recruitment index fell to its lowest historical level in 2012: less than 1% for the North Sea and 5% elsewhere in the distribution area with respect to recruitment from between 1960–1979 (ICES 2012). In the most recent ICES report, the provisional 2019 recruitment index was at 1.4% of the 1960–1979 reference level in the ‘North Sea’ series, and at 6.0% in the ‘Elsewhere’ series (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These provisional values for 2019 show a slight decrease from final 2018 values, which were 1.9% in the ‘North Sea’ index, and 8.9% in the ‘Elsewhere’ index (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). However, statistical analyses conducted on recruitment data have shown the trend from 2011–2019 has increased significantly from zero (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Yellow eel recruitment to European waters was 26.4% of the 1960–1979 reference in 2018 (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Data collection for 2019 was stated to be ongoing and so not available at the time of publication (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). The overall decline in recruitment will likely continue to influence adult stock for at least one generation length (ICES 2012). <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Yellow Eel (standing stock): </strong><br/> There were few time-series data sets available to this assessment for the yellow eel life stage, and they only cover a small amount of the geographical range. Data sets were made available from Skagerrak (southern Norway), Den Burg (Netherlands) and the East Anglian River Basin District (RBD) in the UK (Rivers Blackwater, Colne, Chelmer, Stour) (Environment Agency 2019). Skagerrak and Den Burg data derive from beach seines and fyke nets, respectively, and the East Anglian RBD data derive from electrofishing surveys. Data from Skagerrak contained mostly yellow eels, with some silvers, whereas the other data sets were for yellow eel only.<br/> <br/> The analyses of yellow eel data suggest declines that were not as severe as that of recruitment:&#160;in the East Anglian RBD, the mean decline&#160;was between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data,&#160;over a period of three generation lengths (39 years);&#160;in Skagerrak and Den Burg, the mean decline mirrored this trend.&#160;There is a variety of published literature describing abundance trends in yellow eels not captured within this analysis - note the following examples are not comprehensive. In the Bristol Channel, sampling conducted between 1981 and 2009 at power station cooling water intakes found yellow eel abundance to decline by 15% per year, to 1% of the level in 1980 (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, abundance decline has been documented in the River Meuse, in Belgium (Matondo and Ovidio 2016), and Ireland, in both the Foyle Estuary (Barry <em>et al</em>. 2015) and Lough Sheelin, in the upper River Shannon catchment (MacNamara <em>et al</em>. 2016). Conversely, a study to establish the status of stocks in England and Wales found rivers along the West coast, and some in the northeast remained similar, whereas declines were observed in the south-east (Bark <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fisheries-independent monitoring conducted on six sites along the Swedish west coast found yellow eel CPUE to display a slow increase between 1975 and 2003, after which it decreased, before increasing again from around 2011 (Andersson <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>Declines in yellow eels were identified earlier than that of glass eel recruitment, occurring since the 1960’s (Dekker and Beaulaton 2016). The less pronounced decline in the yellow eel data analysed here compared to those reported for glass eel indices could be partially due to density-dependent mortality confounding the effects of changes in recruitment (Svedäng 1999). However, it needs to be taken into account that the age range of yellow eels is broad and that there may very well be a time lag in knock-on effects. As such, any increase in recruitment would not be expected to be immediately mirrored in a rise in yellow eel numbers, indeed, it is possible that this life stage may continue to decline. </p><p><strong>Silver Eels:</strong><strong><br/> </strong><br/> For silver eels, there is similar uneven geographical spread of data.&#160;Data sets of silver eel escapement were available from France (MNHN-Dinard and UMS PatriNat unpub. data.), Norway and Ireland and were collected from scientific surveys. Note that the silver eel escapement estimates generated for EMPs are only available from 2010 and therefore not dating back long enough to be used in these analyses.</p><p>Based on these data, silver eel decline does not appear as pronounced as for recruitment indices but, similar to yellow eels (standing stock), they indicated a mean decline of&#160;&#160;between 50% and 80%, recognising the paucity of data, over the period of three generation lengths (39 years).&#160;Again, the less pronounced decline compared to recruitment indices may be due to density-dependent mortality at previous life stages, but it cannot be ruled out that a decline in silver eel escapement may continue despite increases in recruitment and/or yellow eels due to the long generation time.&#160;&#160;</p><p><em>Note</em>: The 2019 ICES data call included a request for available data on abundance trends for the standing stock of yellow and silver eels (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). Information collected for yellow eels included long-term monitoring across various habitats for 70 sites, and for silver eels across 28 sites (ICES 2019<em>a</em>). These data have not been reported by ICES yet, but future analysis will provide a more accurate understanding of the situation.</p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> has been included in a number of regional and national Red List assessments in Europe over the past 10 years. The European Eel has been assessed as Critically Endangered across Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011), for the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM 2007), as well as in Sweden (Gärdenfors 2010), Denmark (NERI 2009), France (UICN Comité français, MNHN, SFI and AFB 2019), Ireland (King <em>et al</em>. 2011) and north Belgium (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). Indeed, the European Eel showed the largest negative trend of any of the freshwater fishes (-75%) in the Belgian report (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Norway the status is now Vulnerable (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015).<br/> <br/> For the North African range there is considerably less information. A regional Red List assessment in North Africa suggests that <em>A. anguilla</em> is Endangered due to a decline in recruitment of 50% in the last 10 years with annual catches declining by between 10 and 25% since the 1980s, and by more in Tunisia alone (Azeroual 2010).</p><p>Currently, the best estimate metric for translation into the IUCN criteria for ‘Mature Individuals’ is the silver eel life stage, although this has its limitations. Following escapement from continental waters, there is the possibility that a proportion of silver eels may succumb to the effects of sub-lethal impacts incurred during growth / escapement and/or be predated before reaching the breeding area to spawn. </p><p>                      </p><p>An alternative metric that could be used in place of silver eel escapement is numbers of leptocephali collected close to the breeding area, as this would also give an indication of the state of the spawning stock. In 2011, sampling across the breeding area for <em>A. anguilla, A. rostrata</em> and other non-anguillid species was conducted, following the same methods as previous sampling in this area that occurred in 1983 and 1985, just after the beginning of the decline in eels occurred in 1980 (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). Results from this study were compared with the previous sampling, and significantly lower numbers of European Eel leptocephali were collected in 2011, with a reduction in catch rate of 89% and 64% compared to sampling in 1983 and 1985, respectively (Hanel <em>et al</em>. 2014). This observation depicts a decrease in the abundance of leptocephali occurring in the Sargasso breeding area over this time period, suggesting a reduction in the spawning stock, and correlating with the reduction in recruitment to continental waters. This is of great concern for the future resilience of the population.</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p></p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> occurs in most inland waters of Europe and is distributed from North Cape in northern Norway, southwards along the coast of Europe, all coasts of the Mediterranean and on the North African coast (Schmidt 1909, Dekker 2003<em>b</em>). It very rarely enters the White and Barents seas, but it has been recorded eastward to the Pechora River in northwest Russia. The species occurs in low abundance in the Black Sea region where it migrates east to the Kuban drainage (occasional individuals reach the Volga drainage through canals). <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> also occurs in northern Scandinavia and eastern Europe. A report by the ICES Study Group on Anguillid Eels in Saline Waters (SGAESAW) indicates that eel stocks can contain a mix of freshwater residents, saline water residents, and inter‐habitat migrants (ICES 2009). The continental distribution of the European Eel is over an area of approximately 90,000 km²&#160;in Europe and parts of North Africa (Moriarty and Dekker 1997), with a substantially larger range if their marine distribution is considered. </p><p>For several decades prior to a cessation of import to, and export from, the EU in 2010, <em>A. anguilla</em> was also exported to Asia for seed stock in eel farms (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species may well have been introduced in some parts of Asia (through escape or release from farms, e.g. Arai <em>et al</em>. 2017), however these will not contribute to the spawning stock and therefore areas of introduction have been excluded in the range information. </p><p>    </p><p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring, before eggs hatch and leptocephalus larvae migrate back across the Atlantic to begin the continental phase of their life history (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009, Righton <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><a name=""_Hlk17388906""></a><a name=""_Hlk17388861"">The various life stages, ranging from glass to silver</a>, of all anguillid species are harvested and traded on a global scale for farming and consumption, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla </em>species or population becomes over-exploited, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There is clear evidence for this in the case of <em>A. anguilla</em>. Traditionally, European Eel was consumed within its European and North African range states – yellow and silver eels were fished for direct consumption, and glass eels were caught for farming and also for consumption (mainly in Spain). Although still consumed within Europe, in recent decades European Eel became increasingly important in fulfilling demand in East Asia (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crook 2010, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>According to FAO data, total annual global <em>Anguilla </em>production (catch and aquaculture) has steadily increased since the 1950s, mainly due to the expansion of farming in East Asia. In 2016, eel farming accounted for 98% of total eel production (over 290,000 tonnes (t)), with mainland China responsible for nearly 86% (FAO 2018). Eel farming is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels (glass eels/elvers) as “seed” as breeding in captivity is not yet commercially viable. Historically, eel farms used species of local provenance. France, Spain, Portugal and the UK are the principal fishing nations for glass eels, and Italy, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands the main producers of farmed European Eel for consumption within Europe. However, towards the end of the 1990s, a decline in stocks of Japanese Eels, combined with the apparently cheap and abundant supplies of European Eel glass eels, led to many Asian eel farms in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, supplementing farms with the European Eel (<a name=""_Hlk17273106"">Briand <em>et al</em>. 2008</a>, Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002, Shiraishi and Crook 2015).</p><p>Concerns over the impact international trade was having on European Eel led to it being listed in Appendix II of CITES in 2007. This listing came into force on 13 March 2009 – since then any international trade in this species needs to be accompanied by a permit. In December 2010, however, the European Union (EU) decided to ban all imports and exports of European Eel to and from the EU, as authorities felt they were unable to determine that trade would not be detrimental to the conservation of the species (a requirement for issuance of permits for CITES Appendix II-listed species). There were a number of exceptions to this ban: trade in “pre-Convention” specimens was permitted until the end of 2015), and internal EU trade is still allowed. Trade from non-EU range States to non-EU countries also still occurs (Musing <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>Global FAO catch data for European Eel are available for the period of 1950–2017, peaking at nearly 20,000 t in 1968 but declining thereafter and between 2013 and 2017, annual catches averaged just over 3,000 t. Over 60% of these catches were reported by five EU Member States: Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The principal non-EU range States reporting catches (10% of the total) were Egypt, Norway, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco (FAO 2019). Fishing of various life stages continues in a number of range States, but in many cases, catch is now being limited by quotas or other measures set as part of National Eel Management Plans, fulfilling requirements outlined in Eel Regulation - see Conservation Measures. Reported annual glass eel landings in the EU have declined since 1980, to 62.2 t in 2018, and 58.6 t in 2019 (provisional) (ICES 2019<em>a</em>).</p><p>Live eels and meat are traded globally for consumption and to a much smaller extent <em>Anguilla </em>skins and leather products are also in international trade. Global Customs trade data for live, fresh, frozen and prepared/preserved eel (non-species-specific) are available for the last 40 years. According to FAO and UN Comtrade, global annual exports of <em>Anguilla </em>averaged around 20,000 t in the late 1970s, after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 t in 2001. Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 t in 2008–2011, increasing again slightly to ~90,000 t in 2013–2015. The export value of these commodities has steadily increased over the past 40 years, reaching USD ~1.6 billion in 2012. Over the last decade, of the four commodity types, live and prepared/preserved eel accounted for nearly 80% of total exports by weight; China has been the main eel exporter and Japan the main importer (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018). As noted above, a high percentage of eel in international trade is derived from eels having been grown in farms, which includes <em>A. anguilla </em>(Musing<em> </em><em>et al</em><em>. </em>2018).</p><p>Due to a lack of species-specific Customs data, the precise quantities of European Eel in trade are still unknown. However, imports reported by East Asian Customs of live juvenile <em>Anguilla</em> eels from European Eel range States for farming purposes (defined as “live eel fry” in East Asia) provide a good indication of the amount of European glass eels in trade outside of the EU (both legal and illegal). Between 2003 and 2008, annual live eel fry imports from European eel range States to mainland China, Taiwan, Province of China, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong fluctuated between ~36 and 70 t. In 2009, annual imports dropped to ~9 t and in 2010 they increased again to nearly 28 t. Since 2011, reported annual imports of live eel fry from <em>A. anguilla </em>range States remained less than 10 t. France and Spain were the principal source countries among <em>A. anguilla </em>range States until 2010 (when commercial<em> A. anguilla</em> trade to and from the EU was banned). Imports from non-EU <em>A. anguilla </em>range States, especially from Morocco, began in 2009 and gradually increased over the years, despite a ban for export of glass eels being imposed in this range state since 2013 (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). Due to the reduced availability of European glass eels over the last decade, increasing quantities of glass eels of other <em>Anguilla</em> species have also been imported into East Asia to fulfil demand in farms (Gollock <em>et al. </em>2018).</p><p>Since 2009, species-specific CITES trade data for European eel have been reported. Between 2009 and 2016, over 1000 t of live <em>A. anguilla </em>and another ~1000 t of meat/bodies were reportedly exported from a number of European Eel range States (mainly Morocco and Tunisia). Main destinations were Korea and Hong Kong. In addition, over 50,000 t of meat/bodies were re-exported, mainly from China to Japan (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><p>There are serious concerns over illegal harvesting and trade of <em>A. anguilla.</em> In recent years, authorities have increasingly reported the involvement of organised criminal networks in the movement of legally and illegally sourced European glass eels from the EU to East Asia, principally to China, and have seen traders regularly change travelling routes and their <em>modus operandi </em>to circumvent controls (Musing <em>et al. </em>2018). In 2015, EUROPOL initiated Operation LAKE, a European initiative aimed at combatting illegal eel trade. Under this umbrella, there have been a number of investigations into eel smuggling in air freight and personal luggage. For example, in 2017, Greek and Spanish authorities dismantled an international criminal network suspected of having smuggled 10 t of eels from the EU to China; raids led to the arrest of 32 individuals and seizure of 2 t of <em>A. anguilla </em>worth EUR 2 million (Europol 2017). However, European Eel appears to still be in the supply chain in East Asia – a recent paper indicated it was prevalent in supermarket products in Hong Kong (Richards&#160;<em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>While there is demand for the species, pressures from trade, and unknown quantities in illegal trade, continue to be a serious conservation concern for the species. </p><p>                    </p><p>A detailed recent analysis of trade in <em>A. anguilla</em>, including Customs, CITES and seizure data, is provided in Musing <em>et al. </em>(2018).</p><p></p>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The majority of conservation actions historically in place for the European eel were set up and controlled at local and national level, often with little coordination, which is of particular concern when dealing with a panmictic stock. Protection can be achieved effectively at a national or local level, distributed throughout individual management units, but an international objective is necessary to orchestrate this management (Dekker 2016).<br/> <br/> The Eel Regulation (EC Regulation 1100/2007; EU 2007) is an EU-wide recovery plan for the European Eel, adopted in 2007. As instructed by the regulation, EU member states have been developing and implementing Eel Management Plans (EMPs) with the objective to “reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock.” (EU 2007). Member States are responsible for implementing measures to achieve their targets, and most actions have focussed on commercial and recreational fisheries, followed by hydropower-pumping station obstacles, and measures on habitat, restocking, and predator control (ICES 2013<em>b</em>,&#160;European Commission 2020<em>a</em>). Other actions expected to have indirect effects, such as implementing monitoring programmes and scientific studies, have been almost as common as controls on fisheries (ICES 2013<em>b</em>).</p><p>In a review of EMPs, eel biomass per hectare fell within a narrow range for most countries, apart from France and Spain, whose values were higher than what was reported for other countries (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). The most recent reporting (2018) did not provide mortality rate estimates for all EMPs, and therefore rates could not be summed to reflect the state of impacts across Europe (ICES 2018<em>d</em>). In December 2017, EU Member States reached an agreement prohibiting fishing for eels &gt;12 cm in marine waters of the Atlantic and North Sea over a three-month period (determined by each Member State) between 2018 and 2019 to aid eel recovery (Council of the EU 2018). In 2019, in line with measures implemented by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), this decision extended the mandatory closures to recreational and glass eel fisheries covering brackish waters (Council of the EU 2019).</p><p> As part of the EMPs, any Member State that allowed fishing for eels of &lt;12 cm total was required to reserve a minimum of 60% of their catch from 31 July 2013 onwards for restocking purposes (i.e. restocking waters with glass eels from elsewhere). Although there is evidence showing restocking to be beneficial at enhancing silver eel production within water bodies, the overall effectiveness of restocking programmes at enhancing the spawning stock remains open to debate (ICES 2016). Reviews (ICES 2012, 2016, Pawson 2012) on the contribution of restocking to the recovery of the panmictic European Eel state that there are major knowledge gaps to be filled before firm conclusions can be drawn either way. Until restocking studies are accompanied by suitable controls of areas without translocation, it is very difficult to determine whether there is a net increase in silver eel escapement or differences in growth rates and/or sex ratios in manipulated populations (Pawson 2012). </p><p>A recent evaluation of the implementation of the Eel Regulation sought to assess the measures established for the protection and sustainable use of the European Eel stock, as well as the contribution of EMPs to promoting recovery (European Commission 2019, 2020<em>a</em>). Overall, escapement of silver eels remains below the 40% target biomass (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Catches of yellow and silver eel life stages were found to have declined, while glass eel catch has been steadily increasing (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Overall, there has been progress towards a reduction in fishing effort, but in some Member States’ effort has risen (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). Anthropogenic mortality unrelated to fishing has not significantly declined, and this has received little focus in the EMPs and related actions (European Commission 2020<em>b</em>). The report ultimately stated ""The Regulation’s success in ensuring the recovery of the European eel is still far from certain, as it is widely recognised that the recovery of the European eel will take many decades. In this respect, further ambition is needed to implement the Regulation with a greater focus on non-fisheries related measures.""</p><p>Although the Eel Regulation (1100/2007) only applies to EU Member States, efforts are being pursued to non-EU countries to develop and implement management plans and conservation measures. The GFCM are currently in the process of negotiating a regional Eel Management Plan (SAC 2018). The last working group on the management of European eel (WGMEASURES-EEL) occurred on the 16–17<sup>th</sup> April 2019, where priorities for a regional research programme on eels was discussed, which included drafting an agreed workplan, with a method to launch and implement the programme (SAC 2019). A number of other range states have implemented management measures and/or developed national eel management plans (Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In addition to the Eel Regulation, in 2007, the European eel was included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (CITES 2007). The listing came into effect on 13 March 2009, after which time exporters were required to acquire permits. An export permit may be issued only if the specimen was legally obtained and export is deemed non-detrimental to the survival of the species i.e. a Non-Detriment Finding (NDF). In 2010, the EU’s Scientific Review Group (SRG) concluded an NDF was not possible for this species, and so a zero import/export policy was set for the EU, which is still in place (EC 2010, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). In 2018, several reports investigating the challenges and lessons learnt in relation to implementing the Appendix II listing, including its enforcement and illegal trade were published (CITES 2018, Musing <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p><p>In 2008, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2010). In 2014, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) to catalyse collaborative conservation across range States, providing additional support for conservation and monitoring of the species (CMS 2014). Since the listing there have been three range state meetings in order to develop a mechanism under which signatories will work. At the most recent CMS Conference of the Parties in 2020, it was agreed a species Action Plan would be developed for the European Eel.</p><p>              </p><p>Across Europe, programmes for “trap and transport” (downriver transport), and “assisted migration” (upriver transport), are in place to provide eels with access to habitat that has been lost through the construction of migratory barriers. When applied to migrating silver eels, it can have a significant and immediate effect on local escapement. It is hoped that translocation can mitigate against the loss of habitat and positively contribute to enhanced escapement, and by association, future recruitment (e.g. for barriers: van der Meer 2012, McCarthy <em>et al.</em> 2014, Béguer-Pon <em>et al</em>. 2018). There is a necessity in the future, however, to reduce the level of direct human intervention by eliminating the barriers to navigation, or at least, providing more effective passage for eels.<br/> <br/> Continuous monitoring of eel escapement on a national or international scale is currently very rare and so in addition to localised monitoring, modelling has been explored for providing estimates of escapement in eel subpopulations. A number of assessment models have been developed; Demographic model of the Camargue (DemCam) (Bevacqua and De Leo 2006), Eel Density Analysis (EDA) (EDA 2.2: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2015, EDA 2.2.1: Briand <em>et al</em>. 2018), German Eel Model (GEM) (GEM II: Oeberst and Fladung 2012, GEM III: Oeberst and Fladung 2014), and, Scenario-based Model of Eel Production II (SMEP II) (SMEP: developed by El-Hosaini, Bark, Knights, Williams and Kirkwood; Aprahamian <em>et al</em>. 2007). Using time series eel data sets from a variety of locations across Europe, earlier iterations of these models were reviewed by Walker <em>et al.</em> (2011). The conclusions of this report suggest that all four models were capable of predicting escapement to a degree of accuracy (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/> <br/> In 2019,&#160; ICES stated that: “The status of European eel remains critical”, and that “all anthropogenic impacts (e.g. caused by recreational and commercial fishing on all stages, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) that decrease production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to,&#160; or kept as close as possible to,&#160; zero in 2020” (ICES 2019<em>b</em>). In 2019, provisional recruitment estimates remain low across the geographical range. Although, recruitment during the period of 2011–2019 has shown an increasing trend, statistically significant from zero. This highlights the necessity for continued, effective conservation across the range for <em>A. anguilla</em>.&#160;</p><p></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

In its non-breeding range, it occupies the interior understorey of humid to semi-humid broad-leaved evergreen and semi-deciduous forest and mixed palm forest, also occurring in secondary growth, low-stature forest, thickets and plantations. It feeds mainly on soil-dwelling invertebrates, and takes fruit from late summer to early spring (Jirinec<em> et al</em>. 2016, Evans <em>et al</em>. 2020). It breeds from early May to late August, with pairs typically raising two broods. It is predominantly monogamous, with rare instances of polygyny. Pair bonds usually last for a single season. It is a long-distance nocturnal migrant, leaving its breeding areas in mid-August to mid-September and crossing the Gulf of Mexico on a broad front from Texas to Florida, and making landfall from Veracruz, Mexico to Costa Rica (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stanley <em>et al. </em>2015).&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Individuals leave the non-breeding region during April (Stanley <em>et al.</em> 2012) and most <span lang=""EN-US"">birds <span lang=""EN-US"">(&gt;70%) <span lang=""EN-US"">travel northwards through the central U.S. Gulf Coast (<span lang=""EN-US"">Stanley <em>et al. </em>2015<span lang=""EN-US"">).<p><em> </em></p><p><em> </em></p></span></span></span>","<span lang=""EN-US"">The species is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of its forest habitat both within the breeding and non-breeding ranges (Taylor and Stutchbury 2016, Evans <em>et al</em>. 2020).

The destruction of natural habitat has been found to have led to a rapid reduction of its already small population, which is projected to continue in the future unless immediate conservation action is taken across its entire distribution range. The species is therefore classified as Vulnerable. <p></p>","This species breeds in montane grassland (Keith <em>et al.</em> 1992, Berruti <em>et al.</em> 1995, Holroyd and Quinn undated)<strong></strong>, preferring high rainfall, undulating areas such as mist belt grasslands of South Africa (Evans 2000)<strong></strong>. It favours grassland with interspersed with drainage lines in gullies or valleys, and also frequents wetland systems such as pans and small dams (Anon. 2005b)<strong></strong>. The species requires such wetlands among grassland patches for foraging (Anon. 2005b)<strong></strong>. In Swaziland, its breeding sites have been restricted to grasslands above 1,200 m, with most above 1,300 m (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Prior to its northwards migration, it may congregate akin to Barn Swallow, <em>Hirundo rustica</em>, giving twittering calls (Meikle 2012).&#160;In its non-breeding range it favours open grassland, often with bushes and trees (Keith <em>et al.</em> 1992, Ndang'ang'a 2004, Ndang'ang'a 2007) and marshy areas (Ndang'ang'a 2007)<strong></strong>. Its nest is usually attached to the roof or side of a hole in the ground (relatively free of vegetation) (Turner and Rose 1989, Keith <em>et al.</em> 1992, Johnson 1996)<strong></strong>. Nest-sites in South Africa and Swaziland include underground sinkholes or disused aardvark <em>Orycteropus afer</em> burrows (Mattison 2003, Wakelin 2004, Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, as well as artificial and artificially altered holes (Mattison 2003, Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong> such as old mining and prospecting shafts (Meikle 2010)<strong></strong>. Birds use the same nest-site for up to 30 years (Keith <em>et al.</em> 1992, S. L. Childes <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000)<strong></strong>, as long as the cavity remains stable (Wakelin 2004)<strong></strong>, although it is not known whether these are the same birds returning (J. Wakelin <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. The nest consists of a cup of mud, mixed with fine grass and rootlets, and lined with feathers, and is repaired each year (Wakelin 2004)<strong></strong>. The species has been recorded breeding cooperatively in some parts of its range (facultative cooperative breeder) (Wakelin 2004, S. W. Evans <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. However, it is not known whether helpers are related to the breeding pair (Wakelin 2004)<strong></strong>. Nesting occurs between October and March (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. A successful pair may produce two broods per breeding season (Wakelin 2004, Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>, with three clutches fledged from one nest in KwaZulu-Natal (J. Wakelin <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. It lays two or three eggs, normally three; incubation lasts about 15 days and the chicks fledge after about 22 days (Wakelin 2004)<strong></strong>. The total number of active nests seems to be positively correlated with rainfall prior to breeding, probably through its influence on the abundance of insects, which the species feeds on (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Blue swallow often forage in dense fog. They are well adapted to these conditions, having the most water repellent plumage of any terrestrial bird species (Rijke <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000, Kylin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). <br/><p></p>","Grassland in many parts of its range is being lost to afforestation (Keith <em>et al.</em> 1992, Wakelin 2004)<strong></strong>, intense human settlement, cultivation (especially sugarcane [Evans 2000]<strong></strong>), intensive livestock-farming, intense grazing, intensive grass-burning (Nasirwa and Njoroge 1997)<strong></strong>, invasion by non-native trees and bracken (S. L. Childes <em>in litt.</em> 1999, 2000)<strong></strong> and (potentially) small-scale mining (S. W. Evans verbally 1998)<strong></strong>. Grasslands are burnt annually or sometimes biannually to stimulate new growth for grazing; annual burning and grazing alters the composition of plant species and reduces their cover, accelerating soil erosion, reducing the organic content of soil and thus insect abundance and reducing the productivity and diversity of grasslands (S. W. Evans <em>in litt</em>. 2007, J. Wakelin <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. The drainage of wetlands also threatens the species (Anon. 2005b)<strong></strong>. More than 60% of the South African Grassland Biome Habitat has already been irreversibly transformed (Evans 2000)<strong></strong>. Only 0.24% of montane grassland in KwaZulu-Natal is protected (Wakelin 2004)<strong></strong>. At five study sites in KwaZulu-Natal, 55% of the suitable grassland habitat was transformed between 1980 and 2000, and the number of active nests also halved (Wakelin 2004, M. McNamara <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. At these sites, in addition to afforestation which doubled in area over the 20 year period and also accounted for half of the total land-use of the study area, grassland was also altered by the encroachment of woody vegetation, as a result of a lack of fuelwood harvesting by displaced communities and changes in fire regimes and timber plantation management (Wakelin 2004, J. Wakelin <em>in litt</em>. 2007)<strong></strong>. In Mpumalanga, 61% of suitable habitat in the North-eastern Mountain Sourveld has been transformed (M. McNamara <em>in litt.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Nesting attempts by the species in Mpumalanga and Limpopo Provinces (South Africa) were thought to be adversely affected by cold, dry conditions in October and November 2004 (Anon. 2005b)<strong></strong>, probably as a result of a low abundance of insects. In Swaziland, 42% of potentially suitable grassland above 1,300 m has been transformed or heavily degraded since the 1950s (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. Suitable breeding habitat in this country has been lost mostly to afforestation for exotic timber plantations, as well as urbanisation to a lesser extent (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>.  The Busia Grasslands (Kenya) have lost over 60% of their grassland cover since the mid-1990s (Ndang'ang'a 2007)<strong></strong>. They are surrounded by intensive agriculture, mainly maize and sugarcane (Ndang'ang'a 2004, Ndang'ang'a 2007)<strong></strong>, and are grazed by livestock (Ndang'ang'a 2007)<strong></strong>. The grasslands are severely and immediately threatened by fragmentation, agriculture and overgrazing (Ndang'ang'a 2004)<strong></strong> from the large, rapidly increasing human population (Ndang'ang'a 2007)<strong></strong> in adjacent settlements, some of which are highly populated (Ndang'ang'a 2004)<strong></strong>. Local people in Busia commonly trap swallows for food, and this may include <em>H. atrocaerulea</em><strong> </strong>(Ndang'ang'a 2007, P. K. Ndang'ang'a<em> in litt</em>. 2007). The loss of grasslands outside the Ruma National Park (Kenya) is severe, with almost every available area cultivated, heavily grazed or settled (Ndang'ang'a 2007)<strong></strong>. The species's nest-site fidelity (Wakelin 2004)<strong></strong> may increase its susceptibility to the affects of habitat transformation. Breeding birds are known to abandon their nests in reaction to human disturbance from excessive tourism (Mattison 2003)<strong></strong> and land-owners (Wakelin 2004)<strong></strong>. At the Blue Swallow Natural Heritage Site (BSNHS), South Africa, nesting success has been reported to decline during years with increased fog (Evans and Bouwman 2000). Blue Swallows are well-adapted to flying in dense fog and have the most water repellent plumage of any terrestrial bird species (Rijke <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). Kylin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2011) hypothesise that elevated concentrations of sulphonates in the fog, caused by a combination of increased air pollution from the Johannesburg area and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released from exotic trees, may have increased the wettability of the blue swallow plumage and lowered nesting success.<p></p>","The total population has declined by an estimated 36–56% since the   1850s, and has been estimated at 1,006 pairs or 2,012 individuals (Evans   and Bouwman 2010), and between 1,169 and 1,338 pairs (Evans <em>et al. </em>2016). Estimated numbers of breeding pairs should be treated  with caution, as when nests are surveyed they are assumed to indicate  one breeding pair each, which may not be the case in this facultative  cooperative breeder, and it has been observed that some nests are not  used after construction (J. Wakelin <em>in litt</em>. 2007). It is conservatively placed in the band 1,000-2,499 mature individuals given the uncertainty over estimated numbers, and the maximum number of pairs is only just above this range.

In 1986, an international working group was established for the conservation and recovery of the species throughout its range (Anon. 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The group has helped to prevent afforestation of the species's grasslands and wetlands in five key areas, successfully lobbied for grasslands in eight areas to be rehabilitated, and succeeded in blocking prospecting and mining in two key areas in South Africa (M.

A workshop was held in South Africa in June 2002, followed by the publication of an international action plan (Evans <em>et al</em>. 2002)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. A South African working group has been formed to coordinate and encourage conservation of the species (Evans 2000, Holroyd and Quinn undated)<strong></strong>. In Malawi, Nyika National Park and the Mulanje area are considered secure from agricultural encroachment in the long term, owing to the cold climate and poor soils (F. Dowsett-Lemaire <em>in litt.</em> 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Zimbabwe, c.200 pairs breed within Nyanga National Park (S. L.

The Ruma National Park is a stronghold for the species in Kenya (Ndang'ang'a 2007)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. The majority of the few known pairs in Swaziland breed in Malolotja Nature Reserve (Parker 1994, Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>, with two pairs in recent years on Sibebe Mountain, which has been the focus of a community-based conservation project (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2006)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. In Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal, artificial nest cavities have been dug (Wakelin 2004, Anon. 2005b, S. W.

However, artificial nests are less warm than natural nests, and the possible impacts of this for breeding in this species are, as of yet, still uncertain (Wakelin <em>et al. </em>2013). Of the 44 artificial nest sites created in KwaZulu-Natal, 18 have been used once or more, but 26 remain unused (Anon. 2005b)<strong><sup></sup></strong>.

In the south-west, its habitat comprises a closed canopy of leguminous, often thorny trees and shrubs c.3-6 m high, a sparse understorey of shrubs and saplings, sparse to absent ground-cover and much exposed soil (Blockstein 1991)<strong></strong>. The flowering tree <em>Haematoxylum campechianum</em>&#160;is dominant in these areas (Rusk 1992, Baptista <em>et al</em>. 2020). On the west coast, its habitat also includes some mixed deciduous and evergreen vegetation. It may have been always confined to xeric, coastal areas where climax vegetation was deciduous, seasonal forest and thorn woodland, but frequent natural disturbances (particularly hurricanes) kept the vegetation in a sub-climax condition (Rusk <em>et al. </em>2008). This temporary occupation of ephemeral patches and recolonisation of developing patches may be the normal life history pattern. <br/>Breeding is limited to the rainy season in the south-west, but is more extended on the less xeric west coast (Rusk 1998)<strong></strong>.<br/><p></p>","Hurricanes pose a pertinent threat to the remaining population (Rusk  2017). Following category IV hurricane Ivan in 2004, calling frequency  by males during the breeding season appeared to have fallen  significantly, possibly as a result of stress owing to limited resources  (Rusk 2005)<strong></strong>. The hurricane damaged habitat structure  and allowed the invasion of alien vines into suitable dove habitat. As  hurricanes are projected to increase in intensity and probably also  frequency in the Caribbean with climate change (see e.g.,  Knutson <em>et al</em>. 2010, Walsh <em>et al</em>.  2016), the risk posed by hurricanes is likely to increase in the near future. Climate change is adding a further threat to the species, as an increase in drought events is leading to a higher frequency of fires and a limited availability of fresh water during the dry season (Rusk 2011, Baptista <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Habitat loss due to clearing for<strong> </strong>small plantations and charcoal production has been replaced in recent years with chronic and continuing habitat loss for residential housing, roads, commercial and other development. Habitat on private land is vulnerable to development and high land prices mean that it is not practical for the government to purchase these areas to ensure their protection (Anon. 2012). Forest clearing was substantially reduced at the Mt. Hartman Estate by the late 1990s due to the establishment of the Mt. Hartman National Park and Dove Sanctuary and the cessation of farming on the remainder of the estate (Rusk&#160;1998)<strong></strong>. Nevertheless, in 1995, 50% of Perseverance was clear-cut for a planned quarry, with half the site now a sanitary land-fill (Rusk and Temple 1995)<strong></strong>. A lease was granted for a new quarry at this site in 2008, but that was temporarily halted in 2009 (Rusk&#160;2008, 2010)<strong></strong>. Increases in squatters and cattle in the 1990s resulted in more disturbance at Perseverance, though currently habitat degradation is due to garbage and toxic fumes invading the site from the garbage dump across the road as well as spillover from the adjacent hurricane debris site (Rusk&#160;2008, 2010)<strong></strong>. A resort development proposed in 2015 at Mt. Hartman National Park poses  a significant threat, and would have a serious impact on the adjacent  protected habitat, unless mitigation measures&#160;including a predator  exclusion fence&#160;are put in place to protect the species (B. L. Rusk <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016).  This development would displace all doves outside the national park.  Resort planning was halted in 2016, but has since resumed (B. L. Rusk <em>in litt.</em>&#160;2016, Baptista <em>et al</em>.  2020). Nevertheless, it is planned to minimise the impact on the  species and the boundaries of the national park were expanded to include  all areas where individuals are present (Baptista <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Population declines are likely to be compounded further by high numbers of introduced mongooses (<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>), cats (<em>Felis catus</em>), rats (<em>Rattus </em>spp.) and opposums (<em>Didelphis marsupialis</em>) predating eggs and fledglings, of which mongoose were found to be the most abundant (Rusk 2015), but rats the most widespread (Twyman and Hyslette unpubl. data)<strong></strong>. It is possible that mongooses and cats are able to climb diagonal branches and trunks to reach the birds<strong></strong>. By 2012, mongoose numbers had reached levels whereby they were found to occur daily across much of Grenada Dove habitat (Bolton <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><p></p>","The global population is estimated at 136-182 mature individuals (Rivera-Milán <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/>The population structure has not been assessed. While the species's two strongholds around Mt Hartman National Park and on the Perseverance and adjacent Woodford estates are separated by 9 km of highly converted habitat (Rusk 2017), there are occasional records of single individuals dispersing outside of these areas (Rivera-Milán <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rusk 2017). It is therefore tentatively assumed that the individuals in both areas are able to get in contact, forming just one subpopulation, though this requires confirmation.",Decreasing,"The species is endemic to <strong>Grenada</strong> in the Lesser Antilles. Historically, it was more widespread in coastal and possibly offshore islands<strong></strong>, but may always have been rare (Devas 1943)<strong></strong>. The species is now confined to two areas in the southwest of the island in and around Mt Hartman National Park, and in the west in the Perseverance, Woodford and Beausejour area (Rusk 2017). These two strongholds are separated by 9 km of highly developed and urbanised areas (Rusk 2017). Occasionally, there are reports of single individuals outside of these areas, including on the east of the island (Rivera-Milán <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rusk 2017).<br/><p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Grenada Dove is the national bird of Grenada, has been a focus of environmental education in schools and ecotourism, and features on stamps. In 1996, parts of the Mt. Hartman and Perseverance estates were declared a national park and a protected area, respectively. A four-year GEF/WB funded Dry Forest Biodiversity Conservation Project based on stakeholder input was implemented from 2001-2006.&#160; A recovery plan was drafted in 1998; in 2008, it was revised and updated for a further 10 years (Rusk <em>et al</em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">.</span>&#160;2008)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>In 2011, critical habitat on crown lands at the Beausejour Estate (c.100 acres) received approval by the Government of Grenada cabinet for its protection and addition to the Perseverance Protected Area (Rusk 2011). <br/>In 2010, dove habitats on private lands at Beausejour, Grenville Vale and Woodford were recommended for protection in the Conservation and Management Plan for Perseverance Protected/Beausejour Area. All areas currently occupied by doves are now IBAs and are included in Grenada's System Plan for Parks and Protected Areas. A legislative review to address private lands slated for protection has taken place in 2013. The Grenada Dove Conservation Programme (GDCP), with the Forestry and National Parks Department (FNDP), is collaborating with Birds Caribbean with the aim of developing eco-tourism activities in two of the key areas for the species (Mt. Hartman and Beausejour) (Anon. 2013). This collaboration has resulted in extensive interpretation at the Mt. Hartman Visitor Center, a school outreach programme and increased student site visitation. <br/>Predator control measures at dove sites were initiated in 2014, with over 1,000 mongoose trapped and removed at Mt. Hartman in an 18 month period. The Grenada Dove Conservation Programme and Forestry and National Parks Department collaborated with the University of Chester (2014-2015) to study tropical dry forest changes (including dove habitat) using historical and current data, and to look at possible future changes using climate change modelling scenarios.

The destruction and conversion of boreal wetlands (predominantly in the southern boreal forests) is a significant threat to the species. Strip-mining for tar sands is expected to increase in the future, with up to 300,000 ha of Canada's boreal forest and wetland predicted to be directly affected over the next 30 to 50 years (Wells&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2008). Other possible threats include boreal wetland drying and chemical change resulting from global climate change (Matsuoka&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010, McClure&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012), depletion of available calcium resulting from acid precipitation (Greenberg and Droege 1999, Greenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), increase in methyl mercury (Greenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Edmonds et al. 2012), disease (Barnard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010), loss of boreal forest habitat due to hydropower development (S. Luepold&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2016), loss of wooded wetlands in the south-east U.S. winter range (Hamel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Greenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), and mortality associated with past and ongoing blackbird control efforts&#160;(Greenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Recent research suggests that an ecological trap created through timber harvesting and clear-cutting on breeding grounds may be responsible for declines, possibly through increased Red squirrel (<em>Tamiascirius hudsonicus</em>)&#160;nest predation, however evidence of such a trap is largely lacking (Buckley Luepold <em>et al</em>. 2015). Forest loss within the species's range is currently estimated at ~5.4% across the stipulated ten year period (Tracewski <em>et al</em>. 2016). Potential low level mortality may also result from collisions with communication towers (Longcore&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).<p></p>","The population is estimated to number anywhere between 0.2-2 million individuals (R.

In Canada, it also inhabits regenerating clear-cuts and coastal areas with spruce-fir at low elevations (Atwood <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>. In winter, it occurs in moist broadleaved and mixed pine-broadleaved montane forests and secondary woodlands (Rimmer 1996; <strong></strong>Raffaele <em>et al.</em> 1998; Rimmer <em>et al.</em> 1999; Townsend <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012)<strong></strong>. It nests in June-July (present on breeding grounds May-October), sometimes with high failure rates (Rimmer 1996). The species sexually segregates in winter with females typically occurring in moderately disturbed mid-elevation rainforests of the Cordillera Septentrional and males more commonly found in the more prisitine cloud forest of remote ranges such as Sierra de Bahoruco and Cordillera Central in the Dominican Republic (McFarland <em>et al</em>. 2018).<p></p>","The species is impacted by a number of threats however, the three most significant primary threats are currently considered to be: incompatible forestry practices throughout breeding grounds, particularly in Canada; the clearing and burning of forests in wintering habitat in the Dominican Republic and Haiti for conversion to agricultural fields and additional land uses; and ongoing climate change and a shift and contraction of its breeding range (Lloyd and McFarland 2017). In Quebec, the widespread practice of thinning renders habitat unsuitable (G. Seutin&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1999) and forest loss within this species's range is currently estimated at ~2.78% across a ten year period (Tracewski&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Agricultural conversion, logging, mining and charcoal production are rapidly clearing and fragmenting winter habitat (Atwood&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1996; <strong></strong>C. C. Rimmer&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1998, 1999; Lloyd and McFarland 2017)&#160;whilst invasive rats&#160;<em>Rattus rattus&#160;</em>&#160;pose a threat through predation in the winter range (Erickson 2011). Furthermore, projected climate change is expected to result in dramatic decreases in the extent of suitable habitat in the species's breeding habitat, predominantly through the replacement of balsam fir by unsuitable hardwood forest (C. C. Rimmer&#160;<em>in litt.</em>&#160;1998, 1999;<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><strong></strong>K.

Furthermore, whilst warmer temperatures are expected to force this species upslope on mountains that lack the elevation extent to accommodate such change, asymmetrical interspecific aggression from the Swainson's Thrush (<em>Catharus ustulatus</em>) migrating up from below may further 'push' Bicknell's Thrush upslope, restricting its range and increasing its threat to a greater extent (Freeman and Montgomery 2016). Acid precipitation may have damaged breeding habitat in the 1960s and 1970s (Phillips 1991; Rimmer 1996) although it is thought to have predominantly impacted one tree species that is not widely abundant throughout this species's montane forest habitat (K. McFarland <em>in litt</em>. 2020).&#160;Ski-resort, communication and wind-power developments potentially threaten local populations (Atwood <em>et al.</em> 1996; <strong></strong>Rimmer 1996).

An analysis of several combined data sets revealed an overall decline of c.2.5% per year in New York and New England (Ralston <em>et al.</em> 2015). Surveys (conducted through the High Elevation Landbird Program) in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia recorded apparent declines of c.16% per year and 11% per year respectively between 2002 and 2010 (Campbell 2011). Results from the second Maritime Breeding Bird Atlas show a greater than 40% decline in the distribution of the species between 1999 and 2009 (COSEWIC 2009). The State of the Mountain Birds 2020 report (Vermont Centre for Ecostudies) suggests such declines exhibit strong regional and temporal variability however, it concurrently concludes that the species has likely declined by ~2.41% per year over the last decade throughout the USA, despite localised increases (e.g. Vermont), and that populations are likely declining globally (Hill 2020).

Hunts along forest edges and in clearings. <strong>Diet </strong>Mostly small forest passerines, occasionally medium-sized birds, small mammals, reptiles and insects.&#160;<strong>Breeding </strong>Small nest made from twigs and lined with green foliage and bark built in a tree up to 10 m above ground. In Japan, the species prefers to nest in Japanese red pines (<em>Pinus densiflora)</em>&#160;(Ueta 1997).","Land-use change within the species's wintering range could result in a loss of roosting habitat (Germi <em>et al</em>. 2009). For instance logging operations in Bali may reduce the availability of roost sites (Germi 2005). The preferred tree species for nesting (Japanese Red Pine <em>Pinus densiflora</em>), in which nesting attempts are particularly successful (Ueta 1997), appears to be in decline due to air pollution (Kume <em>et al. </em>2000), which may lead to a decline in sparrowhawk numbers. An increase in the population of Large-billed Crow&#160;<em>Corvus macrorhynchos </em>may be reducing breeding success in some areas (Ueta and Hirano 2006). Capture of birds from migratory roost sites for trade is unlikely to be significant (Germi and Waluyo 2006). Trade at wintering grounds in Indonesia also appears to be at a low level, and is unlikely to be causing significant declines (Iqbal 2016, Gunawan <em>et al. </em>2017).","Status and trends of the population are very poorly known. An average of 14,320 (minimum: 5,452 [2010], maximum: 28,254 [2016]) Japanese Sparrowhawks were counted migrating over Khao Dinsor, Thailand between 2010 and 2016. The population is roughly estimated to number in the tens of thousands to 100,000 individuals, based primarily on counts of migrants in Indonesia (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Assuming a total of 20,000-100,000 individuals, the number of mature individuals is 13,400-67,000.",Stable,"Breeds from southern Siberia and northern Mongolia to eastern China, Korea and Japan.
