500969,11200,Lamna nasus,Vulnerable,A2bd,2019,2018-11-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Porbeagle (<em>Lamna nasus</em>) is a large (to 357 cm total length) pelagic shark with an anti-tropical and disjunct distribution, occurring in the North  Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere in temperate and cold-temperate waters to depths of 1,809 m. There are two separate subpopulations, the North Atlantic  and the Southern Hemisphere. The species has low biological productivity with small litters, late age-at-maturity, and a shorter life span of 26 years in the North Atlantic compared to 60 years in the Southern Hemisphere. Globally, the species is targeted and caught incidentally in coastal and pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, as well as by rod and reel, and is often retained for the high-value meat as well as its fins. Steep declines have occurred in the North Atlantic; with declines also evident, though not as steep, in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic  subpopulation reduction was 50–79% over three generations (58.5 years)  and the Southern Hemisphere subpopulation reduction was &lt;20%  over three generations (114.9 years). The overall estimated median reduction was 26.5%, with a 41.5% probability of &lt;20% reduction and 45.5% probability of &gt;30% reduction over three generations. Expert judgement elicitation was used to estimate that globally,  the reduction  is 30–49% over three generations (58.5 and 114.9 years) and therefore,  the  Porbeagle is assessed globally as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Porbeagle occurs inshore and over continental shelves, shelf edges, offshore banks, and in the open ocean to depths of 1,809 m (Francis <em>et al. </em>2008, Reyes and Torres-Florez 2009, Weigmann 2016). It prefers cold, temperate waters below 18°C (Campana and Joyce 2004, Francis <em>et al. </em>2008, Skomal <em>et al. </em>2009). It reaches a maximum size of 357 cm total length (TL), though maximum size is likely larger in the North Atlantic as individuals &gt;230 cm TL are rare in the Southwest Pacific (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Males mature at 140–165 cm TL in the Southern Hemisphere and 155–177 cm TL in the North Atlantic, females mature at about 170–195 cm TL in the Southern Hemisphere and 200–219 cm TL in the North Atlantic (Jensen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Natanson<em> et al. </em>2002, Francis and Duffy 2005, Francis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Forselledo 2012). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous and oophagous with litters of 1–5 (usually 4), with a 8–9 month gestation period, an annual, but possibly biennial, reproductive cycle, and size at birth of 68–78 cm TL (Francis and Stevens  2000, Francis <em>et al</em>. 2008, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Regional differences in bomb radiocarbon validated age estimates are apparent from the Northwest Atlantic and Southwest Pacific. Female age at maturity is 13 and 16.5 years and maximum age is 26 and 60 years; generation length is therefore 19.5 and 38.3 years, respectively (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2002, Francis <em>et al.</em> 2007, Francis 2015). Population growth rate is low but is countered by high juvenile survival rates to produce an overall moderate population growth rate in the North Atlantic of 0.052–0.081 (Dulvy <em>et al. </em>2008, Cortés <em>et al. 2</em>015).","<p>The Porbeagle is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of large-scale pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters. It may also be captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, as well as on rod on reel, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Northeast Atlantic stock has the longest history of commercial exploitation with the highest catches during the 1930s and 1950s (ICCAT 2010).<br/></p>  <p>Porbeagles are often retained for their meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), although fishing and/or retention is prohibited in some areas<em>. </em>Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). The post-release mortality on commercial longlines has been reported as 10–75%&#160;(Campana <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;</p>","There are no data available on the absolute global population size of the Porbeagle. Genetic data support two separate subpopulations of the Porbeagle, the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere (Kitamura and Matsunaga 2010, Testerman 2014). No genetic structure was found within the North Atlantic or Southern Hemisphere subpopulations (Testerman 2014). <br/><br/>Population trend data are available from four stock assessments: (1) Northwest Atlantic (ICCAT 2010); (2) Canadian Northwest Atlantic (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2013); (3) Northeast Atlantic (ICCAT 2010); and, (4) Southern Hemisphere risk assessment (Hoyle <em>et al. </em>2017). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>First, the Northwest Atlantic stock assessment bycatch surplus production (BSP) model indicated that in 2009 the biomass was 37% of that in 1961, but that with the currently low fishing mortality and an apparent increase in biomass in recent years, the stock is slowly recovering, although recovery could take decades due to the low productivity of Porbeagle (ICCAT 2010). The trend analysis of the biomass for 1961–2009 (49 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.8%, consistent with a median reduction of 65.2% over three generation lengths (58.5 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the Canadian Northwest Atlantic stock assessment age-structured model indicated that the 2009 biomass was 22–27% of that in 1962, but that in recent years reduced quotas have halted the decline and the number of mature females is increasing (Campana <em>et al. </em>2013, Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2016). The trend analysis of the Canadian biomass for 1962–2009 (48 years)  revealed steep annual rates of reduction of 4.2%, consistent with a median reduction of 90.7% over three generation lengths (58.5 years), with the  highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Both Northwest Atlantic stock assessments have led to the conclusion that the Porbeagle stock is overfished but overfishing is currently not occurring (SCRS 2014, Curtis <em>et al. </em>2016).<br/><br/> Third, the Northeast Atlantic stock assessment estimated that the 2009 biomass was 6% of unexploited biomass, although this estimate is uncertain, and that the stock is overfished but overfishing is not occurring (ICCAT 2010). Since 2010, the Total Allowable Catch in the Northeast Atlantic has been set to zero and since converted to a prohibition, to help the stock recover (SCRS 2014). The trend analysis of the biomass for 1926–2009 (84 years)  revealed annual rates of reduction  of 1.8%, consistent with a median reduction  of 56.5% over three generation lengths (58.5 years), with the  highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fourth, the risk assessment model of the Southern Hemisphere population indicated that fishing mortality is low, decreasing eastward from South Africa to New Zealand, and that there is a very low risk the population is subject to overfishing (Hoyle <em>et al.</em> 2017). Catch rate indicators showed stable or increasing catches across most of the Southern Hemisphere (Hoyle <em>et al.</em> 2017). The trend analysis of the modeled relative abundance for 1962–2015 (54 years) revealed modest annual rates of reduction  of 0.2%, consistent with a median reduction of 19.9% over three generation lengths (114.9 years), with the highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths. <br/><br/>Across both subpopulations, the Porbeagle was estimated to have  strongly declined in the North Atlantic and to have declined, but to a  far less degree, in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic  subpopulation reduction was 50–79% over three generations (58.5 years) and the Southern Hemisphere subpopulation reduction was &lt;20%  over three generations (114.9 years). To estimate a global  population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for  each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region;  the two sources of Northwest Atlantic data were used to generate two  global trends. The overall estimated median reduction was 26.5%, with  the highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generations.  However, this global trend was strongly influenced by the Southern Hemisphere trend, as this accounts for a larger proportion of the global distribution. E<span lang=""EN-US"">xpert judgement&#160;elicitation&#160;was used to estimate that globally, the reduction  is 30–49% over three generations (58.5 and 114.9 years) and therefore, the  Porbeagle is assessed globally as Vulnerable A2bd.",Decreasing,"The Porbeagle has an anti-tropical and disjunct distribution, occurring in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere in temperate and cold-temperate waters (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Porbeagles do not occur in the North Pacific, where they are replaced by the congener, the Salmon Shark (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>) (Francis <em>et al. </em>2008).","<p>The Porbeagle is used for its fins, liver oil, and high-quality meat (Francis <em>et al.</em> 2008, Hernandez <em>et al.</em> 2008). Together with the Salmon Shark, the two species accounted for 0.2% of the fin imported in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018). In some counties, such as Spain, Porbeagle meat accounts for a significant proportion, at 15%, of all shark meat imported annually (Dent and Clarke 2015).<strong></strong></p>",Marine,"<p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking.   </p><p>In 2008, the Porbeagle was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Parties’ commitments to work regionally toward conservation. The species is also covered by the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks, which is aimed at facilitating conservation. In 2013, the Porbeagle was added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which requires CITES Parties to ensure that exports be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. </p>  <p>In 2010, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted a ban on directed fishing for Porbeagle that has since been renewed several times. The current (2016) measure runs through 2019 and applies to the NEAFC Regulatory Area (high seas). The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) designated the Porbeagle as a “Key Shark Species” in 2010, but has yet to set Porbeagle fishing limits. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Porbeagle and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow. In 2015, to address depletion in the North Atlantic, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)&#160;adopted a requirement for prompt, careful release of Porbeagles retrieved alive in ICCAT-managed fisheries. ICCAT also pledged to consider additional measures if future Porbeagle catches exceed 2014 levels. </p>  <p>To prevent overfishing and allow recovery, it is recommended that Porbeagles be subject to regional and national catch limits based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, as well as improved reporting of catch data (including discards), efforts to minimize bycatch mortality, and full implementation of all commitments agreed through international treaties.</p>","",,false,false,Global

2373922,195069,Patagonotothen ramsayi,Data Deficient,,2020,2019-12-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has a relatively small range on the continental shelf and slope of the southern part of the Patagonia Sea where it plays an important ecological role as a prey item for larger marine species. The majority of its global population is concentrated in southern Argentina, including the Malvinas Islands, where the main fishing ground is located. One generation length is estimated as 10 years. It is relatively slow-growing and late to maturity with relatively low fecundity, which may cause it to be susceptible to declines when facing heavy fishing pressure. Previous to 2006, it was mostly discarded as bycatch in large quantities beginning in the 1980s. A large-scale, commercial fishery began in 2007 in the Malvinas area. In areas outside the Malvinas closer to the Argentine mainland, it is taken in fisheries in relatively small amounts. According to stock assessment models based on catch per unit effort data and fishery independent trawl surveys, the estimated biomass for the period of 2005 to 2018 was highest in 2005 and then declined by 79% to a low in 2018. According to the 2019 and 2020 survey results, biomass has continued to decline.&#160;Biomass trends prior to 2005 are poorly understood, but based on these data, it is suspected that its population has declined by 40-50% on a global-level over the past one and a half generation lengths, or 15 years. In addition, declines in length at maturity and average length of individuals in the survey catch have also occurred. The cause of decline is poorly understood, but may be attributed in part to fishing activity or a shift in the spatial distribution of its abundance to areas adjacent to the Malvinas. Several fishery management measures are in place, catches have been at a relatively low level and it is not considered overfished. Due to the uncertainty associated with the cause of decline and lack of data prior to 2005, it is not possible to estimate the population trend to cover a three generation length period (either in the past or into the future) at this time. It is listed as Data Deficient with a strong recommendation to conduct studies to improve the understanding of this decline both within the Malvinas area and areas adjacent to it.","This benthopelagic species inhabits the continental shelf and slope on both sandy and rocky areas. It plays an important ecological role as a prey item to many larger fish predators (Laptikhovsky&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;According to fecundity studies by Brickle<em> et al</em>. (2006), fertility is relatively low (J.M. Díaz de Astarloa&#160;pers. comm.&#160;2019). The maximum total length is 41 cm. Spawning occurs on the continental shelf break. Longevity is 14 years and length and age at first maturity is 27.6 cm for males and 24.8 cm for females and approximately 5 years (Brickle<em> et al.</em> 2006). When applying an age at first reproduction of 5 years and longevity of 14 years, its estimated generation length is 10 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.","Overfishing is a potential major threat. This species is relatively slow growing and late to maturity with relatively low fecundity, which may cause it to be susceptible to declines when facing heavy fishing pressure.","This species is common and abundant off southern Argentina, but less common off Chile. It has a particularly high abundance in the Namuncurá Burwood Bank Marine Protected Area Plateau (J.M. Díaz de Astarloa pers. comm. 2020).&#160;The main fishing ground for this species is located in the Malvinas area, and is taken in relatively small amounts in areas closer to the Argentine mainland. Fishing fleets that operate in international waters off Argentina also take this species.&#160;It is not targeted by fisheries in the Pacific part of its range nor in the northern part of the Atlantic range (Uruguay) as it is less common in those areas (C. Buratti, J.M. Díaz de Astarloa and M. Hüne&#160;pers. comm. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The Malvinas stock of Southern Blue Whiting (<em>Micromesistius australis</em>) collapsed in 2004-2007 primarily due to overfishing, and following this, the catches and catch per unit effort of this species (Rock Cod) increased by 20-30 fold between 2002-2004 and 2009-2011 (Laptikhovsky <em>et al.</em> 2013). Large amounts of landings of this species were taken by the fisheries operating on the shelf and slope of the Malvinas between 2006 to 2015. Catch peaked in 2010 at 76,451 t and declined thereafter with a particularly steep decline occurring after 2015 to a low of 2,213 t in 2018. Since the fishery began in 2007, catch per unit effort increased until 2010 before declining thereafter. However, effort has been difficult to estimate as this species is not always the main target and has a patchy distribution that varies annually in the area. Vessels may choose to target Hake and/or Kingclip as they have a higher market value than this species. <br/><br/>Abundances estimates have not been made in any region other than the Malvinas Islands (C. Buratti pers. comm. 2020). Fishery independent scientific trawl surveys have been conducted throughout the Malvinas area since 2010, but were not carried out in the years 2012-2014. The mean length of individuals of this species captured in these surveys declined over time from 22 cm in 2010 to 18 cm in 2020. Length at maturity also declined from 2003 to 2018. These declines are inferred to be caused by fishing pressure (Winter 2019). Survey biomass peaked in 2011 at&#160;1,090,655 t and then declined by 98% to a low of&#160;22,335 t in 2020, or over one past generation length (Ramos and Winter 2020). Modelled biomass has been estimated for the time period from 2005 to 2018. Biomass was highest in 2005 at about 1,250,000 t and mostly declined thereafter to about 265,000 t in 2018, which represents a 79% decline over the past one and a half generation lengths, or 15 years. Biomass trends of this species prior to 2005 are poorly understood. The most recent stock assessment concluded that the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring, but recognized there has been an 8-fold decline in the stock since at least 2005. Despite the situation that fishery catches have been at a relatively low level, no recovery in the stock has been detected&#160;(Winter 2019). The continuing decline in biomass may be due to changes in its distribution, but in general, the cause appears to be poorly understood (Ramos and Winter 2020).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the southeastern Pacific from Isla Madre de Dios, Chile (about 50°S) to Cape Horn and in the southwestern Atlantic from Argentina to Uruguay, including the Malvinas Islands and Burdwood Bank at 55°S&#160;(Brickle <em>et al</em>. 2005, Irigoyen<em> et al.</em> 2018). It has also been recorded in the South Georgia Islands and off the eastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (iDigBio database accessed May 2020). The depth range is 50-500 metres.","This species is targeted and sold for human consumption in Tierra del Fuego and the Malvinas Islands. Since the 1980s, it has comprised a large proportion of the bycatch in squid and finfish trawl fisheries (La Mesa <em>et al.</em> 2016). Previous to 2006, it was typically discarded due to its low commercial value (Laptikhovsky and Arkhipkin 2003, Brickle<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2006), but is now directly targeted by commercial fisheries operating on the shelf off the Malvinas (Arkhipkin <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Marine,"Fishing effort is regulated through an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) licensing system, total allowable catch limits, seasonal and area closures and gear restrictions.

45224547,2062,Arctocephalus tropicalis,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Subantarctic Fur Seals should be listed as&#160;Least Concern despite a decline at one of the three major subpopulations. This decline is recent, relatively slow (a mean annual rate of -6.4 % for the period 2002/03 – 2012/13), and its causes are not yet understood. Abundance of the other major subpopulations is inferred to be stable. The global population was estimated to be over 400,000 animals in the early 2000s. About 99% of pup production occurs at three sites, with small subpopulations found at five other sites. Of concern is the absence of recent complete assessments of abundance for two of the major subpopulations, which together comprise an estimated 74% of the global total. No subpopulations are isolated and movement takes place between them. No subpopulation, nor the species as a whole, is likely to become extinct in the near future. The effects of global climate change on Fur Seal habitat, and the abundance and distribution of prey species, is a possible threat. This especially true in light of the reduced genetic diversity of this species as a result of the population bottleneck it was subject to. Other threats, including the impact of fishing industries and entanglement in anthropogenic debris, remain low.</p>","Subantarctic Fur Seals are sexually dimorphic, with adult males being up to 1.8 m long and weighing 70-165 kg, adult females are 1.19-1.52 m long and weigh 25-67 kg, with a mean of around 50 kg. Newborns weigh 4.0-4.4 kg (Laws 1993). Females attain sexual maturity at five years of age (Bester 1995). Gestation lasts 51 weeks. Longevity is unknown (Reijnders <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1993).<br/><br/>Subantarctic Fur Seals are polygynous, males defend territories with vocal and postural displays and fighting (Bester 1981, Kerley 1983). They prefer rough rocky or boulder beaches with sources of shade or exposure to prevailing winds (Bester 1982). Pups are born from late October to early January, with a peak in mid-December. Females give birth within six days of arriving at the colony with oestrous and mating occurs eight to 12 days later. Females spend the time between the births of their pups and oestrous with their newborn before mating and departing for the first of a series of foraging trips they will make before weaning their pup at approximately 11 months of age (Bester 1981,&#160;Kerley 1983,&#160;Goldsworthy 1999). Trip durations of mothers increase over the course of lactation from six to 10 days to 23-28 days (Goldsworthy 1999,&#160;Georges and Guinet 2000,&#160;Kirkman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002). Dives become deeper and slightly longer over the summer. Dives are seldom deeper than 100 m (but up to 208 m) or longer than four minutes (Georges <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2000). Foraging behaviour varies between subpopulations (Robinson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002, Beauplet <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004,&#160;Bailleul&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005,&#160;de Bruyn <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Subantarctic Fur Seals are opportunistic and pelagic foragers. They feed on myctophid and notothenid fish, cephalopods, and small numbers of crustaceans at Gough Island (Bester and Laycock 1985), the Prince Edward Islands (Klages and Bester 1998, Makhado <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013), Macquarie Island (Goldsworthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1997, Robinson <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2002) and the Isles Crozet (Cherel <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007, Kernaléguen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2012). At Amsterdam Island they have been recorded to take Rockhopper Penguins (Paulian 1964).<br/><br/>Subantarctic Fur Seals are sympatric with other species of Fur Seals at three sites. Low levels of hybridization with Antarctic Fur Seals occurs at the Prince Edward Islands (Hofmeyr <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2006a) and the Îles Crozet (Kingston and Gwilliam 2007). Hybridization&#160; occurs with both Antarctic Fur Seals and New Zealand Fur Seals at Macquarie Island (Lancaster&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Goldsworthy <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Lancaster <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em>&#160;2010).","Similar to all of the other southern Fur Seals, Subantarctic Fur Seals were over-exploited by sealers in the 18th and 19th century and were reduced to the brink of extinction at the beginning of the 20th century. Since then their population has increased rapidly and they have reoccupied much of their former range (Bester 1987,&#160;Kerley 1987, Roux 1987,&#160;Guinet <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994). While the abundance of two of the major subpopulations are thought to be stable (Guinet <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994,&#160;Bester&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;SCAR EGS 2008), that of the third has recently decreased (Bester <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Wege <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in prep.). Wege <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (in prep.) suggest that this may be due to the effects of density dependent food limitation on adult female fecundity. It is also possible that climate change has played a role in the decline. Climate change is potentially detrimental to Fur Seals through impacts on the abundance and distribution of prey species and changes in environmental conditions (Learmonth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Kovacs <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012, McDonald <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012,&#160;McBride&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Few fisheries take place in waters occupied by this species but fisheries may expand in their range (Hanchet <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003). Anthropogenic marine debris, primarily from the fishing industry is responsible for entanglements. At the Prince Edward Islands incidences of debris entanglement are less than one percent for the combined Antarctic/Subantarctic Fur Seal populations (Hofmeyr <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2002).<br/><br/>Fur seals are also at risk of mass mortality from infectious diseases because of they congregate in large numbers, and because they were subject to a population bottleneck that has reduced their genetic variation (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990, Wynen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2000). The isolation of their breeding habitat, however, affords them some degree of protection (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990,&#160;Chown <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1998). The small recovering population at Macquarie Island is at risk from predation by New Zealand Sea Lions and hybridization (Robinson <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1999,&#160;Goldsworthy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).","The global population of Subantarctic Fur Seals was estimated to be greater than 400,000 animals in the early 2000s (SCAR EGS 2008). Subantarctic Fur Seals breed at numerous sites on eight islands or island groups, and approximately 99% of Subantarctic Fur Seals breed at three of those sites. Some 63% of global pup production is estimated to take place at Gough Island (Bester <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006), 25% at the Prince Edward Islands (Hofmeyr <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006a,&#160;Bester&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009,&#160;Wege <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> In prep) and 11% at Amsterdam Island (Guinet <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1994). Pup production at other sites is a few tens or hundreds at each site (SCAR EGS 2008). These estimates are subject to two provisos. First, of the five islands within the Îsles Crozet, the abundance of Fur Seals has been determined only on Île de la Possession (Guinet <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1994). Second, due to the nature of their terrestrial habitat and the isolation of their haulout sites, determining Subantarctic Fur Seal abundance is difficult and it is often inferred from counts of small portions of a subpopulation (Guinet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994,&#160;Bester <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). &#160;<br/><br/>The estimated abundance of the three main subpopulations has increased over the last few decades and is currently either largely stable or decreasing. The Gough Island subpopulation was stable or had increased slightly between 1975 and 2005, as inferred from counts of selected sites (Bester <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006). The Amsterdam Island population was inferred to be stable between 1982 and 2002, also based on counts of selected sites (Guinet <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1994, Guinet pers. comm. in SCAR EGS 2008). More recent estimates of abundance are needed for both Gough and Amsterdam Islands. Complete pup counts indicate that Subantarctic Fur Seal abundance at both islands within the Prince Edward Islands (PEI) increased steadily from 1981 to the early 2000s (Bester <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Hofmeyr <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006a). However, pup production at Marion Island (within the Prince Edward Islands) declined by 6.4% between 2003/2004 and 2012/2013 (Wege <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep.). At Prince Edward Island itself, pup production remained very close to stable between 2001/2002 and 2008/2009 (0.3% mean annual decline; Bester <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009) but it is unknown whether it has since experienced a reduction since then like that at Marion Island. Early evidence indicates that the decline at Marion Island might have been due to a reduction in female fecundity following a density dependent limitation of prey resources (Wege <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep.).<br/><br/>Generation length has been calculated at 10.7 years (Pacifici <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Population change over the three generations from 1981–2012 has been positive (Guinet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1994, SCAR EGS 2008,&#160;Bester <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Wege <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> in prep.).",Stable,"<p>Subantarctic Fur Seals are widely-distributed in the southern hemisphere. They breed on Subantarctic islands north of the Antarctic Polar Front, including Amsterdam and Saint Paul Islands (Guinet <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1994), the Îsles Crozet (Kingston and Gwilliam 2007), Gough (Bester <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006), Macquarie (Goldsworthy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Lancaster <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006), the Prince Edward Islands (Bester <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Hofmeyr <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2006a) and Tristan da Cunha (C. Glass pers. comm. in SCAR EGS 2008). Pupping has also been recorded on Heard Island (a single individual in multiple years; Goldsworthy and Shaughnessy 1989, Page <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2003). Vagrants have been recorded widely. They have been encountered on the coasts of a number of continents: Antarctica (Shaughnessy and Burton 1986), southern South America (Bastida&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;199, 9Aguiar-dos Santos and Haimovici 2001), Africa (Shaughnessy and Ross 1980, Bester 1989), as far north as Tanzania (Hofmeyr and Amir 2010), Gabon (Zanre and Bester 2011) and Australia (Gales <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 1992, Shaughnessy <em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em> 2014).

45226422,10340,Hydrurga leptonyx,Least Concern,,2015,2015-01-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most recent circumpolar estimate of Leopard Seal abundance indicates a total population of more than 35,000 individuals, but this is likely a substantial underestimate. There is no indication of a declining trend in the population, although abundance estimates have considerable uncertainty around them and consequently trend is unknown. Leopard Seals depend on sea ice for reproduction and at some time in the future they could be adversely affected by a reduction in sea ice due to continued climate warming. Leopard Seals are currently a widespread and abundant species that does not qualify for any of the IUCN threatened categories, and they should be listed as Least Concern.","Adult male Leopard Seals are 2.8 to 3.3 m long and weigh up to 300 kg. Adult females are 2.9 to 3.6 m, with very large animals possibly reaching 3.8 m, and weights of 260 to upwards of 500 kg. Pups are 1.0 to 1.6 m in length and weigh 30 to 35 kg at birth. The age at sexual maturity is probably four years for females and 4.5 years for males. Longevity is estimated to be over 26 years (Kooyman 1981, Rogers 2009). <br/><br/>At sea and on the ice, Leopard Seals tend to be solitary. Pups are born on sea ice from early November to late December and the period may be as long as early October to early January (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2003). Births at South Georgia occur from late August to the middle of September. Pups are probably weaned at four weeks old, and female oestrous occurs at or shortly after weaning. Unlike Crabeater Seals, male Leopard Seals do not haul out with female-pup pairs. Mating is believed to occur in the water, but has never been observed.<br/><br/>Leopard Seals are well known for preying upon penguins. However, their diet is in reality highly varied and changes with seasonal and local abundance of prey. Leopard Seals will consume krill, fish, squid, penguins, a variety of other types of seabirds, and juvenile seals including Crabeater, Southern Elephant and Fur Seals (Rogers 2009, Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the case of Antarctic Fur Seals, it has been proposed that predation of Leopard Seals on pups might have a significant role in driving population dynamics of the prey species in certain areas (Schwarz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Most prey are caught in the water. Penguins are usually held in the Leopard Seal's teeth by one end and slung in an arc with a rapid snap of the head and neck and smashed on the surface of the water until they are torn open. Smaller pieces are then swallowed. Young, newly fledged naïve penguins are most vulnerable, but adult birds are taken as well. Leopard Seals patrol and regularly station themselves just off Penguin colonies and wait to ambush and chase animals transiting to and from the colonies (Rogers and Bryden 1995).&#160; Krill may be a seasonally important prey (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1988). <br/><br/>There have been few studies of Leopard Seal diving. Two seals tagged with satellite-linked dive recorders&#160;dove&#160;mostly to 10-50 m, and the deepest dive recorded was 304 m (Nordøy and Blix 2009).","There are currently no major threats from human activity within the species’ normal range.&#160;<br/><br/>Learmonth <em>et al</em>. (2006) list the effects of global climate change on Leopard Seals as unknown. However, loss of sufficient areas of pack ice habitat suitable for pupping, resting and avoidance of predators, and availability of preferred prey such as Penguins, other Seals, Krill and fish that might all possibly decline, could effect Leopard Seals directly or indirectly to an unknown degree. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rises, on Antarctic ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as Seals are unknown.&#160;Siniff <em>et al</em>. (2008) suggested that similar to Crabeater Seals, Leopard Seals would be less affected by changes in sea ice than Ross or Weddell Seals. <br/><br/>Two species of Antarctic ice seals, Leopard and Crabeater, have tested positive for antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV). The effects of an outbreak of this or other diseases on Leopard Seals either as a disease within this species, or repeatedly transmitted to it from an outbreak in a prey species such as the Crabeater Seal, are unknown. Leopard Seals are generally solitary except when females attend their pup or when pairs mate, so transmission of disease within the species would likely be slow or only seasonally significant. CDV is believed to have arrived in the Antarctic with sled dogs before the advent of vaccines. A mass mortality of Crabeater Seals occurred in 1955, with many animals displaying viral illness symptoms prior to death, but the exact cause of death is unknown (Bengtson and Boveng 1991).<br/><br/>Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessels passage, and close approaches by people in small boats and on land on Leopard Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is also a risk of injury to a small number of animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessels passing through ice fields.<br/><br/>There are no reports of significant fisheries interactions. Commercial harvest of Krill may pose direct or indirect threats to Leopard Seals, if conducted on a large scale.","The Leopard Seal is a widespread species and, similar to the other Antarctic seals that inhabit the pack ice, population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct and therefore undertaken infrequently. Published global population estimates from many decades ago range from 100,000-300,000 (Scheffer 1958) up to 220,000-440,000 animals (Laws 1984). However, these early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. An analysis of ship and aerial sighting surveys carried out around the continent between 1968 and 1983 provided a point estimate for global Leopard Seal population size in the pelagic pack ice of the Southern Ocean of 300,000 animals (Erickson and Hanson 1990). The most ambitious and coordinated effort to date, the Antarctic Pack-Ice Seal (APIS) project, conducted aerial and shipboard surveys around the continent during 1996-2001, and also included deployment of satellite-linked dive recorders to investigate haulout behaviour. APIS surveys resulted in an estimate of 35,500 (95% CL 10,900-102,600) Leopard Seals in the surveyed areas (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). All estimates have considerable uncertainty associated with them, and only very large changes in Leopard Seal population size could be confidently detected from repeated surveys (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2008).",Unknown,"Leopard Seals are widely distributed in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters of the Southern Hemisphere, occurring from the coast of the Antarctic continent northward throughout the pack ice and at most sub-Antarctic islands. There is a seasonal presence of juveniles at Kerguelen and Macquarie Islands with the greatest numbers being sighted in September and October (Rounseveld and Eberhard 1980,&#160;Borsa 1990). Vagrants regularly reach warm temperate latitudes.&#160;Leopard Seals&#160;haul out on ice and on land, often preferring ice floes near shore when they are available (Kooyman 1981).","Small numbers of Leopard Seals have been taken for research purposes and some were previously killed for dog food, but otherwise there is no current or past significant catch of this species (Reijnders&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993).",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Leopard Seal is not listed as endangered or threatened on any national Red List.

45226713,11696,Leptonychotes weddellii,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-02 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Due to its widespread occurrence, large population size and lack of major threats, the Weddell Seal is classified by IUCN as Least Concern.</p>","Adult male Weddell Seals reach 2.9 m in length, while females reach 3.3 m. Adults in their prime weigh 400-450 kg, with females being somewhat heavier than males, sometimes reaching over 500 kg (Stirling 1971). Adult female weight fluctuates dramatically during the year with significant weight loss occurring after birth and during lactation. Newborns are about 1.5 m long and average 29 kg. Females become mature at three to six years of age and males at seven to eight years. The annual pregnancy rate of mature females is 70-80%. Gestation lasts 11 months, including a delay of implantation of two months. Longevity is approximately 25 years (Stirling 1971, Reijnders <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990).<br/><br/>Weddell Seals breed in areas of predictable stable fast ice or on land, allowing them to form loose aggregations (or breeding colonies) at specific sites (Siniff 1981, Testa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). Weddell Seal pups are born from October through November. Adult females nurse their pups for a prolonged period (seven to eight weeks), and although they fast during the first one to two weeks, adult females do forage during lactation (Stirling 1971). Pups are born earlier at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes (Testa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). Females enter oestrus approximately one week before weaning their pup, and copulation occurs underwater, where males maintain territories by controlling access to breathing holes and cracks. Adult Weddell Seals display strong site fidelity, with both males and females returning to the same breeding colony. When in the shore-fast ice habitat, Weddell Seals tend to congregate in loose groups along recurrent cracks, leads, and near access holes to the water (Siniff 1981). The behaviour of animals breeding in the pack ice or in the Sub-Antarctic islands is not well known. <br/><br/>Satellite data on movement patterns of Weddell Seals have increased during the last decade, providing a clearer picture of their distribution patterns. Weddell Seals habitat utilization and habitat patterns vary largely at a regional scale, showing large differences in the scale of their movements (tens to hundreds of km) depending on the area they inhabit (K. T. Goetz pers. comm., Heerah <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Further, there seems to be large individual variability in their patterns of habitat usage, with some individuals staying in close proximity to their breeding colonies (e.g., McMurdo Sound), whereas others venture into the pack ice, likely exploiting polynyas and areas of thinner sea ice. The data available on newly weaned and subadult animals seem to indicate that younger animals move north from the continent and spend the winter in the pack ice. <br/><br/>The diving behaviour of Weddell Seals has been well studied, particularly at McMurdo Sound. They can reach depths of over 600 m, and can undertake dives of at least 82 minutes, feeding primarily feed at depths of 100–350 m, with a diurnal feeding pattern (Testa 1994). Weddell Seals are generalist predators, and their diet likely varies at a regional scale. Their diet primarily consists of notothenoid fish (Icefishes), particularly the Antarctic Silverfish which largely dominates in the diet in certain areas (Burns <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998), but also includes Antarctic Toothfish, Myctophids and Cephalopods. Although Weddell Seals in fast ice areas are relatively protected, animals in the pack ice are vulnerable to predation by Killer Whales and Leopard Seals (Stirling 1969a, Visser <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). <br/><br/>Weddell Seals that remain in fast ice areas abrade and grind the ice to maintain access to and from the water. They bite at the ice and then rapidly swing the head from side to side to grind away the ice with their teeth (Stirling 1969ab). Such behaviour, though, comes at a cost, as Seals living in areas where extensive grinding of ice is necessary have accelerated wearing down of their teeth and decreased life expectancy (Stirling 1969b).","At present, there are no immediate or significant threats to the Weddell Seal.<br/><br/>The potential effects of global climate change on Antarctic seals are largely unknown. Sea ice provides habitat used for pupping, resting, avoidance of predators and access to preferred foraging areas. Learmonth <em>et al.</em> (2006) suggest that Weddell Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. In contrast, Proffit <em>et al.</em> (2007), reported that the localized cooling and increased sea ice extent in the Ross Sea was associated with decreased reproduction and lower weaning mass of Weddell Seals in McMurdo Sound. Further, the fact that some populations breed on land (e.g., at South Georgia), could demonstrate an ability in the species to colonize different environments, although the extent of such plasticity is uncertain. Thus, the overall effects of global climate change on Weddell Seals are unknown.<br/><br/>Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessels passage, and close approach by people in small boats and on land or ice, on Weddell Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is also a risk of injury to a small number of animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessel passage through ice fields. Currently there are no reports of significant fisheries interactions. However, the development of new fisheries in Antarctic waters, particularly one targeting the Antarctic Toothfish, could have an impact on Weddell Seal nutrition, and potential operational interactions should be considered in the management plans.","<p>The global population of Weddell Seals has been variously estimated at 200,000 to 1,000,000 individuals (Erickson and Hanson 1990, Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012), although there is large uncertainty in these figures. Weddell Seals are a widespread species and population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct, and are therefore infrequently undertaken. Southwell <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported on results from the Antarctic Pack-Ice Seals program which conducted extensive surveys during 1996-2001. They estimated 633,000 Weddell Seals in two of their survey sectors. In the third sector fast ice was not surveyed and Weddell Seal abundance was not estimated.&#160;</p>",Unknown,"<p>Circumpolar and widespread in the Southern Ocean, Weddell Seals are the world’s southern-most breeding mammal and occur in large numbers on fast ice, right up to the shoreline of the Antarctic continent. They also occur offshore in the pack ice zone north to the seasonally shifting limits of the Antarctic Convergence. A small population lives all year on South Georgia. Weddell Seals are present at many islands along the Antarctic Peninsula that are seasonally ice-free. Vagrants have been recorded in many areas north of the Antarctic in South America, New Zealand and southern Australia (Kooyman 1981, Rice 1998).</p>","Weddell Seals served as an important source of food for men and dogs throughout the early periods of Antarctic exploration (Stirling 1971) until the final removal of dogs from the continent in the 1990s. Local populations no doubt suffered declines from these harvests, but the Murdo Sound population has recovered in the 30 years since harvests ended in the 1980s (Testa and Siniff 1987).",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>The Weddell Seal is not listed as endangered or threatened under any national Red List.

45226918,12246,Lobodon carcinophaga,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its widespread occurrence and very large population size, the Crabeater Seal should remain classified by IUCN as Least Concern.","Adult Crabeater Seals reach 2.6 m in length and weigh an estimated 200-300 kg. Neonates are thought to be at least 1.1 m and 20-40 kg. The mean age of sexual maturity in females varies from 2.5 to 4.2 years and these variations may be related to changes in food abundance (Bengtson and Laws 1985,&#160;Hårding and Härkönen 1995). Annual adult mortality is about 3-10% (Boveng 1993). Crabeater Seal births occur mainly during the second half of October. They do not use specific rookeries. Instead, adult females haul out singly on an ice floe where they give birth, and they are joined by a male shortly after (Siniff <em>et al</em>. 1979, Adam 2005). Adult males attend female-pup pairs and stay with the female until her oestrous begins one to two weeks after the pup is weaned. Mating has not been witnessed and presumably occurs in the water.<br/><br/>Pups are born from September to December (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2003) in a soft woolly coat that is greyish-brown in colour and has been described as light, milk coffee brown, with darker colouring on the flippers. Adult females fast during lactation, and wean their pups after an average of three weeks (Southwell 2004, Adam 2005) at which time pups are moulting from the lanugo coat into a sub-adult pelage similar to that of the adult. Adults and subadults moult in January and February, and a large proportion of the animals in an area are thought to be hauled out during the annual moult.<br/><br/>Mortality is high in the first year, possibly reaching 80%. Much of this mortality is attributed to Leopard Seal predation, and up to 78% of Crabeaters that survive through their first year have injuries and scars from Leopard Seal attacks (Siniff and Bengtson 1997). The presence of long scars and sets of parallel scars that are readily visible on the pale, relatively unmarked pelage of Crabeaters, are testimony to the frequency of these attacks on young of this species. Leopard Seal attacks appear to fall off dramatically after Crabeaters reach one year of age (Siniff and Stone 1985).<br/><br/>Recent research has revealed that Crabeater Seals can dive up to 600 m and stay submerged for 24 minutes, although most feeding dives occur within the top 50 m, and are shorter in duration (Burns <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008). Foraging occurs primarily at night (Bengtson and Stewart 1992), and instrumented seals have been recorded to dive continuously for periods up to 16 hours. Dives at dawn and dusk are deeper than at night, and indicate that Crabeater feeding activity is also tied to the daily vertical migrations of Krill. They have a general pattern of feeding from dusk until dawn, and hauling-out in the middle of the day.<br/>Crabeater Seals feed primarily on Antarctic Krill, <em>Euphausia superba</em>, which accounts for over 90% of their diet, with the remainder made up of fish and squid. New information indicates that the diet composition of the Crabeater Seal can display some plasticity, and they can compensate when Krill availability decreases by incorporating more fish (&gt;25% of their diet; Hückstädt <em>et al</em>. 2012). All of the post-canine teeth are ornate, with multiple accessory cusps that interlock to form a network for straining Krill from the seawater. A ridge of bone on each mandible fills the gap in the mouth behind the last upper post-canine teeth and the back of the jaw, which helps prevent the loss of Krill from the mouth when feeding.<br/><br/>Crabeater Seals are frequently encountered alone or in small groups of up to three on the ice or in the water. Much larger groups of up to 1,000 hauled-out together have been observed. They can be seen swimming together in herds estimated to be up to 500 animals, breathing and diving almost synchronously.","There are currently no direct threats from human activity throughout most of the species’ normal range.<br/><br/>A mass die-off of Crabeater Seals was reported from an area near a research base on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1955 (Laws and Taylor 1957). About 3,000 animals were trapped in areas five to 25 km from open water and most died over a two to three month period. None of the animals examined appeared to be starving, and numerous abortions of foetuses were noted. A disease outbreak was suspected, but never identified. Antibodies to canine distemper virus were found in Crabeater Seals from this area in 1989 (Bengtson <em>et al.</em> 1991).<br/><br/>The effects of global climate change on Antarctic seals are unknown. Learmonth <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggest that Crabeater Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. Loss of sufficient areas of pack ice habitat used for pupping, resting, avoidance of predators, and access to preferred foraging areas because of changes from warming could lead to population declines. The loss of sea ice has the potential to negatively impact Crabeater Seals given their high level of specialization on Antarctic Krill. Sea ice coverage is of particular importance for the survival of juvenile stages of Krill, and ultimately determines the biomass of adult Krill that is available for higher trophic level predators. It is unclear whether Crabeater Seals might be able to switch from their highly specialized, Krill-based diet, to a more generalist strategy with rapid loss of sea ice. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rise, on Antarctic Ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as seals are unknown.<br/><br/>Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessel passage, and close approach by people in small boats and on land on Crabeater Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is a small risk of injury to animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessel passage through ice fields.<br/><br/>There are no reports of significant interactions between Crabeater Seals and fisheries. Commercial harvest of Krill may pose a threat to Crabeater Seals, if it ever becomes established at a large scale.","The Crabeater Seal is a widespread species, and, as is the case for other Seals inhabiting the&#160;Antarctic&#160;pack ice, population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct and therefore infrequently undertaken. Published global population estimates range from two million (Scheffer 1958) up to 50-75 million animals (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 1971). However, early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. The most recent available data, obtained during the multi-national effort conducted under the umbrella of the Antarctic Pack Ice Seal program in the late 1990s, provided a population size estimate of approximately 8,000,000 animals for the area surveyed (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). Considering that major areas of the pack ice around the continent were not surveyed, there is a large uncertainty regarding the actual population size of the species. Yet, Crabeater Seals are considered to be one of the most abundant seal species (if not the most abundant) and one of the most numerous large mammals on Earth.",Unknown,"The distribution of Crabeater Seals is tied to seasonal fluctuations of the pack ice. They can be found right up to the coast and ice shelves of Antarctica, as far south as the Bay of Whales (Lindsey 1938), during late summer ice break-up. They occur in greatest numbers in the seasonally shifting pack ice surrounding the Antarctic continent. As vagrants they travel as far north as New Zealand and the southern coasts of Africa, Australia and South America. Crabeater Seals have been known to occasionally wander far inland and die in the dry valleys adjacent to McMurdo Sound. A live animal was found 113 km from open water at an elevation of 920 m asl, and carcasses have been found as high as 1,100 m asl (Kooyman 1981, Rice 1998).",Several brief episodes of commercial harvesting of Crabeaters ended when they were determined to be economically unsuccessful.,Terrestrial|Marine,The Crabeater Seal is not listed as endangered or threatened on any National Red List. Crabeater Seals are protected by the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals and any future commercial harvest would have to be regulated through these international agreements (Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993).,Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
45227247,13583,Mirounga leonina,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Estimates of Southern Elephant Seal abundance indicate a global pup production of over 200,000 at some 15 islands or island groups. However recent estimates are lacking, including for the largest subpopulation. Global abundance is inferred to have been stable or to have increased over the past three generations. While 50% of pup production is estimated to take place at South  Georgia, four other sites each support more than 5% of global pup production. Three of those sites have experienced decreases over the past three generations that are not fully understood. While decreases have ceased at two of these sites, they continue at a third. In the light of the unknown effects of global climate change on this species, and the age of estimates of abundance for some subpopulations, demographic monitoring is imperative. This species continues to qualify for listing by IUCN as Least Concern.</p>","Southern Elephant Seals are the largest of all pinnipeds with adult males reaching masses of two to four tons and lengths of up to 4.5 m. They show considerable sexual dimorphism, with adult females only reaching masses of 400-900 kg and average lengths of 2.8 m. Newborn pups weigh between 40 and 46 kg (Laws 1993). Females first haul out to pup at ages of three to six years, and males typically breed for the first time at six to ten years of age (Laws 1956,&#160;Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a, Jones 1981,&#160;McCann 1981,&#160;Pistorius&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001,&#160;Kirkman <em>et al.</em> 2004). At Marion Island, less than 5% of females survived beyond 13 years of age, and less than 5% of males beyond 10 years of age (de Bruyn 2009). Longevity of 23 years has been recorded for adult females at Macquarie Island (Hindell and Little 1988).<br/><br/>Southern Elephant Seals undergo an annual double migration between foraging grounds and isolated haulout sites, at which they are born and where they breed in the austral spring, moult in the austral summer, and as immatures haulout in the winter (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1960, Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962b, Hindell and Burton 1988). Southern Elephant Seals are predominantly marine. Adult females spend more than 85% of each year at sea while adult males spend less than 80% (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a, Hindell and Burton 1988, McIntyre <em>et al.</em> 2010). Their foraging grounds may be located over 5,000 km from their terrestrial haulout sites (Bester and Pansegrouw 1992, Jonker and Bester 1998,&#160;Campagna&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999,&#160;Bailleul&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).<br/><br/>Southern Elephant Seals spend most of their at-sea time foraging in association with frontal systems, currents and shifting marginal ice-edge zones. Studies of foraging sites suggest that they are sensitive to fine-scale variation in bathymetry and ocean properties (sea-ice concentration and sea temperature profiles) (Bailleul <em>et al.</em> 2007, Biuw <em>et al.</em> 2010). Southern Elephant Seals are prodigious divers. Dive depth and duration vary during the year and between the sexes, but mostly range from 200 to 700 m deep and from 20 to just over 30 minutes in duration (Biuw <em>et al.</em> 2010, McIntyre <em>et al.</em> 2010). Both sexes spend over 65% of their lives below 100 m. The maximum record dive depth is 2,133 m for an adult male (McIntyre <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>The diet varies between populations and seasons. It consist primarily of myctophid and notothenid fish and squid (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1999,&#160;Piatkowski&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002,&#160;Bradshaw&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;van den Hoff&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;Cherel <em>et al.</em> 2008, Newland <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Four types of terrestrial periods are experienced over the course of their lives: the breeding, moult and winter haulouts, and the natal terrestrial period. The mating system is mate-defense polygyny. Breeding seasons are highly synchronized (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962b, Laws 1956, McCann 1981,&#160;Bonner 1989). Adult females spend approximately a month ashore during the breeding season, while adult males may spend one to three months ashore. During this time adult females will haul out in large aggregations that may contain up to a thousand animals (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a,&#160;Bonner 1989). Some three to seven days after females come ashore they give birth to a single pup, which they will suckle for some three weeks. Mating takes place shortly before the pup is weaned and the adult female returns to the sea a few days later. Breeding aggregations are ephemeral, and do not last beyond the breeding season. Access to all females in one breeding aggregation is defended by a dominant adult male. In larger breeding aggregations, subdominant males also gain access to females (Laws 1956,&#160;Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a, McCann 1981).<br/><br/>Killer Whales are the primary predators of Southern Elephant Seals (Reisinger <em>et al.</em> 2011) but Leopard Seals are also known to take pups (Gwyn 1953).","<p>Southern Elephant Seals face few threats and conflicts today, since they live far from human population centres and have minimal interactions with commercial fisheries. Intensive fishing could, however, deplete important prey stocks (Hanchet <em>et al</em>. 2003). The possible effects of global climate change on Southern Elephant Seals are not well known but such changes may negatively impact prey populations or change marine habitat (Learmonth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is also possible that a reduction in sea ice due to climate change may benefit Southern Elephant Seals (van den Hoff <em>et al</em>. 2014). Southern Elephant Seals that haul out at mainland sites could come in contact with domestic and wild animals and be exposed to a variety of diseases including morbilliviruses (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990).</p>","No recent comprehensive estimate of Southern Elephant Seal abundance is available throughout the entire distribution. The worldwide population was estimated to be 650,000 in the mid 1990s (SCAR EGS 2008). Four distinct populations have been identified in the Southern Ocean (Gales <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989, Hoelzel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993, Slade <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1998). While the movement of breeding individuals between these populations is rare, it does occur (Fabiani <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Reisinger and Bester 2010). These populations include subpopulations at or close to Argentina (Peninsula Valdés and the Falkland Islands), in the Atlantic sector (South Georgia, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, Bouvetøya and Gough Island), in the Indian sector (Iles Kerguelen, Iles Crozet, Heard Island and the Prince Edward Islands) and in the Pacific sector (Macquarie Island, Campbell Island and Antipodes Island). A further four historical populations are extinct, likely due to exploitation: St. Helena Island, Tristan da Cunha, Islas Juan Fernández and the Bass Strait (Bester 1980, Carrick and Ingham 1962, Wace and Holdgate 1976). A subpopulation from Victoria Land on the Antarctic coast became extinct a few hundred years prior to human discovery (Hall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>While Southern Elephant Seals breed at 14 islands or island groups, five of these are responsible for 99% of pup production. More than 50% of pup production takes place at South Georgia (Boyd <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, M. Fedak pers. comm. in SCAR EGS 2008), with Isle Kerguelen responsible for some 21% (Authier <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011) and the Peninsula Valdes, Heard Island and Macquarie Island each responsible for greater than 5% (Lewis <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1998, Slip and Burton 1999, van den Hoff <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>The Peninsula Valdes/Falkland Island colonies have increased in recent times (Lewis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998,&#160;Galimberti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, SCAR EGS 2008). Colonies in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean are also growing or stable (Boyd <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Galimberti <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001,&#160;SCAR EGS 2008,&#160;Gil-Delgado <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). In contrast, those in the Indian Ocean (Guinet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999,&#160;Slip and Burton 1999,&#160;Pistorius&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004,&#160;Bester and Hofmeyr 2005, de Bruyn 2009,&#160;Pistorius <em><em><em>et al.&#160;</em></em></em>2011) and Pacific Ocean (van den Hoff <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, 2014) sectors have been either stable or decreasing to the mid 1990s. However, recent cessations of decrease, and increases, have been recorded at island groups in the Indian Ocean sector (McMahon&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009,&#160;Authier <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Pistorius <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011). This is not true for the Macquarie Island subpopulation, the only substantial population within the Pacific sector (van den Hoff <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Numbers of adult females in this subpopulation declined at a mean annual rate of -0.8% between 1988 and 2011, and continued to do so through 2014.<br/><br/>The causes of these declines are debated. They are not completely understood and may differ between populations but evidence indicates that the low survival of adult females (Pistorius&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004,&#160;de Bruyn 2009, Pistorius <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>&#160;2011, van den Hoff <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014) or of pups (McMahon and Burton 2005, McMahon <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005ab) is important. Survival of both adult females (Pistorius <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, van den Hoff <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014) and pups (McMahon and Burton 2005, McMahon <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005b) varies interannually with climatic conditions. The low survival of adult females may be due to the effects of the limitation of food on an age and sex class that is responsible for successfully weaning offspring, and migrating to distant foraging grounds to recover from terrestrial fasts (Pistorius <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, van den Hoff <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014) whereas the low survival of pups may be due to low weaning mass and also reduced food availability to naïve, and therefore vulnerable, animals (McMahon <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, 2005a).<br/><br/>Generation length has been calculated at 9.5 years (Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). Population change over three generations from 1982–2009 is inferred to have been stable or positive (SCAR EGS 2008,&#160;Authier 2011, Pistorius <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, van den Hoff 2014).",Stable,"Southern Elephant Seals have a nearly circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean. While most haulout sites are on Subantarctic and Antarctic islands, a number of animals haul out regularly at sites on the coasts of southern Argentina and Chile (Campagna and Lewis 1992) and Antarctica (Bester 1988, Heimark and Heimark 1986, Murray 1981). They forage at sea between about 40° south and the Antarctic Continent. Occasional vagrants have been recorded on the coasts of northern South America (Alava and Carvajal 2005, De Moura <em>et al</em>. 2010), southern Africa (Kettlewell and Rand 1955, Oosthuizen <em>et al</em>. 1988), Australia and New Zealand (Mills <em>et al</em>. 1977, Taylor and Taylor 1989). The most distant vagrant was recorded at Oman on the Arabian Peninsula, some 9,000 km from the nearest possible point of origin (Johnson 1990).","Southern Elephant Seals were hunted for thousands of years by aboriginal and native peoples in Australia and South America. More recently, they were subject to intensive commercial harvests starting in the early 19th century and not ending until 1964 at South Georgia (McCann 1985). They were prized for their large quantity of blubber that could be rendered to fine, valuable oil (Laws 1960). The commercial harvesting of Southern Elephant Seals ceased in 1964 and they have not been subject to exploitation since (McCann 1985).",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>Any future exploitation of Southern Elephant Seals within the Antarctic Treaty area (south of 60°S) is regulated by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, while north of this area the Convention on Antarctic Marine Living Resources and various national measures apply to the islands and continental areas on which the species breeds and occurs. The Falkland Islands Dependencies Conservation Ordinance provides protection for Southern Elephant Seals on South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993). Seals on the Prince Edward Islands are protected by virtue of these islands status as a special nature reserve, their location within a marine protected area, and also by the South African Seabirds and Seals Protection Act (PEIMP 2010).</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
45228952,15269,Ommatophoca rossii,Least Concern,,2015,2014-09-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most recent circumpolar estimate of Ross Seal abundance indicates a total population of over 78,000 individuals.<strong> </strong>There is no indication of a declining trend in the population. However, abundance estimates are somewhat dated and have considerable uncertainty around them and therefore, the population trend is unknown.<strong> </strong>Ross Seals depend on sea ice for reproduction and at some time in the future they could be adversely affected by a reduction in sea ice due to continued climate warming. The Ross Seal is a widespread and abundant species that does not qualify for any of the IUCN threatened categories, thus they should be listed as Least Concern<strong>.</strong><br/><em></em>","At maturity, Ross Seals are the smallest of the four Antarctic phocids. Based on a small sample of measured animals, Ross Seal males reach 1.68-2.09 m in length and 129-216 kg and females are slightly larger at 1.96-2.5 m in length and 159-204 kg. It is estimated that pups are about one metre and 16 kg at birth; eight suckling pups examined in November were 109-138 cm in length and 40-75 kg. Age at sexual maturity is thought to be three to four years for females and two to seven years for males (Ray 1981). Adults reach final body size at approximately nine years of age and can live to at least 20 years (Skinner and Klages 1994).<br/><br/>Most pups are born in November, with a peak from early to mid-November (Southwell <em>et al.</em> 2003). Weaning takes place at about one month of age, although little is known of the relationship between mother and pup. Nursing pups have been seen swimming between ice floes so they appear to be aquatic to some degree. Mating is thought to occur in the water, but has not been observed. Although this species has been presumed to be polygynous, genetic studies do not support this hypothesis and indicate a monogamous mating system (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2011). Moulting is believed to occur in January, at which time many Ross Seals appear to fast (Skinner and Klages 1994), and moulting seals can form large aggregations on ice floes. During summer Ross Seals exhibit a diel haulout pattern with most seals hauled out on the ice at midday (Ray 1981, Bengtson and Stewart 1997, Southwell 2003). Satellite tracking suggests that Ross Seals are pelagic foragers, spending months in the open ocean foraging in association with the Antarctic Polar Front&#160; and returning to the pack-ice to breed in October-November (Blix and Nordøy 2007).<br/><br/>Recent work using electronic devices to monitor at-sea behaviour of Ross Seals has revealed that the species dives continuously throughout the day (average of 108 dives per day), frequently reaching depths of 100–300 m, and displays a clear diel pattern in their diving depth. The deepest dive recorded for the species was 792 m, while the longest dives were over 30 minutes in duration (Blix and Nordøy 2007). The diet of Ross Seals is largely unknown, but the limited available data indicate that they eat mostly squid, with lesser amounts of fish and some invertebrates including krill (Ray 1981, Southwell <em>et al.</em> 2012). Skinner and Klages (1994) identified only Antarctic Silverfish (<em>Pleurogramma antarcticum</em>) in 20 animals examined; no other fish were present. Several species of squid were also recorded in this latter study, but many stomachs were empty when the animals were collected in January, suggesting that this species eats little or fasts entirely during the post-breeding moult period.<br/><br/>Killer Whales and Leopard Seals are presumed to be predators of the Ross Seal.","Ross Seals are typically found hauled out in dense consolidated pack ice and can usually only be reached by icebreakers. Small numbers of animals have been collected for commercial purposes, scientific studies and museums, but otherwise interactions with humans have been few. When wandering outside the pack ice zone, Ross Seals could come in contact with commercial fishing operations, but there are no reports of interactions to date.<br/><br/>Ross Seals have antibodies to phocine herpesvirus confirming some exposure, but in the only available study they did not have antibodies to <em>Trichinella</em>, <em>Toxoplasma</em>, or phocine distemper virus (Tryland <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Our very limited knowledge about the species makes it difficult to make any projections about how global climate change might affect the Ross Seal. However, Learmonth <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggest that Ross Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. Siniff <em>et al</em>. (2008) suggest that they will be among the least impacted of the Antarctic seals because they do not feed in sea-ice covered areas. Climate change will affect them when loss&#160;of sufficient areas of consolidated ice habitat used for pupping, resting, and avoidance of predators comes to a critical level. Further, due to their pelagic nature, reductions of sea ice would imply longer travel distances to reach their preferred foraging areas. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rises on Antarctic Ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as seals are largely unknown.","Ross Seals typically haul out in dense consolidated pack ice and are spread over large geographic areas. As these areas can usually only be reached by ice-breaking ships or long-range aircraft, it is difficult to estimate population size and trend with high certainty. Published global population estimates range from 20,000-50,000 (Scheffer 1958) up to 220,000 animals (Gilbert and Erickson 1977). However, early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. Analysis of ship and aerial sighting surveys carried out around the Antarctic Continent between 1968 and 1983 provided an estimate for the global population of Ross Seals in the pelagic pack ice of the Southern Ocean in the order of 130,000 animals (Erickson and Hanson 1990). No indication of the uncertainty around that estimate was given. The most ambitious and coordinated effort to determine abundance of this species to date was the Antarctic Pack-Ice Seal (APIS) project which conducted aerial and shipboard surveys around the continent during 1996-2001. This international programme also included deployment of satellite-linked dive recorders to investigate haulout behaviour. APIS surveys resulted in an estimate of 78,500 (95% CL 39,400-231,200) Ross Seals in the surveyed areas (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). Given the uncertainty in the estimates, only gross changes in Ross Seal population size could be confidently detected from repeated surveys (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2008). New data from genetic studies estimating the effective population size of the species indicate a larger population size for the Ross Seal than that estimated using traditional population size surveys (Curtis <em>et al</em>. 2011), but those methods have not been rigorously tested.",Unknown,"Ross Seals have a circumpolar distribution in Southern Ocean waters surrounding Antarctica. In the summer, they are usually seen in dense consolidated pack ice where they haul out to breed, moult and rest. Satellite tracking suggests that Ross Seals spend several months each year foraging in the open ocean in association with the Antarctic Polar Front (Blix and Nordøy 2007). Vagrants have been reported from many sub-Antarctic islands including the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orknies, and Falkland, Scott, Kerguelen and Heard Islands, as well as from southern Australia (Rice 1998, Thomas 2002).",This species is not used at present.,Terrestrial|Marine,"Ross seals are protected by the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, and are not listed as threatened or endangered on any national Red List.",Antarctic,,false,false,Global
50349982,2478,Balaenoptera physalus,Vulnerable,A1d,2018,2018-02-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The cause of the population reduction in Fin Whales (commercial whaling) that occurred in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is reversible, understood, and has been brought under control. For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The current global population size is uncertain due to lack of data from major parts of the range, especially from mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, rigorous evaluation against the criteria is not possible. However, plausible projections of the global mature population size indicate that it has probably recovered to over 30% of the level of three generations ago (1940) (i.e., reduction of &lt;70% over the last three generations) but has not necessarily yet reached 50% of that level; therefore, the Red List category is changed from Endangered to Vulnerable. It is important that existing data on abundance and distribution be worked up, and that data be collected in the areas where it is currently lacking, in order to verify to what extent the predicted recovery has occurred.&#160; <span class=""MsoCommentReference""></p>","<p>The available quantitative evidence suggests that the Fin Whale is a generalist feeder, sometimes preying heavily on fish but mostly on crustaceans. In Icelandic catches, 96% contained krill only, 2.5% a mixture of krill and fish, and 1.6% fish only (Sigurjónsson and Víkingsson 1997), while only 1 of 267 Fin Whales caught in the northeast Pacific off British Columbia, Canada, contained fish (Flinn<em> et al. </em>2002), and over 99% of stomachs with food in the Antarctic contained krill (Kawamura 1994). On the other hand, Overholtz and Nicolas (1979) reported apparent feeding by Fin Whales on American Sand Lance (Sand Eel),&#160;<em>Ammodytes americanus,</em> in the northwest Atlantic, and Mitchell (1972) found that Capelin, <em>Mallotus villosus</em>, comprised 80-90% of prey in Fin Whales caught off Newfoundland. Capelin abundance is extremely variable over time, and Fin Whales may feed opportunistically on Capelin in years with high abundance.<br/><br/>The Fin Whale is the fastest of the great whales, being able to maintain speeds of over 10 ms<sup>-1</sup> or 20 kn (Bose and Lien 1989). The high speed is likely an adaptation to avoid predation by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em>, (Ford and Reeves 2008) rather than to catch fast prey, because maximum speeds associated with lunge feeding are thought to be below 5 ms<sup>-1</sup> (Potvin <em>et al</em>. 2009). The apparent lack of winter breeding aggregations may also be an adaptation to avoid predation of calves, in the context of a flight rather than fight strategy to escape predation.&#160;</p>","<p>Prior to the advent of modern whaling in the late 19th century, Fin Whales were not subject to much human predation because they were hard to catch, but they were depleted worldwide by commercial whaling in the 20th century. Fin Whales have been protected in the Southern Hemisphere and North Pacific since 1976, and catches ceased in the North Atlantic by 1990, except for small “aboriginal subsistence” catches off Greenland. Commercial catches resumed off Iceland in 2006, but none have been taken in 2016 or 2017. A Japanese fleet resumed experimental catches of Fin Whales in the Antarctic in 2005, but this also has been discontinued. It seems unlikely that catching of Fin Whales will return to the high levels of previous years, not least due to the limited market demand for whale products.<br/> <br/> Fin Whales are one of the more commonly recorded species of large whale reported in vessel collisions (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001, IWC 2018d). An average of 2 collisions per year between Fin Whales and vessels was recorded off the U.S. east coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although reported incidents have been very few relative to the abundance of the species, most collisions involving large vessels are probably not detected, and to date there has been no satisfactory quantitative assessment of the actual risk. There is concern that collisions in the Mediterranean, especially in the main summering ground of Fin Whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Lyon where there are high densities of both whales and vessels, may be frequent enough to impact the population there (Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are also subject to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Nine cases of entanglement were recorded off the U.S. coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2017). Five entanglements involving Fin Whales worldwide were reported to the IWC Scientific Committee in 2017 (Hughes 2018). Although not all countries report, and some incidents will be missed by those that do, it appears likely that, globally, the threat from entanglement is low relative to the overall abundance of the species.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic<br/></em></strong>The Fin Whale was not easily catchable by early whalers due to its size and speed, but was heavily exploited from the start of mechanized whaling in 1864, particularly off Norway, Iceland, the Faeroes, and the British Isles. Whaling then spread to Spain, Greenland, and eastern Canada, and exploitation continued at a lower level until the 1980s. Fin whaling was phased out in the 1980s except for small catches off West Greenland. Catches resumed off western Iceland in 2007, but no catches have been taken there since 2015 (IWC 2018a).<br/> <br/> Catch statistics for the early years are incomplete: some are not divided into species, and a significant number of whales,&#160;perhaps 30-50%,&#160;were killed but lost due to lines breaking, etc. (Johnsen 1959, IWC 2017). The International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee has produced “best” and “high” estimates of Fin Whale kills in the North Atlantic totalling 98,000 and 115,000 respectively (IWC 2017).<br/><br/>Over the last three decades several sets of surveys have been conducted in the North Atlantic in summer to estimates the abundance of Fin Whales and other cetacean species. The most recent abundance estimates for each area are: East Greenland coastal 6,440 (CV 0.26) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018); East Greenland (excl. coastal), Iceland, and Faeroes 40,788 (CV 0.17) in 2015 (NASS2015 surveys, Pike <em>et al</em>. 2016); Norway and Jan Mayen 6,409 (CV 0.18) in 1996-2001 (Øien 2009); UK waters, North and Irish Seas, French and Spanish Atlantic waters and coast of Portugal 18,142 (CV 0.35) in 2016 (SCANS III surveys, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017); Atlantic Canada 3,522 (CV 0.27) in 2007 (Lawson and Gosselin 2009); U.S. east coast 1,595 (CV 0.33) in 2011 (Palka 2012); West Greenland 2,215 (CV 0.41) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018). The available estimates total about 79,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.13.&#160;These figures do not include the waters to the west of Ireland, where Fin Whales are fairly abundant. Data collected in Norwegian waters during 2002-17 have&#160; yet (May 2018) to be worked up.<br/><br/>Compared with previous estimates, the latest estimates show a substantial increase for the East Greenland–Iceland–Faroes area but an annual rate of increase that takes survey differences into account has not yet been calculated. The estimates for the Spain–Portugal–France–British Isles area show little change over the years from the first estimate of 17,355 (CV 0.27) obtained in 1989 (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). The trends in U.S., Canadian, western Greenlandic, and Norwegian waters have yet to be determined.<br/><br/>The overall increase in North Atlantic Fin Whales may represent a continuing recovery from past whaling, but it has also been hypothesized that the recovery was already essentially complete by 2000 and that the latest increase is due to environmental changes (Víkingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><strong><em>Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>Within the Mediterranean, the Fin Whale population was estimated in 1991 from surveys covering much of the western basin at 3,583 (CV 0.27) (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1996). Given the relative rarity of Fin Whales in the Mediterranean outside this area, a total population of about 5,000 for the Mediterranean is plausible (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The relative abundance in the Pelagos Sanctuary in the Gulf of Lyon has been monitored since 2009 from ferries on fixed routes, but the counts are too variable to estimate a trend (Cominelli <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Catches of about 7,000 Fin Whales taken in and near the Straits of Gibraltar during the 1920s depleted the local abundance and may have reduced a population migrating between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Sanpera and Aguilar 1992).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em><br/></strong>Some Fin Whales were likely taken by pre-modern whaling in Japan although the different species of <em>Balaenopter</em><em><em>a</em> were not always distinguished (Omura 1986). </em>A total of 76,000 Fin Whales are recorded taken by modern whaling in the North Pacific during 1910-75 (Allison 2017). The total killed is likely to be higher, because many or most of the approximately 6,500 unspecified whales taken during 1900-09 may have been Fin Whales, and in the early years of modern whaling there were likely, as in the North Atlantic, a substantial number of whales that were killed but not successfully landed. Fin Whales were legally protected from whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific from 1976, but small catches, reported at the time as Bryde’s Whales (<em>Balaenoptera edeni</em>), continued off Korea until 1981. These whales were probably from the East China Sea population.<br/><br/>North Pacific Fin Whale stocks have not been assessed in depth by the IWC Scientific Committee since 1973, when the assessment by Ohsumi and Wada (1974) was accepted. It was updated by Allen (1977). The stock in the western North Pacific was estimated to have declined from an “initial level” of 44,000 to 17,000 in 1975. The figures refer to the “exploitable” population, i.e., whales above the minimum allowed size at capture. Although these assessments were based on indices of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) that did not meet modern requirements for the analysis of such data (IWC 1989), there is no doubt that the populations declined substantially.<br/><br/>There is currently no population estimate for Fin Whales in the North Pacific as a whole, but one may become available once existing data holdings are worked up. The abundance information for each area is summarized here.<br/><br/>In surveys conducted in the Okhotsk Sea in 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2015, the Fin Whale was consistently the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (Miyashita 2004, Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011; Minamikawa <em>et al</em>. 2012, Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016) but the data have not yet been worked up to produce an abundance estimate.<br/><br/>The area of the northwestern Pacific bounded by the 170°E meridian, the coast of Japan, and the border of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone adjacent to Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands, has been surveyed during 2002-2015 by vessels associated with the JARPN II (2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programme in the North Pacific) programme. An estimate of about 4,000 Fin Whales (CV 0.4) was derived from data collected in July-August 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016).<br/><br/>The area between the 170°E and 135°W meridians. bounded to the north by the coast of Alaska and the Aleutian chain, was surveyed by the POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) international cruise in July and August over the years 2010-2012 (IWC 2018c). The data have not yet been worked up to yield an abundance estimate for Fin Whales, but the counts show that Fin Whales were approximately as abundant as Sei Whales, for which an estimate of about 30,000 whales (CV 0.24) has been calculated (Hakamada <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>It is planned to survey the Bering Sea in three parts over 2017-2019 under the POWER programme (IWC 2018c). The eastern Bering Sea was covered in 2017, and the Fin Whale was the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (<a href=""https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan"">https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan</a>). The eastern Bering Sea had previously been covered by U.S. fishery surveys, yielding an estimate of 1,061 (CV 0.38) Fin Whales (Friday <em>et al</em>. 2013). Zerbini <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated the abundance of Fin Whales to be 1,652 (CV ~0.2) in the coastal waters south of the Alaska Peninsula, which is included in the area surveyed by the 2011-12 POWER. An estimate of 4.8% for the annual rate of increase over the period 1987-2003 was obtained with nominal confidence limits of 4.1%-5.4%, but subsequent recalculation of the variance from the data indicates much lower precision (95% confidence limits -1.6% to +11.1% per year) (IWC 2009). In a survey of the western Bering Sea in 2005, Fin Whales (along with Humpback Whales) were the most frequently encountered species, but no abundance estimate has been calculated (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Based on surveys conducted during 2004-08, Best <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated the abundance Fin Whales in the waters of British Columbia (Canada) to be 329 (95% confidence interval (CI) 274-395).<br/><br/>The summer abundance off the west coast of the continental U.S.A. (Washington/Oregon/California) is estimated to have been 9,029 (CV 0.12) whales in 2014, while the average rate of increase over 1991-2014 was 7.5% per year. (Nadeem <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, the variation around the trend line was greater than would be expected from sampling variance alone, suggesting that a variable proportion of the population is found in the area each year.<br/><br/>This genetically isolated Gulf of California subpopulation was estimated in 2004 from a mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data at 613 (CI 426-970) (Díaz-Guzman 2006). There are no data on population trend for this subpopulation.<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>Along with other baleen whales, the IWC has traditionally managed Southern Hemisphere Fin Whales on the basis of six management areas, Areas I through VI, which are longitudinal pie slices 50°-70° wide. The areas were originally chosen as putative management stocks for Humpback Whales, and later used for all baleen whales, with little or no biological support (Donovan 1991).<br/><br/> Over 725,000 Fin Whales have been recorded caught in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905-76 (Allison 2017). There was a series of assessments in the 1970s, including a synthesis by Chapman (1976) which was reassessed for Area I by Breiwick (1977), and updated for Areas II-VI by Allen (1977). A later reassessment of Area VI Fin Whales was inconclusive (IWC 1980). <br/> <br/> These assessments were based on a combination of evidence, including trends in CPUE by whaling fleets, sighting rates by Japanese scouting vessels, and inferences on recruitment and mortality rates from age and length data. Their reliability is questionable on various grounds. For example, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently determined that CPUE data should only be used for stock assessments when the nature of the whaling operations is fully described (IWC 1989). A reanalysis of the historical data using modern methods and insights is warranted.<br/> <br/> Regular sightings surveys in the Antarctic south of 60°S were conducted under the IDCR/SOWER programmes in summer during 1978-2010 (IWC 2018) and the JARPA/II (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programmes in the Antarctic) in summer during 1987-2014 (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, only 55% of the historic summer catch taken during 1904-76 occurred south of 60°S, the remainder having been taken mainly between 50°-60°S. Hence there is probably considerable abundance outside the surveyed areas.<br/><br/>Circumpolar estimates from the IDCR/SOWER surveys increased from 2,100 during 1978-91 (CV 0.28) to 5,100 (CV 0.52) during 1991-98 (Branch and Butterworth 2001) but the more recent data do not appear to have been worked up. An extrapolation of the abundance estimate for 1978-91 to the area south of 30°S using Japanese Scouting Vessel data from 1978-88 yielded a circumpolar estimate of 15,000 (no variance given) (IWC 1996). The Scouting Vessel data were not collected according to any kind of statistical design and should be interpreted with caution.<br/><br/>Estimates from the JARPA/II surveys covering just half the Antarctic from 35°E to 145°W (southern Indian Ocean and south-west Pacific sectors) increased from 5,000 (CV 0.15) in 1996 to 17,600 (CV 0.26) in 2008, but large inter-annual fluctuations in the abundance suggested that the proportion of the population within the surveyed area varied from year to year (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). Approximately three-quarters of the historical catch came from within the 35°E-145°W sector.<br/><br/>Other data sources cover only limited areas and lack long enough time series to estimate trends. As examples, Viquerat and Herr (2017) estimated abundances of about 500 and 800 Fin Whales around Elephant Island and the South Orkneys respectively.<br/><br/>The current circumpolar abundance remains highly uncertain until all existing data are worked up and more data are collected from the zone 50°-60°S. Overall the information suggests a substantial increase has occurred, but the rate of increase is poorly quantified. All estimates of the rate of increase have very low precision but are compatible with an intrinsic growth rate of around 4-5% per year as assumed in the latest assessments.<br/><br/><strong><em>Biological parameters and assessment</em><br/> </strong>Estimates of age at sexual maturity for female Fin Whales, based on observed proportions mature by age, are 6-7 years in the Southern Hemisphere from British catches in the 1960s (Lockyer 1972) and Japanese catches in the 1960s and early 1970s (Mizroch 1981), but these values are likely negatively biased due to selection against smaller animals. For the North Atlantic, Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. (2013) report a value for Fin Whales caught off Iceland of around 8 years during 1965-89, increasing to 14 years during 2006-10, although the sample size in the later years was small. Aguilar <em>et al</em>. (1988) estimated 7.9 years from catches off Spain during 1979-84. There do not seem to be any precise values for the North Pacific, but Kimura (Ohsumi) <em>et al</em>. (1958) estimated 8-12 years. For the purpose of this assessment, the age at first reproduction of 10 years (9 years for age at sexual maturity) as estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007 is assumed. The values of other biological parameters (age at first capture, net recruitment rate, and natural mortality rate) were taken from the previous IWC Scientific Committee assessments (IWC 2017, Allen 1977).<br/><br/>The generation time for a non-depleted Fin Whale population is estimated to be 25.9 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The 3-generation window for application of the&#160;Red List&#160;A criterion is 1940-2018.<br/><br/>Because the available published assessments for this Fin Whales are not up to date, an illustrative population assessment is conducted here to enable estimation of a plausible population trajectory over the period 1940-2018 relative to the A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, it is reasonable to use conventional population assessment methods to provide a crude indication of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (“recruitment”) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately.<br/><br/>Based on the above (incomplete) information, the following population numbers (total, including immature whales) are assumed for the purpose of this Red list assessment:<br/></p><ul><li>North Atlantic: 70,000 whales in 2015; <br/></li><li>North Pacific: 50,000 whales in 2011; <br/></li><li>Southern Hemisphere: 25,000 whales in 2008.</li></ul><p>The parameter values are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material (which forms an integral part of this assessment). The estimated global trajectory for the number of mature individuals indicates that the 2018 mature population size is about 100,000 whales and may be around 45% of the 1940 level, which implies a classification of Vulnerable under the A1 criterion. According to this trajectory, there had already been considerable decline prior to 1940, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. For completeness it should be noted that other models have been posited that imply an increasing Fin Whale population prior to 1940 in the Southern Hemisphere (Mori and Butterworth 2006) but the pre-1940 period does not affect the Red List assessment against criterion A.</p>",Increasing,"<p>Fin Whales occur worldwide, mainly, but not exclusively, in offshore waters of the temperate and subpolar zones (Edwards&#160; <em>et al</em>. 2015). They show some poleward migration in summer but appear to be present at some level throughout their range throughout the year. Fin Whales are considered rare or absent in most of the tropics but were hunted off Peru and Ecuador and in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century (Allison 2017), and are still occasionally observed in the tropics, for example off Peru (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009) and the Seychelles (Keller <em>et al</em>. 1982). There do not seem to remain any confirmed records from the northern Indian Ocean, after correcting misidentifications (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic and Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>In the North Atlantic, the Fin Whale’s range extends as far as Svalbard (Norway) in the northeast (but rarely far into the Barents Sea), to the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay (Canada and Greenland) in the northwest (but rarely into the inner Canadian Arctic), to the Canary Islands (Spain) in the southeast, and to the Antilles in the southwest (Rice 1998, Perry <em>et al.</em> 1999), but it is rare in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001), where the few recorded strandings may be extralimital vagrants (Whitt <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Their main summer range in the northwestern Atlantic extends from Cape Hatteras (U.S.A.) (39°N) northward (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). They occur in summer (and possibly year-round) west and east of Greenland, around Iceland and the Faroe Islands and along the Iceland-Faroes ridge, and to a lesser extent in the Norwegian Sea and around Jan Mayen (Øien 2009). They occur off the northern and western British Isles and in the Bay of Biscay off northwestern Spain but are rare in the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). They regularly occur off the Azores in spring (Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011) and have been detected acoustically west of Madeira (32°N) in winter (Castellotti <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>While there may be some north-south migration between summer and winter, it appears from acoustic data that at least male North Atlantic Fin Whales are present throughout most of the range throughout the year (Morano <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are present in the central and western Mediterranean, mainly north and east of the Balearic Islands, and appear to be a mixture of a resident population and one migrating between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic (Notabartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2016). The area of abundance seems to be concentrated in the Ligurian Sea and the Gulf of Lyon in summer, but expands to cover much of the western and central Mediterranean in winter. Fin Whales are rare in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, do not penetrate far into the Adriatic or Aegean Seas, and are not present in the Black Sea. In the 20th century, Fin Whales were caught year-round near the Straits of Gibraltar (Allison 2017) and observations in this century show Fin Whales leaving her Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar&#160; during May-October and (mostly) entering the Mediterranean during November-April (Gauffier <em>et al</em>. 2018); the observations of calves leaving the Mediterranean during May-July suggests they were born there.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific<br/></em></strong>In the eastern North Pacific, Fin Whales occur year-round off the central and southern California coast. They occur in summer off the entire coast of western North America from California into the Gulf of Alaska and along the Aleutian Islands. Fin Whales marked off California in winter were recaptured in summer by whaling operations along the entire coast, suggesting migration (Mizroch <em>et al</em>. 2009). Offshore, Fin Whales occur across the North Pacific north of 40°N, at least from May to September in summer, with some tendency for a northward shift in distribution in high summer, when they enter the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Melnikov <em>et al</em>. 2017) and are also found along the east coast of Kamchatka (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017) and between Kamchatka and the Commander Islands (Miyashita 2006). They also occur in the Sea of Japan (Miyashita 2006). Fin Whales occur in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and have recently been detected as far as Point Barrow in the northeastern Chukchi, which may be an indication of a northward expansion as the Arctic warms (Crance <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are abundant in the offshore western North Pacific north of about 35°N in summer, and in the coastal waters of Hokkaido and northeastern Honshu (Japan) (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2016), but in recent years have only rarely been seen off central and southern Japan or around the Korean peninsula at any time of year (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017, Sohn <em>et al</em>. 2012). Both are areas where large catches were taken in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Fin Whales in the East China Sea are thought to belong to a distinct subpopulation from those of the North Pacific (Fujino 1960), and it is possible that the Korean and southern Japanese catches came from this stock. There were a few net catches in the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait in the early 2000s (CRI 2005-07).<br/><br/>Fin Whales occur, albeit in small numbers, in Hawaiian waters in both summer and winter (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The winter distribution in the North Pacific poorly known. While there appears to be some migration, acoustic data suggest that overall there is little seasonality in distribution, but that there is seasonality in the amount of vocalization (Watkins <em>et al</em>. 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>The Fin Whales inhabiting the Gulf of California appear to be a resident, genetically isolated subpopulation (Bérubé <em>et al.</em> 2002). Telemetry information has shown year-round residency in this area, with seasonal latitudinal movements (Urbán <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Southern Hemisphere<br/></em></strong>Some Fin Whales penetrate into the high Antarctic, along with Blue (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), Minke (<em>B. bonaerensis</em>) and Humpback Whales (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>), but are rarely seen in the pack ice. The Fin Whale summer distribution also extends into middle latitudes, as evidenced by both sightings and past catches (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Allison 2017). Fin Whales were abundant in summer in the Southern Ocean from 40°S to Antarctica in the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian Ocean sectors, and south of 50°-55°S in other sectors. Recent (post-whaling) data on Fin Whales in the Southern Ocean are available mainly for the area south of 60°S: for example, the international circumpolar IDCR/SOWER surveys under the auspices of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1978-2009 (IWC 2019) which showed that Fin Whales were still distributed in all sectors of the Antarctic, but with a much reduced abundance (Branch and Butterworth 2001); more recently, surveys around the South Orkneys and the South Shetlands (Viquerat and Herr 2017, Joiris and Dochy 2013) found substantial local densities of Fin Whales.&#160;An area of suspected high Fin Whale density to the south of Bouvet Island (55°-57°S 0-5°E) was confirmed by a sighting survey conducted there in December 2006 (Ensor <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Large numbers of Fin Whales were caught by whalers operating out of whaling stations on South Georgia (55°S) during 1904-65, but the species was rarely seen there in the ensuing three decades (Moore <em>et al</em>. 1999). Sightings have become more frequent lately but have not yet been quantitatively evaluated (Richardson 2012).<br/><br/>Outside the Antarctic, Fin Whales were caught in substantial numbers off the southwestern and southeastern coasts of southern Africa in winter, and in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century were also taken in the coastal waters of Mozambique, Angola, Congo, and Gabon (Best 1994), but they are very rare on the western coasts of southern and equatorial Africa today (Weir 2010, 2011). Catch rates of Fin Whales off South Africa declined to near zero by the early 1970s coincident with the severe depletion by whaling in the Southern Ocean, which suggests that this was a wintering ground for a population that migrated to the south in summer (Best 2003).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught off the coast of Peru, mainly in the austral winter, until catches petered out in the early 1970s. Sightings of Fin Whales in the eastern equatorial Pacific since whaling ended in 1976 have been relatively few, in contrast to Blue Whales which continued to be sighted frequently (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Landa <em>et al</em>. 1983, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught from several stations along the coast of Chile from 20° to 44°S from the early 20th century until 1983, but very few were caught after 1970. Catches were taken in all seasons but few in winter; the whales were typically small, with a modal length of 16-17m for each sex, compared with 20-21m (males) and 21-22m (females) for Fin Whales caught by Antarctic fleets. Given the lack of genetic distinction between fin whales in Chile and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere (Pérez-Álvarez <em>et al</em>. 2018) and the recovery in the Antarctic of marks placed in Fin Whales off Chile (Clarke 1978), it is likely that the Chilean Fin Whales were juvenile Southern Fin Whales <em></em> rather than a race of small Fin Whales (Cooke 2019). In recent years, Fin Whales have been observed in nearshore Chilean waters from 23° to 29ºS during spring and summer and seen to be feeding there (Pérez <em>et al</em>. 2006, Pacheco <em>et al</em>. 2015, Toro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Toro <em>et al</em>. classed 502 out of 519 Fin Whale sightings around the Chanaral and Choros Islands (29°S) in summer and fall as ""adults"" but used a size criterion of 17m developed for the smaller North Atlantic Fin Whale; hence the ""adults"" could have included whales of any age class except calves of the year. Pacheco <em>et al</em>. reported two mother-calf pairs off northern Chile (Mejillones Bay, 23°S) in spring 2006.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are now rare in Brazilian waters, but there is virtually no information from the period before the depletion of the whales around South Georgia (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997). A few were taken in a brief period of whaling in southern Brazil in the early 1960s.<br/><br/>Apart from the above-mentioned wintering grounds, the winter distribution of Fin Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is poorly known. Some may remain in the far south while some may disperse into oceanic areas in temperate latitudes. Acoustic detections of Fin Whales in the Antarctic peak in the autumn (May) and are absent in winter and spring, but this may reflect seasonality of vocalization as much as presence/absence (Širović <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><strong><em>Other areas</em></strong><br/>The only confirmed records from Indonesia are two strandings in 1937 and 1975 (Rudolph <em>et al</em>. 1997), which may have been vagrants. A reported sighting off Sarawak (Malaysia) in 1999 (de Boer 2000) is unconfirmed.<br/><br/>The map shows where the species may occur based on a synthesis of occurrence records and oceanography. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are included in the list of native range states.</p>","<p>Large-scale commercial harvesting of this species appears to have ceased, the last catches having been taken in the Antarctic in 2012 and in the North Atlantic in 2015 (IWC 2018a) but frozen products are probably still in trade. The latest entry in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Trade Database was an export of 2,546 tonnes of Fin Whale meat from Iceland to Japan in 2014, but only 1,624 tonnes appear to have reached Japan (CITES 2017).</p>",Marine,"<p>The IWC set catch limits at zero for Fin Whales in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere starting in 1976. The IWC adopted a provision (popularly known as the commercial whaling moratorium) in 1982 to set all catch limits for commercial whaling to zero from 1986, but Iceland, Norway, and the Russian Federation have lodged objections or reservations to the provision. Limited hunting of Fin Whales off western Greenland is permitted for “aboriginal subsistence” purposes.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are listed on Appendix I of CITES, but this does not apply to Iceland, Norway, and Japan, who hold reservations. Fin Whales are also listed on Appendices I and II of the Convention on Management of Migratory Species (CMS).

It is therefore classified as Least Concern.&#160;</p>","The stomachs of the two&#160;Pygmy Right Whales taken by whaling operations of the former Soviet Union (Ivashin 1972) and a juvenile stranded individual (Sekiguchi <em>et al.</em> 1992) contained mainly calanoid copepods. Seasonal inshore movements of Pygmy Right Whales may be related to the availability of food in spring and summer (Kemper 2018). It has been suggested that there are hotspots of occurrence in places where mesozooplankton, particularly <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em> and <em>Calanus tonsus, </em>are abundant (Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2013).<p>  </p>  <p></p>","This poorly known species has never been targeted by commercial hunts although at least two Pygmy Right Whales were taken by whalers between 1960 and 1970 in the South Atlantic (Ivashin <em>et al.</em> 1972). Of the over 100 strandings documented in Australia and New Zealand since 1980, one appeared to have involved entanglement in fishing gear (Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2013). One carcass of a whale suspected to be have been killed by a ship strike was recovered in South Australia in 2008 (Australia 2008). Three animals were caught in nets in False Bay, South Africa during 1957-65, two of which were released (Ross <em>et al</em>. 1975). In view of the relatively low level of human activity in most of its range, this temperate Southern Hemisphere species is probably not threatened by human causes at this time.<p>  </p>","<p></p><p>  </p>The Pygmy Right Whale is one of the least known baleen whale species, and there are too few records to attempt an estimate of population size, even to an order of magnitude. The three sightings of large groups mentioned above represent the bulk of the recorded sightings of live individuals to date. Apart from these three schools, most sightings have been of one or two individuals, sometimes in association with other species of whales and dolphins. The inconspicuous, small blow and quick, shallow surfacing of Pygmy Right Whales make them difficult to spot and identify at sea, such that the species might not be as uncommon as the small number of records suggests.<br/><br/>As might be expected, recorded live sightings exhibit clustering around areas with substantial on-the-water human presence, such as Auckland, Hobart, and Adelaide. The greater frequency of sightings and strandings in the summer months may simply be due to a seasonal increase in observation effort. The time series of strandings in Australia and New Zealand from 1980-2007 shows no obvious trend&#160;with records&#160;in southern Australia&#160;from&#160;all months and in New Zealand from all months&#160;except February and March&#160;(Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2013).  <p></p><br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>The Pygmy Right Whale probably has a circumpolar distribution in temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere between about 30°S and 55°S (extending to 20°S in at least the Benguela Current (southwestern African continental shelf) (Hoffmann and Best 2005, Kemper <em>et al.</em> 2013). There are only a few confirmed records of live whales at sea, but strandings have been reported from Argentina, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Namibia, South Africa, Chile, western, southern, and eastern coasts of Australia, and North and South Islands of New Zealand (Cabrera <em>et al.</em> 2005, Best 2007, Kemper 2002, Kemper <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rice 1998, Ross <em>et al.</em> 1975).<br/><br/>Two Pygmy Right Whales were taken by a whaling vessel in the South Atlantic between 34° and 35°S (Ivashin <em>et al.</em> 1972). An aggregation of about 80 whales was seen in November 1992 at 42°S about 750 km south of Cape Leeuwin, southwestern Australia (Matsuoka <em>et al.</em> 1996). A group of 14 was sighted in January 2001 at 46°S in the South Pacific about 450 km southeast of Christchurch, New Zealand (Matsuoka <em>et al.</em> 2005).

However, given the estimated total population size (13,600 individuals in 2009; IWC 2013), and the 5-10 fold increase in the population since the 1970s, the species, although still scarce relative to its historical abundance, is not considered under threat at the hemispheric level. The population size is estimated to be larger now than it was three generations ago (87 years, assuming a generation time of 29 years; Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007). By IUCN Red List criteria, the species is assessed as Least Concern.  Some breeding subpopulations are still very small and may need special protection to survive. The very small population off Chile/Peru has been assessed separately and listed as Critically Endangered.<br/></p>","<p></p><p>Southern Right Whales have been well-studied on their wintering grounds, especially at Peninsula Valdés, Argentina, off the southern coast of Australia, and off South Africa. Researchers have used callosity patterns to identify individuals on these grounds, and have learned much about the Southern Right Whale's behaviour and reproduction. Calves are born from June to October with a peak in August after a 12-13 month gestation period (Best 1994). Females usually produce calves at 3-year intervals when these are successfully reared, but the interval can shorten to 2 years following perinatal loss of a calf, which often results in an apparent 5-year interval (Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2001, 2015; Leaper <em>et al.</em> 2006). In recent years off Argentina greater numbers of dead calves and a correspondingly greater number of documented two-year intervals have been observed (Rowntree <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sironi <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>  <p>Where feeding occurs north of 40°S the diet consists mainly of copepods, south of 50°S mainly euphausiids (krill), and varying proportions of the two food items at intermediate latitudes (Tormosov <em>et al.</em> 1998).&#160; Evidence from stable isotope analysis suggests that different individuals frequent different feeding grounds and that fidelity to feeding grounds is maternally directed (Morgana <em>et al</em>. 2014, Valenzuela <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>","<p>Like their congeners in the Northern Hemisphere, Southern Right Whales can die from entanglement in fishing gear and from ship strikes (IWC 2001). However, this does not seem to have impeded their recovery, at least in the main areas of abundance. The lower average density of human populations, and thus fishing, shipping, and other potentially harmful activities in the Southern Hemisphere, compared with the western North Atlantic, probably makes this species less affected by such activities than is the North Atlantic Right Whale (IWC 2013).<br/> <br/> Harassment by Kelp Gulls, <em>Larus dominicanus</em>, that gouge skin and blubber from the whales’ backs, is extensive in the Península Valdés nursery ground (Rowntree <em>et al.</em> 1998). This appears to be learned behaviour that has spread through the growing gull population that increased by 2.7% per year during 1994-2008 (Lisnizer <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is thought that the resulting wounds are a contributory factor in some calf deaths, and a number of mitigation measures have been proposed to reduce the rate of gull attacks on Southern Right Whales (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012, Marón <em>et al</em>. 2015) </p>  <p>There has been a marked increase since 2003 in stranded Right Whale carcasses in the two bays (Golfo Nuevo and Golfo San José) on Península Valdés, Argentina, where the whales congregate in the winter and spring. The number of carcasses found averaged 63 per year during 2006-2015, of which about 90% were newborn calves (Rowntree <em>et al</em>. 2013, Sironi <em>et al</em>. 2016). A number of possible factors in the calf deaths have been suggested, including nutritional stress, biotoxin exposure from harmful algal blooms (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2015), and harassment by from Kelp Gulls (IWC 2016). There has been concern that the level of mortality may be anomalously high (a “die-off”, ) (IWC 2011). However, a long-term analysis of calf mortality rates in this population showed that the rate has remained fairly low over most of the last 40 years, averaging around 18% with some inter-annual fluctuation but with recent levels not being unusually high&#160;(Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2015). For most cetacean populations, only a small proportion of&#160;dead animals are ever found (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011), but the geography of the Península Valdéz wintering ground with its two semi-enclosed bays likely facilitates the stranding and discovery of dead calves. This provides a unique opportunity to study the causes of calf mortality.</p>  <p>Observed correlations between breeding success off Argentina and sea surface temperature anomalies at South Georgia suggest that as Antarctic feeding grounds warm up, the average calf survival rate of Southern Right Whales would be expected to decline (Leaper <em>et al.</em> 2006). Off Brazil, reproductive success depends on body condition and therefore foraging success, which in turn are at least partly determined by climate-driven changes in krill density (Seyboth <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p>  The recent decline in Right Whales off South Africa, evident in single animals since 2010 and in cow-calf pairs since 2015, is unexplained (Findlay <em>et al</em>. 2017). No increases in sightings in other areas have been reported that might account for the missing whales. An as yet unidentified factor may threaten this subpopulation.","<p></p><p></p><p>  </p>  <p></p><p>Southern Right Whales were hunted extensively by pre-modern whaling starting in the early 17th century, but especially in the 18th and 19th centuries by American and European whalers. Not all records have survived, and there is uncertainty over the numbers of animals killed but not landed. The total number processed between 1770 and 1900 is conservatively estimated at about 150,000, of which 48,000-60,000 were taken in the 1830s alone. By the start of modern whaling at the beginning of the 20th century, the species was already rare, and catches thereafter until Right Whales were legally protected in 1935 totalled only about 1,000. Over 3,000 were taken illegally by Soviet whaling fleets mainly in the 1960s (Tormosov <em>et al.</em> 1998). The hemispheric population in 1770 is estimated to have been over 70,000 and to have been depleted to a low of about 300 animals by the 1920s. The species began to recover following protection in 1935, but the illegal Soviet catches in the 1960s are estimated to have removed over half of the remaining population and delayed recovery (IWC 2001, 2013).<br/></p><p>Four breeding populations of Southern Right Whales (southwest Atlantic – Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, southeast Atlantic – South Africa and Namibia; Australia; and southwest Pacific – New Zealand) have shown strong recoveries, with doubling times of 10-12 years (Bannister <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2016; Cooke <em>et al.</em> 2001, 2015; Best <em>et al</em>. 2001, Brandão<sup> </sup><em>et al</em>. 2013, Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2016). Two further suspected breeding populations (southeast Pacific – Chile and Peru, and southwest Indian Ocean – Madagascar and Mozambique) remain at very low numbers and show no clear evidence of any increase.<br/></p>  <p>The pan-hemispheric population was estimated to have reached 13,600 animals by 2009 and still to have been increasing strongly (IWC 2013). In recent years there has been evidence of a levelling-off of increase rates in the western South Atlantic (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 2017) and in western Australia (Bannister <em>et al</em>. 2016, IWC 2018). The southeast Atlantic population (South Africa and Namibia) appears to have declined sharply since 2015 for unknown reasons (Findlay <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/></p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>There can be substantial interchange of Southern Right Whales between breeding grounds off the same continent, for example between Argentina and Brazil (Groch <em>et al.</em> 2005), and some interchange between continents and major land masses, for example between Argentina and South Africa (Best <em>et al</em>. 1993) and Australia and New Zealand (Pirzl <em>et al</em>. 2009). As the populations recover the winter ranges of each population seems to have been expanding to include more of the historical range, for example, Argentina to Brazil (IWC 2013), Auckland Islands and Campbell Islands to mainland New Zealand (Carroll <em>et al</em>. 2014), and South Africa to Namibia (Roux <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recovery within regions has been uneven. The calving numbers in southwestern Australia have increased but they remain low in southeastern Australia despite the latter having been a major calving and whaling ground in the 1800s (IWC 2018).</p>  <p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Southern Right Whales have a circumpolar distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. The distribution in winter, at least of the breeding component of the population, is concentrated near coastlines in the northern part of the range. Major current breeding areas are off southern Australia, New Zealand (particularly Auckland Islands and Campbell Islands), Atlantic coast of South America (Argentina and Brazil), and southern Africa (South Africa and Namibia). Small numbers are also seen off central Chile, Peru, Tristan da Cunha, and the east coast of Madagascar (Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2001). In summer, Right Whales are found mainly in latitudes 40-50°S (Ohsumi and Kasamatsu 1986) but also occur in the Antarctic as far south as 65°S (Bannister <em>et al</em>. 1999) and around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (Nijs and Rowntree 2017). Movements of individuals between subantarctic waters in summer and winter calving grounds have been documented using photo-identification and satellite tracking (Bannister <em>et al</em>. 1999, Best <em>et al</em>. 1993, Pirzl <em>et al</em>. 2009, Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2016, Nijs and Rowntree 2017).</p>  The map shows where the species may occur based on oceanography.

It is common in some areas, but information on abundance and trends at the global scale is lacking. The difficulty of distinguishing this species from the Short-finned Pilot Whale (<em>G.&#160;macrorhynchus</em>) at sea in areas where the two species’ ranges overlap compounds the problem of obtaining reliable estimates for such areas. The total of all available abundance estimates for Long-finned Pilot Whales is approximately one million individuals, but large parts of the species' range in the Southern Hemisphere have not been surveyed and therefore actual abundance is likely to be considerably greater than this. </p>  <p>An ongoing hunt for Long-finned Pilot Whales that has been conducted for centuries in the Faroe Islands takes an average of about 850 individuals per year, but has not resulted in any detectable declines in abundance. Another hunt in Greenland appears to have been taking increasing numbers of Long-finned Pilot Whales in recent years, and although there is concern that takes exceed sustainable levels, declines have not been detected in this population either. &#160;</p>  <p>Other causes for concern (besides hunting) and threats throughout the species' range include incidental mortality from fisheries, anthropogenic sound (especially from military sonar and seismic surveys), and contaminants. These factors may be causing declines in abundance that have gone undetected in areas which have been poorly, infrequently, or never surveyed. The Long-finned Pilot Whale was listed on the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient in 2008 and the species remains data-poor in much of its range, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. However, these whales appear to be relatively abundant in many parts of their range, and apart from the substantial removals by direct hunting in the Faroes and Greenland, no threats are considered significant or pervasive throughout the range of the species. There is no indication of large-scale mortality (other than by mass stranding, which is characteristic of both species of <em>Globicephala</em>) or population declines at present, and therefore the species is listed on the Red List as Least Concern. However, the large takes in the Faroes that have occurred over many centuries may well have caused a significant reduction in abundance that has gone undetected in this highly social and wide-ranging species. Although fine-scaled population structure has not been detected, consideration should be given to separate assessment of the Southern Hemisphere and North Atlantic subspecies, with immediate priority given to the latter.</p><p></p>","<p>Primarily squid eaters, Long-finned Pilot Whales also take small and medium-sized fish, such as mackerel, when available (Gannon<em> et al. </em>1997<em>,</em> Santos<em> et al. </em>2014<em>,</em> Monteiro<em> et al. </em>2015). Other fish species taken include cod, turbot, herring, hake, and dogfish. They also sometimes eat shrimp (Gannon<em> et al. </em>1997).</p>  <p>In the western North Atlantic during winter and spring, Long-finned Pilot Whales occur in the highest densities over the continental slope. During late-summer and autumn the species’ distribution is more widespread throughout the waters over the shelf (Payne and Heinemann<em> </em>1993<em>,</em> Roberts <em>et al. </em>2016<em>,&#160;</em>Hayes<em> et al. </em>2017). In European Atlantic waters, Long-finned Pilot Whale sightings were distributed widely along the continental shelf edge and in oceanic waters, extending from the Strait of Gibraltar to the deep waters of the Rockall Trough around 60°N. No Pilot Whales were sighted in the North Sea or the Irish Sea. Depth, distance to the 2000 m depth contour, and latitude were found to be important variables for predicting abundance of Pilot Whale groups. This abundance was predicted to be highest in water depths &gt;1,000 m, was strongly associated with the 2,000 m depth contour, and showed geographic variation with latitude with a peak at 55°W (Rogan <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>The Alborán Sea is one of the most important areas for this species in the Mediterranean (Cañadas and Sagarminaga<em> </em>2000). In that area, the average depth of encounters was about 850 m (ranging from 300 to 1,800 m), reflecting the distribution of pelagic cephalopods in the region (de Stephanis<em> et al. </em>2008). Around the Faroe Islands, tracking studies showed a preference for deep waters beyond the continental shelf (Bloch<em> et al. </em>2003).</p>  <p>Off Chile, Aguayo <em>et al</em>.

Goodall and Macnie (1998) reported on sightings in the eastern South Pacific, which were clustered from 30-35°S and 72-78°W, at a maximum of about 160 nm from shore. In the western South Atlantic, sightings were clustered in two areas, 34-46°S and off Tierra del Fuego, 52-56°S, where schools were found up to 1,000 nm from shore. Fifteen sightings were from waters south of the Antarctic Convergence, from December to March. Only one sighting was made south of 44°S in winter, probably due to lack of effort in southern seas during the colder months&#160;(Goodall and Macnie<em> </em>1998).</p>","<p></p><p>The only current hunts for Long-finned Pilot Whales (at least in the Northern Hemisphere) are undertaken at the Faroe Islands and Greenland. While the drive hunt in the Faroe Islands has been actively pursued since the 9th century, catch levels have apparently not caused stock depletion (NAMMCO<em> </em>2014). Catch records from the Faroes go as far back as 1584, and the catch data series is unbroken since 1709 (Bloch 1994).&#160; Although there appear to be long-term cyclical changes in Pilot Whale availability to the Faroese hunters, no indication of a trend was detected in an analysis of the catch records (Bloch and Lastein 1995). The North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) Scientific Committee (2014) noted that under conservative assumptions a population of between 50,000-80,000 whales would be required to support the documented level of removals. NAMMCO is planning an in-depth assessment of North Atlantic Pilot Whales in 2019 (NAMMCO 2018a).</p>  <p>The hunt in Greenland appears to have been taking increasing numbers of Long-finned Pilot Whales in recent years (NAMMCO<em> </em>2018a). The Scientific Committee of NAMMCO (2014) noted that removals there exceeded sustainable levels given a 2007 abundance estimate. However, a 2015 abundance estimate for what is assumed to be the range of the hunted population was of similar magnitude to the 2007 estimate (NAMMCO 2016). </p>  <p>Long-finned Pilot Whales are subject to entanglement, hooking, and other forms of bycatch to varying degrees in a wide variety of fisheries across their range, although in most cases they are listed as one of the species affected in a particular fishery without any precise information on the number of animals taken (Reyes<em> </em>1991<em>,</em> Zerbini and Kotas<em> </em>1998<em>,</em> Leeney<em> et al. </em>2008<em>,</em> Culik<em> </em>2011<em>,</em> Verborgh<em> et al. </em>2016<em>,</em> Hayes<em> et al. </em>2017<em>,</em> Olson<em> </em>2018).</p>  <p>Pilot Whales, like beaked whales, are likely vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by military sonar and seismic surveys (Cox<em> et al. </em>2006<em>,</em> Parsons<em> et al. </em>2008<em>,</em> Sivle<em> et al. </em>2012<em>,</em> Parsons<em> </em>2017). High contaminant levels have been documented in several populations, including those in the Faroe Islands (Dam and Bloch<em> </em>2000<em>,</em> Nielsen<em> et al. </em>2000<em>,</em> Sonne<em> et al. </em>2010) and Tasmania (Weijs<em> et al. </em>2013), to the extent where their meat is considered a potential health hazard for human consumption if modest monthly recommended allowances are exceeded (Simmonds<em> et al. </em>1994).</p>  <p>Pilot Whales are among the species most often involved in mass strandings throughout their range, but it is not known whether human activity plays a role in these events (Hayes<em> et al. </em>2017). In some cases, disease, such as a morbillivirus epidemic in the Mediterranean, has been clearly implicated (Fernández<em> et al. </em>2008), but in other cases the cause(s) could not be attributed with certainty to any particular factor or set of factors (Bogomolni<em> et al. </em>2010<em>,</em> Dolman<em> et al. </em>2010). Predicted impacts of global climate change in the marine environment may affect Long-finned Pilot Whales, and may induce changes in the species’ range, prey distribution, abundance and/or migration patterns (Learmonth<em> et al. </em>2006<em>,</em> Simmonds and Eliott<em> </em>2009, Fielding 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>Sighting surveys in 1987 and 1989 generated an abundance estimate of more than 750,000 Long-finned Pilot Whales in the central and northeastern North Atlantic (Buckland<em> et al. </em>1993). The 2015 North Atlantic Sightings Survey (NASS), which included aerial and ship-board surveys, generated estimates of 589,681 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.38) for Iceland and the Faroe Islands, 258 (CV 1.02) for East Greenland, and 9,190 (CV 0.50) for West Greenland (Hansen <em>et al.</em> 2018, NAMMCO 2018b). A recent analysis of Pilot Whale abundance estimates for the central and northeastern North Atlantic in the 28-year period from 1987 to 2015 found no detectable trend (Pike <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p>Sightings data from four surveys conducted from ships and airplanes during 2005-2007 in European waters (Small&#160;Cetaceans in the European&#160;Atlantic and&#160;North&#160;Sea (SCANS-II), Cetacean Offshore Distribution and Abundance in the European Atlantic (CODA), and Trans North Atlantic Sightings Survey (TNASS)) were used to estimate cetacean abundance using double-platform line transect methods. The model-based estimate of abundance in the eastern North Atlantic from the four surveys combined was 152,071 (CV 0.32) Long-finned Pilot Whales (Rogan<em> et al. </em>2017).</p><p>The Canadian component of TNASS conducted in July–August 2007 generated an abundance estimate of 16,058 (CV 0.79) Long-finned Pilot Whales in Canadian Atlantic waters, although it should be noted that this estimate is likely negatively biased as it was not corrected for availability (Lawson and Gosselin<em> </em>2011). The best estimate of Long-finned Pilot Whales in the portion of the western North Atlantic between central Virginia and the lower Bay of Fundy, based on a 2011 line transect survey, is 5,636 (CV 0.63) (Palka<em> </em>2012). This was the first line transect survey in that area that was able to reliably distinguish between Long-finned and Short-finned Pilot Whales in those parts of the area where their distribution overlaps, using differences in pigmentation visible in photographs (Rone and Pace<em> </em>2012), but it should be noted that this survey excluded areas of known occurrence of Pilot Whales further to the north (Hayes 2017).&#160;&#160;</p><p>Although no complete abundance estimate is available for the Mediterranean basin, at least two resident populations have been well documented, with apparently no exchange between them – one in and around the Strait of Gibraltar with a mean estimate of 213 individuals (95% confidence interval 142–352) between 1999 and 2005 (Verborgh<em> et al. </em>2009), and another in the Alborán Sea and the Gulf of Vera, where 1,569 individual Pilot Whales were photo-identified between 1992 and 2009&#160;(Morata <em>et al</em>. 2013 in Verborgh<em> et al. </em>2016). Encounters with Long-finned Pilot Whales (1.042/km) were highest in the Alborán Sea (Cañadas and Sagarminaga<em> </em>2000). Survival rates calculated for both populations indicate that the Strait of Gibraltar population was more severely affected by a morbillivirus outbreak in 2006-2007 (Fernández<em> et al. </em>2008) than the Alborán Sea population (Wierucka<em> et al. </em>2014).</p><p>Sighting surveys conducted between 1976 and 1978 yielded an estimate of roughly 200,000 Long-finned Pilot Whales in the Antarctic in the summer (Kasamatsu and Joyce<em> </em>1995). Although mass strandings of Pilot Whales regularly occur off the coasts of New Zealand and Australia (Oremus<em> et al. </em>2009<em>,&#160;</em>2013), no current information is available on population status from these countries or other areas in the Southern Hemisphere.</p><p>          </p><p>There is no information on trends in abundance of the species as a whole (Hayes<em> et al. </em>2017<em>,</em> Olson<em> </em>2018). Genetic studies indicate weak population structure in the North Atlantic, associated with sea-surface temperature, while in the Southern Hemisphere stronger than expected differences were found between populations sampled off New Zealand and Tasmania (Oremus<em> et al. </em>2009).</p>      <p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Long-finned Pilot Whales have an anti-tropical distribution in temperate and subpolar zones of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres (Olson<em> </em>2018). In the Northern Hemisphere, this species is found only in the North Atlantic Ocean, including the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Abend and Smith<em> </em>1999). Long-finned Pilot Whales are not found in the North Pacific Ocean. Skeletal evidence suggests that they were previously present in the western North Pacific but they appear to be absent there today (Olson<em> </em>2018). The subpopulation(s) in the Southern Hemisphere occur as far south as the Antarctic Convergence, sometimes to at least 65°S and extending north only to approximately 30°S (Kasamatsu and Joyce<em> </em>1995<em>,</em> Bernard and Reilly<em> </em>1999). The Northern and Southern Hemisphere populations of Long-finned Pilot Whales are geographically disjunct, and the two populations are apparently isolated although genetic evidence indicates a low degree of shared mitochondrial DNA haplotypes (Oremus<em> et al. </em>2009). </p><p>  </p><p>In some areas, including the east coast of the United States, the east coast of Australia, and both coasts of South America and Africa, the distribution overlaps that of the Short-finned Pilot Whale (Olson<em> </em>2018). This has presented a challenge to abundance and conservation status assessments because the two species are difficult to distinguish at sea (Olson<em> </em>2018). However, recent analyses used both morphological and genetic evidence to distinguish between the two species in waters off the east coast of the United States.

Several Southern Bottlenose Whales have been recorded as bycatch of large-scale driftnet fishing in the Tasman Sea, but numbers taken annually are not known (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Although past levels of bycatch are unknown, they are likely to be low now due to adoption in 1989 of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly, which called for effective conservation and management measures of living marine resources in areas of high seas drift-netting. Developing high-latitude fisheries, such as that for Antarctic toothfish, a significant proportion of which is illegal and unregulated, have the potential to reduce food available for large predators including Southern Bottlenose Whales.<br/> <br/> In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160; However, this species’ range probably puts it largely outside the major areas of such impacts.</span></p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018).

In areas of Alaska and the North Atlantic, Humpback Whales have also been observed feeding in coordinated fashion on schools of Pacific Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), Sand Lance (<em>Ammodytes</em> spp.), and (more rarely) Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>), herding the school together with bubble nets, clouds or curtains (Hain <em>et al</em>. 1982).<br/> <br/> The timing of acquisition of tooth rake marks attributable to Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) indicates that Humpback Whale calves, but usually not subadults and adults, are subject to predation (Mehta <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Although modern commercial whaling seriously depleted all Humpback populations, some of which had already been reduced by pre-modern whaling, the species has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and there have been substantial increases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. Humpback whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling worldwide since 1966, and there have been few catches since 1968. It is unclear whether there has been any recovery in the small, isolated population in the Arabian Sea.<br/><br/>Today, small numbers only are taken for local consumption in Greenland (up to 10 annually) and the island of Bequia (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) (up to four annually), with occasional takes elsewhere (IWC 2018b).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales, along with North Atlanatic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena</em> <em>glacialis</em>), seem to be the most vulnerable of the large whales to becoming accidentally entangled, often fatally, in fishing gear and sometimes other debris. They are also vulnerable to injury by ship strikes, which can also be fatal. In most areas, the majority of entanglements (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also the majority of ship strikes, are likely to go undetected, but there is no generally accepted method for extrapolating from the observed events to estimate totals.<br/><br/>State members of the IWC are encouraged to report bycatches and ship strikes annually to the IWC, but few do so. The figures submitted in 2018 for entanglements include: USA 78 (26 in the Atlantic in 2015, 52 in the Pacific in 2016); Australia 46; Greenland 5, Japan 3, and New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, and Spain (1 each) (Hughes 2019). The reported ship strike numbers were: USA 13, Australia 5, and Brazil 1. &#160;The figures include some potentially non-fatal incidents (such as whales entangled and released).<br/><br/>Minimum estimates of average annual deaths in US waters are: west coast (2012-16) - 16.7 from entanglement and 2.1 from ship strikes (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2018); east coast (2010-14) ­– 7.2 from entanglements and 1.8 from ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Alaska and Hawaii (2011-15) − 18 from entanglements in fishing gear, 2.8 from unspecified marine debris, and 4.4 from ship strikes (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018). Urbán <em>et al</em>. (2017) reported 95 cases of entanglement of Humpback Whales on the Mexican Pacific coast during 2004-2017 of which 42 were released, 6 died and the fate of the others was either unknown or considered not to be severely injured.<br/><br/>In a study of Humpback entanglements in Scottish fishing gear during 1992-2016, Ryan <em>et al</em>. (2016) found that most Humpback Whales spent only brief periods in Scottish waters, but that the entanglement rate per day of whale presence was such that it would be unsustainable for a population that fed regularly in Scottish waters.<br/><br/>The distribution of Humpbacks in the Arabian Sea overlaps that of fisheries known to be dangerous to Humpbacks, and 30-40% of the photographed whales showed entanglement-related scars (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The last comprehensive assessment of North Atlantic Humpback Whales was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2002 (IWC 2003), but more recent data are available for some areas. The abundance estimate for the West Indies group of breeding aggregations, obtained from photographic capture-recapture, was 10,752 whales in 1992-93 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.07) with an estimated annual rate of increase of 3.1% (standard error (SE) 0.5%) over the period 1979-93 (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2003). The latest abundance estimate for part of the Cape Verde Island population is 260 during 2010-2013, also from&#160;photographic capture-recapture&#160;(Ryan<em> et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The most recent estimates of abundance in the individual summer feeding grounds are: Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy - 823 in 2008 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Canadian Atlantic (Newfoundland, Labrador, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and Scotia Shelf) - 2,080 (CV 0.22) in 2007 (Lawson <em>and</em> Gosselin 2009); West Greenland - 993 (CV 0.46) in 2015 (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); East Greenland coastal and central North Atlantic (Iceland, East Greenland, Faeroes, Jan Mayen) 10,031 (CV 0.36) in 2015 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018); northeastern Atlantic (British Isles, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea) 1,450 (CV 0.29) in 2001 (Øien <em>et al</em>. 2009). These estimates total about 15,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.25.<br/><br/>The abundance of Humpback Whales in the Gulf of Maine and northwestern Atlantic was estimated to be growing at 6.5% per year during 1979-91 (Barlow and Clapham 1997) but the rate of increase was less than 4% per year during 1992-2000 (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003). Abundance in the central North Atlantic (East Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands) increased sharply from 1987 to 1995 but there has been no clear trend since then (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were subject to significant removals by pre-modern whalers especially in their wintering grounds in the West Indies and Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Reeves 2003). Whaling in the West Indies (including Bermuda) is partially documented from 1664, but the main period was 1826-1928, during which about 8,600 whales were estimated to have been killed (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001). Whaling in the Cape Verde Islands occurred primarily during 1850-1912 with a total estimated kill of about 3,000 animals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Humpbacks were exploited by modern whalers in their summer feeding grounds from the 1860s, especially off Iceland and Norway (Jonsgård 1977<em>,</em> Allison 2017). About 3,200 Humpback Whales were recorded taken by early modern whaling during 1880-1916, mainly off northern Norway and Iceland. Allowing for a substantial struck and lost rate in early modern whaling, and considering that about 20% of the recorded catch of whales was unspecified to species, the total kill in this period may have exceeded 5,000 Humpback Whales.<br/><br/>About 1,500 Humpback Whales are reported to have been killed in the North Atlantic since 1916, from a variety of areas including the British Isles, Faeroes, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, and eastern Canada, as well as Norwegian pelagic catches. Humpback Whales were protected from commercial whaling in the North Atlantic from the 1955 season by the IWC, except for small catches off Greenland (IWC 1954). However, catch levels had become very low by the 1920s, despite continued high catches of Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>). This suggests that the Humpback population was low at that time.<br/><br/>Attempts to estimate pre-whaling populations from catch, abundance and trend data have yielded inconclusive results (IWC 2003<em>,</em> Punt <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, the current population level is probably considerably higher than the 1942 level because only a small number of Humpbacks (377) were caught between 1942 and the start of the period (from 1979) over which an increase has been documented.<br/><br/>Using genetic methods, Roman and Palumbi (2004) estimated the pre-whaling population of&#160;Humpback Whales in the North Atlantic to be 240,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 156,000-401,000). However, their method assumed that North Atlantic Humpback Whales form a single clade, which they do not (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hence, the Roman and Palumbi estimate would be expected to reflect the global abundance of Humpback Whales prior to whaling rather than the North Atlantic population.<em><strong><br/><br/>North Pacific</strong></em><br/>The total abundance of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific was estimated by photographic capture-recapture at 21,063 (CV 0.04) during 2004-06 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). A comparable estimate from 1993-96 data, calculated retrospectively, was 9,500. The population appeared to have been increasing since 1980 at rates of 5-8% per year in each of the areas with sufficient data to estimate trend (Calambokidis and Barlow 2017). More recent data from the U.S. west coast suggest that numbers there have levelled off (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Using a different model for the relation between summering and wintering grounds applied to the same data as Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2011), Wade <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2016, revised by Wade 2017) estimated a total of 15,805 for the wintering grounds and 16,225 for the feeding grounds. It is not clear why Wade’s totals are lower than Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>.’s, but all evidence indicates that the Hawaiian group is the largest of the wintering populations, comprising 10,000-12,000 whales and making up at least half of the total North Pacific population. Estimates for the other breeding populations are Mexican (2,000-5,000), Asian (1,000-2,000) and Central American (300-1,000); no estimate exists for the Western Pacific (Mariana Islands) area.<br/><br/>Independent of the above data, the abundance of Humpback Whales in the eastern North Pacific (170°E to 135°W) and the eastern Bering Sea has been estimated from the Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment (POWER) series of sightings surveys at 14,407 (CV 0.56) (Inai <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Humpback Whales are also abundant west of these areas, in the western Bering Sea and near the western Aleutian Islands, eastern and western Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands (Miyashita <em>et al</em> 2006<em>,</em> Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>,</em> Gushcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were hunted in Japan at least since 1570 and catching probably increased with the development of net-assisted whaling from circa 1677 (Kasuya 2018). The number taken is very uncertain because detailed catch figures prior to the 20th century are available from only two of about a dozen locations where whaling occurred in southern Japan, on both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts (Omura 1986).&#160;The proportion of whales killed but lost is also unclear: although quite high rates of escape were indicated, it is unclear how many of these would have been mortally wounded. A single whaling firm operating in Kyushu (southwestern Japan), among several known to have been active, took 21,790 whales between 1725 and 1874, of which the majority were likely Humpbacks judging from the species breakdown at neighbouring locations. The data suggest a decline towards the end of the 19th century, but not as marked as for North Pacific Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena japonica</em>).<br/><br/>Building on the works of Maury (1852) and Townsend (1935), Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted by month the positions of about 250 catches and a few sightings of Humpbacks in the North Pacific from a sample of logbooks of American sail whalers in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.&#160;Humpback Whales occurred in most of the summering and wintering areas known today, including the Sea of Japan and Okhotsk Sea. The logbooks are thought to comprise about 10% of all American voyages, but it is unclear how representative they are, especially of the earlier voyages. Furthermore, at least some European vessels were also active in the North Pacific.&#160;It is possible that a few thousand Humpback Whales were taken. Also in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, American shore-based whalers operating on the coast of California killed an estimated 2,000 Humpback Whales between 1854 and 1899 (Reeves <em>and</em> Smith 2010).<br/><br/>Modern whaling began in Japan in 1898 and catches by species are recorded since 1911. Humpback Whales made up only 2.0% (950 out of 47,343) of the catch of large whales in Japan (including the occupied Kuril Islands) during 1911-45, and only 0.2% (90 out of 48,010) of the catch of large whales in Japan during 1946-65 (Allison, 2017). Thus, the Asian migratory population was likely already depleted before the start of modern whaling, and already commercially extinct by the time the catching of Humpbacks in the North Pacific was prohibited by the IWC from 1966 (IWC 1965). Subgroups of the Asian wintering population that used more oceanic migratory corridors probably survived a bit longer, given that over 800 Humpbacks were taken in Ogasawara (Bonin Islands) between 1922-1945, nearly 800 in Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands) during 1958-62, and over 700 in Taiwan during 1920-39.<br/><br/>Approximately 18,000 Humpbacks are recorded as being taken by modern whaling along the American coasts during 1911-65 (5,000 in Alaska, 6,000 in British Columbia, 5,000 in California and Washington, and 2,000 off Baja California, Mexico) (Allison 2017). &#160;Modern pelagic whaling began in the 1930s and a total of over 8,000 Humpback Whales were taken, including 7,714 by fleets of the USSR, which illegally took 248 Humpback Whales after catches had been prohibited by the IWC (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Estimated catches of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific since 1942 total approximately 10,700 whales (Allison 2017). Given the evidence of an increase of over 10,000 whales between the 1980s and the early the 2000s, it is likely that the current population size in the North Pacific as a whole is above the 1942 level.<br/><br/>The Hawaiian wintering population is today the largest of the extant wintering populations. The 19<sup>th</sup> century records include relatively few catches or sightings of Humpbacks in this area, even though Hawaii was a major staging area for long-distance whalers in the Pacific. The thesis of Herman (1979) that Humpbacks were uncommon in Hawaii in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and earlier, based on the paucity of references to Humpbacks in contemporary accounts and local folklore, is controversial. However, it is plausible that Humpbacks were historically less abundant in Hawaii than they are today.<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Population estimates derived from photo-identification conducted in the Arabian Sea during 2000-04 were all less than 100 animals (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011). Provisional analysis of data collected during 2000-2015 yielded an abundance estimate of 89 whales (CV 0.26) in 2015, which may be negatively biased due to heterogeneity (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Soviet whaling fleet <em>Sovetskaya Ukraina</em> illegally took 238 Humpback Whales off the coasts of Oman, Pakistan, and northwestern India in November 1966 (Mikhalev 1997). The current population is very small and its current trend is not known. This population is listed separately as Endangered under Red List criterion D (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>Results of the IWC Scientific Committee’s multi-year “comprehensive assessment” of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, completed in 2015, are summarized by IWC (2016). The estimated total population size in 2015 was 97,000 (CI 78,000-118,000),&#160;obtained from a mix of photographic and genetic capture-recapture, aerial surveys, and shore-based censuses. The estimated total population size in 1942, from a fitted population model, was about 60,000 (confidence interval not given) while the estimated “pre-whaling” population size in 1900 was 138,000 (CI 112,000-198,000). All breeding populations were estimated to have recovered to a substantial fraction of their pre-whaling abundance, except for the West South Africa (BSB2) population, which may still be quite depleted.<br/><br/>The IWC comprehensive assessment assumed that catches by pre-modern whalers were small enough, or long enough ago, to be ignored. However, de Morais <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated catches of 11,000-33,000 Humpback Whales from pre-modern land whaling stations (armações) in Brazil during 1830-1924, and considered it likely that there had been similarly sizeable catches in the preceding century. From samples of logbooks of late 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century sail whalers, Townsend (1935) and Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted positions for about 2,000 Humpback catches and sightings in the Southern Hemisphere. These show presence of Humpbacks in most of the wintering grounds known today, except for northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef probably made access too risky. The 19<sup>th</sup> century whalers did not follow their prey to their Antarctic summering grounds. No attempt has yet been made to estimate total removals from the logbook samples.<br/><br/>The recorded catches by 20<sup>th</sup> century whaling in the Southern Hemisphere total about 220,000, after allowing for some Humpbacks among the 5,000 unspecified whales taken in the early years (Allison 2017). Of the total, about 83,500 were taken by pelagic whaling fleets in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, which started in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century mainly south of 55°S; about 40,000 from land stations in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, mainly at South Georgia; about 29,000 along the west coast of southern Africa (Gabon, Angola, Namibia, and western South Africa); about 20,000 in the southwestern Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mozambique, and Natal (South Africa); over 28,000 off western Australia; over 14,000 off eastern Australia and New Zealand; about 2,500 in the Southeast Pacific (Chile, Peru, and Ecuador); and about 2,000 off Brazil.<br/><br/>Attempts by the IWC to manage the hunting of Humpbacks in the Southern Hemisphere had limited effect. Takes of Humpbacks by pelagic fleets in the Southern Ocean (south of 40°S) were prohibited in the initial Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling that was adopted in 1946 and came into force in 1948. This ban was relaxed from 1950 to allow an annual catch of 1,250 Humpbacks, but the numerical limit was often exceeded and was dropped from 1954 when Humpback catching was instead limited to four days in February. From 1959, increasingly restrictive area limits were imposed. The report of an IWC expert group in June 1963 inferred from the continuing steep decline in the Humpback population that substantial unreported catches had occurred (Chapman 1964). The IWC finally banned all catching of Humpbacks throughout the Southern Hemisphere from 1964 (IWC 1965). Subsequently, it emerged that Humpback catches by the USSR fleets had indeed exceeded the reported values by about 46,000 whales, and had continued until 1968, with small takes continuing until 1973 (Zemsky <em>et al</em>. 1996<em>,</em> Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even before the 1964 Humpback ban, almost all of the additional Soviet catches had been illegal in at least one respect: they were either outside the permitted season, outside the permitted areas, below the minimum allowed body size, or of mothers with calves.<br/><br/>The IWC Scientific Committee’s recent comprehensive assessment, which took account of the previously unreported catches, showed that the current hemispheric population was, by now, very likely above its 1942 level. The assessment probably reflects the current population size and the trends over recent decades quite well, but both the estimates of pre-whaling population size, and the projections of future recovery, are probably more uncertain than the assessment results suggest, for the following reasons; firstly, as noted above, the pre-modern catches may not have been insignificant; secondly, simulation studies by Leaper <em>et al</em>. (2011) showed that alternative assumptions about density-dependent limitation can yield substantially different estimated population trajectories for both the past and the future; finally, Clapham and Zerbini (2015) cautioned that a key model assumption, that all historical breeding areas will be repopulated, may not hold when social factors are considered.<em><strong><br/><br/>Global Assessment</strong></em><br/>The mean age at first reproduction for Humpback Whales is estimated to be 10-12 years in the Southern Hemisphere (Best 2011) with a similar value in the North Pacific (Gabriele <em>et al</em>. 2007). Clapham (1992) reported a value of 5-7 years for Humpbacks in the Gulf of Maine, North Atlantic, but this increased to about 9 years for cohorts born in 1987 and later (Robbins 2007). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) cited 6 years as a reasonable default value, based on Clapham (1992). Taking a compromise value of 10 years, the generation time of 21.5 years estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) would become 25.5 years. Hence the 3-generation time window for applying the reduction criterion (A1) for a threatened category is 1942-2018.<br/><br/>Using the proportion mature of 0.62 estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007), the recent global population contains approximately 84,000 mature individuals out of a total of 135,000 whales. The population in 2018 is estimated to be above the 1942 level in each of the major ocean regions (North Atlantic, North Pacific, Southern Hemisphere). The small Arabian Sea population is probably below the 1942 level, because of the illegal catches taken in the 1960s.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p></p><p>The Humpback Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all the major ocean basins, and all but one of the subpopulations (that of the Arabian Sea) migrate between mating and calving grounds in tropical waters, usually near continental coastlines or island groups and productive colder-water feeding areas in temperate and high latitudes (Dawbin 1966, Clapham and Mead 1999). There tends to be strong, maternally directed fidelity to feeding and breeding grounds, but with some interchange between grounds, especially of males but also of females (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>Humpbacks in the North Atlantic range in summer from the Gulf of Maine in the west to the British Isles and Norway in the east. The northern extent of the Humpback's range includes the Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Davis Strait, but unlike Bowhead Whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>), they do not enter the pack ice. A number of main feeding grounds have been identified: Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, west of Greenland, west of Iceland, northeast Iceland, Jan Mayen, northern Norway, Bear Island, and western Svalbard (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Smaller numbers have been observed feeding in other areas such as the Hudson River Estuary (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2018). Humpback Whales are rare in the central and southern North Sea and there are very few records from the Baltic Sea. Humpback Whales were previously very rare in the Mediterranean Sea; there has been a notable increase in sightings since 1990, but they are still not common (Russo <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The main wintering grounds are in the West Indies and wider Caribbean region where they are found along the entire Antillean arc from Cuba to Venezuela (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The largest aggregations occur on Silver and Navidad Banks near the Dominican Republic, with much lower numbers in Samana Bay (Dominican Republic), off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico, and around the Virgin Islands and the eastern Antilles. Smaller numbers winter around the Cape Verde Islands (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009). There is some interchange of individuals between the eastern and western Atlantic wintering grounds (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2016), and some whales may remain in colder, more northern waters throughout the winter (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1993<em>,</em> Magnúsdóttir <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>,</em> Kowarski 2018).<br/><br/>While whales wintering in the Caribbean region have been matched photographically or genetically with whales in each of the summer feeding grounds, whales from the smaller Cape Verde Islands wintering group have to date been matched only with the northeastern feeding grounds. Individuals from the Cape Verdes have also been observed in spring in the Azores, where they appear to stop over to feed while on their way north (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009<em>,</em> Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011). The genetic and photographic evidence suggests that some of the whales on the Icelandic and Norwegian feeding grounds migrate in winter to an unknown area other than the West Indies or the Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Pike 2009).<br/><br/>The Humpback Whales that occur in the austral winter north of the equator along the African coast from Gabon to Guinea are known or presumed to be Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales (Bamy <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong></strong><br/>In the North Pacific, the Humpback Whale’s summer range covers shelf waters from southern California to the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, the Aleutian chain and Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, and northeastern Japan (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Humpbacks were hunted in the Sea of Japan and the Okhotsk Sea and in the past (Kasuya 2018<em>,</em> Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012). They were for some time rare in the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), but recently have been seen in the eastern and northern Okhotsk Sea (Guschcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>,</em> Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Humpbacks are not common in the Sea of Japan but continue to be taken occasionally as bycatch in Korean waters. Recent occurrence in the Beaufort Sea may be linked to warming climate trends (Hashagen <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds identified to date include (from west to east) are: 1) Asian – Ogasawara (Bonin Islands), Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands), and northern Philippines; 2) west-central Pacific (presumed to be the area of the Mariana Islands, including Guam); 3). Hawaiian; 4) Mexican - Baja California, Gulf of California, Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Mexican mainland; and 5) Central American – Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia (IWC 2018a).<br/><br/>The least well-known wintering area is the west-central Pacific, because only a few whales have been observed there (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017), but the existence of a substantial wintering ground had been inferred from the substantial proportion of Humpback Whales in the Aleutian Islands that could not be matched to other known wintering grounds (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). It remains to be determined whether this is the Marianas region, which was a Humpback whaling ground in the 19<sup>th</sup> century (Townsend 1935).<br/><br/>The Central American wintering ground overlaps the winter range of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, but there is probably not much temporal overlap because the Southern Humpback Whales occupy the area in the austral winter (Rasmussen <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Small numbers of Humpbacks have recently been seen at previously unknown winter locations such as Amami-Ohshima Island (28°N 129°E) and Hachijō-jima Island (33°N 140°E, about 300km south of Tokyo, Japan) (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The various wintering populations have different summer distributions but with considerable overlap. The whales wintering off Central America and mainland Mexico feed mainly off the coasts California, Oregon and Washington (USA), while whales from the Revillagigedo Islands feed mainly in the Gulf of Alaska (Urbán <em>et al</em>. 2017). Whales wintering off Hawaii are found in summer mainly in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska (including Southeast Alaska) and the waters of British Columbia (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Most of the whales summering off Kamchatka migrate to the Asian wintering grounds, a lower number to the Hawaiian grounds, and a few to the Mexican grounds (Titova <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Movements between wintering grounds have also been documented (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008) but these appear to be sufficiently few that the wintering populations remain genetically differentiated, especially with respect to mtDNA, which reflects maternal lineages (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><em></em><br/>The majority of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales migrate to the Antarctic in summer. They are abundant throughout the Antarctic in summer south to the ice edge, but not within the pack ice zone. There are also subantarctic summer feeding grounds around South Georgia (Dawbin 1966<em>,</em> Engel <em>and</em> Martin 2009) and the Fuegian archipelago (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Some mothers with calves remain in mid-latitude waters in the Chilean fjords in the summer (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the winter, Southern Hemisphere whales aggregate in specific nearshore breeding areas in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, at least two of which extend north of the equator, i.e. off Colombia and Central America in the eastern Pacific and in the Bight of Benin (5°N, 2°E) in the eastern Atlantic. Some wintering grounds are fairly localized, for example around island groups, and some are more diffuse, such as along the west coast of southern Africa and the coast of West Africa. As evidenced by acoustic detections, part of the population remains in the Antarctic in winter (van Opzeeland <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The currently known wintering grounds, with the names originally assigned by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (IWC 1998) but with some subsequent regrouping (IWC 2017), are:<br/><br/>A. Western South Atlantic: Coast of Brazil from Cabo São Roque (5°S) to Cabo Frio (23°S), but especially on the Abrolhos Bank (17-20°S);<br/><br/>B. Eastern South Atlantic: Benin Bight and Gulf of Guinea, from the waters of the Republic of Congo to the waters of Guinea (B1), West coast of southern Africa, including waters of South Africa, Namibia and Angola (B2);<br/><br/>C. Southwestern Indian Ocean: Coast of Natal, northeastern South Africa &#160;East Africa, including waters of Mozambique, Tanzania (incl. Zanzibar), Mayotte and the Comoros Islands (C1+C2), Eastern and southern Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius (C3+C4);<br/><br/>D. Western Australia: migration along the west Australian coast to wintering grounds off northwestern Australia;<br/><br/>E. Eastern Australia and Southwest Pacific: Eastern Australia (E1),<br/><br/>F. Oceania: New Caledonia (E2), Fiji and Tonga (E3), Cook Islands (F1), French Polynesia (F2);<br/><br/>G. Eastern South and equatorial Pacific: &#160;Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The groups A-G were originally considered to represent main breeding populations with the numbered sub-groups representing subpopulations. However, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently grouped subgroups E2, E3, F1 and F2 together as the Oceania breeding population. Subgroups C1 and C2 were combined, as have C3 and C4.<br/><br/>The feeding ranges of the different populations overlap in the Antarctic, with some movement of individuals around the Antarctic (IWC 1998), but overall the whales appear to feed preferentially in the sectors nearest to their wintering grounds. The sex ratio in the wintering areas tends to be biased towards males, potentially reflecting a reduced presence of females in their non-calving years or a generally shorter residence time of females (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). Rare movements of both sexes between breeding populations have been observed (e.g., western Africa to Madagascar (Pomilla and Rosenbaum 2005) and Brazil to Madagascar (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2011)).<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><em><strong></strong></em><br/>There is a resident year-round population in the Arabian Sea, whose range includes the waters of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011) and which is genetically isolated from other Humpback Whales (Pomilla <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, song types characteristic of Humpback Whales in the southwestern Indian Ocean have been detected off Oman (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2018); this could indicate the presence of Humpbacks from different populations in the Arabian Sea, or that Arabian Sea Humpbacks sometimes venture further afield and acquire new songs.<br/><br/>Only a few calves have been seen in the Arabian Sea, but from foetus sizes in pregnant whales captured in November 1966, Mikhalev (1997) concluded that the peak calving season is probably in February, with some spread. This is in contrast to Southern Humpback Whales, where peak calving occurs in July-August (Clapham and Mead 1999).<br/><br/>There have been a few records in the Persian Gulf, including the type specimen for <em>M. indica</em> (Gervais 1883) assumed to be a Humpback Whale; these were previously regarded as vagrants, but it is now thought that the regular range extends into the Persian Gulf (Dakhteh <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales seem to be quite rare in Indian waters (Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008) but there have been occasional strandings (Sutaria 2018) and acoustic detections (Madhusudhana <em>et al</em>. 2018) along the west coast. Of 14 individuals satellite-tagged off Oman during 2014-17, one was tracked to Goa and thence to the southern tip of India by January 2018 and back to the tagging site by March 2018 (Willson <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two specimens from the west coast of Sri Lanka (a bycatch in 1981 and a stranding in 1990) (Ilangakoon 2006) and Humpback Whale songs have been during February and March 1982 in the Gulf of Mannar, NW Sri Lanka (Whitehead 1985). Humpback Whales seem to be rare or absent in the northeastern Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.<br/><br/>There have been several sightings over the past 10 years in the northern Red Sea, including the Gulf of Aqaba, but the provenance of those Humpback Whales is unclear (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Large-scale exploitation of this species has ceased, but hunting for local consumption continues in Greenland and the island of Bequia (eastern&#160; Caribbean) (IWC 2018b).

The last substantial catches occurred in 1968. Despite having been severely depleted to a world population in the low thousands at that time, Humpbacks have recovered strongly to a world population that is estimated at over 80,000 mature animals and is increasing.<br/><br/>Humpback Whales enjoy additional protective measures, such as sanctuaries, in a number of countries.

Killer Whales are numerically abundant (at least tens of thousands of mature individuals) and very widely distributed. Experts agree that the present taxon likely includes more than one subspecies, and possibly multiple species. Some small regional populations are known to have declined significantly and would easily qualify for a threatened status if assessed individually (e.g., ENP southern residents, the Bluefin Tuna-dependent population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar), but there is insufficient evidence to support a global decline in the species abundance that would make it meet Criterion A. However, the statement in the previous species assessment (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2013) still holds: “The combination of potential declines driven by depletion of prey resources and the effects of pollutants is believed sufficient that a 30% global reduction over three generations (77 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out for some ‘groups’ that may [eventually] be designated as species.” <br/></p>  <p>Although considerable effort continues to be made on improved understanding of the taxonomy of the genus <em>Orcinus</em>, the taxonomic issues have not been fully resolved. This is especially problematic due to the occurrence of sympatric, non-interbreeding ecotypes in the ENP, Antarctic, and possibly elsewhere. The taxon has previously been listed by IUCN as Data Deficient due to taxonomic uncertainty, and that listing should be continued until proper taxonomic units are described and Red List assessments of them can be carried out.</p>","<p>Killer Whales are known to   feed on a wide array of prey, including most marine mammal species (except river dolphins and Manatees), seabirds, sea turtles, many species of fish   (including sharks and rays) and cephalopods (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Ford   and Ellis 1999, Ford 2009). They have a diversity of foraging tactics,   including intentional beaching to capture pinnipeds on shore, creating waves   to wash seals off ice floes, and using cooperative techniques to herd fish   and to attack large prey such as Tuna and large whales (Dahlheim and Heyning   1999, Baird 2000, Pitman and Durban 2012).</p><p>Although Killer Whales are a generalist as a species, at least some   subpopulations (ecotypes and/or morphotypes) specialize on particular types   of prey (Bigg <em>et al</em>. 1990, Baird 2000). Studies in coastal waters of   the ENP, from California to Alaska, have described three distinct ecotypes of   Killer Whales, referred to as residents, transients (or Bigg’s Killer Whales),   and offshores. Although distinguished by ecological differences, there are   also differences in coloration, external morphology, behavior and acoustics   (Ford and Ellis 2014). The three ecotypes maintain social isolation from each   other (<em>i.e</em>., no interbreeding)   despite sometimes overlapping ranges. The ENP residents are Pacific Salmon   specialists and have a strong preference for one species, the Chinook Salmon   (Ford and Ellis 2006). Transients in coastal waters of the ENP focus their   foraging on pinnipeds and small cetaceans but also take large whales, especially   calves, opportunistically. Killer Whales in coastal Norway specialize on Herring   (Simila <em>et al</em>. 1996) and in the Strait of Gibraltar on Bluefin Tuna   (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006). Some Killer Whales in New Zealand may forage   selectively on rays and other elasmobranchs (Visser 1999), and in Western   Australia, Killer Whales take scores of Humpback Whale calves for several   months a year (Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2015).   Off the south coast of Western Australia one group of Killer Whales forages,   at least seasonally, on Beaked Whales (Wellard <em>et al</em>. 2106). In the Antarctic, there are five described ecotypes   of Killer Whales, each of them morphologically distinct with different   habitat and prey preferences. One type specializes on Minke Whales and Elephant   Seals taken in open water, one eats mostly ice-associated seals taken off ice   floes, another regularly preys on penguins but is probably mainly a   fish-eater, another rarely seen form has only been observed depredating Patgonian   Toothfish from commercial longlines, and the smallest form appears to be   entirely a fish-eater (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durban <em>et al.</em>   2016). <br/></p>   <p>Long-distance migrations   have been documented for high-latitude Killer Whales. Matthews <em>et al</em>. (2011) satellite-tracked an   individual for 5,400 km (and 38° of latitude) from the eastern Canadian   Arctic into the central North Atlantic. Durban and Pitman (2012) tracked Killer   Whales from the Antarctic Peninsula to southern Brazil and back – a non-stop   roundtrip of almost 9,400 km, and Pitman <em>et   al</em>. (in prep.) tracked fish-eating ecotype Killer Whales from the Ross   Sea to north of New Zealand and back – a &gt;11,000 km roundtrip covering 48°   of latitude. Many Antarctic Killer Whales appear to be highly philopatric. In   the Antarctic, some ecotypes readily enter areas of floe ice in search of   prey, while others hunt only in open water (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman and   Durban 2012). Killer Whales in some areas congregate seasonally in coastal   channels to forage and occasionally enter river mouths.</p>","<p>Killer Whales have been exploited (i.e., deliberately hunted) in several regions. Norwegian whalers in the eastern North Atlantic took an average of 56 whales per year from 1938 to 1981. Whalers in Japan took an average of 43 per year in coastal waters from 1946 to 1981. Soviet commercial whalers took an average of 26 Killer Whales annually from 1935 to 1979, primarily in the Antarctic, and then took 916 animals in the 1979/80 Antarctic season (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999,). Killer whales are also taken in small numbers for food (or as a population control measure) in coastal fisheries in Japan, Greenland, Indonesia, and the Caribbean islands (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/> Fishermen in many areas see Killer Whales as competitors, and intentional shooting is known to occur. This problem was especially serious in Alaska, where depredation of longline fisheries is extensive (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, Yano and Dahlheim 1995, Donohue <em>et al</em>. 2003), and retaliation for depredation was credited with contributing to a temporary population decline at Crozet Island, in the Southern Ocean (Poncelet <em>et al</em>. 2010). Depredation of longline catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., Aleutian Islands and Southeast Alaska, South Georgia, Crozet Islands, and several other Southern Ocean Subantarctic island areas, Australia, and other locations in the South Pacific). Increased depredation of Toothfish hooked in fisheries in the Crozet Archipelago appears to have had a positive effect on calving rates of female Killer Whales (Tixier <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> Incidental mortality in trawl, longline and driftnet fishing operations occurs, but is considered rare (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> Persistent bio-accumulating contaminants present a serious potential risk to some Killer Whale populations. Ross <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were very high in three Killer Whale populations (2 resident and 1 transient) frequenting the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada. Transient Killer Whales were particularly contaminated due to their high trophic position in the marine ecosystem. PCB levels in most Killer Whales sampled were greater than levels established at which adverse effects occur in Harbor Seals, suggesting that the majority of free-ranging Killer Whales in this region are at risk of toxic effects. The southern resident and transient Killer Whales of British Columbia and Washington are considered among the most PCB-contaminated cetaceans in the world (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2000). &#160;More recently, Jepson <em>et al</em>. (2016) found very high mean blubber PCB concentrations in Killer Whales in Europe. Small or declining populations of Killer Whales in the northeastern Atlantic (e.g., the very small population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar) have been associated with low recruitment, which is consistent with PCB-induced reproductive toxicity. Also, increasing levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers which, like PCBs, can cause immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive impairment, have become a concern in the southern resident population in British Columbia and Washington (Mongillo <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p><br/> Disturbance is another concern in areas where Killer Whales are subject to whale-watching tourism. Moving boats can disrupt foraging and resting, and underwater boat noise can affect social and echolocation signals of the whales or otherwise interfere with foraging (Erbe 2002, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, Noren <em>et al.</em> 2009). For example, close approaches by whale-watching vessels have been shown to result in avoidance responses by resident Killer Whales in British Columbia, which presumably has energetic costs to whales that are frequently subjected to this activity (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2006). Fast-moving boats in the proximity of Killer Whales also present a risk of vessel strikes (e.g., Visser 1999). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Potential disturbance and acoustic masking effects of increasing ambient noise levels associated with shipping and other vessel traffic is a growing concern in some regions (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Disturbance responses and masking of echolocation signals in areas with heavy ship activity have the potential to disrupt foraging behavior and reduce prey acquisition with possible population-level consequences (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014, Veirs <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/> <br/> </p>  <p>The <em>Exxon Valdez</em> oil spill in Alaska in March 1989 was strongly correlated with the subsequent loss of Killer Whales from transient and resident pods that had been seen swimming near or through oil slicks early in the spill (Dahlheim and Matkin 1994). The AT1 pod had at least 22 individuals when first censused in 1984, before the spill. Eleven individuals have been missing from this pod since 1990 and two more since 1992. Four more whales from this pod died in the early 2000s and there have been no recorded births within the pod since 1984. As of 2012, only 7 of the original 22 AT1 pod members remained. A resident Killer Whale pod affected by the oil had failed to recover 16 years after the spill (Matkin <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2012). Oil spills may also have indirect effects on Killer Whales by reducing prey abundance. </p>  <p><br/> There have been large-scale reductions in predatory fish populations (Myers and Worm 2003; Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003) along with overfishing and collapse of several important “prey” fish stocks worldwide (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2001). There have also been large declines in some marine mammal populations but many of those populations have recovered or are recovering under protection, and this may mean that some mammal-eating populations of Killer Whales are recovering as well. The same is not likely true of many fish-eating populations, however. </p>  <p><br/> Due to their dietary specialization, some populations of Killer Whales could be especially vulnerable to a reduction of their food supply. In British Columbia and Washington State, many Pacific Salmon stocks have significantly declined as a result of overfishing, habitat degradation, and reduced survival at sea. Declines in survival and reproductive rates of resident Killer Whales were found to correlate with a multi-year reduction in Chinook Salmon abundance in coastal British Columbia and Washington State (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ford <em>et al.</em> 2010). Mammal-eating Killer Whales along the west coast of North America likely experienced periods of reduced prey availability due to depletion of pinniped populations prior to 1970 (Ford and Ellis 1999). Depletion of Bluefin Tuna stocks in the Mediterranean Sea has almost certainly had a serious impact on the survival of Killer Whales near the Strait of Gibraltar (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006, Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> How global climate change and its impacts on the marine environment will affect the different populations and ecotypes of Killer Whales is uncertain (e.g., Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, in the Arctic, declining extent and duration of sea ice has given Killer Whales more access to marine mammal prey (Belugas, Narwhals, Bowhead Whales) that depend on ice for refuge from predation (Ferguson <em>et al.</em> 2010, Higdon <em>et al</em>. 2012, George <em>et al.</em> 2015). Similarly, in the Antarctic, the abundance and availability of Killer Whale prey is mediated through the presence of ice (<em>e.g</em>., Pitman and Durban 2012), which means that many species, including both Killer Whales and their prey, face an uncertain future.</p>","<p>Killer Whale populations   have been relatively well-studied in the North Pacific. In the Eastern Tropical   Pacific, a line-transect survey resulted in an estimate of 8,500 (CV=0.37) in   1986-1990 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). A catalogue of 86 individuals was   compiled for waters around the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, from   1972-1997 (Guerrero-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 1998). A shipboard line-transect   survey of the Hawaii EEZ in 2002 resulted in an estimate of 349 (CV = 0.98) Killer   Whales (Barlow 2006). The southern resident population that inhabits the   inland waters of Washington State and southern British Columbia numbered 77   whales in June 2017 (K.C. Balcomb, Center for Whale Research, pers. comm., 13   June 2017); it is depleted due to past live removals and is listed as   endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and Canada’s Species at Risk   Act. The northern resident population in British Columbia numbered 290 in   2014 and had been increasing at a mean rate of 2.2% per annum since 1974   (Towers <em>et al</em>. 2015). A   photographic catalogue of the west coast transient population in British   Columbia and Southeast Alaska included 272 individuals in 2012 (Towers <em>et al.</em> 2012). This population was   estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of about 2% in the two   decades ending in 2006 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2007). Bayesian mark-recapture modelling estimated that there were 300   offshore-type Killer Whales (95% CL 257–373) in the region from Alaska to   California in 2012 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2014). Shipboard line-transect surveys extending out to 300 nm offshore in   2005 and 2007 resulted in an estimate of 691 (CV=0.49) off California, Oregon   and Washington (Carretta <em>et al</em>.   2016); these estimates likely include whales from the aforementioned west   coast transient, southern resident, northern resident, and offshore   populations. A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of   Alaska resulted in an estimate of abundance for transient Killer Whales of   251 (CV=0.51) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007), while the AT1 transient   population (which inhabits Prince William Sound and waters of the Seward   Peninsula, Alaska) numbered only 7 animals in 2010 (Matkin <em>et al</em>.   2012). Over 700 unique individual resident Killer Whales were   photo-identified over the course of a field study during 1984-2010 in coastal   waters of the Gulf of Alaska (Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a subset of   pods within this population were regularly encountered, and those pods   increased in abundance at an average rate of 3.5% per annum during the study.   A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of Alaska   resulted in an estimate of 991 (CV=0.52) resident Killer Whales and 251 (CV=0.51)   transient Killer Whales (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/></p>   <p>The following figures are   available for Killer Whales in the Russian Far East, all representing   photo-identified individuals and therefore “minimum” counts (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014, Erich Hoyt, Whale and   Dolphin Conservation, pers. comm. 12 June 2017): Avacha   Gulf/eastern Kamchatka (1999-2013) – resident type 688, transient type 26   (note that rate of new discovery is very low indicating this may be close to   actual levels of abundance, and site fidelity is much higher than in the   Commander Islands); Commander Islands (2008-2013) - residents &gt; 800,   transients 18 (note that rate of new discovery is high so actual abundance is   certainly higher and about 80% of the identified individuals were encountered   in only one year); western Okhotsk Sea (from Udskaya Gulf to Sakhalin Gulf,   mainly Academiya Gulf) (2011-2013) – residents none, transients 55 (note that no dedicated study was carried out, only   opportunistic sightings along with beluga research; also this is the   population that has been subject to live-capture since 2010).<br/>   <br/>   Line-transect surveys have resulted in high estimates of abundance in several   regions in the North Atlantic, 3,100 (CV=0.63) in Norwegian waters in the   1980s (Øien 1990) and 6,618 (CV=0.32) in Iceland and Faroe Islands waters   also in the 1980s (Gunnlaugsson and Sigurjónsson 1990, Sigurjónsson <em>et al</em>.   1989). A long-term photo-identification study in coastal northern Norway   resulted in an abundance estimate of 731 (CI = 505-1059) in 2003 (Kuningas <em>et al</em>. 2014). In central and southern   European waters there are only two known populations of Killer Whales – one   in the Strait of Gibraltar with 39 individuals in 2011 (Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016) and the other a pod of   nine individuals regularly seen around western Ireland and northwestern   Scotland (Beck <em>et al</em>. 2013). Killer   Whales are not common in the waters off the eastern United States. Line-transect   surveys yielded an estimate of 133 (CV=49%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico in   the early 2000s (Waring <em>et al</em>.   2006).<br/>   <br/>   Several analyses of line-transect surveys have yielded abundance estimates   for Killer Whales around Antarctica (Hammond 1984, Kasamatsu and Joyce 1995);   however, some of the estimates have been considered biased by methodology and   survey coverage (Branch and Butterworth 2001). More recent analyses that   account for some of these biases resulted in an estimate of about 25,000 for   waters south of 60°S (Branch and Butterworth 2001); however, there are still   uncertainties related to coverage of areas in the pack ice, so true abundance   could be higher. Densities are known to vary locally within Antarctic waters,   ranging from very abundant to uncommon (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pitman   and Ensor 2003), and it has been recognized that Killer Whale densities are   higher closer to the ice edge and within the marginal ice zone where the   smaller, fish-eating Killer Whales can occur in aggregations of tens to   hundreds of animals (Berzin and Vladimirov 1983, Pitman and Ensor 2003). A   photo-identification study of type C Killer Whales (a small, fish-eating   form) in McMurdo Sound from 2001-2015 estimated a population of at least 370   animals including 70 that were resident in the Sound each year during the   summer; the remainder were mostly just passing through (Pitman <em>et al</em>. submitted). In the Antarctic   Peninsula area, a photo-identification study of the three different ecotypes   that occur there has to date (June 2017) identified at least 372 type A Killer   Whales (specialist predators of Minke Whales; R. Pitman unpublished data).   Photo-identification studies in the Prince Edward Island Archipelago (mainly   around Marion Island) from 2006-2009 estimated a local population there of   around 42 individuals (95% CI=35-50) that prey seasonally on Penguins and Elephant   Seals (Reisinger <em>et al</em>. 2011). In   other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, 119 (CV=0.20) Killer Whales have been   estimated in New Zealand waters (Visser 2000), and 30 were identified off northern   Patagonia, Argentina, during 1975-1997 (Lopez and Lopez 1985, Iñíguez 2001). No   abundance estimates have been made for type D Killer Whales in the Southern   Hemisphere.<br/>   <br/>   According to Forney and Wade (2006), although the available data are far from   complete, abundance estimates for sampled areas provided a minimum worldwide   abundance estimate of about 50,000 Killer Whales of all types. Those authors   noted that the total was likely higher, because estimates were not available   for many high-latitude areas of the northern hemisphere and for large areas   of the South Pacific, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Killer Whale is the most cosmopolitan of all cetaceans and may be the second-most widely ranging mammal species on the planet, after Humans (Rice 1998). Killer Whales may occur in virtually any marine habitat but are most common in cold-water areas of high marine productivity, particularly at higher latitudes and near shore (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Forney and Wade 2006). Sightings range from the surf zone to the open sea with no clear restrictions of water temperature or depth on their range. The distribution extends to many semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf.<br/></p>  <p>Although Killer Whales occur worldwide, reported densities are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower in the tropics than in the highest latitudes in the Arctic and Antarctic where there has been sampling (Forney and Wade 2006). Killer Whales tend to be more common along continental margins; however, there is some variation in this general pattern that appears linked to ocean productivity. Killer Whales appear to be less common in warm western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio Current, than in more productive eastern boundary currents, such as the California Current. However, they are also common in cold-water western boundary currents such as the Oyashio and Falkland Currents.<br/> <br/> The map shows the inferred range based on a very large number of observations at sea.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>During the period 1962-1977, at least 65 Killer Whales were live-captured in British Columbia and Puget Sound, Washington (Bigg 1982). In addition, from 1976-1988, 59 Killer Whales were captured alive off Iceland: eight were released, three died and 48 (average 3.7 per year) were exported (Sigurjónsson and Leatherwood 1988). Small numbers of Killer Whales have also been live-captured in Japanese waters (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Killer Whales are still in demand for display in aquariums and amusement parks, especially in China. Most recent captures and exports have been of animals in the Russian Far East (Fisher and Reeves 2005, Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014). Of 21 Killer Whales known to have been live-captured in the western Sea of Okhotsk from 2012-2016, at least 13 of them were exported to China between 2013 and 2016 (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). The eastern North Atlantic as well as the ENP populations are included in Appendix II of CMS. <br/> <br/> Further studies on subpopulation structure, abundance and life history are needed for most regions. Regional populations of Killer Whales can be small and highly specialized, and therefore vulnerable to over-exploitation, disturbance, prey reductions and habitat deterioration. Several small populations are already recognized as having a high risk of extinction. Many similarly small and threatened populations may exist worldwide but have not yet been adequately studied and described (e.g., Foote <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50381544,41715,Phocoena dioptrica,Least Concern,,2018,2018-04-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Spectacled Porpoise occurs in cold temperate and sub-Antarctic waters of the Southern Hemisphere. The small number of at-sea sightings suggest that the distribution of this species is circumpolar. It is known from the east coast of South America, southern Australia and a few islands in cold waters of the sub-Antarctic.&#160;No abundance estimates or estimates of mortality are available.&#160;The lack of sightings is likely to be at least partially due to the harsh sighting conditions in its Southern Ocean habitat, combined with typically very small group sizes (1-4) and cryptic behaviour. Abundance therefore may be higher than is suggested by the small number of records (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 2006). This is the second most common species stranded on the coast of Tierra del Fuego, and as for other porpoises, bycatch may be a conservation issue.<br/><br/>The species was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. DD was considered as still potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Red List Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) regarding the use of DD includes the statement that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” Although the information is sparse, this species appears to occur in a variety of locations and across a substantial swath of ocean in sub-Antarctic waters, and the categories of EN and CR cannot be plausibly applied and VU is highly unlikely. Therefore, it was concluded that the species does not belong in the DD category. There is very little information on this species, and there is a great deal of evidence that animals in the genus <em>Phocoena</em> are highly susceptible to entanglement in fishing gear (see assessments of <em>P. sinus</em>, <em>P. spinipinnis</em>, and <em>P. phocoena</em>). It is possible that there are, or have been, undetected or inadequately documented population declines, and stranding rates around Tierra del Fuego are of concern. Given this, a precautionary listing of Near Threatened was considered and very nearly selected for this species. However, due to its wide range in remote Southern Ocean waters where relatively little bycatch-prone fishing is known to occur, the Spectacled Porpoise is listed as Least Concern. Such listing should be considered as provisional pending more information on this data-poor species.</p>  <p></p>","Spectacled Porpoises occur only in cold temperate and sub-Antarctic waters in the Southern Hemisphere. Although they have been caught in gillnets in coastal waters of South America, their habitat is thought to be primarily oceanic. Water temperatures associated with sightings ranged from 0.9°C to 10.3°C (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 2006). Spectacled Porpoises occur in very small groups ranging from 1-4 individuals, and single animals are the most frequently encountered (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 2006). Nothing is known with certainty about migration or seasonal movements of this species (Goodall and Brownell 2018) but researchers working in Tierra del Fuego suspect, judging by the seasonal pattern of strandings, that they come close to the coast during summer months, probably for reproduction (Dellabianca personal observations). Only four stomachs have been examined; the contents included anchovies and stomatopods (Mantis Shrimp) (Goodall and Brownell Jr. 2018). Stable isotope analysis of bones from porpoises stranded in Tierra del Fuego suggested offshore foraging in oceanic waters near to the Antarctic Convergence (Riccialdelli <em>et al.</em> 2010).","Like other species of phocoenoids, Spectacled Porpoises are caught incidentally in gillnets (Jefferson and Curry 1994). At least 34 animals were killed between 1975 and 1990 in coastal gillnets set in Tierra del Fuego, and there was a co-occurrence of strandings and fishing activity in southeastern Chile, suggesting additional undocumented mortality from this source (Crespo <em>et al</em>. 1994, Goodall and Shiavini 1995). Some mortality of Spectacled Porpoises was also reported from bottom and mid-water trawls off the coast of Chubut, Argentina (Brownell and Clapham 1999).","There are no estimates of abundance for Spectacled Porpoises anywhere in their range. Sekiguchi <em>et al.</em> (2006) compiled 28 sightings of this species from surveys conducted during International Whaling Commission/International Decade of Cetacean Research/Southern Ocean Whale and Ecology Research cruises in the Antarctic from 1978 to 2004. They reported that Spectacled Porpoises are very difficult to sight at sea, mainly because of their small body size and group size (average 2 individuals, range 1-4) and inconspicuous behaviour. Almost all Spectacled Porpoise sightings were recorded close to the survey vessel (range 0.03-1.5 nm) and under excellent survey conditions (96.3% in Beaufort sea state 0 and 1). Thus, the paucity of sightings was considered to be mainly due to the typically poor weather conditions in the vicinity of the Polar Front making them difficult to detect (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 2006). The rough conditions that make detection in the area of suspected distribution makes it impossible to measure the numbers of porpoises using visual methods. Acoustic methods may improve chances of estimating abundance if the porpoises do not evade ships beyond the distance where vocalizations could be detected. The majority of records of the Spectacled Porpoise globally are of stranded animals in Tierra del Fuego where it is the second most frequently stranded cetacean species (Goodall and Brownell 2018).",Unknown,"The&#160;Spectacled Porpoise&#160;is known primarily from the southern coasts of eastern South America, from Uruguay and southern Brazil to Tierra del Fuego (Brownell and Clapham 1999).

Although rarely seen at sea, it is assumed that the Spectacled Porpoise’s range is circumpolar and that it occurs in oceanic waters in the vicinity of the Polar Front in the sub-Antarctic zone (within a range of water temperatures of at least 1-10°C) (Sekiguchi <em>et al</em>. 2006, Goodall and Brownell 2018).

66993062,2058,Arctocephalus gazella,Least Concern,,2016,2014-12-10 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Antarctic Fur Seals are the most abundant species of Fur Seal and are classified as Least Concern. While some 95% of Antarctic Fur Seals haul out and breed at the island of South Georgia, they also use 11 other sites. The estimated number of adult females at South Georgia in 2012 was 550,000 and this number is believed to represent a decline of 24% since 1984. These values have, however, been questioned because of limitations in sampling. The second largest population, at Bouvetøya, experienced rapid growth to 2001 but a decline between then and 2007. Most other colonies support several hundred to several thousand animals. No subpopulations exist and movement between colonies takes place. Neither this species as a whole, nor any separate colonies, are likely to become extinct in the near future. The greatest threat to this species is considered to be the impact of climate change on its physical environment and populations of its prey. The impacts of other threats, including the impact of incipient fishing industries on prey populations and entanglement in anthropogenic debris, remain low. Due to a population bottleneck experienced by this species at the height of intensive exploitation, genetic diversity is low, which may render this species more vulnerable to climate change and disease.","Antarctic Fur Seals are a sexually dimorphic species. Adult males are approximately 1.8 m long and weigh between 130 and 200 kg. Adult females are 1.2-1.4 m and 22-50 kg. Newborns weigh six to seven kilograms (Laws 1993). Age of first reproduction is three years for females (Lunn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994) and seven years for males (McCann and Doidge 1987). <br/><br/>Antarctic Fur Seals are highly polygynous. The first adult males arrive at their colonies in late October, some two to three weeks before the first adult females. Males continue to arrive and challenge one another for territories throughout the season. Territories are acquired and held by use of vocalizations, threat postures, and fighting (Bonner 1968). Females begin to arrive in mid-November and most pupping and breeding occurs from late November to late December. Adult females give birth one to two days after arrival at the colony and subsequently attend their pup for six to seven days. They come into oestrous, mate and then depart shortly afterwards on their first foraging trip of the season (Payne 1977,&#160;Doidge <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1986). Foraging trip and attendance periods vary inter-annually depending on the availability of the lactating female’s prey, but generally last four to five days at sea followed by two to three days attendance on shore (Costa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1989,&#160;Boyd 1999,&#160;Guinet <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Kirkman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Antarctic Fur Seals undertake short shallow dives, primarily at night (Boyd and Croxall 1992, Costa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000,&#160;Robinson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002,&#160;Goldsworthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Mean dive depth and duration increase during the lactation period (Costa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1989,&#160;Boyd 1999, Guinet <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). The maximum diving depth recorded for lactating females is 181 m (Boyd and Croxall 1992). <br/><br/>Pups are weaned at about four months of age. After the pups are weaned, seals are thought to disperse widely and are seldom seen at the colonies before the next breeding season (Kerley 1983,&#160;Boyd&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1998,&#160;Warren <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Breeding bulls also depart the rookery, but subadults and some adult males can be seen at rookeries at all times of the year (Bonner 1968,&#160;Payne 1977,&#160;Kerley 1983,&#160;Boyd <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998). <br/><br/>The diet of Antarctic Fur Seals varies by season and locality. At South Georgia and other islands of the Scotia Arc, and at Bouvetøya, they feed primarily on Krill (Kirkman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000,&#160;Staniland and Pond 2005,&#160;Hofmeyr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Polito and Goebel 2010). At Heard Island, Macquarie Island, the Îles Crozet and the Prince Edward Islands, Krill is not as abundant and Antarctic Fur Seals prey primarily on cephalopods and fish such as myctophids and notothenids (Lea <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Robinson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002,&#160;Casper&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007,&#160;Cherel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007,&#160;Cherel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008,&#160;Makhado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008,&#160;Kernaléguen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Antarctic Fur Seals have also been known to eat Penguins at a number of sites (Bonner 1968, Green <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1989, Hofmeyr and Bester 1993).<br/><br/>Antarctic Fur Seals are sympatric with other species of Fur Seals at three sites. Hybridization with Subantarctic Fur Seals occurs at the Prince Edward Islands (Hofmeyr <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006a) and the Îles Crozet (Kingston and Gwilliam 2007) and with both Subantarctic Fur Seals and New Zealand Fur Seals at Macquarie Island (Lancaster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006,&#160;Goldsworthy&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010,&#160;Lancaster&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). Levels of hybridization are low at the Prince Edward Islands (Hofmeyr <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006a) and at Îles Crozet (Kingston and Gwilliam 2007) and thus do not affect the integrity of this species. The population at Macquarie Island comprises 0.02% of the species total population (Goldsworthy <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).","Commercial sealing drove Antarctic Fur Seals to the brink of extinction by the late 19th century. It is now believed that this species survived the period of over-exploitation in very small numbers at three sites: South Georgia, Bouvetøya and the Îles Kerguelen (Wynen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2000,&#160;Hofmeyr <em>et al.</em> 2005), and possibly a fourth site at the South Shetland Islands (Bonin <em>et al.</em> 2013). While this species has lost considerable genetic diversity due to the historical population bottleneck (Wynen <em>et al.</em> 2000) and is potentially at risk from disease outbreaks and environmental change, unexpected levels of diversity are present (Bonin <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Waters inhabited by Antarctic Fur Seals are exploited by few fisheries, but these may expand in their range in the future (Hanchet <em>et al.</em> 2003). This species has been recorded entangled in marine debris such as discarded fishing line, nets, packing bands and other objects. The majority of this debris is believed to be generated by the fishing industry (Arnould and Croxall 1995, Hofmeyr <em>et al.</em> 2006b). The numbers of Antarctic Fur Seals entangled in anthropogenic debris has been estimated to be 0.4% of the total population at South Georgia (Arnould and Croxall 1995), 0.24% of the combined Antarctic/Subantarctic Fur Seal populations at the Prince Edward Islands (Hofmeyr <em>et al.</em> 2002), and 0.059 % at Bouvetøya (Hofmeyr <em>et al.</em> 2006b). Most entangled seals are expected to die as a result of their entanglement (Bonner and McCann 1982, Croxall <em>et al.</em> 1990). <br/><br/>Leopard Seals have been noted to take as many as a third of the Antarctic Fur Seal pups born at sites in the South Shetland Islands (Hiruki <em>et al.</em> 1989). Levels of predation may be high enough to cause a population decline at these sites (Boveng <em>et al.</em> 1998). New Zealand Sea Lions have been reported to kill up to half of the Antarctic Fur Seal pup production in a season at Macquarie Island (Robinson <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The risk of transfer of diseases such as morbillivirus from other pinnipeds or terrestrial animals to Antarctic Fur Seals is unknown. Antarctic Fur Seals are considered to be one of several pinnipeds at high risk of future disease outbreaks because of their tendency to congregate in large dense aggregations and the effect of environmental changes associated with global warming on the spread of diseases (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990). <br/><br/>Tourism takes place at several localities, but due to the isolation of haulout sites, visits by tourists are rare (Kirkwood&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;Hofmeyr and Bester 2008). <br/><br/>The effect of global climate change on Antarctic Fur Seals is unknown, but it has been suggested that warming may impact them indirectly by altering environmental conditions and causing changes in prey population distribution and abundance, resulting in population decline (Learmonth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Siniff&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008,&#160;Kovacs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;McDonald&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;Forcada and Hoffman 2014, McBride <em>et al.</em> 2014). The severe population bottleneck experienced by this species, and the resulting reduction in genetic variation (Wynen <em>et al.</em> 2000), may render this species more vulnerable to climate change (Kovacs&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;Forcada and Hoffman 2014).","<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Antarctic Fur Seals are believed to be the most abundant species of Fur Seal (Wickens and York 1997). The island of South Georgia supports approximately 95% of all Antarctic Fur Seals. The total population of this site in 1999/2000 was estimated to be between 4.5 and 6.2 million (I. Boyd pers. comm. in SCAR EGS 2008). However, the abundance of adult females is estimated to have declined by some 30% between 2003 and 2012, and by 24% since 1984 to around 550,000. It has been suggested that this decline is due to the effects of global climate change on prey availability (Forcada and Hoffman 2014). The methods used to derive these population values have, however, been questioned (Boyd 2014).<br/><br/>The second largest Antarctic Fur Seal population, at Bouvetøya, supported some 47,000 individuals in the 2007/08 season (G. Hofmeyr pers. comm. in SCAR EGS 2008). Estimates indicate that while it was stable between 1992 and 2001 (Hofmeyr <em>et al.</em> 2005) this population experienced a 5.6% mean annual decline between 2001 and 2006. Other populations range in size from a few hundred to a few thousand (SCAR EGS 2008). All other populations are believed to be either increasing or stable, although in many cases recent estimates are lacking (Bester <em>et al.</em> 2003, Goebel <em>et al.</em> 2003,&#160;Page&#160;<em>et al.</em>2003, Lancaster&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, SCAR EGS 2008, Goldsworthy <em>et al.</em> 2009, Wege <em>et al.</em> in prep.).&#160; Because of questions with the adequacy of sampling at South Georgia, and the lack of systematic monitoring at other locations, the overall magnitude of recent declines is unknown.<br/><br/>Antarctic Fur Seals likely have a continuous global range with no distinct subpopulations. Genetic evidence indicates relatively low levels of population substructure, however with two partially differentiated regions, one centred on South Georgia and one on the Îsles Kerguelen (Wynen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Antarctic Fur Seals are able to travel great distances, having been recorded to move between island groups (Boyd <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1998) and as vagrants to distant localities (Shaughnessy and Burton 1986, Drehmer and De Oliviera 2000, Bester <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Shaughnessy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Further evidence of movement between island groups is indicated by the exceptional population growth of some sites, which can only be attributed to immigration (Shaughnessy and Goldsworthy 1990, Page&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Hofmeyr <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005a, Hofmeyr&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006a) and the appearance of leucistic individuals, which are characteristic of South Georgia, at other distant sites (Hofmeyr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;200,5de Bruyn <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Wege <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Generation length has been calculated at 9.1 years (Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). Population change over the three generations from 1984–2012 has likely been negative at South Georgia Island (Forcada and Hoffman 2014).</p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>Antarctic Fur Seals inhabit the Southern Ocean and are widely-distributed in waters south, and in some areas north, of the Antarctic Convergence (Bonner 1968). While most Antarctic Fur Seals breed at South Georgia (Boyd 1993), colonies are also found on the South Shetland Islands (Goebel <em>et al</em>. 2003), the South Orkney Islands (Boyd 1993), the South Sandwich Islands (Holdgate 1962), the Prince Edward Islands (Bester <em>et al</em>. 2003, Hofmeyr <em>et al</em>. 2006a), Îles Crozet (Guinet <em>et al</em>. 1994), Îles Kerguelen (Guinet <em>et al</em>. 2000), Heard Island (Page <em>et al</em>. 2003), McDonald Island (Johnstone 1982), Macquarie Island (Goldsworthy <em>et al</em>. 2009) and Bouvetøya (Hofmeyr <em>et al</em>. 2005). Vagrants have been recorded at Gough Island (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2006), Tristan da Cunha (Bester <em>et al</em>. 2014) and on the coasts of Antarctica (Shaughnessy and Burton 1986), southern South America (Drehmer and De Oliviera 2000), and Australia (Shaughnessy <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Antarctic Fur Seals disperse widely when at sea (Boyd <em>et al</em>. 1998, Staniland <em>et al</em>. 2012), however few data on distribution and movements at sea have been published.</p>","<p>Antarctic Fur Seals were last harvested in the early 20th century. Some 170 were taken at South Georgia in 1907 (McCann and Doidge 1987), and 800 were taken at Bouvetøya in 1927 (Olstad 1929 cited in Fevolden and Sømme 1976). This species has not been exploited since then.</p>",Terrestrial|Marine,"Antarctic Fur Seals are protected by virtue of the isolation of their marine habitat and haulout sites. The Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals protects populations of this species of Fur Seal below 60ºS.

130482064,2475,Balaenoptera borealis,Endangered,A1abd,2018,2018-06-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The cause of the population reduction in Sei Whales (commercial whaling) that occurred in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is reversible and is understood and has been brought under control. For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The three-generation time period for applying criterion A is 70 years. Following the end of large-scale whaling in the late 1970s, some recovery of the population is inferred based on standard assumptions about the population dynamics. Recent abundance estimates for Sei Whales from the North Pacific are consistent with the inferred rate of recovery. There is little direct evidence of recovery in the Southern Hemisphere where the greatest declines occurred, but there has also been little monitoring effort there, and the recovery predicted by the population model is assumed. The species has been listed as Endangered, but plausible projections of the population size indicate that the global population of&#160;mature animals&#160;may have recovered to around 30% of the 1948 level by 2018. The corresponding extent of reduction, at 70%, is at the borderline between Endangered and Vulnerable under criterion A1. In view of the Red List rule that taxa should remain in a higher category of threat for five years after ceasing to meet the criteria for that category, the species remains classified as Endangered, but should be re-evaluated in five years, at which time it can be reclassified to Vulnerable unless new data cast doubt on the predicted recovery.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Sei Whales exhibit a greater variety in diet than some other large whales such as Blue Whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), but tend to feed on only one type of prey at a time. Whale stomachs examined in the northeastern Atlantic contained copepods and euphausiids (Jonsgård and Darling 1977). Of 21,713 stomachs examined from pelagic catches in the North Pacific during 1952-71, 82.7% contained copepods only and 12.6% contained euphausiids only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977). Sei Whale stomachs analysed in the eastern North Pacific off California contained euphausiids and anchovies (Rice 1977) and off British Colombia they fed primarily on copepods in some years and euphausiids or fish in other years (Flinn <em>et al</em>. 2002). Stomachs of Sei Whales taken by Soviet operations in the western North Pacific included copepods and euphausiids, as well as Anchovy, Sardine, Saury, Walleye Pollock, Mackerel, Capelin, and squid (Shuntov and Ivanov 2015). Some of these prey items plus euphausiids were also found in stomachs of Sei Whales taken in Japanese operations in the northwest Pacific in 2009 (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2012). Of 31,494 stomachs examined in the Southern Hemisphere during 1961-66, 54.3% contained euphausiids only, 30.5% contained copepods only, and 14.4% contained amphipods only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977).<br/><br/>Studies have shown a clear differentiation between Sei Whale and Bryde’s Whale habitats in the western North Pacific, where each species favoured different ranges in sea surface temperatures and related covariates, Sei Whales being found in areas with lower sea surface temperatures (Sasaki <em>et al.</em> 2013, Murase <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, in other parts of the world Sei and Brydes Whales have been found to be sympatric in the same season (Gallardo <em>et al</em>. 1983).&#160;</p>  <p></p>","<p>Sei Whale exploitation by modern whaling was particularly intensive in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Pacific from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, following the depletion of Blue, Fin (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) and Humpback (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) Whales. Sei Whale stocks were seriously depleted during this period. Exploitation in the North Atlantic occurred over a longer period and was less intensive, except in the eastern North Atlantic, where the population appears not to have recovered from early modern whaling. Commercial exploitation ceased in the North Pacific in 1975, in the Southern Hemisphere in 1979 and in the North Atlantic in 1989 (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2016). Catches by Japan under scientific permit resumed in the North Pacific in 2002. From 2004-2013, the annual take was 100 animals and was increased to 134 per year from 2017. The IWC Scientific Committee has advised that this level of take will not harm the stock (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>There are records of ship strikes and entanglements involving Sei Whales (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009, Henry <em>et al.</em> 2014), but it is unclear whether they constitute a significant source of mortality. Because of the Sei Whale’s offshore distribution, most ship strikes could go unnoticed.<br/><br/>Rice (1961, 1974) reported a pathological condition in several North Pacific Sei Whales that resulted in deterioration or loss of baleen; however, the current frequency of this condition, and its impact (if any) on the population, are unknown.<br/><br/>An unusual mass mortality of at least 343 Sei Whales that occurred in southern Chile in March 2015 is still under investigation but may have been caused by a harmful algal bloom associated with a developing El Niño event, the frequency of which can be expected to increase as the Pacific Ocean warms (Häussermann<em> et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p></p>","<p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes three stock divisions for Sei Whales in the North Atlantic: Nova Scotia (including the waters off the east coast of the U.S.A.); Iceland-Denmark Strait; and Eastern (including the waters of Spain, Portugal, British Isles, Faroes, and Norway), but the divisions were chosen on largely arbitrary grounds (Donovan 1991). The West-Greenland-Labrador Sea area is not assigned to a stock division, but Sei Whales are present there. Genetic comparisons of Sei Whales from different North Atlantic locations found no evidence for population structure but did not rule it out (Huijser <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>About 17,000 Sei Whales were recorded caught by modern whaling in the North Atlantic (Allison 2017). In addition, a proportion of the approximately 13,000 unspecified large whales caught in the North Atlantic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries would have been Sei Whales, given that the specified catch in the same areas in the following years included Sei Whales. Sei Whales appear to have been depleted in the eastern North Atlantic, with nearly 10,000 recorded taken in Norwegian and British waters prior to 1940 (not counting unspecified whales), but fewer than 250 since then. The species seems to be virtually absent there now: Norwegian surveys of northeast Atlantic waters in 1987, 1989, and annually from 1995–2009 have yielded only two Sei Whale sightings (NAMMCO 2010).<br/> <br/> A summer 2007 survey of the European Atlantic (an area west of British Isles, and Biscaya, northwestern Spain) yielded an estimate of 366 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.33) Sei Whales (Macleod <em>et al</em>. 2009). No Sei Whales were seen in surveys on the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, Sei Whales are still abundant in the central North Atlantic (Iceland-Denmark Strait IWC stock area), especially southwest of Iceland south to 50°N in summer. The only survey with reasonably complete coverage and designed specifically for the purpose of estimating Sei Whale abundance was in 1989, and yielded a population estimate of 10,300 (CV 0.27) (Cattanach <em>et al</em>. 1993). Areas of Sei Whale summer abundance seem to shift markedly between years, more so than for other baleen whale species (Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. 2004). Sei Whales were among the most commonly sighted whales in a 2004 summer survey in the mid-Atlantic Ridge region, with a total of 53 sightings (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2008). The 2007 Trans-NASS survey yielded an estimate of ~5,000 (CV ~0.5) Sei Whales but covered a smaller area than the 1989 survey (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2010). Surveys of U.S. and southern Nova Scotian waters during 2010-14 yielded an estimate of 919 (CV 0.31) Sei Whales averaged (with inverse variance weighting) over spring, summer, and fall, or 849 (CV 0.42) whales in summer only (Palka <em>et al</em>. 2017). These estimates are similar to the estimate of 870 Sei Whales obtained by Chapman and Mitchell (1977) from data collected in this area during 1966-69. About 1,200 Sei Whales were taken off Nova Scotia during 1962–72. Surveys of Atlantic Canadian waters in 2007 yielded just two Sei Whale sightings, too few to estimate abundance (Lawson and Gosselin 2009). Chapman and Mitchell (1977) estimated the abundance in the Labrador Sea-West Greenland area at 965.&#160; <br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>The last stock assessment of North Pacific Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was in 1974 (IWC 1977). The “exploitable” population (animals of legally catchable size) was estimated to have declined from 42,000 in 1963 to 8,600 in 1974 (Tillman 1977). Over 40,000 Sei Whales were caught during this period, out of a total of about 70,000 taken in the North Pacific since the start of modern whaling at the beginning of the 20th century (Allison 2017). A 75% reduction in Sei Whale catch rates at California whaling stations during the 1960s is consistent with an ocean-wide decline (Rice 1977).<br/><br/>From sighting surveys conducted under the IWC POWER programme in July and August 2010-2012, Hakamada <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated 29,632 (CV 0.24) Sei Whales in the area east of 170°E. To this can be added an estimate of 5,086 (CV 0.38) obtained from national surveys west of 170°E in the same months in 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016), giving a total of about 35,000 Sei Whales.<br/> <br/> Assuming that the population was about 50% “exploitable” when commercial whaling ceased in 1975, the recent abundance estimate (2008-12, see above) would correspond roughly to a doubling of the population over the 35-year intervening period, representing a recovery rate of about 2% per year. Thus, the older and newer abundance estimates appear to be broadly compatible (see Supplementary Materials), but the relatively simple analysis of catch and whaling effort data by Tillman (1977) is no longer an accepted method to obtain abundance estimates.<br/> <br/> Sei Whales appear to have been reasonably common in the eastern North Pacific, with over 2,800 taken off Vancouver Island, Canada between 1948 and 1967 (Allison 2017) and 384 whales taken by Californian whalers between 1958 and 1971 (Rice 1977). The estimated abundance for the U.S. west coast was only 56 whales from surveys in 1996 and 2001 (Barlow 2003), but this has increased to 519 whales (CV 0.40) from surveys in 2008 and 2014 (Barlow 2016).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>The IWC arbitrarily divides Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales, along with other Southern Hemisphere baleen whales, into six longitudinally defined management areas. Sei Whales in all six areas have been classified as Protection Stocks by the IWC since 1978. Over 200,000 Sei Whales were recorded taken by modern whaling in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905–1979. The largest catches were during 1960–72, when they exceeded 5,000 in every year, and exceeded 20,000 in each of the 1964/65 and 1965/66 seasons. Most catches were taken in summer by pelagic fleets operating south of 40°S, but winter catches were also taken from land stations in Brazil, Chile, and South Africa (Allison 2017). The catches by the former Soviet Union were grossly underreported at the time: 33,000 Sei Whales were reported taken during 1950-78, but subsequently records totalling nearly 60,000 were found and are included in the above figures (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The last assessment of Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was conducted in 1979 (IWC 1980). Some extra information on these assessments is given by Horwood (1987). Based on catches/sightings per unit effort from Japanese catch and scouting vessels, the “exploitable” stock size (whales of legal size, approximately 2/3 of total population), excluding Area II (South Atlantic sector), was estimated to have declined from about 64,000 in 1960 to about 11,000 by 1979. The population assessment method failed to produce an estimate for Area II, because nearly all the catch for this area was taken in just two seasons (1964/65 and 1965/66), yet the abundance indices suggested a more continuous decline during the 1960s and 1970s (IWC 1980). This suggests that whales move between management areas, and that these areas do not correspond to demographically distinct populations.<br/> <br/> Other available evidence also suggests a severe and rapid decline in Sei Whale stocks during the 1960s and 1970s. The catch and sighting rates from winter whaling operations off Brazil and South Africa show very sharp declines. Abundance indices from the Brazilian whaling ground for Sei Whales during 1966–81 (da Rocha 1983) declined by about 90% during 1966–72. Catch and sightings indices off Durban, South Africa for 1965–74 (Best 1976) declined by over 95%. Tag-recapture data from pelagic whaling suggested an approximately six-fold decline between 1962 and 1976 (IWC 1980).<br/> <br/> IWC (1996) gives a total population estimate for Sei Whales south of 30°S in summer of about 10,000 in 1983 based on a combination of International Decade of Cetacean Research (IDCR) and Japanese Scouting Vessel (JSV) sightings data. It is difficult to know how much reliance to place on this estimate because no variance is given, but it is consistent with a severe decline. No more recent data covering a wide area are available, except for the area south of 60°S, which is outside the main range of Sei Whales. In the absence of dedicated surveys in Sei Whale habitat, and corresponding abundance estimates, it is not possible to verify whether there has been any increase in Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales since the cessation of whaling.<br/> <br/> Because of the erratic local appearance of Sei Whales, recovery is hard to detect from observations collected in limited areas. No recovery of Sei Whales in Brazilian waters has been detected since their depletion (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997, Andriolo <em>et al</em>. 2010), but Iñíguez <em>et al. </em>(2010) reported on a possible slow recovery of Sei Whales in the southwestern Atlantic based on land and aerial sightings in Argentina. <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Generation time and maximum rate of increase</strong></em><em></em><br/>The generation time for Sei Whales is estimated to be 23.3 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The three-generation time window for applying the IUCN Red List decline criterion A is 1948–2018.<br/><br/>For assessment purposes, the IWC Scientific Committee has used a natural mortality rate of about 0.06, an age at first reproduction declining with stock depletion from 12-13 years to 10-11 years, and an annual pregnancy rate increasing with stock depletion from 0.27 to 0.37-0.39 (IWC 1977, 1980, Horwood 1980). Assuming a maximum annual pregnancy rate of 0.40, a minimum age of first reproduction of 10 years, and no juvenile mortality, the maximum rate of increase is 2.7% per year. Horwood and Millward (1987) also conclude that the maximum rate of increase for Sei Whale populations is less than 3% per year. Newer data on life history parameters have been collected in the northwestern Pacific during 2004-2015 and are awaiting analysis (IWC 2017).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Population assessment</strong></em><br/>Because the available published assessments for this species are not up to date, an updated population assessment is conducted here to enable assessment of the population reduction over the period 1948-2018 relative to the Red List A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, a conventional population assessment model was used to provide an illustration of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (“recruitment”) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately. Based on the above information, fitted population sizes for the aged 1+ population size were 12,000 in 1989 in the North Atlantic, 35,000 in 2011 in the North Pacific and 10,000 in 1983 in the Southern Hemsiphere.<br/><br/>The results are provided in the Supplementary Materials, which constitute an integral part of this assessment. Results indicate severe depletion from 1948 to a minimum in the 1970s, followed by gradual recovery such that the global population of mature animals in 2018 is predicted to be around 30% of the 1948 level and to be increasing.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Sei Whale is a cosmopolitan species, with a mainly offshore distribution. The species occurs in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere, but there are no confirmed records in the northern Indian Ocean (Rice 1998, Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/> <br/> Sei Whales migrate between tropical and subtropical latitudes in winter and temperate and subpolar latitudes in summer, staying mainly in water temperatures of 8-18°C. Their winter distribution seems to be widely dispersed and is not fully mapped (Horwood 1987, 2017). Sei Whale sightings in the tropics and subtropics can be hard to confirm due to difficulty differentiating them from Bryde’s Whales.<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Atlantic the summer distribution seems to be quite variable from year to year; however, Sei Whales typically occur north of an arc running from south of Nova Scotia in the west, to the northwestern British Isles and Trondheim (Norway) in the east. They occur as far north as the Davis Strait and the northern end of the Denmark Strait, and to about 70°N in the Norwegian Sea. Occasional incursions into other areas have been noted (e.g., the Gulf of Maine, Schilling <em>et al</em>. 1993). Peaks of catch rates in early and late summer suggested a northward and southward migration through the former Nova Scotia whaling ground (Mitchell 1975). Sei Whales have been scarce in Norwegian and British waters in recent years despite significant catches there in the past. Sei Whales were caught in limited numbers, mainly in late summer, off northwestern Spain (Aguilar and Sanpera 1982). There are very few records from the Mediterranean (Notarbartolo di Sciara and Birkun 2010).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known, but some animals occur off the central eastern seaboard of the U.S.A., and they are occasionally seen in winter as far south as the Caribbean Sea and Cap Blanc, Mauritania (Rice 1998, Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2012). Satellite tagging has shown Sei Whale migration from the Azores to the Labrador Sea and to the Canary Islands (Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Winter catches of Sei Whales in an area north of the Cape Verde Islands by the illegal catcher boats Sierra and Tonna in the late 1970s may indicate wintering grounds there (Best 1992).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Pacific, the Sei Whale summer distribution is mainly north of 40°N, including the offshore North Pacific, the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. They are common only in the southernmost part of the Bering Sea, and have never been recorded in Bering Strait or the Arctic seas. They do not penetrate far into the Okhotsk Sea. Although they are rare in summer south of 40°N in the offshore central and eastern North Pacific (IWC 2018a) the presence of some Sei Whales in Hawaiian waters in both summer and fall has been confirmed (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known. Surveys in February-March 1993-95 south from Japan to the Philippines, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands found no Sei Whales (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996). However, Sei Whales were caught in winter off the Ogasawara Islands during 1923-49. Although Sei and Bryde’s Whales were not routinely distinguished at the time, Omura and Fujino (1954) found that, of a sample of “Sei” Whales examined in detail, those caught during November-April were true Sei Whales whereas those caught in May were Bryde’s Whales. Sei Whales were marked around the Northern Mariana Islands and to the northeast in January-February 1972 and some of them were recaptured in summer in the northeastern and northwestern North Pacific (Masaki 1977). Sei Whales were also sighted on a January-April survey of the waters off Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in 2007 (Fulling <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Surveys of the Eastern Tropical Pacific during 1986-2003 showed that Sei Whales were probably rare during the months surveyed (July to November) but there were problems distinguishing them from Brydes Whales (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <em><br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em></em><em></em><br/>The summer (January–February) distribution in the Southern Hemisphere is mainly in the zone 40–55°S in the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans, and 45–60°S in the South Pacific (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), with occasional catches recorded in the high Antarctic (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>Sei and Bryde's Whales were distinguished in Peruvian whaling records from 1973; after that date, Sei Whales were caught or seen on the Peruvian grounds (3°-9°S) mainly, but not exclusively, in the austral winter (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1982, 1984).<br/><br/>Sei and Brydes Whales do not seem to have been distinguished in the records of whaling stations in Chile, because only Sei Whales are featured in their catch and sighting records (Maturana 1981, Allison 2017) but Gallardo <em>et al</em>. (1983) found both Sei and Brydes Whales present in summer (February) in most of the range of Chilean whaling operations (32°–38°S). Subsequently, Sei Whales have been observed feeding off Chile (~42°S) during the summer (Galletti <em>et al</em>. 2005). This species is also regularly observed in the Magellan Strait in summer (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sei Whales are also regularly sighted in the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas (South Atlantic) with peak occurrence between February and April (Frans and Augé 2016).<br/><br/>Sei Whales were also caught in the austral winter off Costinha, northeastern Brazil (7°S) during 1947-77. Sei and Brydes Whales were distinguished only from 1967; after that date, Sei Whales represented about 90% of the catch of the two species combined (Williamson 1975; da Rocha 1983).<br/><br/>The catches of ""Sei"" Whales recorded off Angola, the Congo, Gabon, and countries in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century were probably mainly Bryde's Whales (Weir 2010). Platform-of-opportunity surveys of cetaceans in these waters during 2004-09 resulted in only one Sei Whale sighting out of over 3,000 cetacean sightings, including 88 sightings of Brydes Whales (Weir 2011). Catches off western South Africa (Saldanha Bay) and eastern South Africa (Durban) peaked in spring and autumn, and are suggestive of populations on migration routes (Horwood 1987). One specimen is known from the northwest cost of Java, Indonesia (Flower 1865). The overall winter distribution in the Southern Hemisphere remains poorly known<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, but winter sightings of Sei Whales including newborns close to the Vitória-Trindade Seamount Chain in Brazil suggest that Trindade Island and Martin Vaz Archipelago may represent a wintering ground for this species (Heissler <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>","<p>Commercial hunting of Sei Whales ceased in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, but catches under Special Permit resumed in the North Pacific in 2004 at the level of 100 per year (increased to 134 per year in 2017; IWC 2018b).

It is a benthopelagic, amphidromous species that occurs in tropical waters between depths of 1 to 30 m (Shao and Lim 1991, Jeyaseelan 1998,&#160;Riede 2004). It is found in offshore marine waters and shallow coastal embayments, also frequently entering estuaries and occasionally penetrating freshwater streams (Allen&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2002).<br/><br/>Adults occur in small to large schools near the coasts or around islands where reefs are well developed. Eggs and larvae are pelagic up to two to three weeks. Older larvae migrate onshore and settle in coastal wetlands (mangroves, estuaries) during the juvenile stage, or occasionally enter freshwater lakes. Juveniles and subadults return to sea where they mature sexually. It spawns only in fully saline water. Larvae eat zooplankton, and juveniles and adults eat cyanobacteria, soft algae, small benthic invertebrates, and even pelagic fish eggs and larvae. It can thrive and grow in water as hot as 32°C (Frimodt 1995) (after Froese and Pauly 2003).&#160;The maximum standard length of this species is 180 cm male/unsexed (Lieske and Myers 1994), and the common standard length is 100 cm male/unsexed. The maximum published weight is 14.0 kg and the maximum reported age in 15 years (Bagarinao 1994).<br/><br/>This species spawns in clear, shallow waters above sandy bottoms or coral approximately 30 m from the shore. Females can spawn up to approximately five million eggs which hatch after 24 hours. Larvae then seek out clear, coastal and estuarine waters warmer than 23°C with salinities ranging from 10-32, and abundant phytoplankton. Spawning and fertilisation is nocturnal. The distribution of this species is limited by susceptibility to predation, but temperature is the prime limiting factor (Schuster 1960). Milkfish exhibit nocturnal broadcast spawning possibly more than once a year, and there is no parental involvement after the eggs are released. Spawning is seasonal and my be influenced by the lunar cycle. The spawning season is longer near the equator than at higher latitudes; may be influenced by water surface temperatures (Garcia 1990, Bagarinao 1994).<br/><br/>Larvae are collected from rivers and are grown in culture ponds into juveniles, which are marketed fresh, smoked, canned and frozen. Broodstocks can be raised and spawned in captivity to produce larvae in the hatchery (Bagarinao 1999).<br/><br/>This species is relatively common in large floodplain lakes in northwestern Madagascar.<br/><em><br/></em>","Overexploitation of larvae for aquaculture and over fishing are threats impacting this species.

Nothing is known of age of first breeding, breeding frequency or survival (P. G.  Ryan <em>in litt.</em> 1999)<strong></strong>. Heavily affected by Hurricane Catarina in March 2004, 354 birds were recorded blown inland, all in heavy moult and near starvation (Bugoni <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). Larger numbers of females among these were thought to be due to difference in at-sea distribution or in body condition (Bugoni<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al.</span> 2007). Evidence suggests moult is completed during the exodus period and before egg-laying, which occurs from 15 June to 21 July (Cuthbert 2004).<p></p>","<p>This species is primarily threatened by a reduction in reproductive success due to depredation of nests by invasive House Mice. On Gough Island, where 90% of the global population is found, chick failure was 87% in 2014-15, with chicks attacked by mice within 2 hours of hatching and dead within 3-7 hours (Dilley <em>et al</em>. 2015). On Tristan da Cunha, rats and mice are present and have likely contributed to the extirpation of the Atlantic Petrel from the island (Richardson 1984, Wanless <em>et al.</em> 2012), with human exploitation representing another potential driver of decline on this island (Richardson 1984). It is very unlikely to be exploited today (P. G. Ryan <em>in litt</em>. 1999, A. Bond <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The large population of native Southern Skua <em>Stercorarius antarcticus</em> feed on seabirds, including <em>P. incerta</em> (Richardson 1984); however, this is unlikely to be significant except in the situation that the population becomes greatly depleted.</p>  Significant mortality of moulting adults, largely females, due to Hurricane Catarina indicates that increased storm intensity and frequency is likely to cause unpredictable adult mortality. Night strikes, as a result of being attracted to lights, are a further threat. This has been ameliorated at the Gough Island meteorological station, but may still pose a problem on ships at sea (Glass and Ryan 2013). It is, however, not thought to be causing significant declines in the population.<p></p>","<p>On Gough Island, Cuthbert (2004) estimated 1.8 million breeding pairs in 2001, suggesting a world population of around 5 million birds. The population size was re-estimated by Rexer-Huber <em>et al. </em>(2014), taking into account the occupancy rates of suitable burrows in 2010 and 2012. This new estimate indicates a population size of 860,000 pairs, varying between 630,000 and 1,100,000 pairs. Because occupancy rates varied interannually, the species’s total breeding area could only be estimated crudely, and burrow densities were assumed to be similar throughout the habitat. This estimate should, therefore, be treated with caution.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Pterodroma incerta</em> breeds only on Gough Island, Tristan da Cunha (<strong>St Helena to UK</strong>).

The species's occurrence on Tristan da Cunha is unclear; in 1972-1974 the population there was estimated to be 100-200 pairs, and there may only be a few scattered pairs remaining.&#160;On Gough Island, the first quantitative population estimate indicates a total of around 1.8 million pairs (Cuthbert 2004), which is considerably larger than the earlier estimate of at least 20,000 pairs (P. G. Ryan <em>in litt.</em> 1999). However, a recent estimate taking into account the occupancy rates of burrows which are suitable for the species halves this number and suggests a population size of 860,000 pairs, varying between 630,000 and 1,100,000 pairs (Rexer-Huber <em>et al.</em> 2014), and several studies revealed very low breeding success of less than 20% (Cuthbert and Hilton 2004, Wanless <em>et al.</em> 2007, Dilley <em>et al. </em>2015). At sea, it is practically restricted to the South Atlantic, occurring off the east coast of South America to the west coast of Africa (Enticott 1991, P. G.

Burrows are dug for breeding under tussock grass, low scrub and on the Snares Islands under <em>Olearia</em> forest. Birds typically do not return to their natal colonies until the age of four. The species feeds on fish, crustacea and cephalopods, which are caught while diving. Short (1-3 days) and long (5-15 days) provisioning trips are made by parents; longer trips allow foraging along the Antarctic Polar Front, reducing competition close to breeding grounds and allowing vast colonies to persist&#160;(Weimerskirch 1998).<p></p><p></p>","<p>The species is at risk from incidental capture in longline, trawl and gill-net fisheries and suffers the additional effects of depletion of prey stocks (Uhlmann 2003). A large number of deaths occur as a result of interaction with fisheries both during the breeding season and the winter migration to the Northern Hemisphere (Uhlmann 2003). The species is also subject to direct persecution, and harvesting of young birds ('muttonbirding') currently accounts for the take of around a quarter of a million birds annually (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Heather and Robertson 1997, Newman <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2009), but is unlikely to account for the scale of the observed decline. </p>  <p>Past investigation into the biological impact of climatic trends led to predictions of large-scale shifts in foraging distribution during the boreal summer and/or dramatic reductions in abundance and survival rate (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1995, Veit <em>et al.</em> 1996, 1997, Spear and Ainley 1999, Wahl and Tweit 2000, Oedekoven <em>et al</em>. 2001, Hyrenbach and Veit 2003). Climate change is already affecting the foraging distribution of this species along the Californian coast (Veit <em>et al.</em> 1997). Evidence shows that birds are still visiting many of the same foraging areas, but are taking new routes to avoid altered current systems (Veit <em>et al</em>. 2003). Declines at monitored breeding sites appear to be linked to changed patterns in large scale oceanic cycles which reduce prey availability (Clucas 2011).</p>  <p>Both Brown Rat <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> and House Rat <em>R. rattus</em> are present within the species breeding range, and although egg and chick predation by rats has been demonstrated, the extent of impact is unknown (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p></p>","The global population totals at 4.4 million pairs, roughly equating to 19.0–23.6 million individuals (Newman&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Waugh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).",Decreasing,"<em>Ardenna grisea</em> is an abundant shearwater, breeding on islands off <strong>New Zealand</strong>, <strong>Australia</strong> and <strong>Chile</strong>, and the <strong>Falkland Islands (Malvinas)</strong>. In Australia, there are colonies on 17 islands, all of which contain fewer than 1,000 pairs. In southern Chile, some colonies number up to 200,000 pairs, with the largest colony of up to 4 million individuals on Isla Guafo (Reyes-Arriagada <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Falklands (Malvinas), 10,000-20,000 pairs have been recorded. New Zealand supports more than 180 colonies. The global population totals at 4.4 million pairs, roughly equating to 19.0–23.6 million individuals (Newman <em>et al.</em> 2009, Waugh <em>et al. </em>2013). In 1970-1971, the colonies on the Snares Islands were estimated to support 2,750,000 breeding pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Heather and Robertson 1997). Although this is an extremely numerous species, there are persistent signs of a current decline (Brooke 2004). In New Zealand, the number of burrows in the largest colony on the Snares Islands declined by 37% between 1969-1971 and 1996-2000, and burrow occupancy may also have declined, indicating that an overall population decline may have occurred (Warham and Wilson 1982, Scofield and Christie 2002, Scott <em>et al.</em> 2008). Some colonies on mainland New Zealand have declined, and several colonies on offshore islands, especially in northern New Zealand, have not responded to predator control (Gaze 2000, Jones 2000, Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, other colonies in southern New Zealand have responded to sustained pest management with increasing numbers (Newman <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<br/><br/>The species migrates to the northern hemisphere during the austral winter (Shaffer<em> et al.</em> 2006, Hedd <em>et al.</em> 2012), and in the California Current, Sooty Shearwater numbers have fallen by 90% in the last 20 years (Veit <em>et al.</em> 1996).

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure).

It feeds mainly on planktonic crustaceans, particularly krill, but will also feed on some small fish and young cephalopods. Prey are caught under water in a pursuit-dive or by surface-seizing. It breeds between October and February in colonies on oceanic islands amongst scree or volcanic ash above the tree line, or under sand dunes in areas of relatively flat ground.

For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. Assuming a 31-year generation time, the 3-generation window for criterion A is the period 1926-2018. The global mature population size in 1926 was probably around 140,000. The current global mature population size is uncertain but likely to be in the range 5,000-15,000. This corresponds to a reduction of 89%-97%, which overlaps the boundary of Critically Endangered and Endangered with respect to past reduction under the A1 criterion (90% reduction over three generations). Given the evidence of increase in those regions where the species was most depleted (Antarctic and North Atlantic), Endangered (A1abd) seems the most appropriate category at this time, taking into account both the current population level and the likely global trend. The dominant contribution to the reduction in the global population was the massive reduction of the formerly very large Antarctic population. The Antarctic subspecies (<em>B. m. intermedia</em>)&#160;is included in this assessment, but is also separately listed as Critically Endangered.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Blue Whales feed almost exclusively on euphausiids (krill), with a variety of species being taken by different Blue Whale populations, such as <em>Euphausia superba</em> in the Antarctic, <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em> off southern Australia (Gill 2002), <em>Euphausia recurva</em> off Western Australia (J. Bannister pers. comm. 2007), <em>Nyctiphanes simplex</em> off the Galápagos (Palacios 1999), <em>Euphausia pacifica</em> and <em>Thysanoessa</em> spp. in the North Pacific (Fiedler <em>et al.</em> 1998), and <em>Meganyctiphanes norvegica </em>and <em>Thysanoessa </em>spp. in the North Atlantic (Visser <em>et al.</em> 2011, McQuinn <em>et al.</em> 2016). They feed both at the surface and at depths of up to 300 m (Sears and Calambokidis 2002, Calambokidis <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>The migration patterns of Blue Whales are not well understood, but appear to be diverse. Although there is evidence of migratory behaviour in most of the populations studied, both wintering and summering areas appear to be occupied at some level throughout the year. Some individuals may reside year-round in habitats of year-round high productivity, while others undertake long migrations from tropical waters to high-latitude feeding grounds, but possibly stopping to feed in areas of high productivity on route, while yet others may undertake more limited migrations (Branch <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Gill <em>et al.</em> 2011, de Vos <em>et al.</em> 2014, Silva <em>et al.</em> 2013, Torres 2013, Lesage <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>The main threat to Blue Whales in the past was direct exploitation, which only became possible on a regular basis in the modern era using deck-mounted harpoon cannons. Modern Blue Whale hunting started in the North Atlantic in 1868 and spread to other regions after the northeastern Atlantic population had been severely reduced, and whaling was temporarily banned in Norway from 1905 and in Iceland from 1915 (Tønnessen and Johnsen 1982). The Antarctic and North Atlantic populations were each probably depleted to the low hundreds by the time whaling ceased in the 1960-1970s, but have increased since. Blue Whales have been legally protected worldwide since 1966, although they continued to be caught illegally by former USSR fleets until 1972. The last recorded deliberate catches were off Spain in 1978 (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>Blue Whales in a calving ground off southern Sri Lanka appears to be especially subject to ship strikes, as indicated by both direct observations of strikes and strandings that exhibit blunt trauma (Ilangakoon 2012, de Vos <em>et al</em>. 2016) and observations of living animals that appear to have injuries that prevent normal swimming (IWC 2018b). The large volume of ship traffic around the southern coast of Sri Lanka makes it one of the busiest ocean-going shipping lanes in the world, but Priyadasharnha <em>et al.</em> (2016)&#160;showed that the expected frequency of ship strikes on Blue Whales would be greatly reduced by moving the lanes slightly further offshore.<br/><br/>Nine deaths of Blue Whales plus some serious injuries were attributed to ship strikes on the west coast of North America during 2007-13 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). Of 21 carcasses of Blue Whales found off California during 1988-2007, eight were found to have been killed by ship strike (Berman-Kowalewski <em>et al.</em> 2010).&#160;This suggests that ship strikes represent a substantial addition to natural mortality (Rockwood <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;Monnahan <em>et al</em>. (2015), on the other hand, argued that ship strikes have only a small effect on this population.&#160;As of 2018 this issue had not been resolved.<br/><br/>Of the Blue Whales in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence photo-identification catalogue, 16% appear to have scars or wounds resulting from ship strikes (Sears and Calambokidis 2002).<br/><br/>McKenna <em>et al.</em> (2015) concluded from tracking data that Blue Whales do not demonstrate effective avoidance behaviour when ships are near.&#160;However, Priyardashana <em>et al.</em> (2016) showed, based on densities of whales and shipping, that the expected frequency of ship strikes off southern Sri Lanka would be an order of magnitude higher than current estimates if the Blue Whales took no evasive action.<br/><br/>Incidental catches of Blue Whales in fisheries appear to be rare. The only reported cases this century were one in the northeastern Pacific in 2015 and one in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in 2002. Blue whales in cold waters often have marks or scars caused by contact with ice, which can make it harder to identify scars caused by contact with fishing gear.<br/><br/>The main food of Antarctic Blue Whales, <em>Euphausia superba</em> and <em>E. crystallorophias</em><em>,</em> are predicted to decline during the 21<sup>st</sup> century due both to reduced ocean productivity associated with warming (Piñones and Fedorov 2016) and to increasing ocean acidity that limits their shell-building (Kawaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160; Comparable changes are likely in other oceans.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic</em></strong><br/>Nearly 11,000 Blue Whales were specifically recorded as taken in the North Atlantic since the start of modern whaling in northern Norway in the 1860s, but an additional 13,000 unspecified large whales were recorded as caught in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Allison 2017), of which perhaps 30% could have been Blue Whales based on specified catches in the same areas in the same and following years. In addition, whaling in the earlier years (pre-1916) is thought to have involved substantial struck-and-lost rates (IWC 2010, 2017b) such that the total number of Blue Whales killed in the North Atlantic was probably in the range 15-20,000.<br/><br/>Catches started off the coast of Finnmark, northern Norway, where it is likely that over 3,000 Blue Whales were taken before whaling was banned from mainland Norway in 1905. Operations spread to Svalbard, where over 1,000 Blue Whales were taken, and to Iceland where probably over 5,000 were taken before whaling was banned for about 20 years starting in 1916 due to noticeably declining abundance. Over 2,000 Blue Whales were taken off Newfoundland, about 500 in the Gulf of St Lawrence and nearly 1,000 around the Faeroes, Scotland, and Ireland. Very few Blue Whales were caught off Spain and Portugal. After the main period of whaling, low-level catches throughout the range probably impeded recovery until catches all but ceased around 1960. The last recorded directed catches  were six Blue  Whales taken off Spain in 1978,  three by pirate whaling vessels, and three  by catchers boats working for land stations (Allison  2017).<br/><br/>Post-whaling abundance estimates for the central and eastern North Atlantic (Iceland, Denmark Strait, southeastern Greenland, Jan Mayen, Faeroes and the British Isles and the Norwegian and Barents Seas) rose from 298 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.25) in 1987 to 1,012 (CV 0.23) in 2001 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2009). The increasing trend is consistent with a previous trend detected in sighting rates from Icelandic whaling vessels during 1969-88 (Sigurjónsson and Gunnlaugsson 1990). The Blue Whales in these surveys were most abundant west of Iceland, but with a shift to the northeast of Iceland in recent years (Víkingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and around Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Blue Whales are now very rare along the coast of Norway despite large catches there in the past. Further surveys of this area were conducted in 2007 and 2014-16 but the data have not yet been analysed to produce updated estimates of Blue Whale abundance (NAMMCO 2017).<br/><br/>Too few Blue Whales were observed in a survey of the Canadian Atlantic in 2007 to estimate abundance (Lawson and Gosselin 2009) and none were seen in US waters in 2011 surveys (Palka 2012).<br/><br/>Only one Blue Whale was seen (west of Cap Finisterre) during the summer 2016 SCANS III surveys which covered UK waters, the North Sea, English Channel, Bay of Biscay, and the Atlantic waters of France and Spain (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). By comparison, over 1,000 Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) were seen. These results suggest a Blue Whale summer abundance in the area only in the tens. A separate survey of waters south-west of Ireland in 2013 (Baines <em>et al.</em> 2017) recorded16 Blue Whales (including resightings), and the data suggest that about 10-20 individuals were present. A Blue Whale seen in southeastern Biscaya in 2016 was the first live sighting off Spain since the last catches in the 1970s (Covelo <em>et al.</em> 2017). <br/><br/>About 500 individual Blue Whales were photo-identified in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during 1979-2015 (Sears <em>et al.</em> 2015). In view of the long time period, many of the animals in the catalogue are likely no longer alive. The Northeast Atlantic photo-id catalogue contained over 500 individuals by 2015, including 125 collected off Iceland during 1995-2005 and 335 in the Azores during 2002-15. The catalogues have not yet yielded estimates of abundance.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em></strong><br/>About 9,000 Blue Whales were recorded as caught in the North Pacific, in addition to over 7,000 unspecified whales, some of which would have been Blue Whales (Allison 2017). The Blue Whale was protected by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1966, but a further 760 Blue Whales were taken illegally by USSR fleets until 1972 (Doroshenko 2000, Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2017)<br/><br/>The best estimate of abundance for the eastern North Pacific population, from&#160;photographic capture-recapture with an allowance for heterogeneity, is 1,647 (CV 0.07) (Calambokidis and Barlow 2013). Using the estimated catch history, including the assignment of a portion of the past catches in the Gulf of Alaska to the eastern North Pacific population, Monnahan <em>et al. </em>(2015) concluded that the eastern North Pacific population had recovered to near its pre-whaling abundance, estimated to be 1,750-2,500 whales. The population seems to have been roughly stable since the early 1990s (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The international POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) surveys covered the North Pacific east of 170°E and north of 40°N up to the Aleutian chain and the Alaska coast during 2010-12 (IWC 2018a). A total of 16 Blue Whales were seen. No abundance estimate has been calculated but the survey results suggest an abundance in the range 500-1,500, but which possibly includes some of the animals that are included in the above mark-recapture estimate. Only one Blue Whale was seen during the 2013-16 POWER surveys which covered the area between 20°N and 40°N. No Blue Whales were sighted in surveys of coastal British Columbia waters during 2004-08 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the northwestern Pacific, Hakamada and Matsuoka (2016) estimated the late summer abundance in 2008 west of 170°E and north of 35°N at about 1,000 whales (CV ~0.5). The survey did not include the waters within the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone along the Kuril chain and Kamchatka, where Blue Whales also occur in summer (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Blue Whales remain rare or absent in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Miyashita 2006, Friday et al. 2013), and very few historical catches are recorded from these areas.<br/><br/>Although over 2,000 Blue Whales were taken by coastal whaling in Japan until the 1960s, no Blue Whales were seen around Japan and in the North Pacific west of 155°E in extensive scouting vessel surveys during 1964-90 (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160; Blue Whales were seen from 145°E eastward in surveys conducted during 1994-2015, but not near the coast of Japan (Matsuoka <em>et al.</em> 2016). <em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern South Pacific and eastern equatorial Pacific</strong></em><br/>A total of 5,276 Blue Whales were reported as caught in the eastern South Pacific including equatorial waters in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Allison 2017). Allowing for some Blue Whales among the unspecified catches and for some level of struck and lost animals, and a lack of catch records for some whaling operations, the likely total kill is in the range 6,000-7,000. However, about 1,000 animals which were taken in equatorial waters during the austral summer/northern winter may have consisted partly of animals from the North Pacific populations. Furthermore, in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Antarctic Blue Whales were much more abundant than today, hence a significant portion of early catches off Peru and Chile, especially in the austral winter, may have been of Antarctic Blue Whales.<br/><br/>For the first 60 years of modern whaling, catches of Blue Whales off Chile and Peru averaged only 60 per year but catches increased from 1964 for meat exports, and 964 whales were taken during 1964-67, between 19°-39°S. Following a recommendation by the Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur (the international body responsible for regulating whaling in the southeastern Pacific at the time) (CPSS 1966) catching of Blue Whales were suspended in Peru after the 1966 season and in Chile after the 1966/67 season. Clarke <em>et al</em>. (1978) cited the high catches off Peru and Chile at a time when the Antarctic Blue Whale stock was reduced to less than 1,000, as evidence that the Chilean and Peruvian whales were not from the Antarctic population, an observation that was later confirmed (see <em>Geographic Range</em> above). Sighting rates of Blue Whales from Peruvian and Chilean whaling vessels apparently remained reasonably high after catches of this species ceased (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Maturana 1982), but the high catches of the mid-1960s would probably have been unsustainable if they had been allowed to continue.<br/><br/>A survey conducted under the IDCR (International Decade of Cetacean Research) programme in November-December 1982 between 10°S and 10°N from the coasts of Peru and Ecuador out to 110°W resulted in 16 Blue Whale sightings, all within 100 nm of the coast (Donovan 1984), but the survey coincided with the onset of an especially severe El Niño event.<br/><br/>A survey conducted under the international SOWER (Southern Ocean Whale and Environmental Research) programme during December-January 1997/98 covered the area between 12-200nm off the Chile coast between 18°S and 38°S and resulted in an abundance estimate of 303 Blue Whales (95% confidence interval (CI) = 176-625) for this area (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2011). Most Blue Whale sightings were between 27°S-33°S.&#160; A mark-recapture estimate using photo-id data collected around Chiloé Island (42°S) during 2004-11 yielded an estimate of 450 whales (CV 0.17) in 2008 with no significant trend (Cooke and Jackson 2017) but it is unclear what population this estimate pertains to because it includes both resident and transient individuals. Only one match was found between the 23 “individuals” (actually: left or right sides) identified on the SOWER cruise and the 563 “individuals” identified around Chiloé Island&#160;(IWC 2017a), which suggests that the whales either belong to distinct groups or to quite a large common population. Likewise, only one match was found between the Chiloé whales and the Blue Whales individually identified off Chañaral (29°S) (Galletti Vernazzani <em>et al</em>. 2017). The overall abundance and trend of Chilean Blue Whales is currently uncertain. Williams <em>et al</em>.

From a survey in December 1996, Best <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the abundance of Pygmy Blue Whales in a survey area south of Madagascar to be 424 (confidence limits about 190-930) and suggested, based on the distribution of past catches, that the total population in the southwestern Indian Ocean was about three times that in the survey area. The Western Australia population has been estimated&#160;at 662-1,559 based on acoustic recordings during 2000-2006 (McCauley and Jenner 2010), and 712-1,754 based on photo-identification during 2000-2005 (Jenner <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, these estimates do not cover the full range of the species in the southeastern Indian Ocean, and updated estimates based on photo-identification and genetic recapture are in preparation (IWC 2017a). A total of 31 distinct blue whales were identified in New Zealand waters during 2004-2014 (Olson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and a population estimate is currently in preparation. The catch of over 9,500 Pygmy Blue Whales in the southern Indian Ocean in the period 1960-72 (Allison 2017) suggests that the initial population was at least this size, and hence that the current population is still depleted, but not as severely as that of the Antarctic Blue Whale.<em><br/><br/><strong>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Mikhalev (2000) documented 1,294 Pygmy Blue Whales caught illegally by Soviet fleets in the northern and equatorial Indian Ocean during 1963-66, mainly in the Gulf of Aden, north of the Seychelles, off the Maldive Islands and Laccdive Islands, and west of southern India and Sri Lanka. Priyadarshana <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated a population size of 270 whales (CV 0.09) in a 7,500 km² area off southern Sri Lanka, which probably does not cover the full extent of this area of occurrence. No other abundance estimates in the Northern Indian Ocean are available.<em><br/><br/><strong>Antarctic</strong></em><br/>Catch records did not distinguish between subspecies until biologists accompanying Japanese and Russian whaling fleets started recording them separately from the 1960s (Ichihara 1966, Doroshenko 2000). Branch <em>et al.</em> (2009) concluded that virtually all of the Blue Whales taken south of 52°S in the southern Indian Ocean sector were Antarctic Blue Whales. The catch history of the various subspecies can be approximately reconstructed by assuming that Blue Whales not specified to subspecies taken south of 52°S or in the South Atlantic were <em>B. m. intermedia</em>, that Blue Whales taken off the west coast of South America were Chilean Blue Whales, and that Blue Whales not specified to subspecies taken in the northern Indian Ocean or in the Indian Ocean or the western South Pacific north of 52°S in the austral summer were Pygmy Blue Whales (understood here to include both <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> and <em>B. m. indica</em>). This leaves just a few hundred early catches in the southern Indian Ocean of doubtful identity.<em> </em>Allowing for some of the unspecified (to species) catch to have been Blue Whales, and for some struck and lost whales in the early years, the estimated total historical kill is about 350,000 Antarctic Blue Whales and 14,000 Pygmy Blue Whales (<em>B .m. brevicauda</em> and/or <em>B. m. indica</em>). These figures include the approximately 9,400 Blue Whales taken illegally by Soviet fleets in the 1960s and early 1970s that were not reported at the time (Ivashchenko <em>et al.</em> 2011), of which about 80% were Pygmy Blue Whales based on the above criteria.<br/><br/>The most recent circumpolar estimate of abundance for Antarctic Blue Whales agreed by the IWC Scientific Committee is 2,280 (CV 0.36) in 1998, based on sightings south of 60°S in summer, with an estimated annual increase rate of 8.1% (95% CI 1.6%-14.9%) (Branch 2007). A recalculation of the increase rate using more years of data is in progress (IWC 2017a).<br/><br/>An estimate from Japanese surveys covering just half of the Antarctic (35°E to 145°W) south of 60° S is 1,223 (CV 0.35) in 2008, with an estimated annual increase rate reported as 8.3% (95% CI 3.9% - 12.5%) (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). However, the annual increase rate implied by the presented data is 6.6% with a wide confidence interval (95% CI 0.0%-13.2%).<br/><br/>Photo-identification of Antarctic Blue Whales during 1991-2016 yielded 441 distinct individuals of which 14 were re-sighted in different years (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160; The number of inter-annual re-sightings is too small for reliable estimation of abundance and trends, but is broadly consistent with the above circumpolar abundance estimate.</p><p><br/><strong><em>Assessment</em></strong><br/>The IWC Scientific Committee in 2008 accepted a stock assessment of Antarctic Blue Whales by T. Branch (IWC 2009). However, the assessment is redone here because the Committee's assessment did not use an age-structured model and thus could not estimate the numbers of mature individuals that are required for the IUCN Red List assessment. The historical catch data have also been revised since then (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>The age at first reproduction is not well-known for Blue Whales in general, but Sears <em>et al.</em> (2013) found a youngest age of 11 years for first known calvings of female Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific. This agrees with the estimate of 11 years  by Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) from inter-specific comparisons. The generation time was estimated by Taylor <em>et al.</em> to be 30.8 years, which corresponds to a 3-generation period from 1926-2018 for application of the A criterion for the Red List.<br/><br/>Plausible rates of natural increase, taking into account the age at maturity and reproductive rates have been estimated to be 4.1% per year (Branch 2008a) for Antarctic Blue Whales and 2% per year for Pygmy Blue Whales, which appear to have a lower reproductive rate (Branch 2008b). Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) inferred an intrinsic increase rate of 5% for Blue Whales and estimated the proportion mature to be 72% for a stable population or 48% for a population increasing at the intrinsic rate.    </p><p>For Antarctic Blue Whales, a 5% intrinsic increase rate with logistic density-dependence, and&#160;assuming a 5 year mean age at recruitment, as for Fin Whales, an annual natural survival rate of 0.975 (Ramp <em>et al.</em> 2006, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), and a total population size of 2,280 whales in 1998, would imply a mature population size in 1926 of 125,000 or a total population size of 189,000, declining to a minimum of less than 1,000 in the late 1960s, and increasing to about 3,000 mature or 6,500 total by 2018 (see Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>As discussed above, there are no complete estimates of recent or current abundance for the other regions, but plausible total numbers would be 1,000-3,000 in the North Atlantic, 3,000-5,000 in the North Pacific, and possibly 1,000-3,000 in the eastern South Pacific. The number of Pygmy Blue whales is very uncertain but may be in the range 2,000-5,000. Taken together with a range of 5,000-8,000 in the Antarctic, the global population size in 2018 is plausibly in the range 10,000-25,000 total or 5,000-15,000 mature, compared with a 1926 global population of at least 140,000 mature. The current mature population would therefore be between 3 and 11% of the 1926 level. This overlaps the boundary (90% decline or 10% remaining) between the Endangered and Critically Endangered categories under criterion A1.<br/><br/>There is evidence of increasing abundance, at least up to around the year 2000, in the Antarctic and North Atlantic, and at least stability in the North Pacific. There is as yet no evidence of trend in the abundance of Pygmy Blue Whales or of Chilean Blue Whales, but it is likely that the global population of Blue Whales has increased in recent decades.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Blue Whale is a cosmopolitan species, found in all oceans but absent from some regional seas such as the Mediterranean, Okhotsk, and Bering seas. Until the 1960s, evidence of Blue Whale distribution came primarily from commercial catches, subsequently from whaling vessels sightings, then in the 1980s and 1990s from dedicated sighting surveys and platforms of opportunity, and since the 2000s also from acoustic detections, especially of males.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic</em><em><br/> </em></strong>In the North Atlantic the summer distribution of Blue Whales extends in the west from the Scotian Shelf to the Davis Strait (Canada/Greenland) and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (Sears and Calambokidis 2002, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2010). Blue whales occur in the Denmark Strait, around Iceland and north to the ice edge, and in the northeast to and around Svalbard (Norway), but not far into the Barents Sea. Historically, Blue Whales were commonly caught along the coasts of northern and western Norway, the Faeroes, and to the north and west of Scotland and Ireland. Small numbers were caught off northwestern Spain&#160;and near the Strait of Gibraltar, but the species does not occur in the Mediterranean (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/><br/>The winter distribution is poorly known but Blue Whales may have been dispersed over much of the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2004). There have been winter sightings off the coast of Mauritania (Baines and Reichelt 2014).&#160; Blue Whales are regularly observed around the Azores in spring and at least some migrate northward from there (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2013). Blue Whales have been tracked from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the New England Seamounts and to the coasts of North and South Carolina (34°N) in winter (Lesage <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are virtually no records from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Photo-identification data show that there are two largely separate populations in the North Atlantic: the northwest Atlantic population occurs in summer in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, on the Scotian Shelf, and around Newfoundland and west of Greenland. The northeast Atlantic population occurs in summer east of Greenland, around Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard, and west of Ireland; in spring it occurs around the Azores and in winter off northwest Africa. About 500 individuals have been identified to date in each of the two populations, but so far only one crossover (from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the Azores) has been documented through photographic matching (Sears <em>et al</em>. 2015.<em><br/><br/><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong><br/></strong><em></em>Blue Whales occur in summer north of 35°N in the western North Pacific, and north of 40°N in the central North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska, but not in the Bering or Okhotsk Seas. In the eastern North Pacific, they occur year-round off Baja California, Mexico, and the California coast (Calambokidis and Barlow 2004). Analysis of song types suggest that Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific are a separate population from those in the central and western North Pacific, but that whales from the eastern population mingle with whales from the western population in the Gulf of Alaska in summer (Monnahan <em>et al</em>. 2014). While some Blue Whales remain off California in winter, some of the Californian Blue Whales, including females with or without calves, migrate into the Gulf of California in winter (Sears <em>et al</em>. 2013). Some North Pacific Blue Whales migrate in winter to the Costa Rica dome (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1999)&#160; and perhaps further south into Peruvian waters (Le Duc <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) and eastern South Pacific</strong></em><br/>Blue Whales are present year-round on the Costa Rica Dome but it is unclear whether any animals are resident there, or whether it is sequentially occupied by whales wintering from the northeastern and southeastern Pacific (Reilly and Thayer 1990).<br/><br/>Sightings recorded by whalers taking other species show that Blue Whales were quite abundant during 1976-82 in the waters west of northern Peru (exact locations not given), especially in January-March, but with much reduced presence during the severe El Niño event of 1982-83 (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Donovan 1984). Their presence in November-December from the coast out to well beyond the Galápagos Islands was also shown by sightings from Japanese scouting vessels during 1979-82 (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996). Their presence in the waters of Ecuador and Peru was shown by tuna vessel surveys during October-March 1975-88 (Reilly and Thayer 1990) and later by dedicated cetacean surveys in July-December during 1986-2003 (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Blue Whales have been hunted in the past from several locations on the Chilean coast from 20°S to 42°S in all seasons (Allison 2017). Current areas of regular summer abundance include Chañaral (29°S) and Chiloé Island (42°-44°S) (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004, Vernazzani <em>et al</em>. 2012). A summer survey in December-January 1997/98 of offshore waters 12-200 nm from the coast between 18°S and 38°S showed presence from 20°S southward, with most sightings between 27°S and 33°S (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Based on morphology, genetics and migration, Branch <em>et al</em>. (2007a) proposed that Chilean Blue Whales are a separate subspecies from <em>B. m. intermedia </em>and <em>B. m. brevicauda</em>. However, while Chilean Blue Whales are clearly distinct from the other Southern Hemisphere subspecies, the division between Chilean and North Pacific Blue Whales is not yet clear. LeDuc <em>et al</em>. (2017) found that most Blue Whales biopsy sampled during July-November on the Costa Rica Dome were genetically closer to whales sampled in the North Pacific, while most Blue Whales biopsy sampled in the same months off Ecuador and the Galápagos were genetically closer to whales sampled in Chilean waters, but there was a high degree of uncertainty in individual assignments to the two groups. There is movement between the two grounds, with individual whales matched or tracked between California and the Costa Rica Dome, between the Costa Rica Dome and the Galápagos, and between the Galápagos and southern Chile (IWC 2017a, Huecke-Gate <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Chilean waters, the seasonal distribution of acoustic detections suggests a migration to northerly tropical latitudes in winter, but calls typical of Chilean Blue Whales were also recorded year-round in the ETP (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2015). Calls typical of Antarctic Blue Whales are detected in the ETP during the austral winter (Stafford <em>et al</em>. 1999, IWC 2017a). Clearly more research is needed to clarify the seasonal presence and distribution of the different groups of Blue Whales in the ETP, as the area is used by North Pacific, Chilean, and Antarctic Blue Whales, and there may also be resident individuals.<br/><br/>Calls typical of Antarctic Blue Whales have also been detected from January to June near Chiloé Island, but appeared to be from individuals making only brief visits to the area (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Indian Ocean and southwestern Pacific</strong></em><br/><br/>Pygmy Blue Whales (<em>B. m. brevicauda</em>) occur north of 52°S, with very few or no individuals south of this latitude (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007a, 2009). They occur off northwestern Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2016), on the Madagascar plateau (Best <em>et al</em>. 2003), in the offshore waters of Kenya (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2016) around and north of the Seychelles (Mikhalev 2000), across the pelagic southern Indian Ocean, and off South Australia and Western Australia, where they form part of a more or less continuous distribution from Tasmania to Indonesia. The Blue Whales observed around New Zealand also appear to be Pygmy Blue whales, based on genetics (Sremba <em>et al</em>. 2015) and morphology (Olson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Blue Whales appear to be rare or absent in the central South Pacific between the New Zealand and Chilean areas of occurrence (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b).<br/><br/>Based on acoustic detections, Antarctic Blue Whales (<em>B. m. intermedia</em>) occur in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean only in winter and spring, while Pygmy Blue Whales occur year-round but with a tendency to move southward in the austral summer (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2013). Other data are also broadly consistent with a lower-latitude distribution in the austral winter and a more southerly distribution in summer (Zemsky and Sazhinov 1982, cited by Best <em>et al</em>. 2003): Pygmy Blue Whales were present at the Seychelles in November but not April (Mikhalev 2000), and off Kenya in September and October but not during November to January (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2016). Foetuses found in the Pygmy Blue Whales taken by Soviet whalers near the Seychelles and in the southern Indian Ocean indicated that calves are born in the austral winter (Mikhalev 2000).<em><br/><br/><strong>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><strong> </strong><br/>Blue Whales are found year-round in the northern Indian Ocean, especially around Sri Lanka, and seasonally around the Maldive Islands and in the Gulf of Aden (Alling <em>et al</em>. 1991, Mikhaelev 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2011, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). They occur virtually year-round off southern Sri Lanka but are most abundant during December to May and least abundant during July to September (Randage <em>et al</em>. 2014). Analyses of fetuses in Blue Whales taken by Soviet fleets in the Northern Indian Ocean (Mikhalev 2000) revealed no clear seasonality of reproduction, being consistent either with year-round reproduction or perhaps a bimodal pattern.<br/><br/>Anderson <em>et al</em>. (2012) considered that there is some east-west migration within the northern Indian Ocean, with peak occurrence in the western Arabian Sea in May-October, followed by dispersal eastward after the end of the southwest monsoon, past Sri Lanka and into the Bay of Bengal, with peak abundance northeast of Sri Lanka occurring in February and March. However, Samaran <em>et al</em>. (2013) found that call types detected off Sri Lanka were also heard in the southern Indian Ocean in December and January, at least as far south as 43°S, which suggests that some Blue Whales may migrate between Sri Lanka and the temperate southern Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Although Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean are tentatively considered to be the distinct subspecies <em>B. m. indica</em>, their distinction from <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> is unclear. Mikhalev (2000) found the maximum body length, body length at maturity, and ovulation rate of Arabian Sea Blue Whales to be similar to Pygmy Blue Whales in the Southern Indian Ocean.<br/></p><strong><em>Antarctic and Southern Ocean</em></strong><br/>The Antarctic form <em>B. m. intermedia</em>, occurs throughout the Antarctic in summer, from the Antarctic Polar Front up to and into the sea ice, and in the subantarctic South Atlantic including the South Georgia area (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b). The winter distribution is not well known, but at least some and possibly most of the population migrates to lower latitudes in winter. Evidence for this comes from past catches of Antarctic-sized Blue Whales off Angola, Namibia, and South Africa in winter only (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b) and more recently from acoustics: call types characteristic of Antarctic Blue Whales have been recorded in the austral winter just north of the equator in the mid-Atlantic (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2017),&#160; in the southeastern Atlantic on the west coast of South Africa (Bell 2016 ), in the tropical Indian Ocean and southwest Pacific Ocean (Balcazar <em>et al</em>. 2017), and near the Galápagos Islands (Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, there is also at least some winter presence in high latitudes (Ŝirović <em>et al</em>. 2009, Thomisch <em>et al</em>. 2016) and perhaps some summer presence in mid-latitudes of the Indian Ocean (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2013) and southeastern Pacific (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2018).","The Blue Whale was the subject of major commercial hunting in the past, which ceased in the 1970s.",Marine,"<p>Blue Whales have been protected from commercial hunting by the International Whaling Commission since 1966, although illegal catches by USSR fleets continued until 1972. No Blue Whales have been reported as having been caught deliberately since 1978.

By the end of the 20th century, under current levels of CO<sub>2</sub> emission more than 80% of the population is projected to be lost, but major changes to sea-ice prevalence are not projected to begin until after 2050. As such, while declines over the next three generations are not expected to exceed thresholds for listing as threatened,&#160;future climate scenarios predict a rapid increase in the rate of population decline, such that without mitigation the species will begin to decline rapidly within one to two generations.","Emperor Penguins are high latitude, ice obligate seabirds; they breed throughout the austral winter, are highly cold adapted and spend their entire lives in the Antarctic region, generally in association with sea ice. The vast majority of colonies are dependent upon land-fast sea ice, which they use as breeding habitat, and upon pack ice that they use as foraging habitat. <br/><br/>Information for most colonies is based upon remote sensing, only available recently, as colony access by researchers is limited. Nevertheless, the general life cycle of the species is reasonably well understood, especially for adults at colonies in the north of the species range.&#160;<br/>Breeding takes place almost exclusively on coastal land-fast sea ice, sometimes tens of kilometers from ocean access.&#160;Only one known colony occurs wholly on land, where the gradation from fast ice to land ice is continuous (Robertson<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2014), while a small number uses available land for parts of their breeding cycle. Four colonies are known to locate at least temporarily onto the top of ice shelves (Fretwell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Emperor Penguins breed throughout the austral winter. They arrive at their colonies in late March to April, and lay eggs in May to June. Chicks hatch after about 65 days and fledge in December to January (Stonehouse 1953; Prévost 1953, 1961). Chicks disperse widely often heading north into waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Kooyman and Ponganis 2008, Wienecke&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Labrousse&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). Adults moult in summer (January to March) and may travel up to 1200 km to areas of seasonally persistent pack ice, suitable for haul out for several weeks (Kooyman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004).<br/><br/>Emperor Penguins feed mainly on fish, krill and cephalopods. The relative importance of these dietary items varies with colony location and season (Cherel and Kooyman 1998, Kirkwood and Robertson 1997, Klages 1989, Wienecke and Robertson 1997)","<p>The species is threatened by the effects of projected climate change, primarily through ongoing and future decreases in sea ice concentration, thickness and duration, which are affected by wind speed and persistence, as well as changes in other climatic variables that affect ocean properties (e.g. Ainley <em>et al.</em> 2010; Jenouvrier <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2017, 2020). Global emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuels and industry have increased on average by &gt;1.5% per year between 2008 and 2017 (Le Quéré <em>et al. </em>2018), and by 1.7% in 2018 leading to a concentration of 407.4 ppm in the atmosphere, despite reductions in some developing countries (Le Quéré <em>et al.</em> 2019). Similarly, atmospheric methane has grown very rapidly each year between 2014 and 2017, and the climate warming impact of methane, if continued at &gt;5 ppb per year in the coming decades, will be highly significant (Nisbit <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>Most climate models agree that future global climate change will lead to reductions in sea ice area of close to 30% (or 40%) in the latter part of the 21st century following medium (or high) emissions scenarios (Bracegirdle <em>et al. </em>2008, 2015, Palerme<em> et al.</em> 2017) and therefore will affect Emperor Penguins (Ainley <em>et al. </em>2010; Jenouvrier <em>et al. </em>2014, 2017). However, it is important to note that already by mid-century, Emperor Penguins are highly likely to be affected as a destabilization of their breeding platforms prior to fledging, seriously diminishes their chances of breeding successfully.</p><p>The decrease of a colony on Emperor Island from c.150 pairs in the 1970s to fewer than 20 pairs by 1999, with the apparent disappearance of the colony by 2009, has been linked to a decrease in seasonally stable sea ice suitable for breeding (Trathan<em> et al.</em> 2011); in the west Antarctic Peninsula region, there has been a statistically significant negative trend in sea ice in March, over the satellite era (IPCC 2019). The colony appears to have moved to a location with more stable ice (LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>In recent years, until 2014, circumpolar Antarctic sea ice had increased in extent. In September 2014, the extent was over 20.11 million km<sup>2</sup>. Antarctic sea ice extent then rapidly decreased, but since 2016 has increased (IPCC 2019), but remained below the long-term average (see nsidc.org/data/seaice_index; accessed 2 January 2020). Trends in sea ice extent are potentially independent of changes in coastal fast ice: e.g. altered winds may lead to more extensive large-scale sea ice, but possibly reduced fast ice (Ainley <em>et al. </em>2010). Nevertheless, in the long-term, the loss of large-scale sea ice in general means that ultimately fast ice is also affected. Modelled projections of sea ice remain a key issue, including uncertainty about recent sea ice anomalies. As the Antarctic continues to change, hence so too does Emperor Penguin habitat. In the long term, Emperor Penguin habitat is likely to deteriorate to a point where suitable locations occur only in restricted refugia or, in the worst case scenario, may be completely unavailable (Jenouvrier<em> et al.</em> 2020).</p><p>The relocation of Emperor Penguin colonies will be limited by decreases in sea ice thickness and duration, making it more difficult for them to find stable, long-lasting fast ice for breeding (Ainley&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010). Colonies could conceivably move to any area of coastline where breeding habitat remains (e.g. LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2015, Trathan and Fretwell 2019). However, importantly, a simple latitudinal gradient in the loss of sea ice has not occurred and is unlikely in the future (Zwally&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2002, Turner <em>et al.</em> 2009, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2011, Stammerjohn <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fretwell <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p><p>Reductions in sea ice concentration and duration reduce the buffering capacity of sea ice to shield fast ice from ocean wave energy (Kim <em>et al. </em>2018). Such energy can contribute to disintegration of breeding habitat. In addition, basal melting of glacier around the Antarctic continent is increasing, potentially leading to further destabilization of Antarctic sea ice (Bronselaer <em>et al.</em> 2018, Massom <em>et al.</em> 2018, Rignot <em>et al.</em> 2019, Shen <em>et al.</em> 2018). Thus, existing and potential breeding areas of Emperor Penguins are subject to a variety of pressures and much uncertainty.</p><p>Out of the water, Emperor Penguins are not agile and cannot easily negotiate rough terrain; they are unable to ascend steep slopes, especially with eggs or small chicks, and require relatively flat, gradual access, either to sea ice, or to beaches (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2019). Loss of suitable breeding habitat is therefore one of the most important challenges that Emperor Penguins face. Recently, breeding on ice shelves has been reported (Fretwell <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, this was only possible where the ablation of shelf fronts or the presence of snow bridges enabled access. Similar opportunities in the future may remain limited, as access varies between years (Zitterbart <em>et al.</em> 2014). In a warming environment potentially causing increased calving of ice shelves, opportunities for this might change. Furthermore, if the rates of flow of ice shelves alter, surfaces may be more highly crevassed. In the long-term, moving onto ice shelves may not be a viable strategy (Fretwell <em>et al. </em>2014). Ice-free ground is rare in Antarctica (less than 1% of Antarctica; Burton-Johnson <em>et al. </em>2016) and the probability that suitable rock areas will emerge is difficult to predict.<br/> <br/> Another threat to Emperor Penguins is a change in food availability; changes to ocean circulation due to increasing melt of Antarctic ice may interfere with the natural processes that bring nutrients and carbon from the deep ocean back to the surface waters (Lago &amp; England 2019). How this will affect marine organisms, especially those that penguins rely on for food, is as yet unknown. Furthermore, fisheries for Antarctic silverfish <em>Pleuragramma antarcticum</em>, part of the diet of Emperor Penguins, could be developed in the future. Harvesting of silverfish and Antarctic krill <em>Euphausia superba </em>could pose a threat, if management does not adequately take into account the needs of species that feed upon these species.

Most on-the-ground studies have been undertaken at colonies in the northern part of the species range. Less is known about the southern colonies in the Ross Sea or Weddell Sea, where the intensity of winter darkness is much greater and it is colder. Pair bonding, breeding, and laying occur later in these high-latitude colonies (G Kooyman <em>in litt.</em> 2019). The natural history beyond post-moult and before return for breeding are unknown and&#160; only one study, conducted in the eastern Ross Sea, focused on non-breeders (Goetz <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/>Human disturbance is regulated in some areas; to date, seven active breeding sites are designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA), and seven are protected by the Ross Sea Region Marine Protected Area (RSR MPA), of which three are also designated ASPAs. More colonies may eventually become protected. MPAs may afford protection for different life history processes, including potentially breeding, foraging and moulting, as MPAs may provide for more comprehensive protection than do ASPAs. MPAs are essential to protect food resources while ASPAs only protect breeding areas: the RSR MPA will protect over 1.5 million km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of the Southern Ocean from commercial fishing over the next 35 years (Australian Birdlife 2016).<br/>Currently however, the RSR MPA protects only one of the Emperor Penguin meta-populations proposed by Younger <em>et al.</em> (2015, 2017). Protection of more genetically distinct meta-populations might be important for future resilience to environmental change.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct regular satellite surveys to monitor population trends in the context of habitat availability (e.g. Fretwell <em>et al. </em>2012, LaRue <em>et al. </em>2015).

It feeds opportunistically and preys predominantly on crustaceans, fish and squid. It preferably forages inshore, close to the breeding colony (Lescroël &amp; Bost 2005). Winter habitats are less well studied, but available data suggest that it prefers coastal areas, while movements are more local relative to its congeners (Tanton<em> et al.</em> 2004, Hinke <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>  <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>  </p>","<p>  </p><p>Interactions with fisheries may pose a threat to the species through incidental capture in fishing nets and resource competition (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1998). The species appears to be actively feeding on discards from trawling fleets, making it susceptible to bycatch, which potentially could be causing slow but significant declines for the minority of the population whose foraging range overlaps with fisheries (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2017). Future intensification of resource competition could lead to more rapid declines for exposed populations. Increasing oil exploration around the Falkland Islands is a growing concern for the species (Lynch 2013) and pollution from oil spills represents a threat on local scales. <br/><br/>Harmful algal blooms were attributed as the cause of the paralytic shellfish poisoning incident that resulted in a major Gentoo Penguin mortality event in 2002, from which the population took several years to recover (Pistorius <em>et al.</em> 2010). Hence, algal blooms appear to have the potential to cause population fluctuations in parts of the global population. Recent diseases leading to massive mortality at some colonies have also been observed recently at Crozet and Kerguelen, sometime in remote colonies (C.A Bost i<em>n litt.</em> 2019). The origin of such diseases is still under study.<br/><br/>Disturbance from tourism has been shown to cause decreased breeding productivity (Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2008, Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2009, Dunn <em>et al. </em>2019) and the associated marine traffic is likely to impact penguins foraging in inshore waters (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2010); increased understanding about the potential impacts of tourism will therefore be important. However, sites visited by tourists collectively account for less than 5% of total population in the Falklands (Malvinas), South Georgia and British Antarctic Territories (J.

The global-level center of its abundance is in the straits of southern Chile. Invasive Chinook salmon now occur throughout the straits of Chile, and this represents a potential major threat, including impacts from competition, predation and disease introduction. The invasion is expected to expand into other parts of its range (i.e. Argentina). The Chilean&#160;salmon aquaculture industry, which is the source of escaped individuals, is expected to expand in the near future.&#160;The centre, or the major proportion of its global population is concentrated in the area where this threat is greatest. This threat has been increasing over time, but probably began about 30 years ago. There are no data to quantify population trends at this time; and considering this major threat and the lack of understanding for the likely direct impact, it is listed as Data Deficient. It is highly recommended to conduct studies on population trends as well as the impacts from the invasive salmon. Recommended conservation actions include the continued protection of kelp forests from harvest and to improve management of invasive salmon and prevention of escapes.","This benthopelagic species forms schools on nearshore rocky reefs and kelp forests comprised of&#160;<em>Macrocystis </em>in&#160;channel and fjord ecosystems. It is not dependent on kelp, but kelp is a significant component of its habitat preferences. The diet is composed of a variety of benthic invertebrates. The maximum total length is 28 cm, but it mostly occurs at less than 20 cm (Hüne and Vega 2015). Females spawn twice per year and males provide nesting and parental care. Longevity is 8 years and length and age at first maturity is 15 cm and 1-2 years (Rae and Calvo 1995). When applying an age at first reproduction of 1-2 years and longevity of 8 years, its estimated generation length is 5 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.","Individuals of the non-native Chinook Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus tschawytscha</em>) escaped from the aquaculture industry into waters of the straits of southern Chile in the mid-1980s and had become invasive throughout the area by 2005. Juveniles and adults of <em>Patagonotothen&#160;tessellata</em> are frequently consumed by the invasive Chinook. Additional impacts include competition and overlap with the invasive Chinook&#160;for food as well as the transfer of disease from consumption of salmon food pellets (Hüne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Given its relatively small range, and that the salmon industry is expected to remain the same or increase into the future, this represents a potential major threat to this species.","This species is easily misidentified and confused with juveniles of <em>Patagonotothen&#160;ramsayi</em>.

For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. <em>Physeter macrocephalus</em> is globally widespread (thus not qualifying as threatened under criterion B), and does not have a global population that warrants listing under criteria C-D. Empirical trend data for this species globally are unavailable. However, commercial whaling at a large scale for this species in the North Pacific and Antarctic within the last three generations (82 years) certainly resulted in a global decline during this period. Commercial whaling for this species has ceased and therefore this population is evaluated under the A1 criterion rather than under the A2-4 criteria. A peer-reviewed publication (Whitehead 2002) provides a model-based estimate of global trend that can be used to evaluate the population under the A1 criterion. The results from that study gave a 6% probability for Endangered, a 54% probability of meeting the Vulnerable category, and a 40% probability of falling into the Near Threatened category. The results suggest little chance that the population would meet the criteria for Endangered or for Least Concern. There is credible and realistic evidence for either the Vulnerable or Near Threatened category. Given that the results give greater probability for at least the Vulnerable category (60%), and that this is the more precautionary category, the species is classified as Vulnerable.","The habitat of the Sperm Whale is the open sea. More specifically, Sperm Whales can be found in almost all marine waters deeper than 1,000 m that are not covered by ice, except in the Black Sea and possibly the Red Sea (Rice 1989; Whitehead 2003). In some areas, particularly in the western North Atlantic, sperm whales, especially males, can occur in shallower waters (e.g., Scott and Sadove 1997). Females and young are usually restricted to waters at latitudes lower than about 40-50º and to areas where sea surface temperatures are greater than about 15ºC (Rice 1989). Sperm Whales are generally more numerous in areas of relatively high primary productivity (Jaquet <em>et al</em>. 1996), although there are some exceptions, such as the Sargasso Sea and the central North Pacific gyre (Barlow and Taylor 2005).<br/><br/>The Sperm Whale is an animal of extremes in size (up to 18 m), sexual dimorphism (mature males have three times the mass of mature females), ecological imprint (sperm whales take roughly the same amount of biomass from the oceans as humans), and many other attributes (Whitehead 2003). The commercial value of the animal (a function of its size and the quality of Sperm Whale oil) drove two massive worldwide hunts: the technologically primitive “open-boat” hunt from 1712-~1920 (Starbuck 1878; Best 1983), and modern whaling using engine-driven whaling ships and harpoon guns from ~1910-1988 (Tonnessen and Johnsen 1982). The complex social structure of sperm whales may have been affected by whaling, lowering potential population growth rates, which are very low anyway (Whitehead 2003). On the positive side, Sperm Whales are very widely distributed (see above), and their primary prey, deep-water squid, are not yet major targets of fisheries.<br/><br/>The generation time (mean age of mothers) for Sperm Whales can be calculated if one assumes a set of population parameters, specifically age at first birth, mortality rate of mature females, and reproductive rate of mature females. There is uncertainty about these parameters, so two calculations were made using different assumptions:<br/><br/>a) Applying the population parameters most recently used for Sperm Whales by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (International Whaling Commission 1982): age at first birth = 10 years; female reproductive rate in unexploited population = 0.20/year; female adult mortality = 0.055/yr): generation time = 27.3 years.<br/><br/>b) The estimates of mortality used by the International Whaling Commission are particularly problematic, and Sperm Whales likely have age-specific survival and reproductive rates. Thus it may be more realistic (Whitehead 2002) to use the well-established mortality schedule of Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 1990) and an age-specific pregnancy rate taken from the sperm whale data presented by Best <em>et al</em>. (1984; pregnancy rate for mature females = 0.257-0.0038xAge in years): generation time = 27.5","The greatest threat to Sperm Whales, extensive commercial whaling, has ceased. However, a number of other threats of various dimensions remain.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales have had a long history of local whaling going back at least to the 1500s and intense commercial whaling beginning around 1712 and continuing to 1988. The “modern” highly mechanised phase was particularly intense around 1950, and at its peak killed around 25,000 whales per year, dramatically depleting the global population. In recent decades, some tens of whales were taken each year from small boats in Indonesia (Reeves 2002), although none have been taken in the last two years (H. Whitehead pers. comm.), and 10 are taken annually by Japan under IWC Special Permit (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets, has been a particular problem in the Mediterranean Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2006), but Sperm Whales die from entanglement in nets and lines in many other areas and in a variety of fisheries as well (e.g., Haase and Félix 1994; Barlow and Cameron 2003). Considering the widespread distribution of Sperm Whales, observations of occasional takes in relatively small scale gillnet fisheries (e.g. Barlow and Cameron 2003) suggest much larger takes in unobserved, unregulated high seas driftnet fisheries such as were common before the 1989 adoption of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly. <br/><br/>Sperm Whales sometimes take fish off fishing gear (most often demersal long-line gear), an activity known as “depredation.” Depredation of long-line catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., South East Alaska, Chile, South Georgia and several other southern ocean island areas, North Atlantic). This interaction has resulted in a few reported entanglements and deaths (e.g. Salas 1987; Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004), and has incurred hostility from some fishermen (National Marine Fisheries Service 1998; Donoghue <em>et al</em>. 2003), including shooting of whales (González and Olivarría 2002).<br/><br/>Sperm Whale tissues have high levels of some contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000); however, any population-level effects on health are unknown. The effects of noise on Sperm Whales are also uncertain. Some evidence suggests that they are highly sensitive to noise (e.g., Watkins <em>et al</em>. 1985; Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1994) while other studies have found little or no effect (e.g., Madsen and Møhl 2000; Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002). To date, all published studies of Sperm Whales and noise focus on short-term behavioural effects. Avoidance of sonar (Dawson pers. comm.) and seismic surveys (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1994; but see Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002) has been observed but no mortality has been documented.<br/><br/>Whaling on Sperm Whales has at various times focussed almost exclusively on one sex or the other. Removals of large numbers of males may have had lingering effects on pregnancy rates in some subpopulations (Best 1979; Clarke <em>et al</em>. 1980; Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997) and large males are noticeably uncommon on some breeding grounds (Whitehead 2003). The removal of large numbers of females from social groups, and of older females in particular, may have lingering, socially disruptive effects. Furthermore, recovery might be inhibited via temporary or permanent loss of social cohesion and of socio-ecological knowledge such as is known to occur in other large-brained, long-lived social mammals (e.g., elephants, Poole and Thomsen 1989). <br/><br/>Maximum rates of increase for Sperm Whale populations are very low, possibly on the order of 1% per year (Whitehead 2002). Population growth/recovery can be expected to be low in the species.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales face other threats at a more regional level. These include collisions with ships (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001), for instance off the Canary Islands (André and Potter 2000) and in the Mediterranean (Pesante <em>et al</em>. 2002), and ingestion of marine debris in the Mediterranean (e.g., Viale <em>et al</em>. 1992). <br/><br/>Causes for optimism: On the one hand, the Sperm Whale is not being heavily whaled at present and seems relatively secure from this threat in the short and medium term. When not being actively hunted, the Sperm Whale has rather little interaction with humans: most of its habitat is far from land, and few of its food sources (principally deep-water squid) are of currently harvested (Clarke 1977). Some populations, for instance the animals in the western North Atlantic that were little affected by modern whaling, seem healthy with reasonably high population densities and evidence of satisfactory reproduction (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1998; National Marine Fisheries Service 2000).<br/><br/>Causes for concern: on the other hand, the Sperm Whale, with a maximum rate of increase of around 1% per year (Whitehead 2002), is not well adapted to recover from population depletion. Furthermore, the population model considers only one anthropogenic threat, whaling, and thus posits that the Sperm Whale population has recovered since about 1980 (Fig. 1 in linked PDF document), when large-scale commercial whaling was rapidly coming to an end. This recovery is purely theoretical, and may not be occurring as sperm whales carry high levels of some chemical contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000), ocean noise is increasing (Gordon and Moscrop 1996), interactions with fisheries continue to result in sperm whale deaths (International Whaling Commission 1994), and the lingering, socially disruptive effects of whaling may be inhibiting recovery of this highly social species (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). Some regional populations of sperm whales are declining or are apparently not recovering from depletion. Even in the absence of whaling, the Mediterranean population appears to have declined over the past 20 years, with bycatch in driftnets a likely principal cause (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The southeastern Pacific Sperm Whale population, very heavily whaled during the period 1950-1980, has an extremely low recruitment rate (probably below replacement), perhaps because of the social disruption caused by intense whaling (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). The population of mature and maturing males in the Antarctic was also heavily whaled over the same period, but should have repopulated from less heavily exploited breeding populations at lower latitudes following the end of large-scale commercial whaling. However, systematic surveys of Sperm Whales in the Antarctic showed no substantial or statistically significant increase between 1978 and 1992 (Branch and Butterworth 2001).","The only recent quantitative analysis of sperm whale population trends (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material, which constitutes an integral part of this assessment) suggests that a pre-whaling global population of about 1,100,000 had been reduced by about 29% by 1880 through “open-boat” whaling, and then to approximately 360,000 (67% reduction from initial) by the 1990s through modern whaling, although much uncertainty is associated with all these estimates (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). There is no direct evidence that any part of the population has increased since the end of large-scale whaling in about 1980, although for most areas there is also no direct evidence that they have not. In some areas there is concern that populations are continuing to decline (see below).<br/><br/>The species has a huge geographic range (Rice 1989) and a global population size in the 100,000's (Whitehead 2002; Fig 1). Although there is considerable uncertainty about sperm whale population parameters and levels of exploitation, Whitehead (2002) estimated historical trajectories of sperm whale abundance incorporating many, but not all, sources of uncertainty (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). That model was modified slightly (to produce an endpoint in 2003) and run to estimate the decline in global sperm whale population size between 1921 and 2003 (i.e. over approximately 3 generations; 82yr; see below for estimation of generation time) (H. Whitehead pers. comm.). As sperm whale population size seems to have changed rather little between about 1910-1930 (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material), the calculations are probably quite robust with reference to the estimated generation time. Using the “best” estimates of the model parameters (as in Whitehead 2002), the population in 2003 would have been 44% of that in 1921. Of 1,000 runs using model parameters randomly selected from within reasonable ranges (as in Whitehead 2002), 6% gave populations in 2003 of &lt;30% of that in 1922, 54% gave a 2003 population between 30-50% of that in 1992, and 40% suggested depletion levels of less than 50% over this time.<br/><br/> Arguments can be made that the model results are overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. Factors that would contribute to making the results overly optimistic that are not accounted for in the model include not accounting for under-reporting of illegal Soviet catches in the North Pacific and Antarctica and under-reporting of Japanese catches in the North Pacific (Kasuya and Brownell 2001), other continuing threats (described below), and factors such as continuing effects of social disruption from whaling that might inhibit recovery (consistent with an apparent lack of recovery in many areas). Factors that would contribute to making the results overly pessimistic include the assumption of a relatively low rate of increase in the model and the extrapolation of a relatively high estimate of g(0) (the proportion of whales detected on the trackline) from a single study to the global population. The direction of the effect of other uncertainties in model inputs, including the effects of sex-biased catches, is not certain. Despite these uncertainties, the Whitehead model provides the best available scientific evidence upon which to base this assessment. To reduce these uncertainties, future analyses would need to address the concerns identified above. <br/><br/>Efforts to assess the conservation status of sperm whales and the impact of historical whaling on contemporary structure are compromised by the absence of a good model of sperm whale population structure; pooling data may obscure distinct geographic patterns. While Sperm Whales are known to show long distance movements (Ivashin and Rovnin 1967; Mitchell 1975) and low genetic differentiation among ocean basins, several lines of evidence suggest that sperm whales past and present, have significant geographic structure. Analyses based on historical and contemporary data from tagging records (Rice 1974; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988), blood types (Fujino 1963), catch distributions, sighting patterns, size composition, lack of recovery from exploitation (Japan), timing of pregnancy (Best <em>et al</em>.1984), photo-identification (Whitehead 2003), genetics (Drouot 2004; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999), cultural markers (Rendell and Whitehead 2003) and combinations thereof (Bannister and Mitchell 1980; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988) suggest evidence for structure in many regions. Over the past decade, several authors have investigated population structure in female Sperm Whales using sequence variation within the mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) and/or polymorphic nuclear loci (microsatellites). In general, results tend to find low genetic differentiation among ocean basins and little evidence of subdivision within ocean basins, with the exception of some isolated basins such as the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (Lyrholm <em>et al</em>. 1999; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999; Drouot <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, factors such as low sample sizes, low mtDNA haplotypic diversity and social structure alone and together reduce the power to detect population structure. In addition, it is clear that biologically discrete populations of odontocetes can occur independently of strong geographic or oceanographic features. Alternative, non-geographic based hypotheses of population structure, such as dialect and differences in diet such as are found in Killer Whales, have not been thoroughly examined. For example, Rendell and Whitehead (2003) suggest that female populations seem to be culturally structured within oceans by “coda” vocalizations and may be genetically distinct (Rendell and Whitehead 2005, Rendell <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Unknown,"The Sperm Whale has a large geographic range (Rice 1989). It can be seen in nearly all marine regions, from the equator to high latitudes, but is generally found in continental slope or deeper water. The distribution extends to many enclosed or partially-enclosed seas, such as the Mediterranean Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Gulf of California, and Gulf of Mexico.",The large-scale commercial harvesting of this species has ceased. Small-scales fisheries continue in Japan and Indonesia.,Marine,"The species is on Appendix I of CITES and Appendices I and II of CMS.<br/><br/>Management plans need both development and implementation. The International Whaling Commission manages sperm whale populations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, and Schedule of the Convention lists Sperm Whale seasons, Sperm Whale size limits and Sperm Whale catch limits (0 at present), as well as sanctuaries for all species in the Indian and Southern Oceans. However, no scheme for managing Sperm Whale populations is in place. Moreover, many range states are not members of the International Whaling Commission.<br/><br/>Regional subpopulations of Sperm Whales exist, and there has been an apparent lack of recovery in some areas or even continued decline (e.g., the Mediterranean (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).

Based on a generation length range of 12–20 years, the ratio of B/B<sub>MSY</sub> has declined between 78% and 90% over the past three generation lengths, or 36 to 60 years (1956–2016; 1965–2016; 1980–2016). However, this species is currently not subject to overfishing, and F/F<sub>MSY</sub> has averaged less than 1 over the past one generation length (12–20 years), indicating more sustainable current management. Southern Bluefin Tuna is therefore listed as Endangered under criterion A1.","Adult Southern Bluefin Tuna lead an oceanic, pelagic existence and can be found to depths of at least 1,000 m (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Like other tunas, the Southern Bluefin Tuna is an opportunistic feeder, preying on a wide variety of fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods, salps, and other marine animals (Serventy 1956).<br/><br/>Large Southern Bluefin Tuna migrate northwards to spawn in a relatively small area off northwestern Australia and to the south of Indonesia in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean (Nishikawa <em>et al</em>. 1985). Sexually mature fish have been taken on the spawning grounds every month except July, with peaks in abundance during October and February (Farley and Davis 1998) at water surface temperatures in excess of 24 °C. Once females start spawning, they appear to spawn daily, similar to other tunas. On the spawning grounds, smaller fish (150–169 cm) are better represented in deep catches, while larger fish (190–209 cm) and spawning fish are better represented in shallow catches (Davis and Farley 2001). The Southern Bluefin is an asynchronous indeterminate spawner with an annual batch fecundity of 57 oocytes per gram of body weight, similar to that found for Yellowfin Tuna. Fecundity of a 158 cm female, with each ovary weighing about 1.7 kg, was estimated at about 14–15 million eggs (Thorogood 1986, Caton 1994, Farley and Davis 1998, Schaefer 2001). It is not known whether all mature fish spawn each year, every few years, or at a lower frequency.<br/><br/>Southern Bluefin larvae have only been caught within latitudes 7–20°S and longitudes 102–124°E from September to March (Ueyanagi 1969, Davis <em>et al</em>. 1990). After the larval stage, juveniles leave the spawning ground, moving south along the coast of Western Australia, reaching the south coast by age one where they spend the austral summer (Hobday <em>et al</em>. 2016). Most juveniles continue to spend austral summers in the Great Australian Bight until about age five. While in the Bight, telemetry indicates that fish spend much of the day in the upper 10 m and tend to move into deeper waters at night (Davis and Stanley 2002). During the winters they migrate across the Great Australian Bight and around Tasmania to 45°S, along the southeastern Australian coastline to about 30oS off northern New South Wales or as far east as New Zealand. Fish older than five years disperse widely across the southern oceans, from the Tasman Sea across the Indian Ocean to the Western Atlantic. Occurrence of juveniles 2–4 years of age on opposite sides of the Indian Ocean during the Austral summer months confirms that not all juveniles are restricted to the southern coastal waters of Australia (Farley <em>et al</em>. 2007, Chambers <em>et al</em>. 2017). However, a large archival tagging study (Basson <em>et al</em>. 2012) indicated that the number of juveniles straying from Australian waters was quite small (Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>The maximum size of the Southern Bluefin Tuna is 225 cm FL and 200 kg. The IGFA all-tackle game fish record is a 167.5 kg individual caught off Tathra, in southern New South Wales, Australia in July 2009 (IGFA, 2020). Use of the bomb radiocarbon dating suggest that a large percentage of&#160; fish greater than 180 cm FL are at least 20 years of age and that Southern Bluefin can live to ages in excess of 30 years (Kalish et al. 1996). Otolith-based aging found ages of upt to 41 years (Farley <em>et al</em>. 2007, Gunn <em>et al</em>. 2008, Shimose and Farley 2016). Females outnumber males in catches of juveniles, but the sex ratio is reversed in adults, with males outnumbering females. The onset of maturity in females varies between 5 and 8 years, and length at first maturity between 110–130 cm FL (Thorogood 1986). Size at 50% maturity has been estimated to be 152 cm FL (Thorogood 1986, Caton 1994, Farley and Davis 1998, Schaefer 2001), and the mean age of maturity is 10–11 years, which does not differ significantly between the sexes (Gunn <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lin and Tzeng 2010, Collette and Graves 2019). Previously, generation length was very conservatively estimated to be at least 12 years due to estimated ages of first maturity and longevity of 10 and 40 years respectively (CCSBT 2009, CCSBT 2010). However, most estimates of spawning seem to fall between 10-15 years for 50% spawning, which indicates that 12 years is likely too low of an estimate of generation length. Even if 100% spawning by age 9 is assumed (knife edge), the generation length is likely to be at least 20 years given an estimated longevity of at least 40 years (CCSBT 2013, Farley <em>et al</em>. 2014, A. Boustany pers. comm. July 2020). Therefore, generation length is estimated to be between 12 and 20 years, although 20 years may still be an underestimate.<br/><p></p>","<p></p>While Southern Bluefin Tuna is currently not undergoing overfishing, it is overfished and its biomass is extremely low compared to the historical levels (SSB is currently ~13% of unfished stock levels in southern Australia). Canning has been the most important form of local utilization of this highly esteemed fish until the early 1980s. Currently, Japan is the primary market, with a very high percentage of the world catches consumed as sashimi (Polacheck 2012, Collette and Graves 2019). <br/><br/>Although the species is not currently overfished, at least in Australian waters, the main potential threat of overfishing still remains. One of the potential problems with the management of this species via annual total allowable catches (i.e. by weight of fish caught), however, is that most of the fish caught in southern Australian waters for sea cage fattening are immature juveniles, with at least 85% of the catch used for aquaculture (DAWE 2020). <br/><p></p>","The Southern Bluefin Tuna has been intensively fished since the 1950s, primarily being taken on longlines, although as of 2019, purse seines now account for approximately 32% of the catch. In 1992, the first commercial sea-cage farms began fattening purse seine-caught Southern Bluefin Tuna in large mesh enclosures moored offshore near Port Lincoln, South Australia (Chambers <em>et al</em>. 2014). Most of the tuna transferred to tuna farms are immature fish (age 2–4 years) and are fattened in enclosures for about 150 days. Worldwide reported landings show a gradual, but variable, increase from 13,716 mt in 1952 to a high of 81,416 mt in 1969, and then gradually decreasing to 10,961 tons in 1991. Catches from 1992 to 2012 were relatively stable, averaging around 16,000 mt per year, and steadily increased to 23,312 mt in 2016. Genetic and otolith composition analyses of Southern Bluefin from South Africa, Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania showed no significant heterogeneity, consistent with the hypothesis of a single panmictic stock and spawning unit (Proctor <em>et al</em>. 1995, Grewe <em>et al</em>. 1997, Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>Based on B/B<sub>MSY</sub> from the 2017 stock assessment (CCSBT 2017), the species is estimated to have declined by 77%, 83% and 90% over three generation length periods of 36, 51 and 60 years respectively. Declines were calculated using a 3-year average for the endpoints and assuming a linear decline. The highest decline estimate is likely most representative of the overall status of this species, given that a generation length of 20 years may still be an underestimate.<br/><br/>According to the most recent 2020 reports, (ISSF 2020, CCSBT 2020), Southern Bluefin is heavily overfished but overfishing is not occurring due to measures taken in a rebuilding plan. Since 2017,&#160; the CCSBT has measured reproductive capacity as Total Reproductive Output (TRO) rather than Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB). The most recent 2020 stock assessment (CCSBT 2020) suggested that the TRO is at 20% of its initial level, and remains below the target and the level that could produce maximum sustainable yield. This indicates improvements in the stock condition since the 2011 stock assessment, which indicated the stock in 2011 was at 5.5% of initial TRO, and the 2017 stock assessment, which indicated the stock in 2017 was at 13% of initial TRO.<br/><p></p>",Increasing,"The Southern Bluefin Tuna is found in the southern parts of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. It primarily occurs in temperate and cold seas, mainly between 30°S and 50°S, to nearly 60°S, but moves up into tropical waters of the Eastern Indian Ocean to spawn (Collette and Graves 2019).","Southern Bluefin Tuna is an important commercial species. The main market is Japan, where a high percentage of the world's catches are consumed as sashimi (Polacheck 2012, Collette and Graves 2019). Juveniles (~2–5 years old) are caught by purse seine and fattened in sea cages off southern Australia, where currently ~85% of the Australian catch is used for that purpose.",Marine,"<p></p>Southern Bluefin Tuna is a highly migratory species listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. The stock is assessed and managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), but practically all catches are made in the IOTC, ICCAT and WCPFC convention areas (approximately 56% in the Indian Ocean, 27% in the Pacific Ocean and 17% in the Atlantic Ocean in 2019). It is important to note that under current management, the spawning population of Southern Bluefin Tuna has continued to recover since around 2009, and the population trajectory has been tracking toward the management target (CCSBT 2020).<br/><br/>The latest Management Procedure includes an interim target reference point of 30% Total Reproductive Output to be achieved with 50% probability by 2035 (DAWE 2020). The stock is primarily managed through annual total allowable catch (TAC). The TAC for 2021 to 2023 is 17,647 tonnes (ISSF, 2020). Other conservation measures adopted by the CCSBT include requirements for fleets to monitor and submit data to show compliance with TACs, development of scientific observer programs, monitoring of farming operations and port inspection of catches. However, the monitoring of farming operations may be inadequate, and therefore the purse seine catch may be uncertain. <br/><br/>The CCSBT scientific committee has long recommended the use of stereoscopic cameras to accurately estimate the amount of caged fish in farming operations, but this recommendation has not yet been realized. The CCSBT has also implemented a Trade Information Scheme to collect more accurate and comprehensive data on Southern Bluefin Tuna fishing by monitoring trade and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing (ISSF 2017, Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

Short trips enable an increase of chick-feeding frequency at the expense of energy reserves built up during long trips. Diet comprises of crustaceans (especially krill), fish, squids and some insects (del Hoyo <em>et al. </em>1992, Cherel <em>et al. </em>2002). The highest recorded blue petrel burrow in surveys by Dilley <em>et al.,</em> (2019) was found at an elevation of 200m.","Impacts of rat and cat predation appears severe and cats appear to have contributed to or caused the extirpation from several islands (Carboneras <em>et al</em>. 2020). The eradication of cats on Marion Island in 1991 initially resulted in a rapid increase in breeding success (Cooper <em>et al. </em>1995), however evidence now suggests that the population still hasn't fully recovered since the extirpation of cats (Cerfonteyn and Ryan, 2016). Since the removal of cats on Marion Island, it is now thought possible that the impacts of chick and egg predation by introduced house mice <em>Mus musculus </em>is hampering population recovery (Dilley <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The European Rabbit may also severely impact Blue Petrels on the islands where it is present, shown by the eight-fold increase in Blue Petrel population on Ile Verte within six years of rabbit eradication (Brodier <em>et al. </em>2011).

While some colonies appear to have stabilised, mass-mortality events believed to be connected to water temperature mediated food availability are occurring too frequently for populations to recover, and as such the population is suspected to continue to decline at a rapid rate. As such, the species has been assessed as Vulnerable.   <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>This species returns to its breeding colonies in October, which range from sea-level sites to cliff-tops, and sometimes inland. Clutch size is two eggs, laid and incubated during November and December for 32-34 days. Chicks fledge and depart the colony in February (BirdLife International 2010). At most breeding sites, only one chick fledges, but there is some evidence that it is not unusual for Southern Rockhopper Penguins in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) to raise two chicks (Clausen and Pütz 2002, Poisbleau <em>et al.</em> 2008). Pairs successfully fledging two chicks has also been observed on Crozet (C. A. Bost <em>pers. comm.</em>).<br/><br/>Southern Rockhopper Penguins prey on a variety of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods,&#160;with components varying in importance spatially and temporally (Williams 1995, Pütz <em>et al.</em> 2013). There is also individual dietary specialization during part of their annual cycle (Dehnhard <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>At the Falklands (Malvinas), hybridization occurs with Macaroni (White and Clausen 2002) and Northern Rockhopper Penguins (Crofts and Robson 2016).&#160;</p><p></p>","<p>Climate change appears to be a significant factor in driving declines. Survival of adult Southern Rockhopper Penguins appears to be sensitive to ocean temperatures, with highest survival probabilities under moderately-cold to long-term average temperature, and reduced survival probabilities under increasingly cold or warm ocean temperatures (Raya Rey <em>et al.</em> 2007, Dehnhard <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Southern Rockhopper Penguins in the Falklands (Malvinas) delayed breeding under warmer environmental conditions and laid lighter eggs, with potential impacts on breeding success (Dehnhard <em>et al.</em> 2015a, b). Temperature extremes have caused collapse in accessible food resources in the past, and these are part of an ongoing trend in more frequent unusual oceanographic conditions recurring in the area (Dehnhard <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Penguins and their habitats may also be threatened by increased frequency of storm events at breeding sites (Wolfaardt <em>et al.</em> 2012). Severe mortality was recorded in moulting birds found unusually far from colonies in 2016, which appeared to be related to a set of poorly understood oceanographic conditions, leading to lowered primary productivity near to breeding sites immediately prior to moult (Morgenthaler <em>et al. </em>2018). Wind-patterns are also subject to change under global warming scenarios and have been shown to affect the foraging success of rockhopper penguins; the currently dominating southerly and westerly winds increased foraging success while foraging success was lower under northerly and easterly wind directions, which may become more frequent in the future (Dehnhard<em> et al. </em>2013b).<br/><br/>Besides these apparent bottom-up effects, climate change may also lead to top-down changes in food web structure, causing increased inter-specific competition and secondary predation, e.g. competition and predation by the rapidly increasing pinniped (fur seal and sea lion) populations (Barlow <em>et al. </em>2002, Raya Rey <em>et al.</em> 2012, Morrison <em>et al.</em> 2017). Overwintering conditions are thought to influence the proportions of birds skipping breeding at Marion Island (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2006) and potentially elsewhere. Predation by native eared seal species&#160;impacts, for example, the populations on Marion and Campbell Islands, where modelling indicates that it is an important driver of the very rapid declines in the local population. Yet, the impacts of occasional years of poor food availability appear to exert a larger impact on the species' demographic rates than do predation regimes (Morrison <em>et al. </em>2017). Overwintering conditions are thought to influence the proportions of birds skipping breeding at Marion Island (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2006) and potentially elsewhere. The number of Southern Rockhopper Penguins returning to Marion Island to breed decreased by about 20% between 1994/95 and 2007/08 and was significantly correlated with breeding success (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2008).<br/><br/>The number of Southern Rockhopper Penguins affected by oil pollution is currently not thought to be as great as in the past, when 40,000 Magellanic Penguins <em>Spheniscus magellanicus</em> were estimated to be contaminated annually in Argentina (Gandini <em>et al.</em> 1994). In Patagonian coastal waters, hydrocarbon exploitation still poses a threat (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1998), as does the potential development of hydrocarbons at the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (between 2008 and 2019, fewer than a hundred oiled individuals were reported in the Falklands (Malvinas), with the highest occurrence in September and October; S. Crofts pers. comm.<em>)</em>. Rockhopper penguins on Staten Island have elevated mercury levels, despite foraging at a lower trophic level when compared to conspecifics from other breeding sites (Brasso <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>At some sites, introduced grazing animals have caused significant vegetation loss. In the past, overgrazing by rabbits led to serious erosion and landslips on Macquarie Island; however, vegetation is now recovering following the successful Macquarie Island Pest Eradication Project (Parks and Wildlife Service 2014). The impact of grazing goats and deer at Isla de los Estados is not known and should be investigated. It is thought that introduced pigs on the Auckland Islands continue to negatively impact local penguin populations, and eradication efforts have been suggested (BirdLife International 2010). Cats and rats are present in parts of the species’ range, but have not been found to cause significant mortality (BirdLife International 2010).<br/><br/>There are very few records of disease outbreaks, although a few colonies are visited regularly. Avian cholera caused the deaths of a small number of adults and chicks at Campbell Island in 1985/86 (de Lisle <em>et al.</em> 1990). Avian Pox has been reported within the Falkland (Malvinas) population, but in a small number of individuals at few sites only (e.g. New Island in 2014, P. Quillfeldt unpubl.). An unknown disease caused up to a hundred adult mortalities at Steeple Jason (Crofts 2014). The massive mortality event on the Falklands (Malvinas) in 2002/03 was due to a Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB), causing mortality via paralytic shellfish poisoning (Uhart<em> et al. </em>2007). Impacts were region-wide, and affected populations took several years to recover (Crofts 2014).&#160; At the Falklands (Malvinas) and in southern Patagonia, adult mortalities of an unknown extent were reported during the moulting period following the breeding season 2015/16 (Crofts and Stanworth 2016, 2017, A. Raya Rey <em>pers. comm.</em>).</p><p>Egg collection was common at some colonies until the 1950s, such as in the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), but is now prohibited. Historically, penguins were taken as bait for use in crab pots at a number of sites, including some Chilean islands (Ryan and Cooper 1991, P. G. Ryan <em>in litt.</em> 1999). The disappearance of the colony on Isla Recalada in Chile indicates that human depredation, in this case the collection of zoological specimens and as bait for crab pots (Oehler <em>et al. </em>2007), is still a serious threat to colonies where sites are accessible and not well protected. Although the number of birds taken in recent years from other Chilean colonies is less than 500 individuals per year (BirdLife International 2010), the potential remains to drive slow declines in parts of the species's range.<br/><br/>Another potential threat stems from interaction with fisheries; levels of bycatch mortality appear to be insignificant, but resource competition and indirect changes to the food web through modification of ecosystems may have more extensive impacts (Crawford <em>et al. </em>2017). Land-based human threats at breeding sites, such as tourism, research and land management, are considered low, and although it may vary on local scales, disturbance from such activities is currently deemed not significant at an overall population level at the Falklands (Malvinas) (Crofts 2014).

The population trend appears to be increasing (except at the northern limit of the range), and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","<p>This species has an unique, prolonged, breeding season (14-15 months) among penguins with an asynchronous laying period. Because of the long breeding cycle, colonies are continuously occupied and crèched chicks can be observed throughout the year. Hence, it spends much of its time near breeding areas. <br/><br/>The breeders usually lay an egg every year, even when failure is almost certain. Successful breeding occurs, at best, every two years only (Jiguet and Jouventin 1999). The King Penguin does not build a nest but incubates its egg on the feet. It is highly territorial. <br/><br/>It is an oceanic, long-distance forager (Bost <em>et al.</em> 2009), capturing prey by means of pursuit deep-diving mostly during the day, and foraging at depths of 160-200 m, up to more than 360 m (Bost<em> et al. </em>2002, Charrassin <em>et al.&#160;</em>2002). The prey comprises mainly myctophid fish but ice fish and cephalopods are also taken. It captures prey by means of pursuit, diving mostly during the day, and forages at depths of 160-200 m. <br/><br/>In the non-breeding season (February-September) adults migrate considerable distances from breeding islands (Orgeret <em>et al.</em> 2019). It arrives at colonies to breed between September and November, forming colonies on flattish beaches free of ice. The annual moult takes place from October until January. The main marine predators of both adults and young are killer whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) and leopard seals (<em>Hydrurga leptonyx</em>). Antarctic fur seals (<em>Arctocephalus gazella</em>) and South American sea lions (<em>Otaria flavescens</em>) occasionally prey on this species as well. In the colonies, giant petrels (<em>Macronectes</em> spp.) prey on chicks, and skuas (<em>Stercoraria</em> spp.) and lesser sheathbills (<em>Chionis minor</em>) take eggs and sometimes small chicks (Bost <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>","<p>Recent studies showed that sea surface temperatures constitute an important driver of the foraging distribution of this species (Péron <em>et al. </em>2012, Bost<em> et al. </em>2015). The results of modelling imply that the projected southwards shift of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) could have negative consequences for King Penguins as, for at least at some colonies in the Southern Indian Ocean, they would have to travel significantly farther to reach their preferred cold water foraging grounds (Péron <em>et al.</em> 2012). IPCC climate models suggest that the APF could shift southward 25-40 km per decade, with the northern colonies likely to be more affected than southern ones. The severity of the threat posed by climate change is still unclear, as it may be responsible for recent observed increases, but equally may drive rapid declines over relatively short periods (Péron <em>et al.</em> 2012, Trucchi <em>et al.</em> 2014, Cristofari <em>et al.</em> 2018). Similarly, other work on the stability of the APF suggest that the deeper layers may be less prone to movement than surface layers, so that the location of the deep front (and its associated nutrient gradients, strong flow and upwelling) may become decoupled in the future (Meijers <em>et al. </em>2019).<br/><br/>Furthermore, the depth of the mixed layer may deepen as the Southern Ocean warms and positive Southern Annual Mode (SAM) anomalies occur more frequently. Although there is still uncertainty about how the mixed layer may respond to alterations in the atmosphere, changes in SAM could alter the exchange of heat and carbon between ocean and atmosphere (Sallée <em>et al. </em>2010). This in turn has the potential to drive the main prey of King Penguins to greater depths forcing the penguins to dive deeper (Péron <em>et al.</em> 2012). Insufficient food may decrease survival of adults (Olsson and van der Jeugd 2002).<br/><br/>Disease could become an issue in the future as an unknown disease killed 250–300 King Penguins at Marion Island in late October 1992 (Cooper&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;<br/><br/>Disturbance from helicopter flights may cause some breeding failure or lead pairs to relocate to alternative breeding sites (Cooper <em>et al.</em> 1994), and a large scale mortality event associated with aerial logistical operations occurred at Macquarie Island in 1990 (Rounsevell and Bins 1991).&#160;Other human impacts could potentially include construction of new science facilities and fisheries, particularly fisheries for myctophid fish if they develop (e.g. Moore <em>et al.</em> 1998). Oil spills may also be important at local scales.&#160;Potential disturbance from tourists, and scientists are&#160; now strictly controlled. Natural predation of chicks by Brown Skua <em>Catharacta antarctica</em> and giant petrels <em>Macronectes </em>spp.&#160;has a low level of impact on the species.<br/><br/>Invasive species may have low-level impacts on King Penguins in parts of the range. Feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> may depredate chicks (reduced reproductive success), but has no impact on adult mortality (Bost <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, cats are present only at a minority of sites, and no population declines have been associated with cat predation.&#160;Recent observations in Hogs Island (Crozet) where feral cats are present around the King Penguin colony tend to invalidate that cats could be responsible for the decrease of this major colony (Bost and Chaigne, unpubl. data). The Argentine Gray Fox (Chilla) <em>Lycalopex griseus</em>, is native to much of the southern extreme of south America, but was introduced to Tierra del Fuego island in 1951 in an attempt to control rabbits (Jaksic and Yáñez 1983). Foxes are now causing some chick mortality at newly formed (and increasing) King Penguin colonies (Godoy and Borboroglu unpubl. data). As yet, no assessment has been made of the impact of fox predation, but given that these colonies are increasing and there is no reported adult mortality, it is unlikely to be significant. Rabbits <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> are present at a few sites with potential to impact a small percentage of the global population. Rabbits have now been eradicated from Macquarie (Parks and Wildlife Service 2014) and the previous notable impact from herbivory, erosion and landslides on the island (Rounsevell and Binns 1991), is highly unlikely to recur. No population declines have been attributed to the impact of rabbits.</p>","The global population is estimated at 1.1 million annual breeding pairs (range 1,084,320-1,228,320) (Bost <em>et al. </em>2013, Weimerskirch <em>et al. </em>2018).",Increasing,"The King Penguin has two subspecies; <em>A. patagonicus patagonicus</em> and <em>A. patagonicus halli</em>.

The foraging ranges of Northern Rockhopper Penguins have been investigated for penguins breeding on Nightingale and Gough islands in the Atlantic Ocean (Steinfurth&#160;<em>et al. </em>in revision) and for penguins breeding on Amsterdam Island (Thiebot&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Heerah <em>et al. </em>2019).<br/><br/><em>South Atlantic Ocean<br/></em><br/>Northern Rockhopper Penguins display marked variability in their spatial distribution during different stages of the breeding season and between islands but show high fidelity in the use of foraging areas between years. Duration of trips is shortest for brood-guard trips (74 hours max. duration) and longest for incubation trips (839 hours). Incubation trips are on average six days longer for males than for females, and five days shorter for males from Nightingale than from Gough. During the crèche stage both sexes perform two distinct trip types with short trips lasting generally just one day and long trips lasting up to three weeks.</p><p><br/>During incubation, penguins breeding on Nightingale Island disperse mostly east-west, remain mainly within the boundaries of the Tristan da Cunha EEZ (mean maximum range: 402 and 277 km for males and females, respectively) and stay north of the Subtropical Front, while penguins breeding on Gough Island have a greater foraging range (584 and 337 km, respectively) and show strong directionality with high continuity, travelling south and south-east towards the Subantarctic Front. During chick-rearing Northern Rockhoppers generally remain within 80 km of their colony (Steinfurth <em>et al.</em> in revision).</p><p>Outside the breeding season preliminary analysis of GLS tracking data from Nightingale and Gough islands reveal that birds disperse over an area stretching to the east along the Walvis Ridge and to the region of the Southern African shelf (approx. 21°S and 15°E) towards the South American continent (approx. 42°W) and south into the region of the Polar Front (approx. 51°S).&#160;<br/><br/><em>South Indian Ocean</em><br/><br/></p><p>Amsterdam Island penguins&#160;&#160;</p><p>Individuals make looping trips during the incubation period, with a mean foraging range of 230 km, but some birds may forage as far as 410 km away from their colony. Birds mostly targeted areas around and north-east of the colony. By contrast, brooding birds usually forage much closer to the colony (8-80 km). The core areas are essentially west and south-east of the colony (Heerah <em>et al.</em> 2019). During chick rearing,&#160; while Northern Rockhopper Penguins mainly stay within the French EEZ to forage within small areas east or north-west of the colony, some birds may forage up to 600 km south of Amsterdam Island during the creche stage. Long trips to the south, toward the Subtropical Front, are likely undertaken by failed breeders, when no chicks survive in the colony (C-A Bost, pers. obs.).<br/><br/>After moulting, GLS data indicate that Amsterdam penguins perform long-range movements of up to 2200 km away from the colony, mainly in longitudinal direction, as far as the south-western side of Australia, without any return to land. Most birds head south-east, along the Indian Ridge and forage south of the Subtropical Front using deep waters (3,000-3,500 m) with very heterogeneous sea surface temperature anomalies and chlorophyll concentrations (Thiebot <em>et al.</em> 2012). Oceanic fronts appear to be an important habitat feature as for many top-predators of the Southern Ocean (Bost <em>et al. </em>2009).<br/><br/><strong>Breeding and moulting biology</strong><br/></p><p>Adults arrive at the breeding colonies in late July (males) and August (females). At the Atlantic breeding sites, nests are located in a variety of habitats ranging from open boulder-strewn beaches on Gough Island and Tristan da Cunha to among dense stands of tall tussock grass (mainly <em>Spartina arundinacea</em>) on Nightingale, Alex (Middle) and Inaccessible islands (Cuthbert 2013). In the Indian Ocean, on Amsterdam and St Paul islands, penguins breed in steep or gently sloping ground in a variety of habitats from sea-level up to 170 m above sea-level. Habitats vary from open boulder-strewn beaches to among stands of tussock grass (<em>Spartina arundinacea</em> and <em>Poa novarae</em>).<br/><br/>Two eggs are laid in early September, the earlier ‘A’ egg being smaller than the later ‘B’ egg as for other <em>Eudyptes</em> penguins. Incubation is divided into two shifts: males make the first trip of three weeks’ duration and females the second lasting two weeks. Chicks hatch in October but only one chick is raised, usually from the B egg. Male birds guard the nest during the 2-3 week while females perform short-range daily foraging trips to feed the chick. Chicks then enter the crèche stage (when both parents forage simultaneously and leave the chick unguarded) until they fledge in December in the northern archipelago or January on Gough. For Northern Rockhopper Penguins breeding on Gough Island and hence south of the Subtropical Front, the penguin’s breeding cycle begins about 3-4 weeks later than in the northern islands. The breeding phenology on Amsterdam-St Paul islands in the South Indian Ocean is similar to that of the northern Atlantic sites.<br/><br/>After the chicks have fledged the parents undertake a pre-moult trip and return ashore between mid-January and late February to moult. The annual moult is completed in about three weeks after which the birds depart onto their winter migration, only returning to shore for the following breeding season.<br/><br/><strong>Prey</strong><br/><br/>Northern Rockhopper Penguins are opportunistic foragers, utilizing different areas during the breeding and non-breeding season. On Tristan da Cunha, they mainly feed on crustaceans, mainly krill (euphausiids) supplemented with small proportions of fish and cephalopods (Booth and McQuaid 2013, Cuthbert 2013). Juvenile squid and crustaceans were the main prey by mass at Amsterdam Island (Tremblay and Cherel 2003). Dietary studies from Tristan da Cunha and Amsterdam Island reveal seasonal changes in diets: crustaceans (Tristan da Cunha) and cephalopods (Amsterdam) dominated the diet during the early chick-crèche stage but fish became the main prey item at both islands in the later stages of chick rearing (Tremblay <em>et al. </em>1997, Booth and McQuaid 2013, Booth<em> et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/><strong>Predation</strong><br/><br/>During the breeding season, in the Tristan group and on Amsterdam Island, adult and immature Northern Rockhopper Penguins are regularly preyed upon by Northern (Amsterdam Is.) and Southern Giant Petrels <em>Macronectes halli&#160;</em>and <em>M. giganteus</em> on the shore and at sea (Ryan <em>et al.</em> 2008, A. Steinfurth, pers. obs., C-A. Bost, pers. obs), while in the colony, unprotected eggs and chicks are taken by the Subantarctic Skua <em>Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi</em> and Tristan Thrush <em>Turdus eremita</em> (A. Steinfurth, pers. obs.). In 2019, for the first time, predation by a subantarctic fur seal <em>Arctocephalus tropicalis</em> was observed off Nightingale Island (T. Glass, pers. obs.). On Amsterdam Island, active predation by Subantarctic Skuas also occurs during the breeding season. Predation on adults by seals close to the shore is reported but is believed to be rare. Predation by Subantarctic Fur Seals, Giant Petrels and Skuas is thought to influence population trends of <em>Eudyptes </em>populations elsewhere (Horswill <em>et al. </em>2014, Morrisson <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p></p>","<p>The causes of current population declines are poorly understood, but introduced species (including pathogens), increasing competition for habitat and food with a rapidly growing Subantarctic Fur Seal <em>Arctocephalus tropicalis</em> population, changes in sea surface temperature and/or marine productivity, human-induced activities and pollution, are all likely to be implicated to some degree.<br/><br/><strong>Human exploitation</strong><br/><br/>Historically, vast numbers of birds and products from penguins were collected (i.e. eggs were harvested, oil extracted from moulting birds, feathers collected for stuffing pillows and mattresses, and feathers being used for making ornamental table mats on Tristan; eggs and adults on St. Paul Island used by sealers). These practices were largely discontinued by 1955 (Hagen 1952, Wace &amp; Holdgate 1976, Richardson 1984); the egg harvest was suspended in 2011 (following the MS Oliva oil spill) but as of 2018 has been reopened. To date, penguin guano is harvested from Nightingale and Alex islands after the breeding season by the Tristan community to provide fertilizer for their allotments.<br/><br/><strong>Fisheries&#160;<br/><br/></strong>Penguins have been taken as bait for use in crab pots at a number of sites, including at St Paul (Indian Ocean) and Tristan da Cunha (Atlantic Ocean) (Guinard <em>et al.</em> 1998, Cuthbert <em>et al. </em>2009), and driftnet fishing and rock-lobster fisheries may have caused significant mortality in the past (Ryan &amp; Cooper 1991, Crawford <em>et al. </em>2017, TAFF 2011). With only few records of fisheries-related mortality (Ryan and Cooper 1991) and no legal gillnet fishery, bycatch does not appear to be a major threat to the species now. However, recent evidence of illegal use of gillnets within the species' foraging range indicates that unobserved bycatch may be higher than suspected (Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017). Still, it is considered unlikely to affect more than a minority of the overall population (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2009, Cuthbert 2013, Crawford <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Food availability&#160;</strong><br/><br/>Food availability may have been compromised by climate change (through increased sea surface temperature [SST]), an increase in Subantarctic fur seal populations and shifts in marine food webs (Cunningham &amp; Moors 1994, Guinard<em> et al. </em>1998, Barlow<em> et al. </em>2002, Hilton<em> et al.</em> 2006, Cuthbert 2013). Population declines have occurred over relatively large spatio-temporal scales, possibly implying that at the ecosystem-scale, at-sea factors are likely to be involved (Hilton <em>et al. </em>2006). Population numbers have been found to correlate with SST on Amsterdam Island (Guinard<em> et al.</em> 1998), while Hilton et al. (2006) found some evidence for a link between decreased primary productivity and population declines and a shift to lower trophic levels due to warming SST. However, different sites showed divergent trends, and the impacts of climate change remain inconclusive. In addition, adult body condition at the beginning of the breeding and moulting periods has been stable since the mid 1990’s (Delord <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/><strong>Oil Pollution<br/><br/></strong>On 16 March 2011, the cargo ship MS Oliva ran aground on Nightingale Island, spilling 1500 tons of fuel and heavy crude oil. This impacted Nightingale, Middle/Alex and Inaccessible islands; breeding sites to almost half of the world’s Northern Rockhopper Penguin population (Tristan main island was unaffected by the spill). Thousands of oiled penguins were caught on Nightingale and transported to Tristan da Cunha where they were cleaned and rehabilitated by a project involving virtually all the island’s inhabitants. Only a few hundreds were saved, and it is impossible to say how many died in the wild. Moreover, the long-term effects of the oil spill on the populations are still unknown. The increase in volume of passing shipping poses a growing risk of chronic oiling and/or further catastrophic spills. <br/>For the Atlantic Ocean population, oil pollution is currently considered the main threat.<br/><br/><strong>Plastics<br/><br/></strong>So far, no impact of plastics pollution on Northern Rockhoppers has been reported from any of their colonies. However, in an ecosystem assessment at the islands carried out in 2017, microplastics were found in 15 of the 19 samples taken (Caselle <em>et al.</em> 2017). Whilst this is a small sample, it indicates the potential necessity for further investigation of the impacts of microplastics.<br/><br/><strong>Invasive species, disease and parasites&#160;<br/><br/></strong>Among birds, penguins are particularly prone to infection by pathogens (Grimaldi <em>et al.</em> 2015). The pathogen <em>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</em>, the causative agent of erysipelas, has been recently detected in Northern Rockhopper Penguins breeding on Amsterdam Island (Jaeger <em>et al. </em>2018). Another identified pathogen <em>Pasteurella multocida </em>(avian cholera) has been implicated in the high chick mortality of Indian Yellow-Nosed Albatrosses <em>Thalassarche carteri </em>on Amsterdam Island. These pathogens could be responsible for four successive years of complete breeding failure of the Northern Rockhopper Penguin population there, although further studies are needed to confirm whether this is the case. The only study of serology and infections on Northern Rockhopper Penguins in the Tristan group was confined to avian influenza on Gough island (Abad <em>et al. </em>2013). In this study, 5% of birds sampled tested positive for antibodies and none for active infection. The impacts on survival are unknown (few birds with antibodies could indicate that infected birds usually die, rather than infection rates being low). In the breeding season 2010/2011, Booth (2011) carried out a study on parasitism in breeding Northern Rockhopper Penguins at the Stony Beach colony on Tristan da Cunha. The protozoan <em>Babesia </em>was the only parasite observed in the samples. Sixty-one percent of all birds examined presented with<em> Babesia </em>infestation (likely <em>B. peircei</em>).&#160;</p><p>Introduced house mice <em>Mus musculus</em> on Gough Island are known predators of seabirds but have not yet been recorded preying on penguins. The same applies to introduced rats <em>Rattus norvegicus</em> on Amsterdam Island and <em>R. rattus</em> on Tristan da Cunha. The only reported cases of major predation by invasive species are by feral pigs on Tristan da Cunha and Inaccessible islands (where they were eradicated in 1873 and 1930, respectively). Domestic and feral dogs were also reported to kill penguins on Tristan da Cunha (BirdLife International 2010) but this threat is now controlled. Feral cattle used to occur on Amsterdam Island, but all were removed c. 5 years ago. On Tristan da Cunha cattle still exists and in close proximity to some of the penguin rockeries. Grazing of cattle has altered the extent and/or structure of the original habitat which may have had some indirect effect on the habitat. Direct impact by predation of rats, cats and mice on eggs, chicks or adults has never been reported in Amsterdam Island but are all possible. Rats may act as a reservoir for maintaining bacteria between two breeding seasons while seabirds are absent from the island (Jaeger <em>et al. </em>2018). Studies on Amsterdam and Gough islands to investigate the role of rats and mice in bacterial maintenance and transmission in the seabird community are currently being conducted.<br/><br/><strong>Tourism<br/><br/></strong>Tourism is not considered a threat at the current low volumes, but the number of cruise ships and tourists can be expected to increase, so the current regulations need to be kept under review. <br/><br/><strong>Hybridization<br/><br/></strong>In 2014, for the first time a breeding attempt between a Northern and a Southern Rockhopper Penguin was recorded on the Falklands Islands. A hybrid chick hatched but died before fledging. A negative impact of hybridization on the population is unlikely to be significant, in contrary, hybridisation could become important in <em>Eudyptes</em> penguins adapting to future climate change scenarios.</p><p></p>","The latest estimates suggest a total population of <em>c. </em>206,850 breeding pairs with the majority of the population (89.7%) being found at the Atlantic Ocean breeding sites (62,791 pairs on Middle/Alex Island in 2016, 64,700 pairs on Gough Island in 2006, 20,423 pairs on Nightingale Island in 2017, 33,867 pairs on Inaccessible Island in&#160; 2016, 3584 pairs on Tristan da Cunha islands in 2015) and 10.3% at the Indian Ocean islands (12,161 pairs on Amsterdam Island in 2015, 7,580 pairs on St Paul Island in 2018) (RZSS, BAS, CEBC-CNRS, RSPB, TAAF, TCD 2018).<br/><br/>Overall, recent analysis of population trends indicates that over the previous 30 years (three generations) the number of Northern Rockhopper Penguins globally declined by 57% (RZSS, BAS, CEBC-CNRS, RSPB, TAAF, TCD 2018).<br/><br/>Early records indicate that millions of Northern Rockhopper Penguins used to occur on both Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island prior to 1955. As a very rough estimate, approximately 2 million pairs (98%) were lost from Gough Island between 1955 and 2006, and Tristan da Cunha is thought to have held hundreds of thousands of pairs in the 1870s, which were reduced to around 5,000 pairs by 1955 (Cuthbert <em>et al.</em> 2009). At Amsterdam Island, numbers have been declining at an average rate of 3.7% since the early 1970s resulting in a 80% decline over the past three generations (Barbraud <em>et al. </em>in revision). On Saint Paul Island, the population has increased at a rate of 1.4% since the early 1970s (Barbraud <em>et al. </em>in revision).",Decreasing,"<em></em><p>The Northern Rockhopper Penguin is found in the temperate South Atlantic and Indian oceans, breeding on seven islands between 37–40° S. Approximately 90% of the global population is found in the Atlantic Ocean, breeding at the Tristan da Cunha archipelago and Gough Island<strong> </strong>(<strong>Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha UK Overseas Territories</strong>) and the remaining 10% in the Indian Ocean on <strong>Amsterdam and St Paul islands</strong> (French Southern Territories) (Cuthbert 2013). The location of these islands places the breeding distribution of most Northern Rockhopper Penguins north of the Subtropical Front, with the exception of Gough Island, which lies between the Subtropical Front and the Subantarctic Front to the south. <br/></p><p>During the incubation period, penguins forage more than 800 km and 670 km away from their breeding site on Nightingale and Gough Island, respectively, whereas during brooding foraging ranges are restricted to a maximum distance of 35 km (Nightingale Island) and 24 km (Gough Island) (Steinfurth <em>et al. unpubl. data</em>). Tracking data from Nightingale and Gough islands further reveal that birds disperse after moult over an area stretching to the east along the Walvis Ridge and to the region of the Southern African shelf (approx. 21°S and 15°E) towards the South American continent (approx. 42°W) and south into the region of the Antarctic convergence (approx. 51°S). While penguins breeding on Nightingale Island display high variability in foraging locations during incubation and over-winter migration, penguins breeding on Gough Island show strong directionality with high continuity, travelling south and south-east. Penguins breeding on Amsterdam Island perform looping trips during the incubation, with a mean foraging range of 230 km, but some breeders may forage as far as 410 km off their colony. Brooding birds usually forage much closer to the colony, staying within the region of the shelf (range 8-80 km) (Bost <em>unpubl. data</em>). After moulting, penguins from Amsterdam Island perform long-range movements of up to 2200 km away from the colony, mainly in longitudinal direction without any return to land. The majority of birds head south-east, along the Indian Ridge and forage south of the southern boundary of the subtropical front, using deep waters (3000-3500 m) with very heterogeneous sea surface temperature anomalies and chlorophyll concentrations (Thiebot <em>et al.</em> 2012).&#160; </p>  <p>Vagrants have been recorded from South Africa (Rollinson <em>et al.</em> 2013) and the Falkland Islands (Matias <em>et al. </em>2009, Crofts and Robson 2015).

All research has to fulfil Tristan da Cunha conservation priorities and be approved by the Conservation Department and is subject to ethical clearance. Scientists are required to complete a permit application and protocol for researchers and must abide by the Tristan da Cunha Environmental Charter. The Tristan da Cunha Environment Charter outlines the environmental management commitments of the UK Government and the Government of Tristan da Cunha and serves as a framework policy to guide the development of management policies and plans. The Tristan da Cunha Fisheries Limits Ordinance 1983 controls commercial fishing activity within the Tristan da Cunha Exclusive Economic Zone covering 200 nautical miles offshore from the islands. Gough and Inaccessible Islands are managed as a World Heritage Site, Wildlife Reserve, IUCN Protected Area category 1, with research and weather monitoring the only activities permitted: each is surrounded by protected marine areas extending 12 nautical miles from their shorelines.<br/><br/>To avoid unregulated disturbance and introduction of invasive species into penguin colonies, tourists are permitted to go ashore at Nightingale and Inaccessible for guided wildlife tours, only if accompanied by a Tristanian appointed by the Conservation Department team and only on daytime visits. No tourism is permitted at Gough Island. As part of the Gough and Inaccessible Islands World Heritage Site Management Plan (2015-2020), “Guidelines for Day Visitors to Inaccessible Island” are provided to visiting tourists. All visitors to the outer islands and Tristan have to complete a “Biosecurity Self-Audit Checklist and Declaration”.<br/><br/>Amsterdam and St Paul islands are part of the Réserve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Françaises, administered by the TAAF (French Southern and Antarctic Territories), which incorporates a protected marine zone covering more than 672,000 km2. The St Paul colony is within in a strictly protected area. Amsterdam colonies are included in a scientific dedicated area with a restricted access. Here, protective measures are implemented on landing and moving around the island to minimise the risk of spreading pathogens. The seabirds of Amsterdam and St Paul islands are protected by law. The French Administration and her/his leader (Préfet) are assisted in management of the reserve by a scientific council comprising members of the Polar Environment Committee and a management committee. <br/><br/>Amsterdam and Saint Paul islands are included in the National Nature Reserve of the French Southern and Antarctic Territories (TAAF) created in 2006, including the entire surface of these islands as well as Crozet, Kerguelen, and a large portion of their surrounding waters. French Southern and Antarctic Territories carry out active environmental policies linked to the conversation of the biodiversity. <br/><br/><em>International designations<br/><br/></em>Gough and Inaccessible islands have been gazetted as an UNESCO World Heritage Site, as two of the least disturbed cool-temperate island ecosystems in the South Atlantic Ocean with international importance for colonies of seabirds, and several endemic species and subspecies of land birds. BirdLife International has designated the Tristan Endemic Bird Area (including Inaccessible Island) and Gough Island Endemic Bird Area. <br/><br/>The whole TAAF Réserve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Françaises is a Ramsar site. Gough and Inaccessible islands are also Ramsar sites and the Northern Rockhopper Penguin is among the species cited in the designations. Gough Island, and the Plateau des Tourbières on Amsterdam island are both listed as Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites, for endemic bird species (not penguins). Although some of these designations target primarily other species, they highlight the rich biodiversity value of the two island groups, and they attract support and funding from governments and international organisations, including for the waters around the islands, foraging and dispersal sites of Northern Rockhopper Penguins.<br/><br/><em>Conservation &amp; research projects<br/><br/></em>Northern Rockhopper Penguin numbers are monitored regularly on Amsterdam and St Paul islands (CEBC-CNRS), Gough, Nightingale and Middle/Alex islands and at all sites on Tristan da Cunha by the Tristan Conservation Department. Counts on Inaccessible Island are intermittent. On Nightingale Island, a deep rock crevice that was trapping and killing penguins was covered (Cuthbert 2013). The year after the oil spill, in 2012, a comprehensive penguin research programme was initiated in the islands to investigate aspects of the penguins’ ecology at vital breeding sites to help understand the potential impact of any natural and/or anthropogenic threats to this population and to inform conservation actions (e.g. Johaadien 2013, Steinfurth <em>et al.</em> in review). Survival rates are an important driver of population trends; a long-term demographic study was implemented on Nightingale Island in 2016 to understand the causes of current decline.<br/><br/>An assessment of sustainable egg harvest levels has been produced (Ratcliffe 2018) to give advice to the Tristan da Cunha Island Council on a sustainable harvest protocol (submitted to the Tristan Council in 2018).<br/><br/>In 2016, as part of its obligations to meet Aichi Target 11, the UK government initiated its Blue Belt Programme, which aims to designate Marine Protected Areas that encompass a total of four million km2 of sea within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of its 14 Overseas Territories, including Tristan da Cunha. To support this initiative, tracking data from three important colonies of Northern Rockhopper Penguins were used to provide information on the species’ spatial distribution to ensure that the most biologically valuable areas are recognized for protection.&#160; <br/><br/>Recent projects at breeding sites in the South Atlantic and South Indian oceans aimed at determining key marine habitats of the Northern Rockhopper Penguin with the main objectives of this project to characterize habitats during the breeding season, create habitat models to predict changes in the locations of habitats under various climate change scenarios and delimit marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (mIBAs) as a tool to help protect key foraging areas.<br/><br/>Following recommendations given in the recently published Northern Rockhopper Species Action Plan (RZSS, BAS, CEBC-CNRS, RSPB, TAAF, TCD 2018) investigations are underway to understand the genetic connectivity between island subpopulations across the species’ global breeding sites with emphasis on potential disease transfer.&#160;<br/><br/><em>Strategic framework&#160;<br/><br/></em>The UK Overseas Territories Biodiversity Strategy (DEFRA 2009) is a framework document covering conservation in all UK Overseas Territories and contains five strategic priorities (three are broadly relevant to Northern Rockhopper Penguins). The Tristan da Cunha Biodiversity Action Plan 2012-2016 (Tristan da Cunha Government and RSPB 2012) is currently undergoing revision. Management plans for Gough and Inaccessible islands were produced in 1994 and 2001, respectively; they were followed by a revised management plan for the Gough and Inaccessible islands World Heritage Site covering 2015-2020 (Tristan Conservation Department and RSPB 2012). Concerning the Indian Ocean population, a first management plan (2011-2015) has been produced for the Réserve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Françaises (TAAF 2010). In 2017, a new management plan covering 2018-2027 has been approved. This plan includes actions related to the impact of human activities, improvement of knowledge on species and habitats, restoration of species both on land and at sea within the natural reserve. A national action plan for the preservation of the Amsterdam albatross was produced in 2011 (TAAF 2011) and is currently in revision. It includes actions regarding the impact of disease and introduced mammals on the Amsterdam albatross and other seabirds, including the Northern Rockhopper Penguin.<br/><br/>An International Species Action Plan was developed at a workshop held at and hosted by the RZSS in Edinburgh, Scotland in October 2017 to identify the most important threats to this species and to recommend conservation actions until 2027 (RZSS, BAS, CEBC-CNRS, RSPB, TAAF, TCD 2018). <br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong></p><p>Following recommendations of the Northern Rockhopper Action Plan (2018), general actions are to; continue or start to monitor all populations in order to assess trends and improve methodologies for monitoring; conduct long-term demographic studies to understand the causes of the current decline; determine genetic connectivity between island subpopulations across the species’s global breeding sites with emphasis on potential disease transfer; conduct research into spatial and temporal links between population trends, sea-surface temperature and primary productivity; investigate the possible impact of oil exploitation; conduct studies to assess interactions with commercial fisheries; assess the threat from introduced predators; reduce disturbance from ecotourism through the use of codes of conduct; assess the threats of disease and increase biosecurity measures.</p><p>For Tristan da Cunha, bring the International Maritime Organisation to designate waters within 50 nautical miles of the coast as ‘Areas To Be Avoided’ so that shipping is routed away from vulnerable, nearshore aggregations of penguins. <br/><br/>For Amsterdam-St Paul islands, to regulate fishing activity within the islands’ EEZ by the French administration and only one commercial vessel can set demersal vertical longlines between November and April within the EEZ.

The population trend appears to be increasing, and hence the species does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. <p></p>","This species is mostly found in zones with light ice pack. Its diet is comprised almost exclusively of Antarctic krill, but it will also take fish and other species of crustaceans when possible. Prey capture is apparently by pursuit-diving up to a depth of 70 m, but mostly at depths less than 45 m. It breeds on irregular rocky coasts in ice free areas, forming large colonies of hundreds and thousands of birds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Winter migrations can be extensive and winter habitats are generally pelagic and are located north of the sea ice edge (Hinke <em>et al. </em>2015, 2019).<p></p>","Climate change is potentially the greatest threat to this species at present and in the future. It is thought to impact reproductive success through incurring changes in abundance and distribution of krill (Trivelpiece <em>et al.</em> 2011, Clucas <em>et al.</em> 2014), though these effects have been noted only in parts of the range (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016). Changes in krill biomass and availability resulting from habitat shifts are thought to be driving rapid declines at a number of colonies (Barbosa <em>et al.</em> 2012, Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2012, Naveen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dunn <em>et al.</em> 2016). In addition, there is considerable overlap between the expanding krill fishery and the species’s foraging distribution, hence there is potential for resource competition, potentially aggravating the climatic effects on krill availability (Hinke 2017, Warwick-Evans <em>et al.</em> 2018; Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>Volcanic activity during the 2016 moulting season at Zavodovski and Bristol in the South Sandwich Islands could have had severe impacts on the large colonies residing there, and surveys of the breeding colonies at the South Sandwich Islands should be repeated. If large numbers are found to have been killed by the volcanic event, and if declines elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula continue, the species may warrant uplisting.<br/><br/>Human impacts potentially include disturbance from tourists, scientists, construction of new science facilities and fisheries. However, only a very small percentage of the global population is exposed to human intrusion and there is currently no documented evidence of population-level impacts (J.

For example, population surveys at the South Sandwich Islands, where the majority of the world population breeds (1,500,000 pairs; Convey <em>et al.</em> 1999; Lynch <em>et al. </em>2016), are infrequent. Other important breeding populations exist at the South Orkney Islands (927,000 pairs; Poncet and Poncet 1985, Humphries <em>et al. </em>2017), but this is probably an underestimate (P. Trathan <em>in litt. </em>2017), especially at the western end of the archipelago. Large populations also occur at the South Shetland Islands (987,000; Trivelpiece and Trivelpiece 2013) and the west Antarctic Peninsula (72,000; Trivelpiece and Trivelpiece 2013). Small populations occur at South Georgia (~1,800 pairs), Bøuvet (&lt;100) and at the Balleny Islands (&lt; 100) (Trivelpiece and Trivelpiece 2013). At the Antarctic Peninsula, population estimates are now increasingly out of date (Trathan <em>et al. </em>2019).<p></p>Population trends for chinstrap penguins, although complex and somewhat regional in extent and timing, suggest that the species experienced a dramatic increase in numbers following the harvesting of fur seals and whales from the early 1800s to mid-1900s and the development and expansion of sub-Antarctic finfish fisheries that began in the 1960s. Chinstrap populations reached their peak in the late 1970s (Croxall and Kirkwood 1979) but then have experienced significant declines at some, but not all, breeding sites since that time (Poncet 1997; Woehler <em>et al. </em>2001; Forcada <em>et al.</em> 2006; Lynch <em>et al. </em>2008; Forcada and Trathan 2009; Trivelpiece <em>et al. </em>2011; Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2016).

Importantly, this region has experienced a significant decrease in sea ice but no apparent changes in Antarctic krill abundance (Steinberg <em>et al. </em>2015).

The species was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008. DD was considered as still potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” Although the information is sparse, this species appears to occur in a variety of locations and across a substantial swath of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere and is not rare, therefore the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied. Therefore, it was concluded that the species does not belong in the DD category.</p>  <p>There is little information on abundance or trends in abundance for this species but regular although infrequent sightings suggest it is uncommon. Typical threats that may result in declines in abundance, namely anthropogenic noise and fisheries bycatch, are not prevalent in most of the range of this species, making LC the more plausible category.</p>","<p>This species generally occurs in deep, cold temperate and subpolar waters, especially in areas with steep-bottomed slopes beyond the continental shelf edge (Kasuya 2009). However, some sightings have been associated with shallower regions, coastal waters, continental slopes or seamounts (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Hobson and Martin (1996) observed groups of Arnoux’s Beaked Whales near the Antarctic Peninsula and found that their breath-holding capabilities make this species one of the most accomplished mammalian divers, capable of swimming up to an estimated 7 km between breathing sites in sea ice. The species seems well-adapted to life in ice-covered waters and may be able to exploit food resources inaccessible to other predators in the region (Ponganis <em>et al</em>. 1995).<br/> <br/> Little is known of the feeding habits of Arnoux's Beaked Whales but they are assumed to be similar to those of their Northern Hemisphere relatives, Baird's Beaked Whales, with primary prey species consisting of benthic and pelagic fishes and cephalopods (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, Culik 2004). Therefore, Brownell and Ainley (2009) suggested that Antarctic toothfish and the most-caught by-catch species, macrourids, in the Area 88 fishery are likely important components in their diet.</p>","<p>Arnoux’s Beaked Whale has never been hunted to any significant degree, and direct anthropogenic threats are not known. However, a few whales have been taken for scientific study (see Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). Considering that some beaked whale species are known to be vulnerable to large-mesh pelagic driftnets (e.g. Californian drift-netting for swordfish and sharks (Barlow and Cameron 2003), it is likely that Arnoux’s Beaked Whales were caught in the large-scale drift-netting in the Tasman sea. Although current levels of bycatch are unknown, they are likely to be low due to adoption in 1989 of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly, which called for effective conservation and management measures of living marine resources in areas of high seas drift-netting. Developing high-latitude fisheries, such as that for Antarctic toothfish, a significant proportion of which is illegal and unregulated, have the potential to reduce food available for large predators.<br/> <br/> In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). &#160;However, this species’ range probably puts it largely outside the major areas of such impacts.</p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of beaked whales (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and is a potential health hazard of unknown significance. However, in all reported cases, organochlorine residues found in Southern Hemisphere small cetacean are lower than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts (O’Shea <em>et al. </em>1980, Reijnders <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/> <br/> Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species, although the nature and magnitude of these impacts is unknown at this time (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>","<p>There are no global abundance estimates available for this species (Kasuya 2009), but in comparison with the sympatric Southern Bottlenose Whale (<em>Hyperoodon planifrons</em>), Arnoux’s Beaked Whale is considered relatively uncommon. </p>  Kasamatsu and Joyce (1995) estimated there to be 599,300 (CV=15%) beaked whales south of the Antarctic Convergence in January, and most of these were considered to be southern bottlenose whales. Branch &amp; Butterworth (2001), on the other hand, estimated 72,000 and 54,000 such whales on the basis of the second and third circumpolar IWC cetacean surveys, respectively. The estimates by these two sets of authors differ by what correction factor was used to address the “sightability” of the whales. The ratio of Arnoux’s beaked whales to southern bottlenose whales in these surveys was 18:1040. Therefore, the estimate for Arnoux’s beaked whales would be 5000 and 3000, respectively (Brownell and Ainley 2009). However, neither estimate accounts for Arnoux’s beaked whales in sea-ice covered areas where they have been frequently observed.&#160;  <p>Arnoux's Beaked Whales seem to be relatively abundant in southern New Zealand around Doubtful Sound and in Cook Strait, at least during summer, and occasionally around Tasmania.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Arnoux's Beaked Whales are found in a circumpolar pattern in the southern Hemisphere from the Antarctic continent and ice edges (ca. 78°S) north to about 34°S in the South Pacific (Kasuya 2009). They may even reach as far north as 24°S in the South Atlantic off Brazil. Sightings are regularly reported such that the species can be considered uncommon but nowhere within this range are they very well known or considered common. Most of the reported sightings are from the Doubtful Sound, New Zealand; Tasman Sea and around the Albatross Cordillera in the South Pacific (MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2006). There are also sightings close to the Antarctic coast (Brownell 1974, Ponganis <em>et al.</em> 1995, Hobson and Martin, 1996), Friedlander <em>et al.</em> 2009). The overwhelming majority of strandings have been from around New Zealand (Balcomb 1989, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). The northernmost records are strandings from Brazil, South Africa, and Australia (Paterson and Parker 1994, Culik 2004), from latitudes south of approximately 40°S (Macleod <em>et al. </em>2006).</p>",,Marine,<p>The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.</p>,Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
