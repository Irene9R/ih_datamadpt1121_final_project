887942,161403,Somniosus pacificus,Near Threatened,A2bd,2021,2019-08-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Pacific Sleeper Shark (<em>Somniosus pacificus</em>) is a large (to 700 cm total length) deep-water sleeper shark that occurs in the North Pacific Ocean from Taiwan, north to the Chukchi Sea, in the Arctic and across the Pacific, including the Hawaiian Islands, to Baja California, Mexico. It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 0–2,008 m. The species is caught as bycatch in industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl and longline and is usually discarded, though may be retained for the liver oil, and for the meat in Taiwan. The species is occasionally observed in Japan and is now rarely captured in Taiwan, with a possible decline over the past 18 years. Russian survey data suggest catches have increased slightly over the past 40 years across the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Northwest Pacific. In the Northeast Pacific, the catch estimate trend is uncertain; the relative abundance may have declined over the past 21 years; however, the observed decline may be due to a reduction in catchability. Mainly immature animals are captured across its range, with fewer adults encountered which suggests either most adults have refuge from fishing pressure at depth or they occur in nearshore habitats but are not susceptible to capture in fishing gear, possibly due to their large size. Large individuals are commonly seen on deep-water videos in Monterey Bay and Baja California. It is still considered common in parts of its western range and in the eastern range, the stock is not considered to be currently subject to overfishing. The species is unlikely to have been threatened for approximately half of the past three generation lengths (150–225 years), however it may have undergone some population reduction in the past 80 years (~1–1.5 generation lengths) due to fisheries exploitation. Taking a precautionary approach, and given its large size and likely low productivity, it is suspected that the Pacific Sleeper Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (150–225 years) due to fisheries exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2bd.","The Pacific Sleeper Shark is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 0–2,008 m (Weigmann 2016). At high latitudes with cold surface waters, it ranges into the littoral and even the intertidal (one large individual was found trapped in a tide pool) as well as at the surface; however, in lower latitudes with temperate water it becomes a deep-water, epibenthic shark, never coming to the surface and ranging to a depth of 2,008 m in the extreme southern end of its range (off Baja California) (Compagno 1984). Tagging studies in the Northeast Pacific showed some Pacific Sleeper Sharks undertake regular diurnal vertical migrations from below the photic zone during the day to near the surface at night (Hulbert <em>et al</em>. 2006). It reaches an estimated maximum size of 700 cm total length (TL), males mature at 385 cm TL and females mature at 365 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 1987, Wang and Yang 2004, Yano <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2007, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Reproduction is probably viviparous with a size-at-birth estimated at 40 cm TL (Yano <em>et al</em>. 2007). Age parameters are unknown, and it is likely that the generation length is similar to that of the Greenland Shark which is suspected of a generation length similar to other deep-water sharks, that is, 50–75 years (Kulka <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The Pacific Sleeper Shark is caught as bycatch in industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl and longline and is usually discarded. Post-release mortality is unknown but has been conservatively estimated as 100% (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). It is captured in recreational fisheries in the Southeast and Southcentral Alaska, however the catch is uncommon and rarely retained (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, shark fishing has a long history with sharks historically targeted by trawl and longline fisheries from the late 1920s when 6,000 t was landed annually (Chen et al. 1997). Most fisheries subsequently moved to taking shark as bycatch, except for some vessels that continued to target shark in the east and northeast of Taiwan up until at least the late 1990s; the gears included demersal longlines set at depths of 80–200 m, mid-water longline, and large-mesh drift nets (till 1992 when they were prohibited in Taiwan) (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Japan, prior to World War I, fisheries from the early 1800s targeted mainly Pacific Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.) and in the Bering Sea, they mainly operated in the waters above the continental shelf and slope of the Bering Sea (Hayashi 1991). Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). Deep-water trawl fisheries across Japan mostly operate at 200–800 m but in some parts of northern Japan, they operate to 1,500 m. Deep-water longline fisheries mostly operate at depths of 400–800 m (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>Russian survey catch data from 1980 to 2014 indicated this species was caught in the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, and in the Pacific Ocean with demersal and mid-water trawls with catches ranging from 1 to 67 individuals per trawl and a total of 798 individuals captured over the 35 years (I. Volvenko unpubl data 2019). In Russia, prior to World War I, fisheries mostly operated in inland waters. During the 1930s, fisheries gradually shifted to coastal waters and expanded to marine waters and foreign fleets during the late 1940s to early 1950s with fishing in the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and western Bering Sea and further in the 1960s to the eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska targeting herring and bottom fish with large, factory stern trawlers (Pruter 1976).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, from 1860 to 1920, fisheries mostly targeted Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.) with pelagic fisheries increasing in effort between World War I and II and sharks (Squaliformes) a minor component of the catch (Diemling <em>et al</em>. 1994). In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI), Pacific Sleeper Shark are now captured mainly in the Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>) longline and the Walleye Pollock (<em>Gadus chalcogrammus</em>) trawl fisheries (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). In the Gulf of Alaska, the species is mainly captured in the flatfish fisheries and Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) longline fisheries (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>The species may be caught as bycatch on the Emperor Seamounts. The fisheries have operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al</em>. 2019). The fisheries currently operate mostly in the Southern Emperor seamounts at depths of 300–500 m. However, some Japanese gillnets may operate at 300–1,300 m and an exploratory South Korea longliner operated at depths of 250–1,050 m in the mid-2000s (CHM 2016, Shotton 2016, NPFC 2020). The demersal trawl fisheries mainly target North Pacific Armourhead (<em>Pentaceros wheeleri</em>) that do not occur below depths of 800 m and Splendid Alfosino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that occurs at depths of 25–1,300 m (Froese and Pauly 2019, NPFC 2020).<span><span

Sleeper Shark catches across the North Pacific from the Sea of Okhotsk to the United States west coast are mostly of small and immature animals (50–200 cm total length, TL) with fewer captures of individuals &gt;200 cm TL reported. Occasional catches of animals up to 400 cm TL have been reported from the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and United States west coast (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a), and large individuals are commonly seen on deep-water videos in Monterey Bay, off California and off Baja California (D.A. Ebert unpubl. data 2021). The lesser number of large and mature animals captured in industrial fisheries and research surveys suggests that most adults inhabit depths beyond the reach of industrial and survey fishing gear or that the adults occur in nearshore habitats but are less susceptible to capture in the gear than smaller individuals (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>In Japan, this species is sometimes observed on deep-water bait cameras in Suruga Bay and Sagami Bay (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, this species was caught previously caught in a small, localised deep-water longline fishery till 2002, but is now a rare bycatch with the decline in catches of concern, particularly as most of the catch was of large sub-adults and adults &gt;200 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013b. H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). Russian survey data suggest catches of the Pacific Sleeper Shark have increased slightly across the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Northwest Pacific from 1980 to 2019, in terms of both abundance and biomass (I. Volvenko unpubl. data 2019). The species is considered common in the southeast of Sakhalin Island (Dyldin and Orlov 2018).<br/><br/>In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) and in the GOA, the Pacific Sleeper Shark is not considered to be currently subject to overfishing (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b). There are no data to determine if the stock is overfished (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). Pacific Sleeper Shark catch in the BSAI was estimated to have averaged 136 t annually for 2003–2020; the method of catch estimation changed in 2003 and catch estimations prior to that were based on limited data (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). The species' catch in the GOA was estimated to have averaged 199 t annually from 1997 to 2020; the same change in catch estimation methods occurred in the GOA in 2003, however GOA catch estimates are informed by more data prior to 2003 (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). There may be underestimation of estimated weights of Pacific Sleeper Shark captured in the BSAI and GOA from longline vessels, as weights based on observer data are generally from smaller individuals because animals &gt;50 kg cannot be weighed at sea and are difficult to bring on board (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Trawl survey indices of relative abundance of Pacific Sleeper Sharks are less reliable than longline survey estimates as even immature animals are large and mostly avoid trawl gear and catches are often based on a small number of trawls and small numbers of individuals within a trawl; hence trawl estimates are not considered a reliable index for this species (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). The catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE, numbers caught per effective hook) from the International Pacific Halibut Commission annual longline surveys in the BSAI and GOA declined over 24 years from 1997 to 2020 (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a, IPHC 2020). Catches were lower in Canada and the United States west coast and no CPUE trends in those areas were evident (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). The decline observed in the BSAI and GOA indicated that either abundance was declining or that the distribution of the Pacific Sleeper Sharks may have altered over time making them less available to capture (Tribuzio et al. 2020a). Despite the potential decline in abundance and uncertainty in catch estimates, overall current catches of this species in both the BSAI and GOA are considered well below the acceptable biological catch levels (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>Overall, the species is occasionally observed in Japan and now rarely captured in Taiwan with possible declines over the past 18 years. The population is estimated to have increased slightly over the past 40 years in the Northwest Pacific, and in the Northeast Pacific the population trend is uncertain; the population may have declined over the past 21 years, however the observed decline in CPUE may be due to a reduction in catchability. Catches of the Pacific Sleeper Shark across the North Pacific are mostly of small and immature animals, with fewer adults captured which suggests either most adults have refuge from fishing pressure at depth or that they occur in nearshore habitats but are not susceptible to capture in the gear, possibly due to their large size. The threats to the species appear to have commenced during the 1940s (1–1.5 generation lengths ago) and it previously was estimated to have increased in biomass in the western Bering Sea from 1999 to 2006 with fluctuations in the eastern Bering Sea possibly due to sampling changes or species movements rather than population changes (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2009). It is still considered common in parts of its western range and in the eastern range, the stock is not considered to be currently subject to overfishing. The species is unlikely to have been threatened for approximately half of the past three generation lengths (150–225 years), however it may have undergone some population reduction in the past 80 years (~1–1.5 generation lengths) due to fisheries exploitation. Taking a precautionary approach, and given its large size and likely low productivity as it is a deep-water species, it is suspected that the population has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (150–225 years) due to fisheries exploitation.<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Pacific Sleeper Shark occurs in the North Pacific in the Northwest, Northeast, and Eastern Central Pacific from Taiwan to Baja California, Mexico, including the Hawaiian Islands. It also occurs north to the Chukchi Sea, in the Arctic Sea (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Kang <em>et al</em>. 2015, Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Its distribution above the Arctic Circle is unclear, and it may be misidentified with the Greenland Shark (<em>S. microcephalus</em>). Large sleeper sharks identified as the Pacific Sleeper Shark from the Southern Hemisphere are most likely that of Southern Sleeper Shark (<em>S. antarcticus</em>) (Ebert 2003, Yano <em>et al</em>. 2004).","The liver oil is used but in most places the meat is not used as it contains toxins, similar to that of the Greenland Shark (Dyldin and Orlov 2018). Despite the toxins, the meat of this species is consumed fresh in Taiwan as a replacement for Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>) meat as it has a similar consistency (Wang and Yang 2004).",Marine,"In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) and in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), the Sleeper Shark has been managed since 2011 as part of the shark stock complex that includes the Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus suckleyi</em>) and the Salmon Shark (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>) under the BSAI and GOA Fishery Management Plans; a total allowable catch, accepted biological catch, and overfishing limits are set and revised biennially for the stock complex (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b). The recreational fishing limit in the State of Alaska for combined Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, and Squaliformes is a daily bag limit of one shark with an annual limit of two sharks per year (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>Elsewhere, there are no species-specific measures. In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). Demersal fisheries in the Emperor Seamount Chain are managed by interim conservation measures of the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC) and voluntary measures of NPFC Members, that include time-area closures, effort controls, and capacity limits (CHM 2016). Throughout the main Hawaiian Islands, there are a series of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) referred to as Bottomfish Restricted Fishing Areas (DLNR 2019). These are generally closed to industrial and recreational bottom fishing and may offer the species refuge. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>","",,false,false,Global
4071001,135301,Oncorhynchus nerka,Least Concern,,2011,2010-11-24 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"At the global population level, Sockeye Salmon are assigned a Red List status of Least Concern (LC). The median and mean rate of change across the 62 assessed populations indicate an expanding global population (9.0 and 72.4 % increase, respectively, over the past three generations), thus there is no evidence of risk to the species under Red List A2 criterion. With an estimated geographic range of 11.5 million km², there is no evidence of threat to the global population under criterion B1 (Table 1). Similarly, at 1.9 million km² of current occupancy (freshwater basin area), there is no evidence of threat under criterion B2 (Table 1). Approximately 7% of the historical range of Sockeye Salmon has been lost due to localized extinction events, but we conclude the species is not threatened globally.<br/><br/>For all Figures, Tables and more details about the methods used for this assessment, see the Supplementary Material.","The species exhibits a great variety of life history patterns. It has a life history form called “Kokanee” that lives its entire life within freshwater, but this assessment includes only anadromous populations commonly referred to as “Sockeye” or “Red Salmon”. Sockeye are born in gravel nests in rivers or lakes and the majority of life history forms rear as juveniles for one to three years in freshwater before migrating to the ocean. Some Sockeye assume a river-type life history and rear in a river channel, while others are lake-type and rear in a lake environment. Primary prey during this life history stage include zooplankton and stream invertebrates. Some sea-type populations migrate within one to three months following emergence, and these make extensive use of estuaries. Most populations spend one to three years in offshore feeding areas where they grow to maturity (ca. 50-60 cm total length, 2.5-3.0 kg weight). Diet in the ocean consists primarily of zooplankton (copepods and euphausiids), but their diet also includes squids and fishes. Natural predators during this period in their life history include Salmon Sharks (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>) and Daggertooth (<em>Anotopterus nikparini</em>). Foraging individuals mix among populations both within and between Asia and North America, but at maturity they all migrate back toward their natal freshwater habitat where they spawn and die. The return to natal habitat and the isolation of spawning populations results in considerable genetic differentiation and adaptation to local conditions. Many fish are intercepted by fishers during the homeward, spawning migration, and natural predators include seals, sea lions and bears. Spawning occurs in late summer and autumn, in lake outlet or lake tributary streams or along lake beaches in finer sediments where subterranean upwelling occurs or among boulders on wave-aerated shores. River-type Sockeye spawn in river channels not associated with lakes. Adults display bright red bodies and green heads. Males compete with each other for access to females. Females compete with each other for gravel sites where they build nests, deposit eggs (fecundity typically ranges from 2,000–5,000 eggs), and briefly guard the redd. Median population size for the species is <em>ca</em>. 6,000 individuals. Reviews of life history and ecology of the species appear in Smith <em>et al</em>. (1987), Burgner (1991), Wood (1995) and Quinn (2005).","<strong></strong>The key threats to the species identified by the IUCN SSC Salmon Specialist Group were: <br/><ol><li>Mixed stock fishing leading to over fishing small, less productive populations</li><li>Changing river and ocean conditions that are likely linked to global climate change, expressed in poor marine survival rates and increased incidence of disease in adult spawners</li><li>Negative effects of hatcheries and construction of artificial spawning habitat </li></ol>It is important to note that in many cases, the causes for declines in some specific Sockeye Salmon subpopulations remain unknown.","At the species level, the population is believed to be stable; however, some subpopulations are declining. For more details on subpopulation size estimates and trends, see the Supplementary Material (particularly Appendix 2).",Stable,"The current distribution of <em>Oncorhynchus nerka</em> extends from approximately 45–70°N to 140°E–125°W longitude. The species has been recorded from Russia, United States, Canada, and Japan, although the Japanese populations are likely to have resulted from introductions; Japan is therefore not considered to be part of this species' natural range.<br/><br/>See the Supplementary Material (particularly Figures 1 &amp; 2, and Appendices 1 &amp; 2) for details on the range of this species and of each of the 98 subpopulations identified.","A certain percentage of Sockeye are captured and killed exclusively for their roe (eggs, caviar).  This occurs primarily in the Russian portion of their natural range, and the fishery is illegal and the take is unreported.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"1. Many subpopulations of Sockeye in British Columbia were found to be threatened based on this assessment. Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is responsible for salmon management and is currently formulating conservation units (Holtby and Ciruna, unpublished manuscript) and initiating new policy (e.g,. Wild Salmon Policy) and procedures to stem the loss in diversity (DFO 2005, Irvine and Fraser 2008). Two locations of Sockeye Salmon, Sakinaw Lake and Cultus Lake, have been assessed and listed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). However, the federal government has declined protection under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) due to the social and economic costs of closures to the fishery (Irvine <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). We encourage COSEWIC and DFO to focus attention on those subpopulations that we identified as threatened in this IUCN assessment.<br/><br/>2. We considered Ozette Lake, Lake Pleasant and Quinault Lake Sockeye Salmon as individual spawning sites in a larger subpopulation (SEASONAL UPWELLING). These lake systems are recognized individually as Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The latter two sites were not included in the genetic baseline applied in this assessment, thus we assumed all sites are members of a larger, parent subpopulation. Further, we did not include Ozette Lake in our assessment given the recent escapement data available for the native beach-spawning population at that location is obscured by repeated attempts at establishing a tributary spawning population originating from broodstock taken from outside the basin. We encourage efforts at expanding the range-wide microsatellite-DNA baseline to include Lake Pleasant and Quinault Lake, and to investigate the status of the native beach-spawning Sockeye in Ozette Lake.<br/><br/>3. Most of the data used in our assessment, particularly in Alaska, were from large aggregate stocks that may contain many (sometimes 100s) of individual spawning sites, and hence may mask important dynamics occurring at small scales. While a number of recent studies have shown that there is a significant degree of coherence among populations within a given region, it is important to acknowledge that a majority of the variability in vital rates are not explained by regional, environmental drivers, and may result from localized threats, for example road or other infrastructural development, or by different life history characteristics which affect productivity. Where possible and feasible, we recommend a more comprehensive monitoring approach that addresses dynamics at the scale of individual spawning sites. An excellent example of this approach is the Wood River system in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, where a combination of sampling approaches provides a more integrated monitoring system that translates into a robust assessment of the status of the species in that basin.<br/><br/>4. Mixed-stock fishing is likely to be a key factor in the decline observed at many sites and subpopulations in our assessment. We feel a key priority is filling a gap in knowledge about composition of mixed-stock harvest in coastal Sockeye Salmon fisheries. While a great deal of resources has been invested in developing weak-stock management for Fraser River Sockeye Salmon through the Pacific Salmon Commission and DFO, there has been much less attention placed in other regions along the west coast of North America, particularly in the regions where we found the greatest diversity of subpopulations. We encourage continued investment in developing methods and protocols to account for subpopulation composition of coastal fisheries targeting Sockeye salmon to help track harvest pressure at a biologically and ecologically meaningful scale. Further, we encourage fisheries management agencies to explore restructuring fisheries in a way that would result in shifting fishing pressure from coastal regions to more terminal locations, thus providing a more effective means of controlling fishing pressure at the scale of individual subpopulations.<br/><br/>5. Another leading factor threatening Sockeye Salmon are poor marine survival rates. This has been documented in cases where smolt-to-adult survival rates are estimated through intensive monitoring programs. This appears to be a significant factor explaining declines in adult abundance across many locations in the southern range of the species in North America. While marine conditions have been shown to cycle based on climate forcing and may, in fact, improve in future years, we feel it is important for those managing salmon in this region to acknowledge that poor marine survival may persist, particularly given projections based on global climate change. Reversing declining trends in those subpopulations affected may require increased attention to agents of mortality that are occurring at other life history stages over which we have more local control.<br/><br/>6. Many previous attempts at re-introductions of Sockeye Salmon have been unsuccessful, and we feel any effort at captive breeding or inter-basin transfers for reintroduction purposes should proceed with great caution. These efforts, to the extent that they exist, are at best stop-gap measures and are in no way a substitute for conserving the species in the wild. The lack of success from the captive breeding of endangered Sakinaw Sockeye Salmon by DFO, and endangered Redfish Lake Sockeye by NMFS, are examples of the limitations to these expensive measures. Recent evidence of re-establishment of anadromous runs of Sockeye from remnant, isolated Kokanee populations following dam removal or modification (e.g., Allouette Lake in British Columbia) may offer hope in re-establishing anadromous life histories in cases where dams have prevented passage.<br/><br/>7. Enhancement activities (particularly hatchery releases and spawning channel construction) is likely to be a key factor in reducing abundance in neighbouring, small wild populations. In our assessment, we were unable to functionally track both wild and enhanced Sockeye Salmon where they intermingle. We strongly recommend adoption of integrated monitoring programs that includes a robust marking program and monitoring efforts targeted toward wild Sockeye Salmon populations that would provide the data necessary to address the degree to which enhancement practices threaten wild Sockeye Salmon. It is important to note that two large basins in our assessment (Fraser and Skeena) are all strongly. influenced by enhancement activities, and these activities likely represent a key factor threatening many neighbouring subpopulations.<br/><br/>8. While not addressed in the present assessment due to lack of data, we feel there should be more focused research attention on sea-and river-type Sockeye that may serve as colonizers in the future. This line of research is particularly important given expected habitat alterations from climate change.<br/>&#160;<br/>9. Very few data were available to assess population viability of Sockeye Salmon in the Russian Far East, and we document a significant reduction in escapement in recent years at a site within the Kamchatka River basin that warranted an endangered listing for this subpopulation. The leading threat recognized for this subpopulation is overfishing. The situation has been exacerbated by an increase in illegal fishing practices. We encourage the leading agencies in this region to provide more open access to data, and supporting meta-data, for assessment purposes. We also encourage development of new monitoring efforts throughout the region and increased enforcement to reduce poaching. Many populations of river-type Sockeye exist, particularly in western Kamchatka, and focused research on these populations will provide important insight into the status of the species there.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

14871490,22823,Ursus maritimus,Vulnerable,A3c,2015,2015-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Loss of Arctic sea ice due to climate change is the most serious threat to Polar Bears throughout their circumpolar range (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stirling and Derocher 2012, USFWS 2015). We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term “management units” may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (M’Clintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89°46’N, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52°35’N (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bears’ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party “…shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,…” and according to Article VII, “The Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bears…” and&#160; “...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...”. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Further, the Parties shall consult with each other on the management of shared Polar Bear subpopulations, and exchange information on research and management programs. The PBSG has reiterated that all management actions be based on the best scientific information. The PBSG has identified these management elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Protection of essential habitats</li><li>Use of scientific evidence</li><li>Monitoring, prevention and sound management of human-bear conflicts</li><li>Development of inter-jurisdictional agreements for shared populations</li><li>Development of management strategies to minimize impacts of human activities (e.g. mining, shipping, oil and gas activities, tourism and other human-caused disturbance)</li><li>Management of sustainable harvest</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of the local public living in polar bear areas in developing and achieving the goals of the action plan </li></ul><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

However, Bearded Seals are very likely going to be negatively impacted by climate change, in particular because of losses of sea ice, and they should be monitored over the coming decades and reassessed as soon as more data become available.","<p>Bearded Seals are the largest northern phocid seal. Burns (1981) found that the average standard length of adults measured from the Bering/Chukchi region was 233 cm, with females slightly longer and substantially heavier than males. Maximum lengths were 233 cm for males and 243 cm for females and maximum weights were 262 kg and 360 kg. Newborn pups averaged 131 cm in length. Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2011) found an average asymptotic length of 219 cm for Bering/Chukchi samples from the 1970s, and 209 cm for samples from the 2000s. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) report a maximum weight of 432 kg for a female collected in the Bering Sea in spring 1985. The Atlantic Bearded Seal is of similar size, and shares the slight sexual dimorphism, with females tending to be larger than males (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Maximum mass recorded in Svalbard is for a female in spring that weighed 424 kg <br/> <br/> In Alaskan waters, sexual maturity is reached between 3 and 6 years in females, with an average of 4 years (Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Males reach sexual maturity at 6-7 years (Burns 1981). In Svalbard, females reach sexual maturity at an age of 5 years, while males are 6 years of age when they are sexually mature though it is likely some years from that point before they compete successfully to breed (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999). Final body size in Bearded Seals is reached at approximately 9-10 years (McLaren 1958). Maximum longevity is likely 25-30 years (Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).</p><p>Bearded Seal pups are normally born on pack ice or small floes of annually-formed sea ice that fracture away from shore-fast ice as it breaks up in late spring (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). They also have been documented to use glacier ice pieces floating on the sea for birthing and nursing when forced to by the lack of availability of first-year sea ice (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The large, precocial pups swim within hours of birth (Kovacs 2009). Peak birthing occurs between late March and mid-May, varying somewhat across the Bearded Seal’s range (Burns 1981, Kovacs 2009). Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2000) estimated that in Svalbard pups are weaned in approximately 24 days. Nursing might be somewhat shorter for the Pacific subspecies, Burns (1981) suggested that pups are weaned at 12-18 days of age. Prior to weaning, their aquatic skills develop to the degree that they spend about half their time in the water, diving for up to 5.5 minutes to depths of up to 84 m (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). Mothers spend over 80% of their time in the water while caring for a dependent pup (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999); about half that time is spent away from the neonate, presumably in foraging dives. Females haul-out to nurse their pups on average three times a day. The small amount of time mothers spend out of the water when pups are young is thought to be an adaptive response to Polar Bear predation; when only the pup is on the surface, the pair is less conspicuous to hunting bears (Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Mating takes place at the end of lactation similar to other phocid seals. Males court females and display using elaborate downward trilling vocalizations that can travel many kilometres (Cleator <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989). Individual males use distinct songs, and occupy the same territories over a series of consecutive years within constraints imposed by variable ice conditions, or they show a roaming pattern (Van Parijs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, 2003, 2004). Males exhibit aggression with each other during breeding, including bubble-blowing and physical combat so the mating system is presumably polygynous to some degree.<br/><br/>Bearded seals have an extended moulting period and animals can be found shedding hair from April to August, though there appears to be a peak in May/June for both subspecies (Burns 1981, Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000).&#160; During the moult they spend much of their time hauled out and are reluctant to enter the water (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Bearded seals use sea ice as a haulout platform on a year-round basis whenever it is available, preferring small and medium sized floes and generally avoiding large floes (Simpkins <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). However, they will haul out on land in the summer in the absence of sea ice (e.g., Burns 1981, Merkel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).&#160; They are rarely found more than a body length from access to water even if hauled out on land (Kovacs 2009).<br/><br/>Bearded Seals naturally occur at quite low densities (Bengtson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005); they are typically solitary animals, but they do form small, loose aggregations at times (Burns 1981). <br/><br/>Studies conducted on Atlantic Bearded Seal lactating females and pups (Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000) have shown that diving depths largely reflect local bathymetry in coastal areas.&#160; This reflects their benthic foraging habits; Bearded Seals feed primarily on or near the bottom and most diving is to depths of less than 100 m (though dives of adults have been recorded up to 300 m and young-of-the-year have been recorded diving down to almost 500 m; Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). They use their elaborate whiskers to search for food items on and in soft bottom substrates and have powerful suction abilities to extract prey (Marshall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, 2008). The diet of Bearded Seals varies by age, location, and season (Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1980). Polar Cod (<em>Boreogadis saida</em>), Sculpins, Spider Crab, and Shrimps (<em>Sabinea sptemcarinatus </em>and <em>Sclerocrangon boreas</em>) are the most frequent prey items in Svalbard (Hjelset <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). However, Cod, other demersal fish, and worms are also regular components of the diet in this area. A wide variety of prey has been reported from the Okhotsk Sea, with Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, and Worms accounting for most of their diet (Burns 1981). Quakenbush <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2011) analyzed the frequency of occurrence of prey in 943 Bearded Seal stomachs collected from the Bering and Chukchi Seas during 1960-2009 and identified 213 different prey taxa. The most commonly eaten groups were Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, benthic and demersal fishes, and echiuroid worms. These authors found a significant increase in consumption of gadid fishes, principally Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>) and Saffron Cod (<em>Eleginus gracilis</em>), from the 1960s to the 2000s.</p><p>Bearded Seals are preyed upon by Polar Bears, Killer Whales, Greenland Sharks, and Pacific Walruses (Lowry and Fay 1984, Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).</p>","Global climate warming is currently causing major reductions in the extent and duration of sea ice cover in the Arctic, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals. Pinnipeds such as the Bearded Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting, resting, and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Laidre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2015; Kovacs 2011, 2012). In 2012, Bearded Seals were listed under the US Endangered Species Act following a detailed review of their status and threats (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) because of the threats posed from climate change induced losses in sea ice and ocean acidification due to climate warming, as well as increasing industrial activities in a more ice-free Arctic (Federal Register 2012). Increasing development and industrialization of the Arctic may threaten Bearded Seals in several ways. Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect them through direct contact with oil and damage to foraging areas and stocks of prey, particularly benthic invertebrates, that are vulnerable to oil contamination. An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Bearded Seals that are very vocal during their breeding season, to abandon areas of habitat they otherwise might use. Increased shipping will pose a greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals. Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2010) concluded that these factors could constitute low to moderate threats to Bearded Seals.<br/><br/>Hunting by indigenous peoples continues throughout most of the species range. There is no evidence of any impact from hunting on Bearded Seal population numbers. For example, reports from Alaska Native subsistence hunters do not give any indication that Bearded Seal numbers have declined (Quakenbush <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).","Population sizes and trends are unknown for all populations of the Atlantic Bearded Seal (see Laidre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015 for a summary). An estimate for Canadian waters of 190,000 animals was suggested by Cleator (1996), based on data collected over a 35-year period, but this number is really an educated guess as opposed to an actual estimate and in any case is now dated. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada more recently assessed the status of this species in Canada as being data deficient (COSEWIC 2007). They are also listed on Greenland’s Red List as being data deficient (Boertmann 2007). There have never been any surveys for Bearded Seals in Norwegian waters (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006) or Russian territories in the Atlantic Arctic (Reijnders <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1993). However, recordings of their distinctive breeding calls via passive acoustic monitoring networks suggest that this species remains widespread and relatively numerous in the Atlantic Arctic (e.g., Moore <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).<br/><br/>Population data are also incomplete for Pacific Bearded Seals, but this subspecies has received considerably more survey effort. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) concluded that the best estimate for the Okhotsk Sea is 95,000 based on data from 1990 (Fedoseev 2000), and that there are no useful abundance estimates for the East Siberian and Beaufort Seas. Aerial surveys in 1999-2000 estimated about 27,000 Bearded Seals in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea. In the Bering Sea, surveys having been conducted by the USA and the Soviet Union/Russia starting in the 1970s. Early efforts, which covered varying areas and used a variety of methods, suggested an abundance of 50,000-100,000 Bearded Seals in the region. More recently, Ver Hoef <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2014) analyzed line transect survey data collected in the Bering Sea in spring 2007 using a series of models and estimated there were 61,800 Bearded Seals (95% CI 34,900–171,600) in their study area. Because that study included about half of the available sea ice habitat, Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) considered that the total Bearded Seal population in the Bering Sea was about 125,000. It is likely that the total abundance of Pacific Bearded Seals, including the Okhotsk Sea, is at least 250,000.<br/><br/>The global population size of Bearded Seals is unknown. Current population trends are also unknown.",Unknown,"Bearded Seals have a patchy circumpolar distribution throughout much of the Arctic and sub-Arctic, south of 85ºN.&#160;In the Pacific sector they range from the Arctic Ocean south through the East Siberian, Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas (Burns 1981).&#160;They also occupy all of Hudson Bay and much of the eastern Canadian Archipelago south to southern Labrador, and both coasts of Greenland. They occur along the north shore of Iceland, within the Svalbard Archipelago, in the drifting pack ice of the Barents Sea and across much of the north coast of the Russian Federation (Kovacs 2009). Bearded Seal vagrants have been reported from many locations outside the Arctic including Portugal (van Bree 2000), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, northern Newfoundland, and Massachusetts&#160;(Gosselin and Boily 1994)&#160;in the North Atlantic, as well as in Japan and China in the North Pacific (Rice 1998).<br/> <br/> Bearded Seals are strongly associated with sea ice and are benthic feeders, and these two attributes explain much of their seasonal movement patterns and their general distribution. While they are not strictly migratory, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi region undergo seasonal movements linked with the advance and retreat of sea ice (Burns 1981, Cameron <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). However, in some other regions they are quite sedentary throughout the year, such as in Svalbard, Norway (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).","<p></p><p>Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have hunted Bearded Seals for subsistence for thousands of years, a practice that continues today throughout much of the species’ range. However, levels of subsistence harvest are not well known. Subsistence harvests of Bearded Seals in Alaska were estimated to average approximately 6,800/year during 1990-1998 (Allen and Angliss 2010). Some animals are struck and lost, especially from late spring to mid summer when they are thinnest, and if those animals are accounted for the annual Alaska harvest could be as high as 10,000. An additional 1,000-2,000 may be taken by coastal hunters in Chukotka (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Subsistence harvest levels are not closely monitored in Canada, but Cleator (1996) estimated that roughly 2,400 Bearded Seals were taken per year. In Greenland Bearded Seals make up only 1-2% of the Seal catch (Garde 2013), with some few hundred taken annually. Bearded Seals are hunted at low levels in Svalbard currently, but during the whaling period individual boats would take hundreds. They are also harvested in the White Sea.<br/> <br/> The former Soviet Union historically conducted ship-based commercial harvests of Bearded Seals in the North Pacific region, in the Bering, Chukchi, and Okhotsk Seas. Harvests grew from 9,000 to 13,000 for the Bering and Okhotsk seas combined during 1957-1964, and were 8,000 to 10,000 per year during 1964-1967 (Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992). Ship-based harvests were suspended from 1970 to 1975, and took place at lower levels when they resumed (Kelly 1988). There is currently no significant commercial harvest of Bearded Seals in Russia.</p>",Terrestrial|Marine,"Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act generally prohibits taking of Bearded Seals unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. In 2012, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi and Okhotsk Seas were listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (Federal Register 2012). In Canada, subsistence hunting of Bearded Seals is co-managed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and regional resource boards (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Licensed hunters can shoot Bearded Seals in Svalbard, outside protected areas and during open seasons, that are set in periods when Bearded Seals shot in the water are least likely to sink (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). In Russia, the “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Seals by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a total allowable catch is determined annually. Russia is the only nation to set a quota on the number of Bearded Seals that can be harvested, it is an “open” hunt in all other regions.<br/><br/>Bearded Seals are able to use glacier ice pieces that have calved into the sea as haul-out platforms, so tidal glacier fronts are increasingly important to them in areas where sea ice declines are marked (Lydersen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Tidal glacier fjords may represent important breeding refugias in the future as sea ice continues to decline and this habitat type should be considered for special conservation status.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45228501,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"While Walruses occur over a vast area and are common in some regions, their future is by no means secure. Climatic warming will surely require them to live in a much different environment as sea ice recedes and disappears from many of the areas they have used in past centuries (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, 2012, 2015; Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2015). All reasonable scenarios expect that such drastic changes to their habitats will cause Walrus populations to decline throughout most of their range. Because of the expectation of a decline the IUCN SSC Pinniped Specialist Group has recommended that the Atlantic Walrus be listed as Near Threatened under criterion C1, and they have recommended that the Pacific Walrus be listed as Data Deficient. Models suggest that Pacific Walrus abundance declined by 50% between 1980 and 2000 (Udevitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009), and there is ongoing concern about female body condition and possible impacts on calf survival (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Considering both the certainty of future decline in their habitat quality and the limitations of abundance and trend data, the Walrus as a species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.","The Walrus’s most distinctive feature is the external tusks, which are possessed by both males and females. The tusks can grow to be a meter long and can weigh 5 kg in large bulls. They are one of the largest pinnipeds with Pacific Walrus males reaching 3.6 m in length and weighing 880-1,557 kg; adult females are about 3 m and 580-1,039 kg. Atlantic Walrus adults are slightly shorter and lighter. Newborns are 1-1.4 m long and weigh 33-85 kg (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).<br/><br/>Walruses are extremely social animals, and when on land or ice they are normally found in tight groups ranging in size from a few individual up to thousands. At sea they usually travel in groups as well (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). There is significant sexual segregation outside the breeding season, with males often being found in areas away from females and their calves. Walruses have a narrow ecological niche. They depend on: 1) the availability of large areas of shallow water with suitable bottom substrate to support a productive bivalve community, 2) the presence of reliable open water over rich feeding areas, particularly in winter when access to feeding areas is limited by ice cover, and 3) the presence of haul out areas in reasonably close proximity to feeding areas. The preferred haul out platform is sea ice, although both subspecies routinely use terrestrial haul out sites in the summer and autumn (Fay 1981, Hamilton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Because they feed in shallow, coastal areas Walruses usually perform only relatively shallow, short dives (Fay and Burns 1988, Born 2005). The Walrus’s main prey is bivalve mollusks that they search for using their sensitive whiskers on or in soft-bottom substrates. In addition to Clams, their diet can include Worms, Snails, soft shell Crabs, Amphipods, Shrimp, Sea Cucumbers, Tunicates, and even slow-moving Fishes (Born 2005, Sheffield and Grebmeier 2009). Some Walruses prey on birds and other marine mammals, eating a variety of Seal species (Lowry and Fay 1984, Fox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Seymour <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Walrus make foraging trips that last from a few hours to several days; in the Pacific, trips are shorter in duration and distance when they originate from sea ice versus land (Udevitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occur in the winter. Walruses are polygynous and the males establish small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes (Sjare and Stirling 1996, Sjare <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Most births occur in May of the following year. Most female Walrus give birth at 7-10 years old and usually they only produce one calf every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>The primary predators of Walrus are Polar Bears and Killer Whales (Killian and Stirling 1978, Fay 1981).","Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.<br/><br/>Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers <em>et al.</em> 2006, Skoglund <em>et al.</em> 2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.<br/><br/>Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011, Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova <em>et al.</em> 2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.","The Pinniped Specialists Group assessed the abundance and trend of the two Walrus subspecies as follows:<br/><ul><li>Atlantic Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;25,000, some subpopulations increasing but overall trend unknown</li><li>Pacific Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;200,000, trend unknown</li></ul>Considering these results, the abundance of the Walrus species as a whole is likely &gt;225,000 and the trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and are mostly found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas (Fay 1981, Rice 1998). The Atlantic Walrus occurs from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2014). Within that region nine stocks are generally recognized. Historically, Atlantic walruses occurred south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northwestern North Atlantic, but they were extirpated in this region by excessive harvesting (McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2014). Vagrants have been reported from New England, Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay in France/Spain. The Pacific Walrus normally ranges from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, which constitute the center of its range, to the Laptev Sea in the west and the Beaufort Sea in the east, with vagrants south into the North Pacific Ocean to Japan and southcentral Alaska (Fay 1982).","Native people of the Arctic have depended on Walrus for food, hides, ivory and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests continue today in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia. All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been managed under numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been well within sustainable limits (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010, Henriksen and Hilmo 2015). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland, and additionally females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Walrus are listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which allows for control of global trade in Walrus ivory.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia; they are on the Norwegian Red List (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and they are listed in the Russian Red Book (Boltunov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland (Wiig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated the Atlantic Walrus as a species of “special concern”, which acknowledges that they are at risk of becoming threatened in this region; this classification is attributed to climate change impacts on sea ice (COSEWIC 2006).<br/><br/>Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) generally prohibits taking of Walrus unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. MMPA regulations are used to control impacts caused by commercial fishing, oil and gas development, and other human activities. The Pacific Walrus is currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act which would provide additional protections. Within the US there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Russia, Walruses were commercially harvested through the 1980s, but harvests ended in 1991 due to economic collapse of the industry. The “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Pacific Walruses by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a quota is determined annually. Russian legislation prohibits sport hunting of Pacific Walruses, and a variety of types of protection are afforded to major haulout sites along the Russian coast (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45229806,17023,Phoca largha,Least Concern,,2016,2015-06-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,The Spotted Seal is an abundant species and there is no evidence of recent declines in the main part of its range. It is therefore listed as Least Concern.<br/><br/><em></em>,"In the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, adult female Spotted Seals usually weigh 65-115 kg and are 151-169 cm long, while adult males weigh 85-110 kg and are 161-176 cm long (Boveng <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Maximum reported length was 182 cm for females and 185 cm for males (Tikhomirov 1968).<br/><br/>In spring, Spotted Seals give birth to a single pup, typically on the surface of sea ice but in some places on shore, particularly in the Bohai Sea, Peter the Great Bay, the South Kuril Islands, the second Kuril Strait, Utashud Island, and the east coast of Kamchatka (Trukhin 2005). Pups are born in a white lanugo coat that is shed at or before weaning, which occurs about four weeks after birth. At birth pups are 75-92 cm long and weigh 7-12 kg, and they grow to 30 kg or more by weaning (Boveng <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Mating occurs after pups are weaned. Spotted Seals are annually monogamous and males defend lactating females on ice floes. Groups composed of a female with her pup and a male, called triads, are common during the breeding season (Quakenbush 1988).<br/><br/>In late-spring and summer many Spotted Seals leave the sea ice and haul out on land to rest when they are not foraging. On some haul-out sites in Kamchatka the number of animals on shore may exceed 10,000 individuals (V. Burkanov pers. comm.). As sea ice forms in October-November Spotted Seals again use the ice as their primary feeding and resting habitat (Burkanov 1990; Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, 2000). They are generalist feeders that take primarily a variety of fish species (Walleye Pollock, Arctic and Saffron Cod, Rockfish, Herring, Sand Lance, Smelt, Capelin, Eelpout, Salmon, Flatfishes), cephalopods (Squid and Octopus) and crustaceans (Shrimp and Crab) (Burkanov 1990, Quakenbush <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Reported predators include Pacific Sleeper Sharks, Killer Whales, Golden Eagles, Steller’s Sea Eagles, Ravens, Gulls, Polar and Brown Bears, Wolves, Arctic Foxes, Walruses and Steller Sea Lions (Quakenbush 1988).","Intensive harvesting of fish in the Okhotsk and Bering seas poses a risk to Spotted Seals, as several of their main prey species are targets of commercial fisheries (Lowry and Frost 1985). Entanglement in commercial fisheries occurs occasionally in Japan and in the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea. Small, organized control kills to limit damage to fisheries regularly occur in Japan (Mizuno <em>et al.</em> 2001, Angliss and Outlaw 2007). In Kamchatka, Spotted Seals sometimes eat fish out of fishing gear and fishermen shoot small numbers in local areas to defend their landings and protect their equipment (V. Burkanov, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Oil and gas development may cause disturbance to and adversely affect the habitat used by Spotted Seals (Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to their populations, but the closely related North Pacific Harbor Seal was impacted by oil spilled from the tanker <em>Exxon Valdez</em> (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1994). The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season, if food resources were negatively affected, or if the spill was an event that affected a large area (St. Aubin 1990). A variety of contaminants have been found in Spotted Seals sampled in Alaska but their potential impacts are largely unknown (Quakenbush<em> et al</em>. 2009). Contaminant concerns would be greatest for animals living in the western part of the range where they occur near large population and industrial areas in China, Korea, and Japan.<br/><br/>Reduction in late winter and spring sea ice cover as a result of the disrupted, warming climate could be problematic for Spotted Seals as the majority of the population uses pack ice at the southern limit of the ice extent for pupping (e.g., Tynan and DeMaster 1997). Changes to ice characteristics that affect its location, timing, stability, etc. could result in lower survival of Spotted Seal pups. This threat is strongest in the southern parts of the range, the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan, where ice extent and seasonal persistence time have already been greatly reduced (Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009). The threat may be mitigated somewhat in the Bering Sea, where a long-term range shift northward would be possible through Bering Strait to the Chukchi Sea, where seasonal formation of suitable ice is projected to occur beyond the current century under the most commonly used global climate models (Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009). Disruption or alteration of the patterns of primary productivity and abundance of key prey species, either by sea ice loss or ocean acidification could also have detrimental effects on Spotted Seals, though the magnitude and even the direction of impacts are very uncertain (Boveng <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).","The abundance of Spotted Seals has never been well quantified. Poorly documented estimates suggest a total population size in the 1970s of perhaps 400,000, with 200-250,000 in the Bering-Chukchi Seas and perhaps 170,000 in the Okhotsk Sea (Bigg 1981, Quakenbush 1988). More recent surveys indicate the total number may be in excess of 640,000 individuals, with more than 460,000 in the Bering Sea (Conn <em>et al</em>. 2014), 180,000 in the Sea of Okhotsk (Fedoseev 2000), and about 3,300 in the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan (Han <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nesterenko and Katin 2009). Surveys have been too irregular and imprecise to measure population trend, but Alaska Native hunters have not reported any notable changes in the availability of Spotted Seals (Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009, Quakenbush <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Maximum longevity is at least 35 years (Quakenbush 1988). Less than a third of females and males become sexually mature by age 3, about two-thirds of both sexes become mature by age 4, and nearly all (i.e., &gt;90%) are sexually mature by age 5 (Tikhomirov 1966, Naito and Nishiwaki 1972, Fedoseev 2000, Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009).",Unknown,"Spotted Seals breed in the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohia Sea. They are also found outside the breeding season in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, ranging north into the Arctic Ocean to about the edge of the continental shelf, west to about 170°E longitude, and east to the Mackenzie River Delta in Canada (Shaughnessey and Fay 1977, Quakenbush 1988). They inhabit the southern edge of the pack ice from winter to early summer. In late summer and fall, Spotted Seals move into coastal areas, including river mouths. They rarely occur in water depths greater than 200 m (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2000). They breed mostly on sea ice and haul-out on sea ice when it is available, but they also haul out on beaches and sandbars (Burns 1970; Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2000). There are several sites along the Asian coast where Spotted Seals breed on small remote islands (e.g., in Peter the Great Gulf, the Kuril Islands, and small islands along east coast of Kamchatka; Burkanov 1988, 1990; Trukhin and Katin 2001; Kostenko <em>et al</em>. 2004; Vertyankin and Nikulin 2004).","Alaska Natives are allowed to take marine mammals for subsistence and creation of handicrafts. Subsistence hunting of Spotted Seals has no doubt occurred since humans first made contact with the species and they remain an important subsistence resource for coastal Alaska Natives in western Alaska (Quakenbush 1988, Allen and Angliss 2014). From the 1960s through the 1980s, the Soviet Union harvested several thousand Spotted Seals each year in both the Okhotsk and Bering seas, mostly from large commercial vessels (Heptner 1996). Commercial harvesting of this species no longer occurs in Russia.",Terrestrial|Marine,"In the United States the Spotted Seal is generally protected from all but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which also generally prohibits import and export of parts or products from all marine mammals.<br/><br/>Commercial harvesting of Spotted Seals from vessels of the Russian Federation ended in 1994. Small scale commercial and subsistence harvests from small boats and land occurs along the Russian Far East coast, but the size of the harvest is relatively small (V. Burkanov pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Spotted Seals are listed in the Second Category (II) of the State Key Protected Wildlife List in China, listed as Vulnerable in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals, and designated a vulnerable species under the Wildlife Conservation Act of China (Wang 1998). However, as of 2004, no “conservation action, public awareness or education programmes have been carried out for the species in this region” (Won and Yoo 2004).<br/><br/>In 2000, Spotted Seals were afforded protected status under the Wildlife Conservation Act of South Korea. Despite this protection, the Liaodong Bay population, shared between China and Korea, has continued to decline (Han <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45230946,41670,Histriophoca fasciata,Least Concern,,2016,2015-06-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Despite recent progress in population assessment, estimates of total abundance of Ribbon Seals are imprecise and current population trend is not known. But, with modern assessment methods producing an estimate of nearly 400,000 animals it is evident that the population is quite large. Commercial harvesting of Ribbon Seals stopped in 1994 and numbers have likely been growing since then. The only major threat identified is climate change, and effects of that are not likely to occur in the near future. Ribbon Seals are classified as Least Concern.","Ribbon Seals are medium sized phocids, with a striking pattern of light bands on their darker pelage. Pups at birth are about 86 cm long and weigh about 9.5 kg. Males and females are similar in size with adults typically 150-175 cm long, and weighing 70-90 kg (Tikhomirov 1968, Burns 1981, Fedoseev 2000).<br/><br/>Female Ribbon Seals mature when they are 2-4 years old and males when they are 3-5 years. Adult females give birth to a single white-coated pup in March-May that is nursed for 3-4 weeks. Clean, white, broken pack ice is preferred as a birth site over solid ice sheets and ice with sediment or algae. Breeding occurs after the pup is weaned, and gestation lasts about 9 months after 2-2.5 months of delayed implantation. Ribbon Seals generally live to about 20 years old, but maximum longevity may be as much as 30 years (Burns 1981, Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>From late winter until summer, Ribbon Seals occupy the pack ice that overlies the continental shelf. They prefer areas of 60-80% ice coverage, rarely use shore fast ice, and do not haul-out on land unless moribund (Kelly 1988, Burns 1981). They typically lie away from the edge of floes and show little concern for the approach of people or vessels. Broken pack ice is preferred over solid ice sheets and highly concentrated pack ice. Their whereabouts when pack ice breaks up or disappears from the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk is not well known. Kelly (1988) suggested that animals from the Bering Sea population summer in the Chukchi Sea and those from the Sea of Okhotsk, where Ribbon Seals are not seen after mid-July, might move into the southern Bering Sea. Burns (1981) reported that few Ribbon Seals are seen on ice or harvested by Alaska Natives in the Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea after mid-June, and suggested that many Ribbon Seals are probably pelagic during summer and fall, not hauling out on land or ice until the next winter.<br/><br/>Satellite-linked tags were applied to more than 80 Ribbon Seals captured in spring 2005-2010 in the ice of the central and western Bering Sea (Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). All tagged Seals were pelagic during summer and fall. They ranged widely through the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Chukchi Sea, and adjacent Arctic Basin. Ribbon Seals from the Okhotsk Sea have not been tagged and tracked.<br/><br/>The overall diet of Ribbon Seals is unknown because essentially all the samples that have been examined came from the spring period when the primary activities are pupping, breeding, and molting, and most stomachs are empty. Prey items identified from spring samples included at least 25 species of fishes and 23 species of invertebrates. Commonly occurring prey included Walleye Pollock, Arctic Cod, Pacific Cod, Saffron Cod, Capelin, Smooth Lumpsucker, Eelpout, flatfish, Squids, Octopus, and crustaceans. Crustaceans (Euphausiids and Shrimps) appear to be a main food item for newly weaned and young Seals (Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Using both stomach contents and stable isotope analysis, Dehn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2007) concluded that trophic level of the Ribbon Seal diet increased with age of the Seal, suggesting a diet transition from mostly crustaceans in young animals to fish and nektobenthos in older animals. The only two stomach samples collected in mid-winter contained Walleye Pollock and Arctic Cod (Burns 1981).<br/><br/>Dive data provided by satellite-linked tags showed relatively shallow diving (mostly to &lt;100 m) during spring when Seals are over the continental shelf, with deeper diving occasionally to &gt;600 m at other times when the Seals may be over deep basins (Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013).","Ribbon Seals are sometimes incidentally caught in commercial fisheries, but bycatch data are incomplete. Available data suggest a take of approximately one per year by the Alaska fisheries that were monitored during 1990-2007 (Boveng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). Woodley and Lavigne (1991) reported catches of a few up to 14 per year in fisheries around Japan. During seven years (1993-1999) of monitoring the offshore salmon gill net fishery in Russian Far East, incidental mortality of Ribbon Seals was estimated to be 1,079 individuals (154 per year), mostly juveniles (Burkanov and Nikulin 2001). These data certainly underestimate the total take as bycatch is not monitored in a number of Russian and Alaskan fisheries.<br/><br/>Commercial fisheries target a number of known Ribbon Seal prey species (e.g., Walleye Pollock, Pacific Cod, Pacific Herring, and Capelin), and it is possible that reductions in prey biomass caused by fishing could have an impact on Seal nutrition. At the current time, biomasses of these fishes are fairly high and stable, at least in the Bering Sea, and impacts of removals on Ribbon Seal nutrition are not likely. This situation could change, however, as fishing patterns shift with warming waters and reduced sea ice (Boveng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>As is true for all ice-associated pinnipeds, climate warming and reductions in seasonal sea ice are likely to have impacts on Ribbon Seals. A detailed review of this issue by Boveng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) analyzed the possible individual and cumulative effects on Ribbon Seals of future warmer temperatures, reduced ice, ocean acidification, and associated changes in prey, predators, parasites, and diseases. They concluded that while impacts are likely at some point in the future, they are very difficult to predict or quantify.","Three separate populations of Ribbon Seals have been proposed associated with aggregations of breeding animals - the Bering Sea, the southern Sea of Okhotsk, and the northern Sea of Okhotsk (Fedoseev 2002). However, Boveng <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2013) considered the biological evidence for separate breeding populations in the Okhotsk and Bering seas to be weak or equivocal, and they assessed the status of Ribbon Seals as a species with a single population.<br/><br/>Ribbon Seals are difficult to enumerate, as they are widely dispersed over large areas that are generally far from land. Nonetheless, a number of population estimates have been proposed based on counts made during aerial surveys flown over sea ice in the Bering and Okhotsk seas (see Boveng <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). In most cases surveys were not designed specifically for Ribbon Seals, and the methods used varied and were often not well described. Burns (1981) reported a population estimate of 90,000-100,000 animals in the Bering Sea, and 140,000 animals in the Okhotsk Sea. Fedoseev (2002) gave an estimate of 120,000 to 140,000 animals for the Bering Sea in 1987 and estimates of between 200,000 (1968-1974) and 630,000 (1988-1990) for the Okhotsk Sea. The Okhotsk Sea population was reported to have averaged 370,000 animals with 320,000 in the central northwestern region and 50,000 in the southern region, in the period between 1968 and 1990 (Fedoseev 2002). Little information was collected on Ribbon Seal abundance between 1991 and 2007. Boveng <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2008) used eastern and central Bering Sea survey results from 2007, combined with information on distribution (Fedoseev 1973, Fedoseev <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1988), to estimate the range-wide abundance of Ribbon Seals as 267,000. The 95% credible interval for that estimate was 154,000-827,000.<br/><br/>American and Russian scientists conducted image-based aerial surveys of ice-associated Seals in the Bering and Okhotsk seas in 2012 and 2013. Data from those surveys are not yet fully analyzed, but using a limited subsample of the data collected from the U.S. portion of the Bering Sea in 2012, Conn <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2014) estimated about 184,000 (95% CI: 145,752-230,134) Ribbon Seals in that area. The estimate from the 2013 survey in the Okhotsk Sea was 181,179 (95% CI: 118,392–316,995) Ribbon Seals (Chernook <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). The mean estimate from the two surveys combined is about 365,000 animals.<br/><br/>Population trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Ribbon Seals inhabit the northern North Pacific Ocean and adjoining seas, and are seen most commonly in the Bering and Okhotsk seas hauled out on sea ice in the ice front region. They are seen on ice until it has melted in May-June, and seldom haul out on ice or land until the following spring (Burns 1981). The presumption that they live a pelagic lifestyle during summer and fall has been corroborated by tracking with satellite-linked tags (Boveng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Results from tagging and occasional sightings indicate that during the ice free months they range from Hokkaido and the northern Sea of Japan, eastward through the northern North Pacific and Aleutian Islands to the western Gulf of Alaska, and northward through the Chukchi Sea to the East Siberian Sea, the western Beaufort Sea, and the Arctic Ocean (Moore and Barrowclough 1984, Mizuno <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Boveng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Single Ribbon Seals occasionally occur along the coast of North America and Asia outside of their normal range (Boveng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), and a debilitated vagrant was found on the beach in Morro Bay, California, and taken into captivity (Roest 1964).","Russian commercial hunting of Ribbon Seals began in the Okhotsk Sea in the 1930s and expanded to an annual harvest of 20,000 in the 1950s (Heptner 1996). The annual harvest averaged 11,000 from the 1950s to 1969 and 5,000-6,000 from 1969-1992 (Fedoseev 2002). Commercial hunting began in the Bering Sea in 1961 with an average annual harvest of 9,000 through 1968, declining to 3,000 to 4,000 per year from 1969 to 1992 (Heptner 1996). Reported harvests did not include the number of animals that were killed but lost which may have amounted to 15-20% (Fedoseev 2000). Commercial hunting from sealing vessels stopped in the Bering Sea in 1991 and in the Okhotsk Sea in 1994 because of economic factors, but substantial quotas were still allocated at least through 2005 (Boveng <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Ribbon Seal abundance appears to have declined due to the intensive commercial hunting in the late 1950s and 1960s, but began to rebound after quotas were reduced in 1969 (Burns 1981, Boveng <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/>The number of Ribbon Seals taken by indigenous hunters for subsistence is not well quantified, but harvests are low and almost certainly sustainable (Boveng <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Marine,"Russia stopped large scale commercial harvesting of Ribbon Seals in 1994. Shore-based harvests for subsistence purposes are at very low levels and not likely to be a threat to the population. In the US, Ribbon Seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In 2007, the US National Marine Fisheries Service was petitioned to list the Ribbon Seal as threatened or endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. In 2013 the agency concluded that such a listing was not appropriate at that time (NMFS 2013).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231087,41671,Pagophilus groenlandicus,Least Concern,,2015,2015-06-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its large population size, and the increasing trend in two of three major population groups, the Harp Seal should continue to be classified by IUCN as Least Concern. However, climate change poses a serious threat to this ice-associated species and Harp Seals should be reassessed within a decade. Reductions in pup production and declines in body condition have recently been documented in the Northeast Atlantic breeding groups that are thought to be due to environmental change linked to warmer water and less sea ice.","Harp Seals are medium-sized phocids. Adult males and females are similar in size, about 1.8 m long and weighing about 130 kg. Females reach sexual maturity between four and eight years of age (e.g., Frie <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003), and this has varied considerably over the last century, in part as a consequence of population size that has been largely determined by harvest levels and food availability. Males probably do not participate in breeding until they are somewhat older, though they reach physiological maturity around the same time as females. <br/><br/>Birthing takes place in vast herds from late February to April. There is some variation across the range in the precise timing but herds are highly synchronized (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Pups are born on the open, free-floating, pack ice and nursed for 12 days, during which time they gain weight at about 2.2 kg per day (Kovacs and Lavigne 1985, Kovacs 1987, Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1991, Lydersen and Kovacs 1996). To minimize energy expenditure, most pups are sedentary for the first month; some are so immobile that they melt into the ice beneath them, forming ice “cradles” (Kovacs 1987). Pups are referred to as “whitecoats” because they are born with an insulating coat of white lanugo. Lactating females spend up to 85% of their time in the water, depending on the weather (Lydersen and Kovacs 1993). Towards the end of lactation, females come into oestrus and mate (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Weaned pups remain on the ice for up to six weeks, losing up to 50% of their weight before entering the water to feed. During this post-weaning fast they complete moulting of the lanugo. After this coat is shed, the black and silver-gray pelage is exposed and the juveniles are known as “beaters” until they are about a year old. <br/><br/>Gestation lasts about 11.5 months, including a three to four month period of delayed implantation (Stewart <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1989). The maximum life span of a Harp Seal is approximately 30 years; most animals that reach sexual maturity live to over 20 years. Both males and females are sexually active until the ends of their lives, showing no reproductive senescence (Ronald and Healey 1981). <br/><br/>Harp Seals older than pups undergo a moult in the post-breeding months, from early April to early May (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Harp Seals are highly migratory, and after breeding Canadian Seals follow the pack ice up the coast of Labrador, with small numbers going into Hudson Bay and around Baffin Island, and the rest travelling up both sides of Davis Strait. The Jan Mayen and White Sea groups migrate northward and mix in the Barents Sea (Folkow <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). The Canadian Seals also spend the summer months in the Arctic; their round-trip migration is over 5,000 km long (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). They begin the return trip to their breeding grounds (either the Gulf or the Front) in late autumn. <br/><br/>Harp Seals consume a wide range of prey that varies along their migration routes. Their recorded diet includes 67 species of fish and 70 species of invertebrates (Lavigne 2002). Pups and juveniles take a lot of invertebrate prey, especially Euphausiids (<em>Thyanoessa </em>spp.) and pelagic Amphipods (<em>Parathemisto </em>spp.; Haug <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Nilssen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Adults in Greenland eat pelagic crustaceans, and fish such as Capelin (<em>Mallotus villosus</em>), Sandeel (<em>Ammodytes</em> sp.), Polar Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>) and Arctic Cod (<em>Arctogadus glacialis</em>). Commercial species such as Atlantic Cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>) appear to be of minor importance in the diet (Kapel 2000), largely because Harp Seals of all ages eat relatively small prey and tend to specialize somewhat on polar species such as Polar Cod and Capelin (Lindstrom <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). In the Barents Sea, Harp Seals eat Amphipods, Shrimps and small fish including Polar Cod, Sculpin (<em>Cottidae</em>), Snailfish (<em>Liparidae</em>) and Capelin (Nilssen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995); but they show a clear preference for large Polar Cod (Wathne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, Lindstrom <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The Seals off Newfoundland eat Capelin and Arctic Cod, and off Labrador they eat Arctic Cod and Atlantic Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>). In the Gulf of St Lawrence, the Seals consume Capelin, Herring, Atlantic Cod, Arctic Cod and Redfish (<em>Sebastes </em>sp.; Lawson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). Harp Seals feed heavily in winter and summer and less in spring and autumn. They are a highly social species that travels and forages in groups, yet they maintain a stratification of diet according to age class and depth of the feeding dives. <br/><br/>Harp Seals are relatively shallow divers. Animals satellite-tagged at Jan Mayen stayed close to the edge of the pack ice during the spring moult, usually diving to less than 100 m, but by July tagged Seals in the Barents Sea dove to 400 m. Overall, the deepest dives occurred during the day in winter (Folkow <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004).<br/><br/>Natural predators of Harp Seals include Polar Bears, Killer Whales and Greenland Sharks (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). In Svalbard, 13% of Polar Bear prey is comprised of Harp Seals (Derocher <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002).","As noted earlier, Harp Seals have been harvested for thousands of years but currently the population is large and the number of animals harvested is declining.<br/><br/>Reduced availability of potential prey, especially Polar Cod, Capelin and Herring, is a threat to Harp Seals. Several Harp Seal “invasions” took place in recent decades along the north coast of Norway. By-catch mortality in nets during those events was estimated to be as high as 100,000 animals in 1987 and 21,474 in 1988 (Haug <em>et al.</em> 1991). The reason for these emigrations out of their normal range within the Barents and Greenland Seas seems to have been a collapse of Herring and Capelin stocks due to a combination of overfishing and shifting oceanographic conditions (low temperatures and salinity, and extensive ice cover; Haug <em>et al.</em> 1991, Woodley and Lavigne 1991). More recently, declining Krill abundance has been correlated with declines in both pup production and body condition of Harp Seals in the Barents Sea region, which are likely related to reductions in sea ice in this area (Øigård <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>A small tourist industry that visits the whelping patches in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is not thought to pose any risk to the Seals; it uses a rotational mode of operation such that individual Seals are not visited repeatedly (Kovacs and Innes 1990). <br/><br/>Oil spills in the Northwest Atlantic off the east coast of Canada remain a threat to Seals. There is a concern about the impacts of tanker traffic, particularly in places like Lancaster Sound in the eastern Canadian Arctic, which is an important Harp Seal summering area (Reijinders <em>et al.</em> 1993). The discharge from a ruptured tank on the shore of New Brunswick, Canada in March–April 1969 led to 10,000 to 15,000 Seals being heavily coated with oil. The high number of dead pups washing ashore after this event was evidence of the lethal effects of the oil (St. Aubin 1990). Oil development in the Barents Sea is ongoing and poses a future threat to Harp Seals in the White Sea and West Ice stocks. <br/><br/>Harp Seals have been found to carry significant loads of contaminants including metals, DDT and PCBs (Ronald <em>et al.</em> 1984ab). Organochlorines are still present in their blood, despite DDT levels in the environment (and PCBs to a lesser extent) declining from the early 1970s to the 1980s (Addison <em>et al.</em> 1984) and further in the 1990s and 2000s (Muir and de Wit 2010). <br/><br/>Phocine distemper virus (PDV) was first found in Harp Seals from the West Ice off Jan Mayen in 1987 and 1989. It is widespread in Harp Seals, but only shows up as antibodies; it is not known if there are significant health effects or mortality from PDV infection in this species (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 1993, Duignan <em>et al.</em> 1997). Harp Seals might have been the carriers responsible for the Harbour Seal PDV epidemic in Europe in 1988 (Markussen and Have 1992). PDV also appeared Harp Seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1991, but not in epidemic proportions (Daoust <em>et al.</em> 1993). <br/><br/>Global climate warming is of notable concern for this species. There have already been major reductions in the extent and seasonal duration of sea ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008,&#160;Laidre&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Pinnipeds such as the Harp Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting and resting are likely to be heavily impacted by future changes in their sea ice habitats (Johnston <em>et al.</em> 2005, Friedlaender <em>et al.</em> 2007, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011,&#160;Kovacs&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). The high variability in pup production numbers in Canada, as well as the condition declines in the Northeast Atlantic, are thought to be linked to changing oceanographic and sea ice conditions. The degree of plasticity Harp Seals might show with respect to temporal or spatial shifts in breeding times and areas is not known.","The Harp Seal is the most abundant pinniped species in the northern hemisphere. Globally this species numbers close to nine million animals with an annual pup production for all breeding sites combined of approximately 1.2 million (ICES 2013, Hammill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The Northwest Atlantic stock is estimated to number close to 7.5 million (Hammill <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). This stock is thought to be relatively stable, showing little change between the 2004 and 2012 surveys, although pup production has become highly variable with extremely high pup mortality in some recent years. This is a marked recovery from an estimated low of around 1.8 million in the early 1970s, which was a result of overharvesting (Sergeant 1976). Over the period of recovery, catch levels have been increased such that they likely approached potential biological removal levels by the late 1990s (see Johnston <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2000). The current quota of 400,000 is likely not sustainable, but this is not a concern because the combined Greenlandic and Canadian harvest average only about half of this number. <br/><br/>The breeding group in the West Ice near Jan Mayen (often referred to as the Greenland Sea population) was estimated to be 296,000 in 1994; this population increased to approximately 348,000 by 2003 and in 2013 was estimated to be 627,000 (ICES 2013, Øigård <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). The quota is approximately 20,000 animals, but an average take in the hunt in recent years is about 6,000 (ICES 2013). <br/><br/>The White Sea breeding group was estimated to be 1.8 million animals when surveyed in 2000 (Potelov <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003). An estimate produced in 2013 using data from several pup counts done between 1998 and 2010 suggested that the population had dropped to 1.4 million, most likely due to reduced pup production (ICES 2013). Hunting in recent years in the White Sea has been extremely limited (annual takes of zero to 200 animals); harvesting of pups less than one year of age was banned in Russia in 2009. Norwegian harvests of this population during summer when they are in the Barents Sea have also been very small in recent years, with no hunt at all in 2013 (ICES 2013).<br/><br/>A new Harp Seal whelping patch was found near South Greenland in 2007 (Rosing-Asvid 2008). The source of these animals and the inter-annual stability of this group are not known. This finding was particularly interesting in light of the fact that the Greenlandic harvest of this species has increased from about 1,500 per year in the 1970s up to approximately 100,000 in the year 2000, and has remained at an average of around 85,000 since then (DFO 2012).",Increasing,"Harp Seals are widespread in the North Atlantic and the adjacent Arctic Ocean and shelf seas. Their range extends from a western extreme in northern Hudson Bay and the Foxe Basin, Baffin Island and the Davis Strait, eastward through the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Newfoundland region in the western North Atlantic, along the southwest and south coasts of Greenland, continuing east to Iceland and from there to northern Norway and the White, Barents and Kara Seas. The northern limit in the eastern North Atlantic is at least to Franz Joseph Land and Svalbard; in some years Harp Seals may range northward to between 82° and 85° north, depending on ice conditions (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Rice 1998, Lavigne 2002). <br/><br/>The southern limit of Harp Seal distribution off North America shifts southeast in some years to the Gulf of Maine and Sable Island where large numbers of animals have been recorded at times since the mid-1990s (Lacoste and Stenson 2000, Harris <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002, Lucas and Daoust 2002). Harp Seals often occur as vagrants outside this range, south to Virginia in the United States (Scheffer 1958, Rice 1998). Similarly in Europe, Harp Seals occasionally reach the United Kingdom (Ronald and Healy 1981), the Faroe Islands, Denmark, Germany, France and even Spain (van Bree 1997, Bloch <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000).<br/><br/>Prehistorically, Harp Seals occurred in the Baltic Sea. Genetic drift, interspecific completion and overhunting by humans are all factors that are likely to have contributed to their extinction in that region (Stora and Ericson 2004).","Harp Seals have been harvested for thousands of years by indigenous peoples of the Atlantic Arctic, including coastal Northern Europeans (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). Basques whalers began taking Harp Seals in the 1500s. By the mid-1600s, French settlers developed land-based netting techniques on the St. Lawrence River. French-Canadians exported 500 tons of oil per year by the mid-1700s, obtained from an estimated take of 6,000 Harp Seals per year. In Newfoundland, English settlers hunted Harp Seals on a larger scale that accounted for an estimated average take of 7,000-12,800 Seals per year for most of the 1700s. By the 1800s, schooner-based sealing developed and the number of Seals harvested rose dramatically; from 1803-1816 the average annual take was 117,000. The peak of sealing in the Northwest Atlantic occurred between 1818 and 1862, when 500,000 Seals were harvested in many years, with maximum yearly takes between 640,000 and 740,000. During that time, it is estimated that 18.3 million Harp Seals, mostly whitecoats, were killed for oil. The records show somewhat lower figures for the Northeast Atlantic. At Jan Mayen, the catch began falling in the late 1850s; the drop in catch was likely attributable to over-harvesting. From 1860 to 1900, an estimated 12.8 million Seals were harvested from the West Ice.<br/><br/>During the 20th century Harp Seals became more valued for their pelts than their oil. In 1917, 143,000 Seals were taken. The catch dropped for a time, then escalated in the 1950s, when it averaged 312,000 Seals per year. In 1960, Canada became concerned about the large numbers of adults being killed, so it placed limits on the length of the hunting season. During the 1960s, an average of 284,000 Seals were taken per year from the Northwest Atlantic stock. In the mid 1960s, adult females became protected on the breeding grounds, and Norway was excluded from sealing in Canadian waters. In 1971 a quota management program was established; from 1970 to 1987 quotas varied from 127,000 per year to 245,000 per year, but the actual harvest was often much lower than the quota (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). In 1983, the European Economic Community imposed an import ban on all whitecoat products and the average annual harvest in Canadian waters fell to 52,000 Seals from 1983-1995. By 1987, Canada banned the killing of whitecoats and the focus of the hunt switched to beaters (post-weaning to 13 months of age; DFO 2006a). From 1999-2003, the estimated annual mortality of Harp Seals in the Northwest Atlantic was 453,962, broken down into an average of 232,915 taken in the commercial harvest by Canada, 83,000 taken from 1999-2002 in Greenland, and approximately 5,000 taken in the Canadian High Arctic, plus a by-catch of close to 20,000 in the Newfoundland Lumpfish fishery, plus an average annual struck and loss rate of 119,430 from all harvests (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>The Canadian harvest increased with the combined three-year quota (“Total Allowable Catch”) introduced for the period 2003-2005 set at 975,000 (DFO 2005). Given the age structure of the current hunt, this quota would not be sustainable (see Johnston <em>et al.</em> 2000). The current quota is 400,000, but the number taken in the hunt is much less (see above). In addition to Canada’s commercial harvest, some Harp Seals are taken in subsistence hunts in Labrador, Newfoundland, northern Quebec and in Nunavut, as well as in Greenland. In Canada, aboriginal peoples and non-aboriginal coastal residents who reside north of latitude 53 degrees can hunt Seals for subsistence purposes without a permit (DFO 2006b).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, Norway established a commercial hunt in 1846, which peaked in the 1870s-1880s when annual catches ranged from 50,000 to 120,000 animals. In the 20th century, annual harvests increased to an average of more than 100,000 per year, with the maximum in the 1920s and 1930s when the catches were 200,000-300,000 per year. In 1989, Norway banned the killing of whitecoats (N-RFC 2005) and harvests in the last few decades have been small compared to historical numbers. Russia also banned the killing of white-coats in 2009 and the White Sea hunt has been almost negligible since that time.<br/><br/>The numbers of Harp Seals struck-and-lost in the both the current commercial hunts (which focus largely on one plus animals) and in subsistence hunting is high, and most harvest estimates do not account for this additional mortality (see Lavigne 1999). The struck and loss rate for Harp Seals in Greenland could be as high as 50% (Sjare and Stenson 2002).",Marine,"<p>Canada has in place sealing regulations pursuant to the 1993 Marine Mammal Regulations that require annual quotas, referred to as “Total Allowable Catches” hunting licenses, and official observers of the commercial Harp Seal hunt (DFO 2005). In the northeast Atlantic, quotas for sealing are based on recommendations made by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO). Russia is responsible for managing Harp Seals in the southeast part of the Barents Sea, while Norway is responsible for managing stocks in the Greenland Sea near Jan Mayen (N-RFC 2005, NMFCA 2006). However, these harvest control mechanisms are no longer particularly influential given the declining interest in Seal harvesting by commercial operators.</p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231341,41672,Pusa hispida,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"As a species, Ringed Seals are widely distributed in ice-covered waters of the northern hemisphere, and they may presently number about three million animals. Some of the subspecies, however, have restricted distributions and exist in much smaller numbers. With climatic warming, all subspecies will be negatively impacted by continuing decreases of ice habitats critical for their reproduction. Nevertheless, at this time Ringed Seals as a species do not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing, and are listed as Least Concern. Subspecies <em>Pusa hispida ladogensis</em>, the Ladoga Seal, is assessed separately as Vulnerable and subspecies <em>P. h. saimensis</em>, the Saimaa Seal, is assessed as Endangered.","Ringed Seals are in many respects the “classic” ice-seal. Throughout most of their range they use sea ice exclusively as their breeding, molting, and resting (haul-out) habitat, rarely if ever moving onto land (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Their ability to create and maintain breathing holes in ice using the well-developed claws on their fore-flippers allows them to thrive in areas where even other ice-associated seals cannot reside. Although Ringed Seals are quite small they deal with the thermal challenges posed by the arctic winter by having a very thick blubber layer, and by building lairs (small caves) in the snow on top of sea ice during the winter. The lairs are particularly important for neonatal survival (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Ringed Seals also use natural cracks along pressure ridges and leads in the sea ice for surfacing and breathing. In Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa, the Baltic Sea, the White Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk, Ringed Seals haul out and pup on ice but rest on shore during the ice-free period (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kelly <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Reported mean age at sexual maturity for female Ringed Seals varies in the literature from 3.5 to 7.1 years (Holst and Stirling 2002, Krafft <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Males likely do not participate in breeding before they are 8-10 years old. Body sizes vary considerably between regions (Frost and Lowry 1981, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Ringed seals are long lived, with ages close to 50 reported (Lydersen and Gjertz 1987). Regional productivity rates are variable; reproductive success depends on many factors including prey availability, the relative stability of the ice, and sufficient snow accumulation prior to the commencement of breeding (Lukin 1980, Smith 1987, Lydersen 1995). <br/><br/>A single pup is born in late February-early March for the Ladoga, Saimaa, and Baltic subspecies (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998) and March-May for the others (Frost and Lowry 1981). Most births occur in subnivean lairs excavated in snow that accumulates near ice ridges or shorelines. Lairs provide thermal protection against cold air temperatures and high wind chill and afford at least some protection from predators (Smith 1976, Smith and Stirling 1975, Gjertz and Lydersen 1986). For Arctic Ringed Seals, lactation lasts an average of 39 days and pups are weaned at approximately 20 kg (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999). Females become receptive for mating towards the end of the lactation period, similar to other phocid seals. <br/><br/>Ringed Seals molt from mid-May to mid-July and during that period they spend quite a bit of time hauled out (Reeves 1998). Feeding intensity is at a minimum during molting (Ryg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). <br/><br/>Although they may dive to more than 500 m (Born <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), in many areas where they feed the water is not that deep and dives are correspondingly shallower (Gjertz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).<br/><br/>Outside the breeding and molting seasons, Ringed Seal distribution is correlated with food availability (e.g., Simpkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Freitas <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Numerous studies of their diet have been conducted, and although there is considerable regional variation several patterns emerge. Most Ringed Seal prey are small, and preferred prey tend to be schooling species that form dense aggregations. Fishes are usually in the 5-10 cm length range and crustacean prey in the 2-6 cm range. Typically, a variety of 10-15 prey species are found, with no more than 2-4 dominant prey species for any given area. Fishes are generally more commonly eaten than invertebrates, but diet is determined to some extent by availability of various types of prey during particular seasons as well as by preference, which in part is influenced by energy content of various available prey (Reeves 1998, Wathne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). Commonly eaten prey include Polar Cod, Arctic Cod, Saffron Cod, Redfish, Herring, and Capelin in marine waters (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Labansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), and Smelt, Vendance, Perch, Roach, Stickleback, and Burbot in lakes (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Invertebrate prey species seem to become more important in the open-water season and often dominate the diet of young animals (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Large Amphipods, Krill, Mysids, Shrimps, and Cephalopods are all eaten by Ringed Seals and can be very important in some regions at least seasonally (Agafonova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most important predator of Arctic Ringed Seals in most parts of their range and they are also eaten by Killer Whales and Walruses. Wolves, Wolverines, Foxes, Gulls, and Ravens may also prey on Ringed Seals, especially pups, in other areas (Reeves 1998).","Ringed Seals carry loads of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants from industry and agriculture that have been implicated in uterine pathology in Baltic Seals (Bergman and Olsson 1986), and high concentrations of mercury in Saimaa Seals is thought to have reduced pup production in the 1960s and 1970s (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). However, following restrictions on the use and release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment, contaminant levels are dropping rapidly in the Baltic (Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). The same is true with regards to POPs in Arctic populations (Wolkers <em>et al</em>. 2008). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to Ringed Seals. The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season or if food resources were negatively affected (Smith 1987, Reeves 1998).<br/><br/>Manipulation of water levels, recreational snow machine operation, net-fishing, boating, tourism, and development of cottages on the shoreline have been noted as threats to the Ringed Seals in Lake Saimaa, and industrial pollution, net fishing and poaching, as well as disturbance of on-shore summer haulout groups have been highlighted as threats for the Ladoga Seals (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007). Predation by Red Fox, Wolves, feral and domestic Dogs, and even birds of prey, are also risks for these lake Seals (e.g., Kunnasranta <em>et al</em>. 2001). By-catch in fisheries and other negative impacts associated with fisheries conflicts seem at present to be the major threat to Saimaa and Ladoga Seals (Kokko <em>et al</em>. 1998, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Verevkin 2002, Sipilä 2003, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Global warming may pose the greatest threat to Ringed Seals of all subspecies if it leads to large losses of the stable ice habitat required for pupping and rearing their young (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). Early break-up of the ice results in poor condition of pups and higher mortality rates (Smith and Harwood 2001). Associated changes in precipitation and weather patterns could also negatively affect Ringed Seal populations if there is insufficient snow cover to protect pups in lairs in the spring (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Ferguson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Hezel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Iacozza and Ferguson 2014). Pups born outside lairs have a very low chance of survival; the pups are so small that even large Gulls can be predators if they are exposed (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Declining trends in reproduction and survival of pups have already been noted in some regions that have been attributed to earlier break-up of the sea ice over recent decades and concomitant changes in the marine ecosystem (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stirling 2005). Reductions in arctic sea ice could have quite dramatic effects via prey availability if Polar and Arctic Cod populations are negatively impacted.<br/><br/>  Reductions in sea ice cover will likely lead to increased human activity in arctic regions in the form of shipping and resource extraction industries, with associated increased threat of marine accidents and pollution discharge (Pagnan 2000). An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Ringed Seals, to abandon areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997) although studies to date suggest relatively minor impacts of development (Davis&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1991; Moulton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, 2003, 2005; Blackwell&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2004). However, over-flights by aircraft certainly cause disturbance to Ringed Seals if flights occur by helicopter at less than 1,500 m distance or by fixed-winged aircraft at closer than 500 m (Born&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1999).","Available data on Ringed Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>&#160;Arctic Ringed Seal--1,450,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Okhotsk Ringed Seal--44,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Baltic Ringed Seal--11,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Ladoga Seal--3,000-4,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Saimaa Seal--135-190, trend increasing<br/></li></ul>The world-wide population size of Ringed Seals is not accurately known. Some recent survey data are available from parts of their range (see subspecies assessments), but for the Arctic and Okhotsk subspecies data are limited in spatial scope. Citing many factors such as the vast geographic area occupied by the species, its highly variable distribution within areas that have been surveyed, the unknown relationship between the numbers of individuals observed versus those not seen, and other factors, Frost and Lowry (1981) stated that it is “unwise to attempt an estimate of the world population of this subspecies”. Despite numerous surveys at specific locales conducted since then, Reeves (1998) believed that “this conclusion remains appropriate.”<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the figures presented above indicate the number of mature individuals is more than 1.5 million, and the total population size is likely more than 3 million.",Unknown,"Ringed Seals have a circumpolar distribution throughout the Arctic Basin including records of individuals near the North Pole (Rice 1998). Ringed Seals also range widely into adjacent seas being found in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, and Greenland, Barents, White, Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian Seas, and they occasionally range into some lake and river systems in Northern Canada (Heide-Jørgensen and Lydersen 1998). Separate subspecies occur in the Baltic Sea, Lake Ladoga in the Russian Federation, Lake Saimaa in Finland, and the Sea of Okhotsk (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Extralimital records for Ringed Seals extend far south on both sides of the Atlantic, to New Jersey USA in the west and Portugal in the east. In the Pacific, vagrants have been recorded south to the Zhejiang in China and southern California&#160;USA (Rice 1998).","Humans have hunted Ringed Seals in the Arctic since the arrival of people to the region millennia ago (e.g., Murdoch 1893, Riewe and Amsden 1979). They are a fundamental subsistence food item for most coastal dwelling northern indigenous peoples. Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1998) reported a combined estimate of 10,000 taken per year from the Bering, Chukchi, and western Beaufort Seas by Russians and Alaska Natives. They also estimated that the annual removal of Ringed Seals in the Canadian Arctic was in the “high tens of thousands”, and that in the 1980s, including animals killed and lost, the harvest was between 60,000 and 80,000, and may have exceeded 100,000 in some years. Another substantial annual harvest occurs in Greenland with nearly 100,000 taken per year in the 1970s and approximately 70,000 taken annually in the early1990s (Teilmann and Kapel 1998).<br/><br/>Commercial harvests of Ringed Seals in the early to mid-20th century were sometimes large and probably had significant local impacts on the respective populations. Harvest statistics reported for western Russia by Belikov and Boltunov (1998) suggest that maximum catches earlier in the 20th century exceeded the total allowable catches (TACs) significantly, with harvests of up to 8,900 in the White Sea (1912), 13,200 in the Russian Barents Sea (1962), and 13,200 in the Kara Sea (1933). Those harvests are thought to have dropped considerably in recent decades, though there are no available data. Reporting of harvest statistics and enforcement of TACs is difficult to manage in outlying areas, and the harvest of Ringed Seals in eastern Russia is largely unknown.<br/><br/>Although Ringed Seals in the Baltic and Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa were hunted in the past, hunting is no longer allowed (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Ringed Seals are protected by a variety of laws and quotas in different parts of their range, but even within Europe the legal provisions are not always being fully implemented in domestic law (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001). The population in Lake Saimaa has been protected since 1955, and additional protection has been afforded via the establishment of two national parks within the lake, and regulation of shoreline development. Similarly, the hunting of Seals in Lake Ladoga was prohibited in 1980 (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). In the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 allows Ringed Seals to be harvested only by Alaskan Native hunters for subsistence purposes, and that Act generally prohibits all other forms of taking except where specifically permitted. In 2012, the Arctic, Okhotsk, and Baltic subspecies were listed as threatened, and the Ladoga subspecies was listed as endangered, under the US Endangered Species Act; the Saimaa subspecies was listed as endangered in 1993. <a name=""_GoBack""></a>State Nature Reserves at Franz Josef Land and in the White and Kara seas protect large areas of Ringed Seal habitat in the western Russian Arctic, and quotas and licensing of hunting have been in place in various parts of the Russian Federation for decades (Belikov and Boltunov 1998). Baltic Ringed Seals were protected from all killing by the Soviet Union in 1980, by Sweden in 1986, and by Finland in 1988 (Härkönen <em>et al</em>. 1998).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50347659,2467,Balaena mysticetus,Least Concern,,2018,2018-01-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The global (pan-arctic) population of the Bowhead Whale appears to be increasing, due primarily to the well-documented increase in the large Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation (also known as the Western Arctic population or stock). The global population size, at over 25,000 animals, is well above the IUCN Red List Vulnerable threshold for a non-declining population. The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation (estimated to be over 16,000 and increasing at 3% per year or more) may have recovered to near or even above its level prior to commercial whaling. The East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation is estimated to exceed 4,000, and has probably been increasing but is still below its pre-whaling level. Bowhead Whale numbers in the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation remain at a small fraction of pre-whaling abundance with no estimate of trend. The main reduction in the global population occurred before the three-generation time window that would trigger the Red List population reduction (A) criterion. The East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea and Okhotsk Sea  subpopulations have separate Red List assessments, in addition to being included in this global assessment.</p>  <p>  </p>","Small to medium-sized crustaceans, especially krill and copepods, form the bulk of the Bowhead Whale diet (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2004, Pomerleau <em>et al</em>. 2011). Bowheads also commonly feed on mysids and gammarid amphipods, and the diet includes at least 60 species (Lowry 1993).<br/><br/>The seasonal distribution of Bowhead Whales is strongly influenced by prey availability and pack ice conditions (Moore and Reeves 1993). During the winter, they occur within areas of sea ice (Stafford <em>et al.</em> 2012) and appear to feed mainly near the bottom (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). During the spring, they use leads and cracks in the ice to penetrate areas that were inaccessible during the winter due to heavy ice coverage. During the summer and autumn, they concentrate in areas where zooplankton production is high or where large-scale biophysical processes create local concentrations of calanoid copepods (Finley 1990, Finley <em>et al</em>. 2000) and appear to feed mainly in mid-water and near the surface (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Pacific Arctic, six feeding hotspots have been identified including two in the Bering Sea and one in the Chukchi Sea along the northern coast of Chukotka where there is evidence of winter feeding, and three in the Beaufort Sea where most of the feeding occurs in summer and autumn (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The Bowhead Whale may be the longest-living mammal, possibly capable of living for over 200 years (George <em>et al.</em> 1999, Keane <em>et al. </em>2015, Wetzel <em>et al.</em> 2017). Nearly all life history data come from the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas population. Female age at sexual maturity is estimated at 18-33 years (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2013). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated the mean generation time for Bowhead Whales to be about 52 years, assuming an age at first reproduction of 20 years. Females give birth every 3-7 years (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 1992) and calves are weaned at 9-12 months of age (Koski <em>et al. </em>1993).<p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Extensive commercial hunting, beginning in the 1500s, depleted Bowhead Whales throughout their range. Commercial whaling for the species has been prohibited under international conventions since the 1930s. The limited subsistence whaling by indigenous communities  mentioned above has not impeded the recovery of the affected populations.</p><p>Accidental human-caused deaths are relatively few. During 2010-15, two dead-stranded and one live Bowhead were observed to be entangled with fishing gear but it was unclear whether the entanglement was the cause of death. Of the Bowhead Whales taken in Alaskan hunts during 1990-2012, 12% showed scars or wounds from fishing gear and 2% showed scars or wounds from ship strikes (George <em>et al.</em> 2017a).</p>  <p>There has been concern since the 1970s that disturbance from oil and gas exploration and extraction activities in the Arctic region would affect Bowhead Whales. Effects on diving behavior (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2013) and calling rates (Blackwell <em>et al.</em> 2015) in the vicinity of seismic surveys have been observed, but to date there has been no discernible population-level impact. Examination of whales taken in subsistence hunts off Alaska since 1980 found relatively low levels of morbidity, which would be consistent with an increasing population and good individual animal health (George <em>et al</em>. 2017b).</p>  <p>During this century, a profound reduction in the extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic has occurred and this reduction is predicted to continue, possibly leading eventually to the complete disappearance of sea ice in summer as mean Arctic temperatures rise faster than the global average (Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The short-term effects of reduced ice cover on Bowhead Whales in the western Arctic appear to be positive, due to increased feeding opportunities (George <em>et al</em>. 2015, Moore 2016). However, the long-term effects are less clear. The emergence of Bowheads as a separate, ice-adapted species may have coincided with the appearance of sea ice in the late Pliocene, and Bowheads could lose out to non-ice-adapted species in the long term, but no projections of the time scale of such an eventuality are available (Harington 2008, IWC 2016).&#160; </p>  <p>There is also concern that, as the sea ice diminishes, the opening up of the Arctic to increased vessel traffic, fishing activities, and extractive industries will increase human-caused impacts on Bowhead Whales (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014).&#160; </p>","<em><strong>Current Population sizes</strong></em><br/>The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation is estimated to have numbered 16,900 (15,700-18,900) in 2011 from shore/ice-based counts (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2016) or&#160;19,000 (12,400-28,500) from photo-identification capture-recapture (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160; Numbers in the East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation are estimated at 4,000-10,500 in 2013 from aerial surveys (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al.</em> 2015) or 4,500-11,000 in 2008-12 from genetic mark-recapture (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Given the increasing trend in the large Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation, the total range-wide population likely exceeds 25,000 individuals. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation is estimated to be only about 200, and the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation probably also numbers in the hundreds (see separate listings).<strong><em><br/> <br/> <strong>Population trends<br/></strong></em></strong>The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation has been monitored for more than 30 years and has been increasing over that period at an estimated annual rate of 3.7% (range 2.8–5.4%) in the presence of subsistence hunting (Givens <em>et al. </em>2016). The East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation has probably also been increasing. Based on aerial surveys and genetic capture-recapture, Rekdal <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that the number of Bowhead Whales using West Greenland waters in the winter-spring period increased from 1998 to 2006 and has levelled off since then. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation may be declining (Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2017). No estimates of trend are available for the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation.<strong><em><br/><br/>Pre-whaling population sizes</em></strong><em></em><br/>Commercial whaling for Bowhead Whales in the Bering Sea began in 1848 and expanded rapidly, depleting the worldwide population (Bockstoce and Burns 1993). Brandon and Wade (2006) estimated the initial abundance of the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation at 10–20,000. Using a different kind of population model, Witting (2013) estimated pre-whaling abundance to be 13-24,000. Therefore, the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation appears to have reached or exceeded estimates of its size prior to commercial whaling. All models indicate that the population reached a minimum size around 1914.<br/><br/>Basque whalers took Bowhead Whales in the northwestern Atlantic in the 16th century, but ambiguities over the species identity of whales taken in early commercial whaling have made interpretation of old catch records difficult. Genetic analysis of bones from 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century shore stations in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St Lawrence found that, contrary to previous assumptions, almost all bones were from Bowhead Whales rather than North Atlantic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena glacialis</em>) (Macleod <em>et al.</em> 2008). This suggests that 25-40,000 Bowhead Whales were taken in the eastern Canadian Arctic by Basque whalers during 1530-1610, followed by approximately 28,000 during the pelagic whaling phase during 1719-1915 (Ross, 1993).<br/><br/>The pre-whaling size of the East Canada – West Greenland population was thus probably at least 25,000, well above the likely current level.The pre-whaling size of the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea population has been estimated to be 33,000-65,000 using a simple population model (Allen and Keay 2006) applied to historical catch data from Dutch, German, and British sources compiled by de Jong (1983). The current population size, therefore, is a small fraction of the pre-whaling size.  The pre-whaling population size in the Okhtosk Sea has been variously estimated as between 3,000 and 20,000 depending on assumptions about past catches (Ivashchenko and Clapham 2010). The current population size is a small fraction of those estimates.",Increasing,"<p>Bowhead Whales are found only in Arctic and subarctic regions. Until recently they have spent much of their lives in and near sea ice and they migrate seasonally to avoid ice entrapment and to take advantage of food concentrations (Moore and Reeves 1993). With the reduction of sea ice cover, Bowhead Whales now occur increasingly in open water during the summer (Moore 2016).<br/> <br/> The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has traditionally recognized five stocks named for the regions in which Bowheads occur: Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas; Hudson Bay – Foxe Basin; Davis Strait – Baffin Bay; Svalbard – Barents Sea (Spitsbergen); and Okhotsk Sea (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 2003). Movements of tagged Bowheads indicating somewhat overlapping ranges, and lack of clear genetic differences, has discredited the traditional distinction between the Hudson Bay – Foxe Basin and the Davis Strait – Baffin Bay populations (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2006, Postma <em>et al.</em> 2006, Alter <em>et al.</em> 2012, IWC 2012). Four main subpopulations are now recognized: Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas; East Canada – West Greenland; East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea; and Okhotsk Sea. The boundary between the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas and Eastern Canada – West Greenland subpopulations is liable to become more porous as sea ice cover diminishes (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>With the exception of the Okhotsk Sea, genetic divergence between Bowhead Whales in different parts of their range appears to be low, and there is some evidence of movement between the main areas of occurrence (IWC 2013). The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation appears to be genetically and geographically isolated.</p>  <p>Based on direct observations and telemetry, the summer range of the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation extends from Chaunskaya Guba (Russian Federation) in the western Chukchi Sea through the Beaufort Sea and east to Amundsen Gulf (Canada) and Viscount Melville Sound (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Most of the whales appear to migrate into the Bering Sea in winter (IWC 2013, Quakenbush <em>et al.</em> 2012, Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, substantial catches were also taken in summer in the Bering Sea,&#160;but the climatic conditions were quite different then than at the present (IWC 2013) </p>  <p>Bowhead Whales belonging to the East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation are observed in Hudson Bay, Foxe Basin, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, Gulf of Boothia, Prince Regent Inlet, and other waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Tracking of satellite-tagged whales has confirmed movements from Foxe Basin through Fury and Hecla Strait into the Gulf of Boothia and Prince Regent Inlet, and from Cumberland Sound into Prince Regent Inlet, Gulf of Boothia, Foxe Basin, and Hudson Strait, while animals tagged in West Greenland moved to Prince Regent Inlet and Hudson Strait (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2012). The whales move out of the summering areas as ice forms in autumn to wintering areas in polynyas (Holst and Stirling 1999), unconsolidated pack ice, and open water near the ice edge off West Greenland (Reeves and Heide-Jørgensen 1996) and eastern Baffin Island. Sightings and strandings have occurred in recent years in the western North Atlantic as far south as Newfoundland (Ledwell <em>et al.</em> 2007) and the Gulf of Maine (Accardo <em>et al.</em> in press).</p>  The East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation occurs from the east coast of Greenland across the Greenland Sea, including the Northeast Water polynya off northeastern Greenland, in the Barents Sea, in the Franz Josef Land Archipelago, and in the Kara Sea at least as far as far as Severnaya Zemlya. There have also been sightings further south, exceptionally reaching Iceland and the coast of Finnmark. Vagrants have been observed as far south as the western British Isles and France (de Boer <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation occurs in the northern and western Sea of Okhotsk from Shantarskiye Zaliv east to Zaliv Shelikova, Gizhiginskaya Guba, and Penzhinskaya Guba (Moore and Reeves 1993,&#160;Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is no evidence of migration into or out of the Okhotsk Sea.","<p></p><p></p><p>Limited subsistence whaling on the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation by indigenous people of Alaska and Chukotka is permitted by the IWC on the basis of advice from its Scientific Committee (under its aboriginal subsistence whaling management procedure). Small&#160;hunts are also authorized in Canadian waters under co-management agreements between federal agencies and indigenous communities, and in West Greenland under the IWC management procedure. The reported average annual take in Alaska and Chukotka during 2006-15 was about 55 animals struck of which about 75% were successfully landed (Allison 2017, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>",Marine,"<p>Bowhead Whales were legally protected from commercial whaling under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) since its entry into force in 1948, and by its predecessor the Convention on the Regulation of Whaling since the 1930s. All range states except Canada are parties to the ICRW. Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling of Bowhead Whales is allowed by the IWC (the regulatory body established under the ICRW) from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock and off West Greenland on the basis of scientific advice (see <em>Threats</em> section). Hunting by indigenous people in Canada is co-managed by the federal government and regional bodies created under land-claim agreements. The Bowhead Whale has been included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Appendix I since 1975 and it is listed on the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals Appendix I. Bowhead Whales are managed under national threatened species legislation in the U.S.A., Canada, and the Russian Federation.</p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

While declines occurred in some regions in the past due to overexploitation, it can be assumed that the population has not been reduced by more than 50% relative to three generations ago (Red List criterion A1 for Vulnerable), given that the estimated catches, including net catches, taken during 1951-2017 (three generations of 22 years) sum to less than 180,000. The models used by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee to assess the populations predict that the population has been recovering in the North Atlantic and is still declining in the western North Pacific, but work is underway to compare these predictions with recent empirical data. The Common Minke Whale is listed as Least Concern.<br/></p>  <p></p>","<p>The Common Minke Whale occurs in both coastal and offshore waters and exploits a variety of prey species in different areas according to availability.<br/><br/>In the North Atlantic, studies in Icelandic shelf waters showed a decrease during in 2003-07 in Sandeels (Ammodytidae), krill (Euphausiacea) and Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) relative to previous years, and a corresponding increase in Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>) and Haddock (<em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</em>). I<span lang=""EN-GB"">n Norwegian waters in 2000-2004, krill dominated the diet near Svalbard, while Capelin dominated the diet around Bear Island and contributed considerably to the diet along the coast of northern Norway, along with Herring and Haddock. The diet in the Norwegian Sea consisted of mainly of Herring, while the diet in the North Sea was dominated by Sandeels and Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>) (Windsland <em>et al</em>. 2007). Minke Whales caught off Newfoundland during 1966-72 contained mainly Capelin (Mitchell 1974).<br/><br/>In the offshore northwestern Pacific, the diet during 1996-2014 consisted mainly of Japanese Anchovy (<em>Engraulis japonicus</em>), Pacific Saury (<em>Cololabis saira</em>), and Walleye Pollock <em>(Gadus chalcogrammus</em>). Krill (<em>Euphausia pacifica</em>) and squid (Tamura <em>et al</em>. 2016a). In some of the Japanese coastal areas, Pacific Sandlance (<em>Ammodytes personatus</em>) is also important (Tamura <em>et al</em>. 2016b). In the Okhotsk Sea the diet was dominated by krill (Lindstrøm <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>Feeding habits of the Dwarf Minke Whale are poorly known. The stomach contents of an individual bycaught in Brazil contained exclusively krill (<em>Euphausia similis</em>) (Secchi <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>All Minke Whales are subject to predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>), and tend to flee at high speed to evade them (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Minke Whales' apparently dispersed distribution outside the summer feeding season may be an adaptation to Killer Whale predation pressure (Ford and Reeves 2008).<br/><br/>With the exception of the Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea – East China Sea population, conception and birth in Common Minke Whales is believed to occur in winter. Most animals occur singly, and few in groups of more than two. The reproductive cycle of the Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea – East China Sea stock (the J stock) appears to be four months out of phase with other North Pacific Minke Whales, with conceptions occurring in October-November instead of February-March for the Okhotsk Sea – West Pacific population (Omura and Sakiura 1956, Kato 1992). This is the only known case of breeding asynchrony in baleen whale populations from the same hemisphere.<br/><br/> Methods of age determination have been developed only recently for this species (Maeda <em>et al</em>. 2018) and a direct estimate of generation time is not yet available. The limited number of individual age estimates obtained to date (Maeda <em>et al</em>. 2017) is consistent with a female age at first reproduction of 8 years as estimated from inter-specific comparisons by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007). Hence, the Taylor <em>et al</em>. generation time estimate of 22 years is plausible. </p>","<p>Whaling on Common Minke Whales was intensive in the northeastern Atlantic especially during 1940-83, when it reduced the population by about half (IWC 2018a). Commercial catches were phased out during 1984-87, but resumed at a reduced level in Norwegian waters in 1992 and in Icelandic waters in 2002, initially under scientific permits (IWC 2018c). The IWC Scientific Committee has approved in principle catch levels for North Atlantic Minke Whales according to its Revised Management Procedure, but catch limits are set at national level using a modified version of the procedure that allows higher limits (IWC 2018a). However, the catches actually taken have on average been below the limits set.<br/><br/>“Aboriginal subsistence whaling” has continued uninterrupted in Greenlandic waters since the 1960s. The IWC Scientific Committee regularly reviews the situation and has advised that the currently allowed levels of take of Common Minke Whales will not harm the population (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>Catches by whaling vessels in the North Pacific peaked in the mid-1970s when the annual catch exceeded 1,500, and were phased out over 1983-87 with the coming into effect of the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling's moratorium on commercial whaling, but resumed in 1994 under a scientific permit issued by the Government of Japan. Since 2014, active whaling on Common Minke Whales has been limited to coastal operations off the Pacific coast of Japan (IWC 2018b). Net catches, including incidental catches in fisheries, do not count as “whaling” and are not regulated by the IWC, but are taken into account in the IWC Scientific Committee's assessments of population status and sustainable take levels. Net catches increased during the 1980s and have continued off Japan and Korea, and possibly also off China. The IWC Scientific Committee has expressed concern over the sustainability of takes from the autumn-breeding Sea of Japan–Yellow Sea–East China Sea population (IWC 2009), and most of its population projections predict a continuing decline of this population (IWC 2014). However, the Committee in 2017 recommended that the projection model be revised to ensure consistency with available information on recent trends in abundance (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>Outside of the western North Pacific region, reported entanglements of Minke Whales in fishing gear are few in relation to the apparent overall abundance of the species (e.g., 6.5/year on the eastern U.S. seaboard, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Reports of ship strikes on this species are also few (e.g., 1.6/year on the eastern U.S. seaboard, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although most ship strikes probably go undetected or unreported, the data suggest that this species may be less vulnerable to shipping than are the larger whale species.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic</em><em> </em><br/></strong>The IWC traditionally recognizes four stocks of Minke Whales in the North Atlantic: Northeast Atlantic, Central North Atlantic, West Greenland, and Canadian East Coast (which includes the U.S. east coast) but the evidence for these is equivocal. Recent genetic analyses suggest that there may be just two main breeding populations, whose winter distributions are unknown and which mix on the summer feeding grounds (Anderwald <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The latest review of abundance, catches, and population structure was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2017 (IWC 2018a). The Committee’s review resulted in stock structure hypotheses involving 1, 2, or 3 breeding stocks being considered equally plausible.<br/><br/>Population estimates for this species by area have been variable over time (IWC 2017), probably mainly due to changes in distribution, but possibly also affected by methodological issues. The most recent estimates from surveys conducted during 2007-2015 in the main summer range are: <br/></p><ul><li>US waters (Virginia to lower Bay of Fundy): 2,591 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.81) in 2011 (Palka 2012); <br/></li><li>Canadian Atlantic waters and Gulf of St Lawrence: 20,741 (CV 0.30) in 2007 (Lawson and Gosselin, 2011); <br/></li><li>West Greenland: 5,095 (CV 0.46), East Greenland: 2,762 (CV 0.47) (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); <br/></li><li>central North Atlantic pelagic: 6,306 (CV 0.35), Iceland coastal: 12,710 (CV 0.53) in 2015 (IWC 2018a); <br/></li><li>Jan Mayen: 10,991 (CV 0.36) in 2010; <br/></li><li>West Svalbard: 5,009 (CV 0.29) in 2008; <br/></li><li>East Svalbard: 22,281 (CV 0.18) in 2008; <br/></li><li>Barents Sea: 34,125 (CV 0.34) in 2013; <br/></li><li>Norwegian Sea and Faeroes: 21,218 (CV 0.32) in 2011; <br/></li><li>British Isles and North Sea: 12,808 (CV 0.35) in 2016 (excluding most of Irish waters) (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017).</li></ul>These total about 156,000 with a nominal CV of 0.12.<br/><br/>Pre-modern catches of&#160;Minke Whales in the North Atlantic are known to have occurred but were probably small (Holt 1988). Recorded catches from modern whaling begin around 1930 and total just under 150,000 whales (Allison 2017). The most intense whaling on this species took place&#160;in the northeast Atlantic during 1941-83, when over 100,000 whales were taken. Simulations of the population indicate that it was reduced by about half during this period (IWC 2018a). The decline in the population was noticed at the time from the decline in catches per whaling vessel per day (IWC 1984). Commercial catches were phased out during 1984-87, but were resumed in 1993 at a reduced level and continue to this day. Catches by indigenous hunters continue in West Greenland waters, and in small numbers off East Greenland. The average annual catch of Minke Whales in the North Atlantic during 2013-17 was about 800, taken mainly in Norwegian waters (IWC 2018b). The population is predicted to have partially recovered from the past period of high catches (IWC 2018a) but abundance estimates have been too variable to corroborate this.<em><br/><br/><strong>Western North Pacific</strong></em><strong><em></em><br/></strong>The IWC recognizes three management areas in the North Pacific: Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea – East China Sea; Okhotsk Sea – West Pacific (west of 180°); and “Remainder” (east of 180°). However recent work has focused on delineating the range of the ‘J stock', which is now known to include the near-shore waters of the Pacific coast of Japan, mainly within 20 km of shore, where animals from this stock are partially sympatric with other Minke Whales, and are subject to direct and incidental takes (see Geographic Range).<br/><br/>The latest review of abundance, catches, and population structure of Minke Whales in the western North Pacific was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2013 and resulted in a number of alternative hypotheses for the population structure in this region being treated as plausible, without consensus on all of them (IWC 2014). The most recent abundance estimates accepted by the IWC Scientific Committee for the western North Pacific (west of 170°E) derive from data collected during 2005-12 and total 27,000 animals (CV 0.16), of which about 60% were in the Okhotsk Sea (Allison <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Minke Whales have been caught in nets on the Japanese coast at least since the 17th century (Kasuya 2009), and net catches have continued in modern times alongside direct hunting (Kim 1999, Toboyama <em>et al</em>. 1992). Estimated catches in the western North Pacific since 1946 total about 60,000 Minke Whales, of which 38,000 were taken by whaling operations and 22,000 in nets (Allison 2014, IWC 2018b). These were taken primarily off Japan and Korea, plus a limited number of catches off China and some offshore catches. Catches in recent years have declined to about 250 per year, taken mainly in nets (Japan 2014-17, Korea 2013-17). The Korean fisheries catching Minke Whales are described by Song <em>et al</em>. (2010); most of the catches were in set nets, gill nets or pots. The IWC Scientific Committee has in the past expressed concern about incomplete reporting of net catches, especially as genetic capture-recapture analyses of meat market products suggested that more individuals were entering the markets than were reported caught (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2007, IWC 2009), but has since agreed on revised estimates of the net catch (Allison 2014).<br/><br/>Most of the net catch has been from J stock, given that genetic sampling of markets has shown that nearly all the products sold in Korea and nearly half the products sold from Japan have been from that stock (Lukoschek <em>et al</em>. 2009). The IWC Scientific Committee has in the past expressed particular concern on the effects of catches on the J stock, which had already been depleted by past catches (IWC 2009). The latest assessment by the Committee predicts continuing decline in the J stock (and in the Yellow Sea stock, if it is separate from the J stock) under most of the scenarios examined (IWC 2014). However, the trend has not been corroborated by other evidence, and the Scientific Committee has called for the assessments to be updated to take account of auxiliary information (IWC 2018c).<em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong></em><strong> (east of 180°E)</strong><br/>Minke Whale densities in the eastern North Pacific are generally lower than in the western region: for example, 636 (CV 0.72) for the U.S. west coast during 2008-14 (Barlow 2016), 522 (CV 0.30) for the waters of British Columbia during 2004-08 (Best <em>et al</em>. 2015), 2,020 (CV 0.73) for the eastern Bering Sea shelf (Friday <em>et al</em>. 2013), and 1,232 (CV 0.34) for coastal waters of the northern Gulf of Alaska and the eastern and central Aleutian Islands (Zerbini <em>et al.</em> 2006). Only 12 Minke Whales were seen in the international POWER surveys of the North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska north of 40°N east of 170°E during 2010-12, and none were seen south of 40°N during 2013-16 (IWC 2018d). <a style=""mso-comment-reference:GD_1;mso-comment-date: 20180319T1738"">However, because Minke Whales were not a target species and surveys continued in sea states considerably above those suitable for observing this species, no abundance estimate has been calculated (IWC 2016).</a><em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>It is not possible at this time to estimate the abundance of <em>B. acutorostrata</em> in the Southern Hemisphere, because most of the available quantitative sighting data do not distinguish it from the more numerous <em>B. bonaerensis</em> with which it is partially sympatric. <em>B. acutorostrata</em> has not been subject to significant exploitation in the Southern Hemisphere. Of more than 1,700 Minke Whales taken by Antarctic pelagic whaling from the 1987/88 to the 1992/93 season (when the two species have been reliably distinguished), only 16 were Dwarf Minke Whales (Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. 2005). One was taken at 65°S and the remainder between 55° and 62°S, 55°S being the northern limit of whaling operations. Surveys of the Antarctic Peninsula in summer during 1994-2008 found only 11 Dwarf Minke Whales versus 519 Antarctic Minke Whales (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the IDCR/SOWER series of international cetacean surveys south of 60°S, only 0.2% of Minke Whale sightings were <em>B. acutorostrata</em> (Branch and Butterworth 2001).",Unknown,"<p>The Common Minke Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all oceans and in nearly all latitudes, from nearly 70°S to 80°N. It occurs in the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, throughout the Southern Hemisphere and possibly also in the northern Indian Ocean. At least parts of the populations migrate to lower latitudes in winter, but there are no known areas of regular winter aggregation, except at the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, where Dwarf Minke Whales congregate in winter (Arnold 1997) and support a local swim-with tourism industry (Curnock <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is likely that the winter distribution of most Common Minke Whales is highly dispersed. The species can be hard to spot at sea except in fairly calm conditions but it is possible to detect its presence acoustically thanks to the confirmed identification of certain underwater sounds made by this species (Martin <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic (B. a. acutorostrata)</em><br/></strong>In summer, Minke Whales are common throughout the northern North Atlantic as far north as Baffin Bay, Greenland Sea, Svalbard (Norway), Franz Josef Land, and Novaya Zemlya, and as far south as 40°N on the U.S. east coast (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017), and as far south as the western English Channel and the central North Sea in Europe (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the mid-Atlantic, summer concentrations of Minke Whales occur to at least as far south as 50°N (Sigurjónsson <em>et al</em>. 1991). It is possible that at least a part of the Minke Whale population over-winters in the summer range, but there has been little observation effort in winter to confirm this.<br/><br/>Minke Whales also occur south of the above described range in the southeastern North Atlantic, but with no obvious seasonality and not commonly seen, with the exception of the Canary Islands where they occur year-round (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1999). There have been occasional sightings and strandings off Spain and Portugal, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, and the Cape Verde Islands (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 1983, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1999, Hazevoet <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). Minke Whales occur regularly in the Azores, apperently year-round but in low numbers (Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011, Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014) and are occasionally seen off Maderia (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Minke Whale is considered a “visitor species” in the Mediterranean (average &lt;1 record per year) with one vagrant recorded in the Black Sea (Reeves and Notabartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/> <br/> There are few winter sightings, but a summary by Mitchell (1991) indicates that Minke Whales do occur in winter near Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Antilles, and along the U.S. coast south of 40°N. A Norwegian winter expedition sent to the tropical Atlantic in 1989/90 to “find the breeding grounds of the Minke Whale” encountered just two at 20°N and 10°N off West Africa in December (Folklow and Blix 1991). Ten strandings have been recorded in the Gulf of Mexico (Jefferson and Schiro 1997) but very few live sightings. Minke Whales were detected off Puerto Rico in an acoustic survey in 1994 (Mellinger <em>et al</em>. 2000). A whale was satellite-tagged off western Iceland in August 2004 and tracked past the Azores to about 25°N by December before contact was lost (Víkingsson and Jørgensen 2015).<br/><br/>Acoustic monitoring from sites spaced along the mid-Atlantic ridge and the U.S. eastern seaboard, and in the eastern Caribbean showed the presence of Minke Whales in winter (November to March) at sites south of about 35°N, and only in other seasons at sites further north; these data suggest seasonal migration, but with different corridors for the spring and autumn migrations (Risch <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific (B. a. scammoni)</em></strong><br/>Minke Whales occur in summer all across the North Pacific north of about 30°N in summer, with a tendency for the distribution to shift northward in mid-summer. They are particularly abundant in the Okhotsk Sea in August (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996a), and also occur in the Bering Sea, around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2002, Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2006) and the Chukchi Sea (Ivashin and Votrogov 1981).<br/><br/>In the western North Pacific, there are at least two distinct subpopulations, and possibly more. The so-called “J stock” is an autumn-breeding population that occurs in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, and along the Pacific coast of Japan within 20nm of the coast, with some penetration into the Okhotsk Sea. The ""O stock,"" which like most baleen whales breeds in winter, occurs in summer in the northwestern Pacific, including off the northeastern coasts of Japan and in the Okhotsk Sea (Omura and Sakiura 1956, Kato 1992, Kanda <em>et al</em>. 2009). Minke Whales in the Yellow Sea may be distinct from the remainder of J stock (Wade <em>et al</em>. 2010, IWC 2014).<br/> <br/> The winter distribution in the western North Pacific is poorly known. Japanese expeditions to look for wintering grounds in the southwestern North Pacific during 1993-95 failed to locate any Minke Whales (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996b). The timing of the arrival of Minke Whales in Korean and western Japanese waters is suggestive of migration from the south in spring and return in autumn (Ohsumi 1983). Minke Whales were detected acoustically at low densities around the Mariana Islands in winter and spring 2007 (Norris <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In the eastern North Pacific, there appears to be a year-round subpopulation off California and Baja California and in the Gulf of California, and Minke Whales occur in summer off Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). Minke Whales have for many years been detected both acoustically and visually around the Hawaiian Islands in winter but not in substantial numbers (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The wintering area in the eastern North Pacific (U.S. mainland to Hawaii) has been identified acoustically to be primarily between 15° and 35° N latitude, with a boundary at around 135°W between two populations with acoustically distinct signatures (Rankin and Barlow 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Northern Indian Ocean</em><br/></strong>There have been very few records of Minke Whales in the northern Indian Ocean and none of them have been confirmed (Brownell<em> et al</em>, 2017). Deriyanagala (1963) described a new subspecies of Minke Whale, <em>B. acutorostrata thalmaha, </em>from strandings in Sri Lanka but subsequent examination of&#160; the type specimen indicated that it was probably from a Bryde's whale, <em>B. edeni </em>(Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>Southern Hemisphere (Dwarf Minke Whales)</em></strong><br/>Much of the data on the occurrence of Minke Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is ambiguous with respect to identification as <em>B. acutorostrata</em> or <em>B. bonaerensis</em>, because the two species are partially sympatric. Japanese scouting vessel data indicated high abundance of Minke Whales in November between 10°-30°S in the central South Pacific and in much of the eastern and southern Indian Ocean to 50°S (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996a), but the species identity is unclear. The limited information available from surveys in low and middle latitudes from the 1987/88 season onwards, when the two species were reliably distinguished, indicates that most of the Minke Whales were <em>B. bonaerensis</em> (Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. 1991), probably on route to the Antarctic from (as yet unknown) low-latitude breeding grounds, but that <em>B. acutorostrata</em> is also present in these latitudes.<br/><br/>Dwarf Minke Whales (<em>B. acutorostrata</em>) also occur at higher latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere but are much less common than <em>B. bonaerensis</em>. A winter survey in the Bellinghausen Sea in August 1993 found two Dwarf Minke Whales, including one at 69°25’S which is the southernmost record for this species (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011). </p>  <p>In coastal waters, Dwarf Minke Whales have been recorded off most of the South Atlantic coast of South America (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1996, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003), in the Beagle Channel (Chile/Argentina) (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006), and off South Africa (Best 1985), Australia (Arnold <em>et al</em>. 1987, Arnold 1997), New Zealand (Dawson and Slooten 1990), and New Caledonia (Garrigue and Greaves 2001). The most northerly confirmed Southern Hemisphere record is from 2°S, off the northern coast of Brazil (Magalhães <em>et al</em>. 2007).

50349982,2478,Balaenoptera physalus,Vulnerable,A1d,2018,2018-02-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The cause of the population reduction in Fin Whales (commercial whaling) that occurred in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is reversible, understood, and has been brought under control. For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The current global population size is uncertain due to lack of data from major parts of the range, especially from mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, rigorous evaluation against the criteria is not possible. However, plausible projections of the global mature population size indicate that it has probably recovered to over 30% of the level of three generations ago (1940) (i.e., reduction of &lt;70% over the last three generations) but has not necessarily yet reached 50% of that level; therefore, the Red List category is changed from Endangered to Vulnerable. It is important that existing data on abundance and distribution be worked up, and that data be collected in the areas where it is currently lacking, in order to verify to what extent the predicted recovery has occurred.&#160; <span class=""MsoCommentReference""></p>","<p>The available quantitative evidence suggests that the Fin Whale is a generalist feeder, sometimes preying heavily on fish but mostly on crustaceans. In Icelandic catches, 96% contained krill only, 2.5% a mixture of krill and fish, and 1.6% fish only (Sigurjónsson and Víkingsson 1997), while only 1 of 267 Fin Whales caught in the northeast Pacific off British Columbia, Canada, contained fish (Flinn<em> et al. </em>2002), and over 99% of stomachs with food in the Antarctic contained krill (Kawamura 1994). On the other hand, Overholtz and Nicolas (1979) reported apparent feeding by Fin Whales on American Sand Lance (Sand Eel),&#160;<em>Ammodytes americanus,</em> in the northwest Atlantic, and Mitchell (1972) found that Capelin, <em>Mallotus villosus</em>, comprised 80-90% of prey in Fin Whales caught off Newfoundland. Capelin abundance is extremely variable over time, and Fin Whales may feed opportunistically on Capelin in years with high abundance.<br/><br/>The Fin Whale is the fastest of the great whales, being able to maintain speeds of over 10 ms<sup>-1</sup> or 20 kn (Bose and Lien 1989). The high speed is likely an adaptation to avoid predation by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em>, (Ford and Reeves 2008) rather than to catch fast prey, because maximum speeds associated with lunge feeding are thought to be below 5 ms<sup>-1</sup> (Potvin <em>et al</em>. 2009). The apparent lack of winter breeding aggregations may also be an adaptation to avoid predation of calves, in the context of a flight rather than fight strategy to escape predation.&#160;</p>","<p>Prior to the advent of modern whaling in the late 19th century, Fin Whales were not subject to much human predation because they were hard to catch, but they were depleted worldwide by commercial whaling in the 20th century. Fin Whales have been protected in the Southern Hemisphere and North Pacific since 1976, and catches ceased in the North Atlantic by 1990, except for small “aboriginal subsistence” catches off Greenland. Commercial catches resumed off Iceland in 2006, but none have been taken in 2016 or 2017. A Japanese fleet resumed experimental catches of Fin Whales in the Antarctic in 2005, but this also has been discontinued. It seems unlikely that catching of Fin Whales will return to the high levels of previous years, not least due to the limited market demand for whale products.<br/> <br/> Fin Whales are one of the more commonly recorded species of large whale reported in vessel collisions (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001, IWC 2018d). An average of 2 collisions per year between Fin Whales and vessels was recorded off the U.S. east coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although reported incidents have been very few relative to the abundance of the species, most collisions involving large vessels are probably not detected, and to date there has been no satisfactory quantitative assessment of the actual risk. There is concern that collisions in the Mediterranean, especially in the main summering ground of Fin Whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Lyon where there are high densities of both whales and vessels, may be frequent enough to impact the population there (Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are also subject to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Nine cases of entanglement were recorded off the U.S. coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2017). Five entanglements involving Fin Whales worldwide were reported to the IWC Scientific Committee in 2017 (Hughes 2018). Although not all countries report, and some incidents will be missed by those that do, it appears likely that, globally, the threat from entanglement is low relative to the overall abundance of the species.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic<br/></em></strong>The Fin Whale was not easily catchable by early whalers due to its size and speed, but was heavily exploited from the start of mechanized whaling in 1864, particularly off Norway, Iceland, the Faeroes, and the British Isles. Whaling then spread to Spain, Greenland, and eastern Canada, and exploitation continued at a lower level until the 1980s. Fin whaling was phased out in the 1980s except for small catches off West Greenland. Catches resumed off western Iceland in 2007, but no catches have been taken there since 2015 (IWC 2018a).<br/> <br/> Catch statistics for the early years are incomplete: some are not divided into species, and a significant number of whales,&#160;perhaps 30-50%,&#160;were killed but lost due to lines breaking, etc. (Johnsen 1959, IWC 2017). The International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee has produced “best” and “high” estimates of Fin Whale kills in the North Atlantic totalling 98,000 and 115,000 respectively (IWC 2017).<br/><br/>Over the last three decades several sets of surveys have been conducted in the North Atlantic in summer to estimates the abundance of Fin Whales and other cetacean species. The most recent abundance estimates for each area are: East Greenland coastal 6,440 (CV 0.26) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018); East Greenland (excl. coastal), Iceland, and Faeroes 40,788 (CV 0.17) in 2015 (NASS2015 surveys, Pike <em>et al</em>. 2016); Norway and Jan Mayen 6,409 (CV 0.18) in 1996-2001 (Øien 2009); UK waters, North and Irish Seas, French and Spanish Atlantic waters and coast of Portugal 18,142 (CV 0.35) in 2016 (SCANS III surveys, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017); Atlantic Canada 3,522 (CV 0.27) in 2007 (Lawson and Gosselin 2009); U.S. east coast 1,595 (CV 0.33) in 2011 (Palka 2012); West Greenland 2,215 (CV 0.41) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018). The available estimates total about 79,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.13.&#160;These figures do not include the waters to the west of Ireland, where Fin Whales are fairly abundant. Data collected in Norwegian waters during 2002-17 have&#160; yet (May 2018) to be worked up.<br/><br/>Compared with previous estimates, the latest estimates show a substantial increase for the East Greenland–Iceland–Faroes area but an annual rate of increase that takes survey differences into account has not yet been calculated. The estimates for the Spain–Portugal–France–British Isles area show little change over the years from the first estimate of 17,355 (CV 0.27) obtained in 1989 (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). The trends in U.S., Canadian, western Greenlandic, and Norwegian waters have yet to be determined.<br/><br/>The overall increase in North Atlantic Fin Whales may represent a continuing recovery from past whaling, but it has also been hypothesized that the recovery was already essentially complete by 2000 and that the latest increase is due to environmental changes (Víkingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><strong><em>Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>Within the Mediterranean, the Fin Whale population was estimated in 1991 from surveys covering much of the western basin at 3,583 (CV 0.27) (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1996). Given the relative rarity of Fin Whales in the Mediterranean outside this area, a total population of about 5,000 for the Mediterranean is plausible (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The relative abundance in the Pelagos Sanctuary in the Gulf of Lyon has been monitored since 2009 from ferries on fixed routes, but the counts are too variable to estimate a trend (Cominelli <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Catches of about 7,000 Fin Whales taken in and near the Straits of Gibraltar during the 1920s depleted the local abundance and may have reduced a population migrating between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Sanpera and Aguilar 1992).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em><br/></strong>Some Fin Whales were likely taken by pre-modern whaling in Japan although the different species of <em>Balaenopter</em><em><em>a</em> were not always distinguished (Omura 1986). </em>A total of 76,000 Fin Whales are recorded taken by modern whaling in the North Pacific during 1910-75 (Allison 2017). The total killed is likely to be higher, because many or most of the approximately 6,500 unspecified whales taken during 1900-09 may have been Fin Whales, and in the early years of modern whaling there were likely, as in the North Atlantic, a substantial number of whales that were killed but not successfully landed. Fin Whales were legally protected from whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific from 1976, but small catches, reported at the time as Bryde’s Whales (<em>Balaenoptera edeni</em>), continued off Korea until 1981. These whales were probably from the East China Sea population.<br/><br/>North Pacific Fin Whale stocks have not been assessed in depth by the IWC Scientific Committee since 1973, when the assessment by Ohsumi and Wada (1974) was accepted. It was updated by Allen (1977). The stock in the western North Pacific was estimated to have declined from an “initial level” of 44,000 to 17,000 in 1975. The figures refer to the “exploitable” population, i.e., whales above the minimum allowed size at capture. Although these assessments were based on indices of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) that did not meet modern requirements for the analysis of such data (IWC 1989), there is no doubt that the populations declined substantially.<br/><br/>There is currently no population estimate for Fin Whales in the North Pacific as a whole, but one may become available once existing data holdings are worked up. The abundance information for each area is summarized here.<br/><br/>In surveys conducted in the Okhotsk Sea in 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2015, the Fin Whale was consistently the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (Miyashita 2004, Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011; Minamikawa <em>et al</em>. 2012, Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016) but the data have not yet been worked up to produce an abundance estimate.<br/><br/>The area of the northwestern Pacific bounded by the 170°E meridian, the coast of Japan, and the border of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone adjacent to Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands, has been surveyed during 2002-2015 by vessels associated with the JARPN II (2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programme in the North Pacific) programme. An estimate of about 4,000 Fin Whales (CV 0.4) was derived from data collected in July-August 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016).<br/><br/>The area between the 170°E and 135°W meridians. bounded to the north by the coast of Alaska and the Aleutian chain, was surveyed by the POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) international cruise in July and August over the years 2010-2012 (IWC 2018c). The data have not yet been worked up to yield an abundance estimate for Fin Whales, but the counts show that Fin Whales were approximately as abundant as Sei Whales, for which an estimate of about 30,000 whales (CV 0.24) has been calculated (Hakamada <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>It is planned to survey the Bering Sea in three parts over 2017-2019 under the POWER programme (IWC 2018c). The eastern Bering Sea was covered in 2017, and the Fin Whale was the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (<a href=""https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan"">https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan</a>). The eastern Bering Sea had previously been covered by U.S. fishery surveys, yielding an estimate of 1,061 (CV 0.38) Fin Whales (Friday <em>et al</em>. 2013). Zerbini <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated the abundance of Fin Whales to be 1,652 (CV ~0.2) in the coastal waters south of the Alaska Peninsula, which is included in the area surveyed by the 2011-12 POWER. An estimate of 4.8% for the annual rate of increase over the period 1987-2003 was obtained with nominal confidence limits of 4.1%-5.4%, but subsequent recalculation of the variance from the data indicates much lower precision (95% confidence limits -1.6% to +11.1% per year) (IWC 2009). In a survey of the western Bering Sea in 2005, Fin Whales (along with Humpback Whales) were the most frequently encountered species, but no abundance estimate has been calculated (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Based on surveys conducted during 2004-08, Best <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated the abundance Fin Whales in the waters of British Columbia (Canada) to be 329 (95% confidence interval (CI) 274-395).<br/><br/>The summer abundance off the west coast of the continental U.S.A. (Washington/Oregon/California) is estimated to have been 9,029 (CV 0.12) whales in 2014, while the average rate of increase over 1991-2014 was 7.5% per year. (Nadeem <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, the variation around the trend line was greater than would be expected from sampling variance alone, suggesting that a variable proportion of the population is found in the area each year.<br/><br/>This genetically isolated Gulf of California subpopulation was estimated in 2004 from a mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data at 613 (CI 426-970) (Díaz-Guzman 2006). There are no data on population trend for this subpopulation.<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>Along with other baleen whales, the IWC has traditionally managed Southern Hemisphere Fin Whales on the basis of six management areas, Areas I through VI, which are longitudinal pie slices 50°-70° wide. The areas were originally chosen as putative management stocks for Humpback Whales, and later used for all baleen whales, with little or no biological support (Donovan 1991).<br/><br/> Over 725,000 Fin Whales have been recorded caught in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905-76 (Allison 2017). There was a series of assessments in the 1970s, including a synthesis by Chapman (1976) which was reassessed for Area I by Breiwick (1977), and updated for Areas II-VI by Allen (1977). A later reassessment of Area VI Fin Whales was inconclusive (IWC 1980). <br/> <br/> These assessments were based on a combination of evidence, including trends in CPUE by whaling fleets, sighting rates by Japanese scouting vessels, and inferences on recruitment and mortality rates from age and length data. Their reliability is questionable on various grounds. For example, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently determined that CPUE data should only be used for stock assessments when the nature of the whaling operations is fully described (IWC 1989). A reanalysis of the historical data using modern methods and insights is warranted.<br/> <br/> Regular sightings surveys in the Antarctic south of 60°S were conducted under the IDCR/SOWER programmes in summer during 1978-2010 (IWC 2018) and the JARPA/II (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programmes in the Antarctic) in summer during 1987-2014 (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, only 55% of the historic summer catch taken during 1904-76 occurred south of 60°S, the remainder having been taken mainly between 50°-60°S. Hence there is probably considerable abundance outside the surveyed areas.<br/><br/>Circumpolar estimates from the IDCR/SOWER surveys increased from 2,100 during 1978-91 (CV 0.28) to 5,100 (CV 0.52) during 1991-98 (Branch and Butterworth 2001) but the more recent data do not appear to have been worked up. An extrapolation of the abundance estimate for 1978-91 to the area south of 30°S using Japanese Scouting Vessel data from 1978-88 yielded a circumpolar estimate of 15,000 (no variance given) (IWC 1996). The Scouting Vessel data were not collected according to any kind of statistical design and should be interpreted with caution.<br/><br/>Estimates from the JARPA/II surveys covering just half the Antarctic from 35°E to 145°W (southern Indian Ocean and south-west Pacific sectors) increased from 5,000 (CV 0.15) in 1996 to 17,600 (CV 0.26) in 2008, but large inter-annual fluctuations in the abundance suggested that the proportion of the population within the surveyed area varied from year to year (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). Approximately three-quarters of the historical catch came from within the 35°E-145°W sector.<br/><br/>Other data sources cover only limited areas and lack long enough time series to estimate trends. As examples, Viquerat and Herr (2017) estimated abundances of about 500 and 800 Fin Whales around Elephant Island and the South Orkneys respectively.<br/><br/>The current circumpolar abundance remains highly uncertain until all existing data are worked up and more data are collected from the zone 50°-60°S. Overall the information suggests a substantial increase has occurred, but the rate of increase is poorly quantified. All estimates of the rate of increase have very low precision but are compatible with an intrinsic growth rate of around 4-5% per year as assumed in the latest assessments.<br/><br/><strong><em>Biological parameters and assessment</em><br/> </strong>Estimates of age at sexual maturity for female Fin Whales, based on observed proportions mature by age, are 6-7 years in the Southern Hemisphere from British catches in the 1960s (Lockyer 1972) and Japanese catches in the 1960s and early 1970s (Mizroch 1981), but these values are likely negatively biased due to selection against smaller animals. For the North Atlantic, Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. (2013) report a value for Fin Whales caught off Iceland of around 8 years during 1965-89, increasing to 14 years during 2006-10, although the sample size in the later years was small. Aguilar <em>et al</em>. (1988) estimated 7.9 years from catches off Spain during 1979-84. There do not seem to be any precise values for the North Pacific, but Kimura (Ohsumi) <em>et al</em>. (1958) estimated 8-12 years. For the purpose of this assessment, the age at first reproduction of 10 years (9 years for age at sexual maturity) as estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007 is assumed. The values of other biological parameters (age at first capture, net recruitment rate, and natural mortality rate) were taken from the previous IWC Scientific Committee assessments (IWC 2017, Allen 1977).<br/><br/>The generation time for a non-depleted Fin Whale population is estimated to be 25.9 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The 3-generation window for application of the&#160;Red List&#160;A criterion is 1940-2018.<br/><br/>Because the available published assessments for this Fin Whales are not up to date, an illustrative population assessment is conducted here to enable estimation of a plausible population trajectory over the period 1940-2018 relative to the A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, it is reasonable to use conventional population assessment methods to provide a crude indication of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (“recruitment”) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately.<br/><br/>Based on the above (incomplete) information, the following population numbers (total, including immature whales) are assumed for the purpose of this Red list assessment:<br/></p><ul><li>North Atlantic: 70,000 whales in 2015; <br/></li><li>North Pacific: 50,000 whales in 2011; <br/></li><li>Southern Hemisphere: 25,000 whales in 2008.</li></ul><p>The parameter values are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material (which forms an integral part of this assessment). The estimated global trajectory for the number of mature individuals indicates that the 2018 mature population size is about 100,000 whales and may be around 45% of the 1940 level, which implies a classification of Vulnerable under the A1 criterion. According to this trajectory, there had already been considerable decline prior to 1940, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. For completeness it should be noted that other models have been posited that imply an increasing Fin Whale population prior to 1940 in the Southern Hemisphere (Mori and Butterworth 2006) but the pre-1940 period does not affect the Red List assessment against criterion A.</p>",Increasing,"<p>Fin Whales occur worldwide, mainly, but not exclusively, in offshore waters of the temperate and subpolar zones (Edwards&#160; <em>et al</em>. 2015). They show some poleward migration in summer but appear to be present at some level throughout their range throughout the year. Fin Whales are considered rare or absent in most of the tropics but were hunted off Peru and Ecuador and in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century (Allison 2017), and are still occasionally observed in the tropics, for example off Peru (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009) and the Seychelles (Keller <em>et al</em>. 1982). There do not seem to remain any confirmed records from the northern Indian Ocean, after correcting misidentifications (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic and Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>In the North Atlantic, the Fin Whale’s range extends as far as Svalbard (Norway) in the northeast (but rarely far into the Barents Sea), to the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay (Canada and Greenland) in the northwest (but rarely into the inner Canadian Arctic), to the Canary Islands (Spain) in the southeast, and to the Antilles in the southwest (Rice 1998, Perry <em>et al.</em> 1999), but it is rare in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001), where the few recorded strandings may be extralimital vagrants (Whitt <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Their main summer range in the northwestern Atlantic extends from Cape Hatteras (U.S.A.) (39°N) northward (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). They occur in summer (and possibly year-round) west and east of Greenland, around Iceland and the Faroe Islands and along the Iceland-Faroes ridge, and to a lesser extent in the Norwegian Sea and around Jan Mayen (Øien 2009). They occur off the northern and western British Isles and in the Bay of Biscay off northwestern Spain but are rare in the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). They regularly occur off the Azores in spring (Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011) and have been detected acoustically west of Madeira (32°N) in winter (Castellotti <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>While there may be some north-south migration between summer and winter, it appears from acoustic data that at least male North Atlantic Fin Whales are present throughout most of the range throughout the year (Morano <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are present in the central and western Mediterranean, mainly north and east of the Balearic Islands, and appear to be a mixture of a resident population and one migrating between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic (Notabartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2016). The area of abundance seems to be concentrated in the Ligurian Sea and the Gulf of Lyon in summer, but expands to cover much of the western and central Mediterranean in winter. Fin Whales are rare in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, do not penetrate far into the Adriatic or Aegean Seas, and are not present in the Black Sea. In the 20th century, Fin Whales were caught year-round near the Straits of Gibraltar (Allison 2017) and observations in this century show Fin Whales leaving her Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar&#160; during May-October and (mostly) entering the Mediterranean during November-April (Gauffier <em>et al</em>. 2018); the observations of calves leaving the Mediterranean during May-July suggests they were born there.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific<br/></em></strong>In the eastern North Pacific, Fin Whales occur year-round off the central and southern California coast. They occur in summer off the entire coast of western North America from California into the Gulf of Alaska and along the Aleutian Islands. Fin Whales marked off California in winter were recaptured in summer by whaling operations along the entire coast, suggesting migration (Mizroch <em>et al</em>. 2009). Offshore, Fin Whales occur across the North Pacific north of 40°N, at least from May to September in summer, with some tendency for a northward shift in distribution in high summer, when they enter the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Melnikov <em>et al</em>. 2017) and are also found along the east coast of Kamchatka (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017) and between Kamchatka and the Commander Islands (Miyashita 2006). They also occur in the Sea of Japan (Miyashita 2006). Fin Whales occur in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and have recently been detected as far as Point Barrow in the northeastern Chukchi, which may be an indication of a northward expansion as the Arctic warms (Crance <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are abundant in the offshore western North Pacific north of about 35°N in summer, and in the coastal waters of Hokkaido and northeastern Honshu (Japan) (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2016), but in recent years have only rarely been seen off central and southern Japan or around the Korean peninsula at any time of year (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017, Sohn <em>et al</em>. 2012). Both are areas where large catches were taken in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Fin Whales in the East China Sea are thought to belong to a distinct subpopulation from those of the North Pacific (Fujino 1960), and it is possible that the Korean and southern Japanese catches came from this stock. There were a few net catches in the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait in the early 2000s (CRI 2005-07).<br/><br/>Fin Whales occur, albeit in small numbers, in Hawaiian waters in both summer and winter (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The winter distribution in the North Pacific poorly known. While there appears to be some migration, acoustic data suggest that overall there is little seasonality in distribution, but that there is seasonality in the amount of vocalization (Watkins <em>et al</em>. 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>The Fin Whales inhabiting the Gulf of California appear to be a resident, genetically isolated subpopulation (Bérubé <em>et al.</em> 2002). Telemetry information has shown year-round residency in this area, with seasonal latitudinal movements (Urbán <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Southern Hemisphere<br/></em></strong>Some Fin Whales penetrate into the high Antarctic, along with Blue (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), Minke (<em>B. bonaerensis</em>) and Humpback Whales (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>), but are rarely seen in the pack ice. The Fin Whale summer distribution also extends into middle latitudes, as evidenced by both sightings and past catches (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Allison 2017). Fin Whales were abundant in summer in the Southern Ocean from 40°S to Antarctica in the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian Ocean sectors, and south of 50°-55°S in other sectors. Recent (post-whaling) data on Fin Whales in the Southern Ocean are available mainly for the area south of 60°S: for example, the international circumpolar IDCR/SOWER surveys under the auspices of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1978-2009 (IWC 2019) which showed that Fin Whales were still distributed in all sectors of the Antarctic, but with a much reduced abundance (Branch and Butterworth 2001); more recently, surveys around the South Orkneys and the South Shetlands (Viquerat and Herr 2017, Joiris and Dochy 2013) found substantial local densities of Fin Whales.&#160;An area of suspected high Fin Whale density to the south of Bouvet Island (55°-57°S 0-5°E) was confirmed by a sighting survey conducted there in December 2006 (Ensor <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Large numbers of Fin Whales were caught by whalers operating out of whaling stations on South Georgia (55°S) during 1904-65, but the species was rarely seen there in the ensuing three decades (Moore <em>et al</em>. 1999). Sightings have become more frequent lately but have not yet been quantitatively evaluated (Richardson 2012).<br/><br/>Outside the Antarctic, Fin Whales were caught in substantial numbers off the southwestern and southeastern coasts of southern Africa in winter, and in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century were also taken in the coastal waters of Mozambique, Angola, Congo, and Gabon (Best 1994), but they are very rare on the western coasts of southern and equatorial Africa today (Weir 2010, 2011). Catch rates of Fin Whales off South Africa declined to near zero by the early 1970s coincident with the severe depletion by whaling in the Southern Ocean, which suggests that this was a wintering ground for a population that migrated to the south in summer (Best 2003).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught off the coast of Peru, mainly in the austral winter, until catches petered out in the early 1970s. Sightings of Fin Whales in the eastern equatorial Pacific since whaling ended in 1976 have been relatively few, in contrast to Blue Whales which continued to be sighted frequently (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Landa <em>et al</em>. 1983, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught from several stations along the coast of Chile from 20° to 44°S from the early 20th century until 1983, but very few were caught after 1970. Catches were taken in all seasons but few in winter; the whales were typically small, with a modal length of 16-17m for each sex, compared with 20-21m (males) and 21-22m (females) for Fin Whales caught by Antarctic fleets. Given the lack of genetic distinction between fin whales in Chile and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere (Pérez-Álvarez <em>et al</em>. 2018) and the recovery in the Antarctic of marks placed in Fin Whales off Chile (Clarke 1978), it is likely that the Chilean Fin Whales were juvenile Southern Fin Whales <em></em> rather than a race of small Fin Whales (Cooke 2019). In recent years, Fin Whales have been observed in nearshore Chilean waters from 23° to 29ºS during spring and summer and seen to be feeding there (Pérez <em>et al</em>. 2006, Pacheco <em>et al</em>. 2015, Toro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Toro <em>et al</em>. classed 502 out of 519 Fin Whale sightings around the Chanaral and Choros Islands (29°S) in summer and fall as ""adults"" but used a size criterion of 17m developed for the smaller North Atlantic Fin Whale; hence the ""adults"" could have included whales of any age class except calves of the year. Pacheco <em>et al</em>. reported two mother-calf pairs off northern Chile (Mejillones Bay, 23°S) in spring 2006.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are now rare in Brazilian waters, but there is virtually no information from the period before the depletion of the whales around South Georgia (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997). A few were taken in a brief period of whaling in southern Brazil in the early 1960s.<br/><br/>Apart from the above-mentioned wintering grounds, the winter distribution of Fin Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is poorly known. Some may remain in the far south while some may disperse into oceanic areas in temperate latitudes. Acoustic detections of Fin Whales in the Antarctic peak in the autumn (May) and are absent in winter and spring, but this may reflect seasonality of vocalization as much as presence/absence (Širović <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><strong><em>Other areas</em></strong><br/>The only confirmed records from Indonesia are two strandings in 1937 and 1975 (Rudolph <em>et al</em>. 1997), which may have been vagrants. A reported sighting off Sarawak (Malaysia) in 1999 (de Boer 2000) is unconfirmed.<br/><br/>The map shows where the species may occur based on a synthesis of occurrence records and oceanography. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are included in the list of native range states.</p>","<p>Large-scale commercial harvesting of this species appears to have ceased, the last catches having been taken in the Antarctic in 2012 and in the North Atlantic in 2015 (IWC 2018a) but frozen products are probably still in trade. The latest entry in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Trade Database was an export of 2,546 tonnes of Fin Whale meat from Iceland to Japan in 2014, but only 1,624 tonnes appear to have reached Japan (CITES 2017).</p>",Marine,"<p>The IWC set catch limits at zero for Fin Whales in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere starting in 1976. The IWC adopted a provision (popularly known as the commercial whaling moratorium) in 1982 to set all catch limits for commercial whaling to zero from 1986, but Iceland, Norway, and the Russian Federation have lodged objections or reservations to the provision. Limited hunting of Fin Whales off western Greenland is permitted for “aboriginal subsistence” purposes.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are listed on Appendix I of CITES, but this does not apply to Iceland, Norway, and Japan, who hold reservations. Fin Whales are also listed on Appendices I and II of the Convention on Management of Migratory Species (CMS). Under the Agreement for Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black and Mediterranean Seas, Fin Whales in the Mediterranean, along with other cetaceans, are protected from deliberate killing by signatories to the agreement.</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Combining the most current abundance estimates for the various subpopulations results in a total of more than 195,000 whales. Given that there are no estimates for most of the Russian High Arctic, total abundance is likely more than 200,000. At least four subpopulations number more than 20,000 individuals. Some subpopulations are reduced below historical levels and some small subpopulations are declining but data are not adequate to assess overall population reduction or trend. As a species, Beluga Whales do not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and are listed as Least Concern.</p>  <p>Belugas in Cook Inlet have been assessed by IUCN as a separate subpopulation and are classified on the Red List as Critically Endangered (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2012). Several other subpopulations are small, declining, and/or occupy restricted areas, and warrant Red List assessment at the subpopulation level.</p>","Belugas are relatively well-studied as a result of carcass sampling conducted in association with hunting (Heide-Jørgensen and Teilmann 1994, Suydam 2009) along with a considerable amount of satellite-linked radio-tracking (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005), and aerial survey efforts (Moore, 2000, Belikov and Boltunov 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/> Belugas occupy estuaries, continental shelf and slope waters, and deep  ocean basins in conditions of open water, loose ice, and heavy pack ice  (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). In summer, they are found in coastal waters as shallow as 1–3 m deep and also in offshore waters thousands of meters deep. They typically enter estuaries and sometimes move upstream into rivers; there are records of individuals or small groups ranging hundreds of kilometers from the sea (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Belugas generally prefer to overwinter in areas with light or highly moveable ice cover (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2001, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017) and may occur as fully Arctic subpopulations (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998b, <em></em> 2001; Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or Subarctic subpopulations (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> Some Belugas undertake large-scale annual migrations between summering and wintering sites (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while others remain in the same area year-round, shifting offshore only when excluded from coastal habitat by fast-ice formation (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). Large numbers of migratory Belugas occur along the northwestern and northern Alaskan coast, in the Canadian high Arctic, and in western Hudson Bay. At certain times of the year, those whales migrate thousands of kilometers, in some cases as far as 80°N into dense pack ice (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or thousands of kilometers into the North Water polynya or to the pack ice off West Greenland (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). In some areas, beluga distribution appears to be determined by sea ice extent, with belugas shifting offshore during low-ice years to maintain associations with the marginal ice zone (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Non-migratory Belugas that generally make seasonal shifts in distribution of less than a few hundred kilometers are found in Cook Inlet, Cumberland Sound, Svalbard, and the St. Lawrence Estuary (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Kingsley 2002, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> While the general features of Beluga Whale habitat can be described for the relatively well-studied subpopulations, the importance of those features is not well understood (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). For example, the summer occupation of nearshore/estuarine waters has been ascribed alternatively to feeding (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1982), to warm water providing a thermal advantage to neonates (Sergeant and Brodie 1969), and to the presence of fresh water and coarse substrates facilitating skin shedding during molt (St. Aubin <em>et al</em>. 1990, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993). The relative importance of each of those factors likely varies according to the environmental conditions (e.g., water temperatures and prey availability) specific to each of the summering areas (Frost and Lowry 1990). Similarly, it is unclear why Belugas sometimes move into deep, ice-covered waters (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2016). One potential reason would be to avoid predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992). However, movements into the ice appear excessive for what would be needed to avoid Killer Whales (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and actually could expose Belugas to predation by Polar Bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987) as well as increase the risk of entrapment in the ice. It is possible that Belugas move into ice-covered offshore regions for feeding, primarily on Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), but few data are available to test this hypothesis (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, the associations of Belugas with features such as the continental shelf break and slope (Moore 2000, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017) may be related to biophysical processes that produce good feeding conditions (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/> <br/> Beluga dives may last more than 20 minutes and can reach depths of more than 900 m (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Beluga has a diverse diet, which varies greatly from area to area. Although various species of fish are considered to be the primary prey items (including Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.), Herring (<em>Clupea </em>spp.), and Arctic Cod), Belugas also feed on a wide variety of mollusks (such as squid and octopus) and benthic crustaceans (shrimps and crabs) (Quakenbush <em>et al</em>. 2015, Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas throughout their Arctic range (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992).","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease. Belugas are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance varies among the many Beluga subpopulations.</p><p>Hunting for human consumption is the biggest known threat to Belugas  across certain portions of their range. The most immediate concerns  relate to continuing harvests from small and depleted subpopulations (IWC  2000). The strong philopatry of Belugas, which causes them to return to  the same estuaries year after year, makes them highly vulnerable to  overexploitation. This behavioural trait is undoubtedly the most  important natural factor that has led to the extirpation of Belugas from  some parts of their range by a combination of commercial and  subsistence hunting (e.g., in southwestern Greenland and some river  mouths in Ungava Bay, Canada). In nearly all regions hunting is now  being controlled by limiting takes to sustainable levels (see  the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section).<br/> </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial reduction in the seasonal extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as changes in timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Belugas occur only in regions where sea ice occurs at least seasonally, suggesting a strong connection with sea ice influenced habitat. However, Belugas from some subpopulations spend many months in open water far from any ice while others spend most of their time in regions with sea ice concentrations up to 90%, indicating that the species as a whole has substantial flexibility in its relationships with ice (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). Belugas that occupy ice covered areas may do so for feeding on abundant ice-associated species such as Arctic Cod (<em></em>Loseto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Changes in the distribution and characteristics of sea ice will result in changes in productivity and prey species types and abundance (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008, Haug <em>et al</em>. 2017) but the potential costs or benefits to Belugas of such changes are not known. Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992) and it is generally assumed that concentrated sea ice provides Belugas some degree of refuge from predation. There is good evidence that Killer Whales are expanding their range in Arctic regions where sea ice has been declining (Higdon and Ferguson 2009, Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Belugas are susceptible to entrapment when sea ice conditions change rapidly and if they cannot escape they may die or be preyed upon by Polar Bears <em></em> and/or humans (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/></p>  <p>Known or potential threats include a variety of human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is allowing increases in the scale and distribution of some of those activities in areas previously covered with heavy ice. Ongoing and expanding oil and gas development, along with commercial shipping, is likely to impact habitats used by Belugas. Such impacts may be especially acute in shipping routes such as the Northwest Passage which traverses much of the summering habitat of belugas in Canada and Greenland (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas such as the Mackenzie Delta, West Greenland, and the Barents Sea are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which may include seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by icebreaking and shipping. Much of this activity is undertaken in the summer months in the same areas occupied by Belugas. In a study of responses of Belugas to icebreaking ships, the whales typically moved rapidly along ice edges away from approaching ships and showed strong avoidance reactions to approaching ships at distances of 35–50 km (Finley <em>et al</em>. 1990, Erbe and Farmer 2000). Expansion of commercial fisheries into new Arctic regions may have implications for bycatch of Belugas in fishing gear and depletion of Beluga prey resources. Construction of dams for hydroelectric development in the Hudson Bay area and along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence may have affected Belugas because of their dependence on estuarine conditions (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p> Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants from those sources that are high enough to cause impacts on health (Ross 2000). Threats from contaminants are of concern for Belugas in some areas. High levels of several contaminants have been found in Belugas sampled in the Canadian Arctic (Braune <em>et al</em>. 2005). Studies of the SLE Beluga subpopulation have found that concentrations of both total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated PCB congeners are much higher than in Belugas in the Arctic. Some scientists believe that the increased occurrence of opportunistic bacterial infections, parasitic infestation, gastric ulcers and other disorders in SLE Belugas is evidence of a link between immune system dysfunction and PCB exposure (Martineau <em>et al</em>., 1994). SLE Belugas also have elevated tissue levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (flame retardants) (Lebeuf <em>et al</em>. 2004). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Belugas are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2005). Significant epizootics have not been recorded in Belugas, but serological screenings document pathogen exposure (e.g., Alekseev <em>et al</em>. 2009) and necropsies find a variety of health issues (e.g., Martineau <em>et al</em>. 1988). Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. (2016) found low level exposure to biotoxins (domoic acid 2 of 15 tested and saxitoxin 1 of 12 tested) in Beluga samples from Cook Inlet. A mass mortality event in summer 2008 in the SLE, which included several Belugas, was linked to an intense bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate <em>Alexandrium tamarense</em> (Starr <em>et al.</em> 2017).  Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could impact disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p>The global Beluga population consists of multiple subpopulations with varying degrees of differentiation and abundance (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to the lack of sampling, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee organized information on Belugas on the basis of 29 provisional management stocks (IWC 2000), and a recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 21 stocks (NAMMCO in prep.).<br/></p>    <p>Stocks are generally based on nearshore areas (principally fjords, bays, and estuaries) where Belugas congregate during part of the open water season. Satellite telemetry, genetic studies, and organochlorine analyses have shown that Belugas have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2002; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, de March <em>et al</em>. 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Palsbøll <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some stock boundaries overlap spatially and seasonally during winter and during the spring and fall migrations (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014). For stocks that winter in the Bering Sea, limited satellite tracking data suggest that areas used generally do not overlap in the same year, suggesting that Belugas from different stocks have traditional winter ranges that are mostly exclusive (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/></p>  <p>While good abundance estimates are available for some Beluga subpopulations, the sizes of others are virtually unknown or only roughly approximated (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Available information is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Okhotsk Sea</strong></p>  <p>Belugas occur in two well-separated regions of the Okhotsk Sea.<em> </em>In the northeastern region, they summer along the coast and in estuaries of Shelikhov Bay and winter along the ice edge of the Bay and northwestern Kamchatka.<em> </em>Based on surveys in 2010, Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated there were 1,333 surface-visible Belugas in the northeastern Okhotsk Sea, resulting in an estimate of 2,666 total whales when corrected for availability bias (animals not seen because they were diving). In the western Okhotsk Sea, Belugas occur in the northern Sakhalin Bay and Amur River region as well as several smaller bays along the Shantar coast (Ulbansky Bay, Udskaya Bay, Tugursky Bay and Nikolskaya Bay.<em> </em>There Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated 4,780 visible Belugas and 9,560 in total. The population trend is unknown in both regions. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Alaska and Western Canada</strong></p>  <p>Five subpopulations of Belugas are known to occur in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. All five winter in the Bering Sea (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations migrate northward in spring and spend summer and early fall well north of Bering Strait (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while the Bristol Bay, Anadyr Gulf, and eastern Bering Sea subpopulations remain in the Bering Sea south of Bering Strait (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2016, NAMMCO in prep., Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC) unpublished data). </p>  <p>Bristol Bay Belugas have been counted using aerial surveys conducted periodically between 1993 and 2016.<em> </em>Correction factors to account for animals missed were applied to counts made in 2004 and 2005 (Lowry <em>et al. </em>2008) which produced an abundance estimate of 2,887 whales (Muto <em>et al. </em>2016).<em> </em>Similar correction factors applied to the 2016 count resulted in a population estimate of 3,166 whales (ABWC unpublished data). Lowry <em>et al. </em>(2008) reported that counts of Bristol Bay Belugas increased by 4.8% per year during 1993-2005 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–7.5%). The estimate based on 2016 counts was similar to 2004/05 suggesting that the increasing population trend had leveled off (ABWC unpublished data). </p>  <p>Belugas in Anadyr Gulf have never been surveyed adequately. An analysis of Beluga sightings obtained opportunistically during a survey for Pacific Walruses (<em>Odobenus rosmarus divergens</em>) conducted in the western Bering Sea in April 2006 estimated 15,125 Belugas in the area (with availability correction factor applied). However, the survey did not cover all areas known to be used by Anadyr Belugas, and it is possible that individuals from other subpopulations were also in the survey area. The maximum count along the coast in Anadyr Bay was 241 whales, and expert opinion suggests that the total Anadyr subpopulation is about 3,000 whales with fairly stable abundance (NAMMCO in prep.). </p>  <p>Aerial surveys for Belugas were flown in the eastern Bering Sea periodically during 1992-2001. Data collected in 2000 were used in distance sampling analysis that resulted in an estimate of 3,497 surface-visible Belugas in the survey area. The total abundance estimate was 6,994 whales (95% CI 3,162-15,472) when a correction factor for availability was applied (Lowry <em>et al</em>. in press). There are currently no data with which to estimate population trend, but another survey of the subpopulation was conducted in 2017. </p>  <p>Early estimates of the size of the eastern Chukchi Sea Beluga stock relied on June-July counts of whales in and near coastal lagoons with correction factors applied to account for animals missed.<em> </em>Those studies resulted in abundance estimates of roughly 2,000-4,000 whales (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1988, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>Subsequent tagging of whales with satellite depth recorders (SDRs) showed that during summer they had a very broad distribution, including considerable time spent in offshore areas where they were missed during coastal lagoon surveys (Suydam 2009). Further analysis of SDR data from eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea Belugas (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014) showed there is a date range and region where data from offshore marine mammal surveys (Aerial Surveys of Alaskan Marine Mammals (ASAMM); Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2013) could be used to estimate abundance of the eastern Chukchi subpopulation.<em> </em>That analysis (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2017) estimated there were 5,547 (CV 0.22) surface-visible Belugas in the study area in 2012. Data from SDRs were used to develop correction factors to account for animals that were missed because they were outside of the study area or diving too deep to be seen, resulting in a total abundance estimate of 20,752 whales (CV 0.70). Trend in abundance is unknown but there are several other years of ASAMM survey data that could be analyzed to look for changes over time. <br/></p>  <p>The most recent estimate of abundance for the eastern Beaufort Sea Beluga stock is 39,258 whales (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>This number was derived from aerial surveys conducted in the Mackenzie Delta and eastern Beaufort Sea in 1992 that estimated 19,629 (CV 0.23) surface visible Belugas (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 1996) and a correction factor to account for submerged whales.<em> </em>Synoptic surveys for Belugas were conducted in the region only in 1992, but Beluga sightings were recorded during offshore Bowhead Whale (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) surveys in 1982, 1984, 1985, and 2007-09. The number of Belugas counted at the surface was substantially higher during the 2007-09 surveys but it is unclear whether this was due to a shift in distribution or population increase (Harwood and Kingsley 2013). <br/></p>  <p>An isolated subpopulation of Belugas occurs in Cook Inlet, Alaska where they reside throughout the year (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005, Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2012, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Sightings are occasionally made outside of Cook Inlet in the Gulf of Alaska (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2000), and there is a small group (&lt; 20 animals) that is apparently resident in Yakutat Bay approximately 600 km to the east (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is considered to be part of the Cook Inlet stock (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Beluga abundance in the Inlet, including corrections for availability and sightability, is determined using aerial counts and video analysis of whale groups (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2000). The 2014 survey produced an estimate of 340 whales (CV 0.08; Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<em> </em>Abundance declined by nearly 50% between 1988 and 1994, and by about 1.3%/year during 1994-2014 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2015, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Canada and Greenland</strong></p><p>There are currently three main population centers for Belugas in Arctic Canada, High Arctic-Baffin Bay (HA-BB), Cumberland Sound, and Hudson Bay. A subpopulation that once occurred in southwest Greenland in winter is likely extirpated (NAMMCO in prep.). HA-BB Belugas summer mostly in nearshore waters around Somerset Island (Koski and Davis 1980, Smith and Martin 1994) and winter in northern Baffin Bay and off West Greenland (Doidge and Finley 1993, Heide-Jørgensen and Laidre 2004). An aerial survey of the Canadian High Arctic in summer 1996 produced an availability-adjusted abundance estimate of 21,213 whales (95% CI 10,985-32,619; Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>A 2012 winter survey off West Greenland resulted in a corrected estimate of 9,072 Belugas (CV 0.32) (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling by Innes and Stewart (2002) indicated a major decline in HA-BB Beluga abundance occurred between 1981 and 1994.<em> </em>Current trend in abundance is unknown. </p>  The Cumberland Sound Beluga subpopulation remains in the Cumberland Sound area throughout the year (Richard and Stewart 2008). Aerial surveys were conducted in typically used portions of the Sound in 2014, and abundance was estimated using a combination of visual surveys and photographic counts.<em> </em>The total abundance estimate (corrected for availability bias) was 1,151 whales (95% CI 761–1,744; Marcoux <em>et al</em>. 2016). Marcoux and Hammill (2016) constructed a model of this subpopulation using survey data collected during 1980-2014 and harvest data for 1920-2015.<em> </em>Results indicated that current abundance is substantially reduced compared to 1960 and that abundance is still declining.          <p>Four Beluga stocks occur in the Hudson Bay region.<em> </em>The eastern Hudson Bay (EHB) and western Hudson Bay (WHB) stocks summer in the regions for which they are named and winter principally in Hudson Strait (NAMMCO in prep.). Although some interbreeding occurs on the wintering grounds (Turgeon <em>et al</em>. 2012), genetic studies show that the two groups are distinct (deMarch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Colbeck <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that cultural transmission of migration routes exists which likely acts to minimize interchange between the groups.<em> </em>Systematic aerial surveys of EHB Belugas have been flown seven times since 1985. Surveys flown in 2015 produced an availability-corrected estimate of abundance of 3,819 whales (CV 0.43; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling of the series of survey estimates and harvest data for 1972-2016 indicates that abundance declined during 1974-2002, but has been stable since then (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Abundance of WHB Belugas was most recently estimated from visual and photographic aerial surveys flown in summer 2015. The availability-corrected estimate of total abundance was 54,473 whales (95% CI 44,988-65,957; Matthews <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Because of bad weather conditions, this estimate did not include the Ontario coast where nearly 15,000 whales were estimated in 2004 (Richard 2005). A comparison of surface abundance estimates from 2015 and 2004 for five strata surveyed in both years showed that 2015 counts were about 6% higher (NAMMCO in prep.). Belugas use James Bay in large numbers during the summer and remain in that region during winter (Bailleul <em>et al</em>. 2012).<em> </em>The 2015 aerial survey estimated availability-corrected abundance as 10,615 (CV 0.25; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Estimates from similar surveys conducted from1985 to 2011 ranged from 4,720 to 19,439 whales so the trend in abundance is unclear. Belugas were once abundant in Ungava Bay, with summer aggregations in and near several rivers.<em> </em>Numbers are now greatly diminished with no animals sighted on-transect during aerial surveys conducted there since 1983 (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>However, some Belugas still occur occasionally in the area as indicated by off-transect sightings during aerial surveys (Kingsley 2000) and land-based sightings (Doidge <em>et al</em>. 1994). Using data from surveys conducted during 1985-2008, Doniol-Valcroze and Hammill (2012) estimated Ungava Bay Beluga abundance to be 32 individuals (95% CI 0-94).   </p><p>&#160;A relict subpopulation of Belugas occurs in the Saint Lawrence River estuary (SLE) that is isolated from all other subpopulations both geographically and genetically (Brown Gladden <em>et al</em>. 1999; de March and Postma 2003). Both the core range used in summer and the total range of SLE Belugas have shrunk considerably since the 1930s (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2010). The size of the SLE subpopulation is believed to have declined from 7,800 whales in the 1866 to about 1,000 in 1985 (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2007).<em> </em>Abundance has been monitored since 1988 using photographic aerial surveys.<em> </em>An integrated population model using survey counts and vital rates indicated that abundance increased slowly between the 1960s and early 2000s then declined to an estimated 889 in 2012 (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Svalbard and Russian Arctic </strong></p>  <p>The Svalbard Beluga subpopulation is geographically isolated and genetically differentiated from subpopulations to the east and west (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2010). During the ice-free season Belugas in the archipelago are found very nearshore, often at the faces of glaciers (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>During winter, sea ice formation causes them to move offshore somewhat but they remain in the Svalbard area (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>Currently there is no abundance estimate for Svalbard Belugas but the first ever survey was to be conducted in summer 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>The Beluga subpopulation in the White Sea is genetically differentiated from other subpopulations (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>In summer, the whales are seen in several aggregation areas in the major bays (Andrianov <em>et al</em>., 2009, Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010a, Alekseeva <em>et al</em>., 2012). While some investigators believe that in winter Belugas move to the Barents Sea, they are seen in the White Sea in March (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and all of the Belugas tracked with satellite-linked tags have stayed in the White Sea (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2012, Svetochev and Svetocheva 2012, Kuznetsova <em>et al</em>. 2016). Aerial surveys for belugas were flown in the White Sea in July six times during 2005-2011. The abundance estimate for 2011 was 5,593 whales (CV 0.14), and estimates from prior years ranged from 5,009 to 7,464 (Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012a). Available data suggest that abundance is stable. <br/></p>  <p>Belugas have been recorded at many other locations along the Arctic coast of Russia, including the Kara, Barents, Laptev, and East Siberian seas as well as Nova Zemlya and Franz Josef Land (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964, Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012b). A compilation of observations made during 1958-1995 from sea ice reconnaissance flights showed many sightings in coastal and offshore waters from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea but few observations in the East Siberian Sea (Belikov and Boltunov 2002). Boltunov and Belikov (2002) considered that the primary summer habitats are near Franz Josef Land and in the Kara Sea and western Laptev Sea, and that most of Belugas from this region winter in the Barents Sea. There are no estimates of current abundance, but given the size of the area and the number of animals taken by historical whaling (Boltunov and Belikov 2002), it is likely that Belugas were once numerous there.<em></em><br/></p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p>Summing the various estimates above gives a total of approximately 195,000 Belugas in the surveyed subpopulations. Because no abundance estimates are  available for Svalbard and the Russian High Arctic and the estimate for the White Sea is not corrected for availability, it is nearly certain that total rangewide abundance is more than 200,000. Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) calculated that in a pristine Beluga population 68% of all individuals would be mature. Using that value the total number of mature Belugas is estimated at about 136,000. The number of mature Belugas in the largest subpopulation, WHB, is about 37,000.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Generation time is an important parameter for several of the IUCN Red List criteria, and calculations of generation time require an accurate method for determining or estimating ages of individuals. For Beluga Whales, this has been done primarily by counting layers in the teeth of harvested or stranded animals. Counts of growth layer groups (GLGs) have usually been converted to age in years assuming there were two GLGs formed each year (Brodie 1971, Sergeant 1973, Burns and Seaman 1988, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Formation of two GLGs per year was supported by examination of teeth from captive, known age, individuals (Brodie 1982, Goren <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Stewart <em>et al</em>. (2006) measured the incorporation of atomic bomb radiocarbon into Beluga tooth GLGs, and used those measures to estimate age. When those estimates were compared to ages based on formation of one GLG versus two GLGs/year, the data fit the one GLG/year assumption. Lockyer <em>et al</em>. (2007) examined 10 teeth from captive Belugas and found clear support for one GLG/year in six of the specimens, but results for the others were equivocal.  Hohn <em>et al</em>. (2016) considered that the bomb radiocarbon study and long-term photoidentification studies showed that GLG deposition is “unquestionably annual.” (also see Matthews and Ferguson 2014). However, Brodie <em>et al</em>. (2013) continued to argue for two GLGs/year, based on field observations of Beluga life history parameters in Cumberland Sound, captive animal studies, and suggested problems with studies that support one GLG/year. Using the assumption of two GLGs/year, Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated generation time for belugas as 16.4 years for a population in a pre-disturbance state. If one GLG/year is actually the case, generation time would be much longer, but calculations using that assumption have not been done.</p><span lang=""EN-CA""><p>Data on historical sizes of Beluga subpopulations are sparse. Innes and Stewart (2002) estimated the historical carrying capacity (K) of the HA-BB  subpopulation as 39,790 whales. Bettridge <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated K for Sakhalin - Amur Belugas as between 13,200 and 20,800. Cumberland Sound Belugas were estimated to number 3,100 in 1960 (Marcoux and Hammill 2016). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated that there were 6,663 Belugas in EHB in 1974. Abundance of                    Cook Inlet Belugas  in 1979 was estimated at 1,293 (NMFS 2003). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated that there were 7,800 Belugas (standard error 600) in the SLE in 1866. Comparing these figures with those for the most recent abundance estimates given above suggests a reduction of 88% for SLE belugas, and 28-74% for the other five subpopulations. While these comparisons show that some stocks have been substantially depleted and remain in that state, a species-wide reduction in abundance cannot be calculated. The difficulty of such a calculation is compounded by the lack of agreement on calibration of tooth layers for age estimation, which is central to determining generation length and the amount of depletion over time. The combined abundance of those six subpopulations known to be depleted constitutes less than 20% of the current species-wide abundance estimate, and there is no reason to think that all of the remaining subpopulations are similarly depleted.    </p><span lang=""EN-CA""></span>",Unknown,"<p>Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. (1964) correctly noted that “The Beluga is widely distributed throughout the northern seas.”<em> </em>More recent and more detailed mapping (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014) confirms that Belugas are widely distributed in Arctic regions, occurring nearly throughout northern waters of Russia, Alaska, Canada, West Greenland, and Svalbard. Gaps in the distribution occur off North and East Greenland and perhaps in central Russia. Sightings and telemetry studies show that Belugas occur north of 80° N latitude at Svalbard (Vacquié-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017), and north of western Russia (Belikov and Boltunov 2002) and Alaska (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>Subpopulations in the Okhotsk Sea and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence occur in Subarctic waters as far south as 50° N (Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2010) and 47° N (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2012) respectively. Belugas have been recorded as vagrant at Japan, New Jersey and Washington State USA, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Scotland, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark (Rice 1998).</p>","<p></p><p>In the past Belugas were hunted commercially at several locations but that is no longer the case. They are legally hunted for food by indigenous communities in several parts of their range, including western and northern Alaska (Frost and Suydam 2010), western and eastern Canada (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2017), some parts of Russia (D. Litovka pers. comm.), and Greenland (Heide-Jørgensen and Rosing-Asvid 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Legally-harvested Beluga products may be sold in Alaska Native communities. Some illegal hunting may also occur, particularly in parts of Russia (NAMMCO, in prep.). Russia allows Belugas in the White Sea and in the Sakhalin Bay - Amur River delta region to be live-captured for public display.<em> </em>Numbers taken in the White Sea are small (probably 5-6 or fewer per year, NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>The number live-captured at Sakahlin is more substantial, 0-81 per year during 2000-2017 (Shpak and Glazov 2014, NAMMCO, in prep.). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (2011) calculated the sustainable annual removal of Belugas from the Sakhalin subpopulation to be 29 whales. Records of historical kills were used in a population model to estimate that the Sakhalin - Amur subpopulation meets the definition of depleted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, which disallows imports for live display into the U.S. (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; <br/></p>",Marine,"<p>Although Belugas were hunted intensively on a commercial basis for oil and leather in many parts of their range during the 20th century, the only known direct removals at present are for food (subsistence use) and the aquarium trade. The Canada-Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga (JCNB) is expected to ensure the conservation of shared stocks of Belugas while NAMMCO is a regional management body to which Canada, Greenland, and Norway belong. Catch limits and other recommendations on conservation of belugas are made on the basis of advice from joint meetings of the JCNB’s Scientific Working Group and NAMMCO’s Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic. Catch levels from hunted Beluga subpopulations range anywhere from less than ten to a few hundred animals per year. There is concern that Cumberland Sound Belugas are being hunted at unsustainable levels (NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>Removals from the Bristol Bay, Eastern Bering Sea, Eastern Chukchi Sea, and Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations are considered sustainable (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). In both Canada (Richard and Pike 1993) and Alaska (Adams <em>et al</em>. 1993), indigenous peoples’ organizations have entered into co-management agreements with government agencies to work on conservation of Beluga stocks. Harvests from the Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulation occur in both Alaska and Canada, and that is managed by an agreement between the North Slope Borough (Alaska) and the Inuvialuit Game Council (Canada).</p><p></p><p>As a species, the Beluga is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

The only definitely surviving breeding population is in the eastern North Pacific. The North Atlantic breeding population is extinct, and the western North Pacific breeding population is possibly extinct.</p>","Gray Whales are unusual for large whales. They are primarily bottom feeders and are thus restricted to shallow continental shelf waters for feeding. They are largely coastal although they do occur at greater distances from shore on the shallow continental shelf of the Bering and Chukchi seas (Rice and Wolman (1971). Gray whales feed primarily on swarming mysids, tube-dwelling amphipods, and polychaete tube worms in the northern parts of their range, but are also known to take red crabs, baitfish, and other food (crab larvae, mobile amphipods, herring eggs and larvae, cephalopods, and megalops larvae) opportunistically or off the main feeding grounds (Nerini 1984). In one of their main feeding grounds in the Chukchi Sea, Gray Whale densities were highest in areas with high benthic amphipod abundance (Brower <em>et al</em>. 2016). Gray Whale feeding may have a dramatic effect on benthic invertebrate communities (Oliver and Slattery 1985). <br/><br/>Gray Whales are often preyed upon by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em> (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2007).","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Gray Whales have been hunted since prehistoric times, and were particularly vulnerable to whalers due to their slow swimming speeds and coastal distribution. The North Atlantic population was extinct by the early 1700s, although it is unclear whether this was due primarily to hunting (Mead and Mitchell 1984). Gray Whales were hunted in prehistoric times on both sides of the North Pacific, but aboriginal catches declined to relatively low levels by the early 20th century due largely to depletion of the stocks by commercial whaling (Mitchell 1979).</p>  <p></p>  <p>Over-exploitation had been thought to have caused the extinction of the western North Pacific breeding population by the 1970s (Bowen 1974) but its probable continued existence in some form is noted above. The eastern North Pacific breeding population had reached such low numbers by the end of the 19th century that commercial whaling ceased, but it has now recovered to at or near carrying capacity, its abundance showing some fluctuation in response to environmental conditions. </p>  <p>Gray Whales are subject to anthropogenic threats such as entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes. Scordino <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated about 10 fatalities per year in the eastern North Pacific and the Bering Sea resulting from known incidents during 2010-15, of which ~80% involved entanglement in fishing gear and ~20% from ship strikes. The threat seems small in relation to the population size of 25,000-30,000 animals, but there are fisheries with little observer coverage, such as the Alaska gillnet fisheries, such that total mortality rates may be higher (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; </p>  <p>Entanglement rates in the western North Pacific appear to have been comparatively high relative to abundance: out of only 18 records of Gray Whales on the Pacific coast of Japan during 2000-16, there were 10 live sightings, 4 entanglements, and 4 strandings (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2016). No further entanglements in Japanese waters have been reported since 2008 when Gray Whales in Japan acquired legal protection against deliberate killing and commercial utilization, but it is unclear whether this is coincidental. A Gray Whale death from entanglement was recorded in the Taiwan Strait in 2011 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/></p>  <p>Salmon trap nets have been set at least since 2013 in Gray Whale  feeding grounds off northeastern Sakhalin, with at least one observed entanglement and at least one probable entanglement death (Lowry <em>et al</em>. submitted). Based on analysis of photographs, approximately 20% of Gray Whales observed off Sakhalin during 1995-2005 showed evidence of scarring from past entanglements (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2009), but it is not known where the scars were acquired. <br/></p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Seven to eight times more gray whales than average washed ashore on the US coast in 1999 and 2000, but the causes of this unusual mortality event have not been conclusively identified (Gulland <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  Perryman <em>et al</em>. (2002) and Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that Gray Whale  calf production is positively correlated with the length of the ice-free season in the main feeding grounds in the preceding season. While this would imply that reduced ice coverage, as predicted by most climate models, could benefit Gray Whales in the short term, the longer term effects of arctic climate change on Gray Whales are unknown. There is some evidence that the distribution on the winter breeding grounds shifts northward in warm (El Niño) years and southward in cool (La Niña) years (Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. 2015). This trend seems to have continued in 2015 and 2016, with lower Gray Whale counts in the more southerly Bahia Magdalena Lagoon complex (24-25°N) compared to the previous years and with water temperatures 2.0-3.5° higher than in 2012-13 (Urbán <em>et al</em>. 2016). The conservation implications in the context of a general trend towards higher water temperatures and more frequent El Niño conditions are unclear.<p></p>  Plastic debris has been found in stomachs of dead Gray Whales but does not appear to have been a significant factor in the deaths of the individuals concerned.","<p></p><p>Gray Whales in the eastern North Pacific were rapidly depleted by commercial whalers after the wintering concentrations in lagoons along the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, were discovered in the mid-19th century. Peak catches, averaging over 480 whales per year, occurred between 1855 and 1865. Lagoon whaling ended by about 1875, apparently due to exhaustion of the lagoon populations, but shore-based whaling in California continued at a lower level until the late 19th century (Henderson 1984, IWC 1993, Reeves and Smith 2010). In the 20th century, there were some pelagic catches off California and Mexico by Norwegian and American vessels in the 1920s and 1930s, and in the 1930s and 1940s by the Soviet pelagic fleet in the Bering and Chukchi seas (Allison 2017). A further 320 Gray Whales were taken under scientific permit in the 1960s (Rice and Wolman 1971), and 138 illegal Soviet catches occurred in the 1960s (Doroshenko 2000). “Aboriginal subsistence” whaling resumed in the Bering and Chukchi seas off Chukotka in 1948 and has continued into the present, apart from an interruption in the early 1990s. Reported catches during the years 1985-2016 averaged 118 per year. Very small numbers have also been taken by aboriginal whalers in Alaska, and by the Makah tribe in Washington State (IWC 2017). <br/></p>  <p>Despite the continuing catches, the eastern North Pacific population has recovered strongly from past over-exploitation, increasing by 2.5% per year during 1967-96 (Buckland and Breiwick 2002). Abundance seems to have peaked around 1997/98 when a census on the southward migration indicated a population of 24,000-36,000 (Laake <em>et al</em>. 2012). There followed a reduction in population size, with some recovery in recent years. The most recent abundance estimate is 26,960 (95% confidence interval 24,420-29,830) from the 2015/16 southbound migration survey off California (Durban <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2017).&#160; <br/></p>  <p>There was a downturn in population condition around the turn of the millenium involving poor calf production, high stranding rates, and relatively high numbers of emaciated animals (LeBouef <em>et al.</em> 2000, IWC 2003, Rugh <em>et al.</em> 2005). An observed die-off involved at least 651 whales between 1999 and 2001 (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2016). Perryman <em>et al.</em> (2002) showed that calf production was related to the proportion of feeding habitat free of sea ice in the preceding summer. Since 2002, calf production has recovered, and mortality and the occurrence of emaciated whales have declined (IWC 2004). The presence of female-calf pairs has also recently increased in Laguna San Ignacio, Baja California Sur (Swartz <em>et al</em>. 2012). The population has probably reached a size where it exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment in years when food availability is below average, and is likely to fluctuate around some environmentally determined average level.</p><p>The Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) was estimated at 243 whales (standard error 19) in 2015 and has shown some increase in recent years (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; <br/></p>The combined feeding aggregations off northeastern Sakhalin and southeastern Kamchatka were estimated to number 271-311 whales (excluding calves) in 2016, of which 175-192 were predominantly Sakhalin-feeding whales. The Sakhalin component has been increasing at 2-5% per year. Based on evidence of migration to the eastern North Pacific from tags and photo-identification matches between Sakhalin/Kamchatka and Mexico, it was estimated that at most 100 of the Sakhalin/Kamchatka whales migrate to wintering grounds in the western North Pacific (Cooke 2017). <p>Given documented catches of about 2,000 gray whales in Korean waters  during 1890-1966 (Kato and Kasuya 2002), and the lack of sightings in  Korean waters since 1977, the western breeding population, if it still  exists, is likely at a very small fraction of its original abundance.<br/></p>",Stable,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>Gray Whales are now regularly found only in the North Pacific and adjacent seas. They congregate in winter in or around various lagoons along the west coast of Baja California (Mexico) and small numbers also occur in winter in the Gulf of California and along the Mexican mainland. Some calves are born during the southward migration and the remainder are born in shallow bays and lagoons on the west coast of Baja California (Jones and Swartz 2002). In spring, the population migrates to feeding grounds mainly in the shallow waters of the northwestern Bering Sea and the southern Chukchi and Beaufort seas, with some individuals migrating as far westward as Kamchatka and Sakhalin, Russia (Weller <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mate <em>et al</em>. 2015). Some Gray Whales also summer and feed along the Pacific coast of North America from northern California to Kodiak Island, Alaska; those animals are known as the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p></p>Former whaling grounds off Korea and southwestern Japan indicate the existence of a separate western North Pacific or Asian population that migrated to breeding grounds south of the Korean Peninsula, based on the seasonality of catches in the Korean grounds (Weller <em>et al</em>. 2002, Kato and Kasuya 2002). The last sighting in Korean waters was in 1977, and recent surveys in Korean waters have failed to find any Gray Whales (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Gray Whales, including mothers with calves, return every year to a feeding ground off northeastern Sakhalin (Weller <em>et al</em>.  1999). This group was until recently thought to be a remnant of the  western breeding stock that was exploited in the Korean whaling grounds;  the Russian name “Korean-Okhotsk gray whale” for this population was  based on this assumption. Tracking with satellite-linked tags and  photo-matching data (Mate <em>et al</em>. 2015, Weller <em>et al</em>.  2012) show that at least some of the Sakhalin whales migrate to the  eastern North Pacific in winter. However, the number of movements  recorded to date has not been sufficient to conclude that all Gray  Whales observed off Sakhalin belong to the eastern breeding population  (Cooke <em>et al.</em> 2017, IWC 2017).  <br/>  <p>Since 1990, about 30 sightings and strandings have been documented in Japan, mainly on the Pacific coast (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2016). These include at least one reproductive female moving between Sakhalin and Japan and one individual seen in successive years alternately off Sakhalin in summer and off Japan in winter and spring (Weller <em>et al</em>. 2016, Nakamura <em>et al</em>. 2017). There have also been a few strandings on the coast of mainland China from the northern Yellow Sea to the Hainan Strait in the south (Zhu and Yue 1998), and one animal caught in fishing gear in the Taiwan Strait in 2011 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015). Therefore, at least some of the Gray Whales that feed in the Okhotsk Sea migrate into Japanese waters and possibly farther south in winter;&#160;these may be a remnant of the historical Asian Gray Whale population, but it is not known whether there exists an Asian calving and nursery aggregation, as occurs in Baja California. <br/> <br/> Gray Whales were once present in the North Atlantic as well as the North Pacific. Sub-fossil remains, the most recent dated to around 1675, have been found on the eastern seaboard of North America from Florida to New Jersey and on the coasts of the English Channel and the North and Baltic seas (Mead and Mitchell 1984). There are historical accounts of living Gray Whales from Iceland in the early 1600s and possibly off New England in the early 1700s (Rice 1998). </p>  A few rare occurrences of Gray Whales outside their normal range have recently been documented. One was seen in May 2010 in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel, and a few days later again off Spain (Scheinin <em>et al.</em> 2011). A Gray Whale was found stranded on the coast of El Salvador in July 2010, the southernmost record known in the Pacific Ocean (previously, the southernmost record was in Bahía de Banderas, Mexico) (Barraza 2011). A Gray Whale was seen in May 2013 off Namibia, possibly a juvenile and the only report to date of a Gray Whale in the Southern Hemisphere (Elwen and Gridley 2013).","<p>Commercial whaling of Gray Whales has ceased, but aboriginal subsistence whaling continues, primarily off Chukotka with a few taken in some years in Alaska. The IWC permitted a catch of 744 Gray Whales during the years 2013-18 with a maximum of 140 in any one year.</p>",Marine,"<p>Gray Whales have been protected from commercial whaling by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling since its entry into force in 1948, and by its predecessor convention since 1936. Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling is permitted by the IWC, and catch limits have been set since the 1970s on the basis of advice from its Scientific Committee (most recently under its new aboriginal subsistence whaling management procedure) and requests from the relevant governments (Russian Federation and U.S.A.). The current (2013-2018) catch limit for the eastern subpopulation is 744 for the six years, subject to a maximum of 140 in any single year (IWC 2017). </p>  Three Gray Whale breeding lagoons in Mexico (Laguna Ojo de Liebre, Laguna San Ignacio, and Laguna Guerrero Negro) enjoy some protection in the form of limitations on boating, fishing, and coastal development, originally as National Gray Whale Refuges, now through their inclusions in the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, which is also listed internationally as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Ramsar protected wetland (Hoyt 2005).<br/> <br/> The Gray Whale has a measure of legal protection in Russian waters through inclusion in the Russian Federation Red Book of Threatened Species: the Korean-Okhotsk subpopulation is listed as Endangered while the eastern North Pacific population, which migrates in Russian waters in summer, is listed as “Recovery and Restoration”. The Gray Whale has been legally protected in Japan since 2008: deliberate killing and commercial utilization are prohibited.

The current global population is estimated at 135,000 and the mature population at about 84,000, which is higher than the level of three generations ago. This is true of the global population as well as the three main regional populations individually – North Pacific, North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. The species does not, therefore, qualify for a Red List threatened category, and is listed as Least Concern. The Arabian Sea subpopulation appears to be isolated, is very small, and is listed separately as Endangered (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p></p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>With few exceptions, such as the Arabian Sea population, Humpback Whales undertake long migrations between breeding grounds in tropical coastal waters in winter to feeding grounds in middle and high latitudes (Clapham 2018).<br/> <br/> In the Southern Hemisphere, they appear to feed mainly in the antarctic and subantarctic, where the diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids (Krill, <em>Euphausia superba</em>) (Mackintosh 1970), although some feeding has been observed in the Benguela Current ecosystem on the migration route west of South Africa (Best <em>et al</em>. 1995); suspected prey species in that region are euphausiids (<em>E. lucens</em><em>)</em> and amphipods (<em>Themisto gaudichaudii</em><em>)</em>. Some Humpback Whales feed in summer in mid-latitude (41°-44°S) Chilean waters (Hucke-Gaete<em> et al</em>. 2013) <br/> <br/> Few data on diet in other areas are available. Humpback Whales caught off Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1950s and 1960s were consuming mainly Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) (Mitchell 1973). Those caught off California in the early 20th century were eating mainly euphausiids and sardines (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1997). Humpback Whales caught in the northern North Pacific in the 1950s were feeding mainly on euphausiids and fish (Nemoto 1959). In areas of Alaska and the North Atlantic, Humpback Whales have also been observed feeding in coordinated fashion on schools of Pacific Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), Sand Lance (<em>Ammodytes</em> spp.), and (more rarely) Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>), herding the school together with bubble nets, clouds or curtains (Hain <em>et al</em>. 1982).<br/> <br/> The timing of acquisition of tooth rake marks attributable to Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) indicates that Humpback Whale calves, but usually not subadults and adults, are subject to predation (Mehta <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Although modern commercial whaling seriously depleted all Humpback populations, some of which had already been reduced by pre-modern whaling, the species has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and there have been substantial increases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. Humpback whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling worldwide since 1966, and there have been few catches since 1968. It is unclear whether there has been any recovery in the small, isolated population in the Arabian Sea.<br/><br/>Today, small numbers only are taken for local consumption in Greenland (up to 10 annually) and the island of Bequia (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) (up to four annually), with occasional takes elsewhere (IWC 2018b).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales, along with North Atlanatic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena</em> <em>glacialis</em>), seem to be the most vulnerable of the large whales to becoming accidentally entangled, often fatally, in fishing gear and sometimes other debris. They are also vulnerable to injury by ship strikes, which can also be fatal. In most areas, the majority of entanglements (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also the majority of ship strikes, are likely to go undetected, but there is no generally accepted method for extrapolating from the observed events to estimate totals.<br/><br/>State members of the IWC are encouraged to report bycatches and ship strikes annually to the IWC, but few do so. The figures submitted in 2018 for entanglements include: USA 78 (26 in the Atlantic in 2015, 52 in the Pacific in 2016); Australia 46; Greenland 5, Japan 3, and New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, and Spain (1 each) (Hughes 2019). The reported ship strike numbers were: USA 13, Australia 5, and Brazil 1. &#160;The figures include some potentially non-fatal incidents (such as whales entangled and released).<br/><br/>Minimum estimates of average annual deaths in US waters are: west coast (2012-16) - 16.7 from entanglement and 2.1 from ship strikes (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2018); east coast (2010-14) ­– 7.2 from entanglements and 1.8 from ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Alaska and Hawaii (2011-15) − 18 from entanglements in fishing gear, 2.8 from unspecified marine debris, and 4.4 from ship strikes (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018). Urbán <em>et al</em>. (2017) reported 95 cases of entanglement of Humpback Whales on the Mexican Pacific coast during 2004-2017 of which 42 were released, 6 died and the fate of the others was either unknown or considered not to be severely injured.<br/><br/>In a study of Humpback entanglements in Scottish fishing gear during 1992-2016, Ryan <em>et al</em>. (2016) found that most Humpback Whales spent only brief periods in Scottish waters, but that the entanglement rate per day of whale presence was such that it would be unsustainable for a population that fed regularly in Scottish waters.<br/><br/>The distribution of Humpbacks in the Arabian Sea overlaps that of fisheries known to be dangerous to Humpbacks, and 30-40% of the photographed whales showed entanglement-related scars (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The last comprehensive assessment of North Atlantic Humpback Whales was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2002 (IWC 2003), but more recent data are available for some areas. The abundance estimate for the West Indies group of breeding aggregations, obtained from photographic capture-recapture, was 10,752 whales in 1992-93 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.07) with an estimated annual rate of increase of 3.1% (standard error (SE) 0.5%) over the period 1979-93 (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2003). The latest abundance estimate for part of the Cape Verde Island population is 260 during 2010-2013, also from&#160;photographic capture-recapture&#160;(Ryan<em> et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The most recent estimates of abundance in the individual summer feeding grounds are: Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy - 823 in 2008 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Canadian Atlantic (Newfoundland, Labrador, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and Scotia Shelf) - 2,080 (CV 0.22) in 2007 (Lawson <em>and</em> Gosselin 2009); West Greenland - 993 (CV 0.46) in 2015 (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); East Greenland coastal and central North Atlantic (Iceland, East Greenland, Faeroes, Jan Mayen) 10,031 (CV 0.36) in 2015 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018); northeastern Atlantic (British Isles, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea) 1,450 (CV 0.29) in 2001 (Øien <em>et al</em>. 2009). These estimates total about 15,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.25.<br/><br/>The abundance of Humpback Whales in the Gulf of Maine and northwestern Atlantic was estimated to be growing at 6.5% per year during 1979-91 (Barlow and Clapham 1997) but the rate of increase was less than 4% per year during 1992-2000 (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003). Abundance in the central North Atlantic (East Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands) increased sharply from 1987 to 1995 but there has been no clear trend since then (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were subject to significant removals by pre-modern whalers especially in their wintering grounds in the West Indies and Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Reeves 2003). Whaling in the West Indies (including Bermuda) is partially documented from 1664, but the main period was 1826-1928, during which about 8,600 whales were estimated to have been killed (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001). Whaling in the Cape Verde Islands occurred primarily during 1850-1912 with a total estimated kill of about 3,000 animals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Humpbacks were exploited by modern whalers in their summer feeding grounds from the 1860s, especially off Iceland and Norway (Jonsgård 1977<em>,</em> Allison 2017). About 3,200 Humpback Whales were recorded taken by early modern whaling during 1880-1916, mainly off northern Norway and Iceland. Allowing for a substantial struck and lost rate in early modern whaling, and considering that about 20% of the recorded catch of whales was unspecified to species, the total kill in this period may have exceeded 5,000 Humpback Whales.<br/><br/>About 1,500 Humpback Whales are reported to have been killed in the North Atlantic since 1916, from a variety of areas including the British Isles, Faeroes, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, and eastern Canada, as well as Norwegian pelagic catches. Humpback Whales were protected from commercial whaling in the North Atlantic from the 1955 season by the IWC, except for small catches off Greenland (IWC 1954). However, catch levels had become very low by the 1920s, despite continued high catches of Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>). This suggests that the Humpback population was low at that time.<br/><br/>Attempts to estimate pre-whaling populations from catch, abundance and trend data have yielded inconclusive results (IWC 2003<em>,</em> Punt <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, the current population level is probably considerably higher than the 1942 level because only a small number of Humpbacks (377) were caught between 1942 and the start of the period (from 1979) over which an increase has been documented.<br/><br/>Using genetic methods, Roman and Palumbi (2004) estimated the pre-whaling population of&#160;Humpback Whales in the North Atlantic to be 240,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 156,000-401,000). However, their method assumed that North Atlantic Humpback Whales form a single clade, which they do not (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hence, the Roman and Palumbi estimate would be expected to reflect the global abundance of Humpback Whales prior to whaling rather than the North Atlantic population.<em><strong><br/><br/>North Pacific</strong></em><br/>The total abundance of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific was estimated by photographic capture-recapture at 21,063 (CV 0.04) during 2004-06 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). A comparable estimate from 1993-96 data, calculated retrospectively, was 9,500. The population appeared to have been increasing since 1980 at rates of 5-8% per year in each of the areas with sufficient data to estimate trend (Calambokidis and Barlow 2017). More recent data from the U.S. west coast suggest that numbers there have levelled off (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Using a different model for the relation between summering and wintering grounds applied to the same data as Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2011), Wade <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2016, revised by Wade 2017) estimated a total of 15,805 for the wintering grounds and 16,225 for the feeding grounds. It is not clear why Wade’s totals are lower than Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>.’s, but all evidence indicates that the Hawaiian group is the largest of the wintering populations, comprising 10,000-12,000 whales and making up at least half of the total North Pacific population. Estimates for the other breeding populations are Mexican (2,000-5,000), Asian (1,000-2,000) and Central American (300-1,000); no estimate exists for the Western Pacific (Mariana Islands) area.<br/><br/>Independent of the above data, the abundance of Humpback Whales in the eastern North Pacific (170°E to 135°W) and the eastern Bering Sea has been estimated from the Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment (POWER) series of sightings surveys at 14,407 (CV 0.56) (Inai <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Humpback Whales are also abundant west of these areas, in the western Bering Sea and near the western Aleutian Islands, eastern and western Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands (Miyashita <em>et al</em> 2006<em>,</em> Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>,</em> Gushcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were hunted in Japan at least since 1570 and catching probably increased with the development of net-assisted whaling from circa 1677 (Kasuya 2018). The number taken is very uncertain because detailed catch figures prior to the 20th century are available from only two of about a dozen locations where whaling occurred in southern Japan, on both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts (Omura 1986).&#160;The proportion of whales killed but lost is also unclear: although quite high rates of escape were indicated, it is unclear how many of these would have been mortally wounded. A single whaling firm operating in Kyushu (southwestern Japan), among several known to have been active, took 21,790 whales between 1725 and 1874, of which the majority were likely Humpbacks judging from the species breakdown at neighbouring locations. The data suggest a decline towards the end of the 19th century, but not as marked as for North Pacific Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena japonica</em>).<br/><br/>Building on the works of Maury (1852) and Townsend (1935), Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted by month the positions of about 250 catches and a few sightings of Humpbacks in the North Pacific from a sample of logbooks of American sail whalers in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.&#160;Humpback Whales occurred in most of the summering and wintering areas known today, including the Sea of Japan and Okhotsk Sea. The logbooks are thought to comprise about 10% of all American voyages, but it is unclear how representative they are, especially of the earlier voyages. Furthermore, at least some European vessels were also active in the North Pacific.&#160;It is possible that a few thousand Humpback Whales were taken. Also in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, American shore-based whalers operating on the coast of California killed an estimated 2,000 Humpback Whales between 1854 and 1899 (Reeves <em>and</em> Smith 2010).<br/><br/>Modern whaling began in Japan in 1898 and catches by species are recorded since 1911. Humpback Whales made up only 2.0% (950 out of 47,343) of the catch of large whales in Japan (including the occupied Kuril Islands) during 1911-45, and only 0.2% (90 out of 48,010) of the catch of large whales in Japan during 1946-65 (Allison, 2017). Thus, the Asian migratory population was likely already depleted before the start of modern whaling, and already commercially extinct by the time the catching of Humpbacks in the North Pacific was prohibited by the IWC from 1966 (IWC 1965). Subgroups of the Asian wintering population that used more oceanic migratory corridors probably survived a bit longer, given that over 800 Humpbacks were taken in Ogasawara (Bonin Islands) between 1922-1945, nearly 800 in Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands) during 1958-62, and over 700 in Taiwan during 1920-39.<br/><br/>Approximately 18,000 Humpbacks are recorded as being taken by modern whaling along the American coasts during 1911-65 (5,000 in Alaska, 6,000 in British Columbia, 5,000 in California and Washington, and 2,000 off Baja California, Mexico) (Allison 2017). &#160;Modern pelagic whaling began in the 1930s and a total of over 8,000 Humpback Whales were taken, including 7,714 by fleets of the USSR, which illegally took 248 Humpback Whales after catches had been prohibited by the IWC (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Estimated catches of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific since 1942 total approximately 10,700 whales (Allison 2017). Given the evidence of an increase of over 10,000 whales between the 1980s and the early the 2000s, it is likely that the current population size in the North Pacific as a whole is above the 1942 level.<br/><br/>The Hawaiian wintering population is today the largest of the extant wintering populations. The 19<sup>th</sup> century records include relatively few catches or sightings of Humpbacks in this area, even though Hawaii was a major staging area for long-distance whalers in the Pacific. The thesis of Herman (1979) that Humpbacks were uncommon in Hawaii in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and earlier, based on the paucity of references to Humpbacks in contemporary accounts and local folklore, is controversial. However, it is plausible that Humpbacks were historically less abundant in Hawaii than they are today.<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Population estimates derived from photo-identification conducted in the Arabian Sea during 2000-04 were all less than 100 animals (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011). Provisional analysis of data collected during 2000-2015 yielded an abundance estimate of 89 whales (CV 0.26) in 2015, which may be negatively biased due to heterogeneity (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Soviet whaling fleet <em>Sovetskaya Ukraina</em> illegally took 238 Humpback Whales off the coasts of Oman, Pakistan, and northwestern India in November 1966 (Mikhalev 1997). The current population is very small and its current trend is not known. This population is listed separately as Endangered under Red List criterion D (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>Results of the IWC Scientific Committee’s multi-year “comprehensive assessment” of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, completed in 2015, are summarized by IWC (2016). The estimated total population size in 2015 was 97,000 (CI 78,000-118,000),&#160;obtained from a mix of photographic and genetic capture-recapture, aerial surveys, and shore-based censuses. The estimated total population size in 1942, from a fitted population model, was about 60,000 (confidence interval not given) while the estimated “pre-whaling” population size in 1900 was 138,000 (CI 112,000-198,000). All breeding populations were estimated to have recovered to a substantial fraction of their pre-whaling abundance, except for the West South Africa (BSB2) population, which may still be quite depleted.<br/><br/>The IWC comprehensive assessment assumed that catches by pre-modern whalers were small enough, or long enough ago, to be ignored. However, de Morais <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated catches of 11,000-33,000 Humpback Whales from pre-modern land whaling stations (armações) in Brazil during 1830-1924, and considered it likely that there had been similarly sizeable catches in the preceding century. From samples of logbooks of late 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century sail whalers, Townsend (1935) and Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted positions for about 2,000 Humpback catches and sightings in the Southern Hemisphere. These show presence of Humpbacks in most of the wintering grounds known today, except for northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef probably made access too risky. The 19<sup>th</sup> century whalers did not follow their prey to their Antarctic summering grounds. No attempt has yet been made to estimate total removals from the logbook samples.<br/><br/>The recorded catches by 20<sup>th</sup> century whaling in the Southern Hemisphere total about 220,000, after allowing for some Humpbacks among the 5,000 unspecified whales taken in the early years (Allison 2017). Of the total, about 83,500 were taken by pelagic whaling fleets in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, which started in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century mainly south of 55°S; about 40,000 from land stations in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, mainly at South Georgia; about 29,000 along the west coast of southern Africa (Gabon, Angola, Namibia, and western South Africa); about 20,000 in the southwestern Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mozambique, and Natal (South Africa); over 28,000 off western Australia; over 14,000 off eastern Australia and New Zealand; about 2,500 in the Southeast Pacific (Chile, Peru, and Ecuador); and about 2,000 off Brazil.<br/><br/>Attempts by the IWC to manage the hunting of Humpbacks in the Southern Hemisphere had limited effect. Takes of Humpbacks by pelagic fleets in the Southern Ocean (south of 40°S) were prohibited in the initial Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling that was adopted in 1946 and came into force in 1948. This ban was relaxed from 1950 to allow an annual catch of 1,250 Humpbacks, but the numerical limit was often exceeded and was dropped from 1954 when Humpback catching was instead limited to four days in February. From 1959, increasingly restrictive area limits were imposed. The report of an IWC expert group in June 1963 inferred from the continuing steep decline in the Humpback population that substantial unreported catches had occurred (Chapman 1964). The IWC finally banned all catching of Humpbacks throughout the Southern Hemisphere from 1964 (IWC 1965). Subsequently, it emerged that Humpback catches by the USSR fleets had indeed exceeded the reported values by about 46,000 whales, and had continued until 1968, with small takes continuing until 1973 (Zemsky <em>et al</em>. 1996<em>,</em> Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even before the 1964 Humpback ban, almost all of the additional Soviet catches had been illegal in at least one respect: they were either outside the permitted season, outside the permitted areas, below the minimum allowed body size, or of mothers with calves.<br/><br/>The IWC Scientific Committee’s recent comprehensive assessment, which took account of the previously unreported catches, showed that the current hemispheric population was, by now, very likely above its 1942 level. The assessment probably reflects the current population size and the trends over recent decades quite well, but both the estimates of pre-whaling population size, and the projections of future recovery, are probably more uncertain than the assessment results suggest, for the following reasons; firstly, as noted above, the pre-modern catches may not have been insignificant; secondly, simulation studies by Leaper <em>et al</em>. (2011) showed that alternative assumptions about density-dependent limitation can yield substantially different estimated population trajectories for both the past and the future; finally, Clapham and Zerbini (2015) cautioned that a key model assumption, that all historical breeding areas will be repopulated, may not hold when social factors are considered.<em><strong><br/><br/>Global Assessment</strong></em><br/>The mean age at first reproduction for Humpback Whales is estimated to be 10-12 years in the Southern Hemisphere (Best 2011) with a similar value in the North Pacific (Gabriele <em>et al</em>. 2007). Clapham (1992) reported a value of 5-7 years for Humpbacks in the Gulf of Maine, North Atlantic, but this increased to about 9 years for cohorts born in 1987 and later (Robbins 2007). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) cited 6 years as a reasonable default value, based on Clapham (1992). Taking a compromise value of 10 years, the generation time of 21.5 years estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) would become 25.5 years. Hence the 3-generation time window for applying the reduction criterion (A1) for a threatened category is 1942-2018.<br/><br/>Using the proportion mature of 0.62 estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007), the recent global population contains approximately 84,000 mature individuals out of a total of 135,000 whales. The population in 2018 is estimated to be above the 1942 level in each of the major ocean regions (North Atlantic, North Pacific, Southern Hemisphere). The small Arabian Sea population is probably below the 1942 level, because of the illegal catches taken in the 1960s.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p></p><p>The Humpback Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all the major ocean basins, and all but one of the subpopulations (that of the Arabian Sea) migrate between mating and calving grounds in tropical waters, usually near continental coastlines or island groups and productive colder-water feeding areas in temperate and high latitudes (Dawbin 1966, Clapham and Mead 1999). There tends to be strong, maternally directed fidelity to feeding and breeding grounds, but with some interchange between grounds, especially of males but also of females (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>Humpbacks in the North Atlantic range in summer from the Gulf of Maine in the west to the British Isles and Norway in the east. The northern extent of the Humpback's range includes the Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Davis Strait, but unlike Bowhead Whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>), they do not enter the pack ice. A number of main feeding grounds have been identified: Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, west of Greenland, west of Iceland, northeast Iceland, Jan Mayen, northern Norway, Bear Island, and western Svalbard (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Smaller numbers have been observed feeding in other areas such as the Hudson River Estuary (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2018). Humpback Whales are rare in the central and southern North Sea and there are very few records from the Baltic Sea. Humpback Whales were previously very rare in the Mediterranean Sea; there has been a notable increase in sightings since 1990, but they are still not common (Russo <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The main wintering grounds are in the West Indies and wider Caribbean region where they are found along the entire Antillean arc from Cuba to Venezuela (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The largest aggregations occur on Silver and Navidad Banks near the Dominican Republic, with much lower numbers in Samana Bay (Dominican Republic), off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico, and around the Virgin Islands and the eastern Antilles. Smaller numbers winter around the Cape Verde Islands (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009). There is some interchange of individuals between the eastern and western Atlantic wintering grounds (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2016), and some whales may remain in colder, more northern waters throughout the winter (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1993<em>,</em> Magnúsdóttir <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>,</em> Kowarski 2018).<br/><br/>While whales wintering in the Caribbean region have been matched photographically or genetically with whales in each of the summer feeding grounds, whales from the smaller Cape Verde Islands wintering group have to date been matched only with the northeastern feeding grounds. Individuals from the Cape Verdes have also been observed in spring in the Azores, where they appear to stop over to feed while on their way north (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009<em>,</em> Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011). The genetic and photographic evidence suggests that some of the whales on the Icelandic and Norwegian feeding grounds migrate in winter to an unknown area other than the West Indies or the Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Pike 2009).<br/><br/>The Humpback Whales that occur in the austral winter north of the equator along the African coast from Gabon to Guinea are known or presumed to be Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales (Bamy <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong></strong><br/>In the North Pacific, the Humpback Whale’s summer range covers shelf waters from southern California to the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, the Aleutian chain and Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, and northeastern Japan (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Humpbacks were hunted in the Sea of Japan and the Okhotsk Sea and in the past (Kasuya 2018<em>,</em> Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012). They were for some time rare in the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), but recently have been seen in the eastern and northern Okhotsk Sea (Guschcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>,</em> Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Humpbacks are not common in the Sea of Japan but continue to be taken occasionally as bycatch in Korean waters. Recent occurrence in the Beaufort Sea may be linked to warming climate trends (Hashagen <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds identified to date include (from west to east) are: 1) Asian – Ogasawara (Bonin Islands), Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands), and northern Philippines; 2) west-central Pacific (presumed to be the area of the Mariana Islands, including Guam); 3). Hawaiian; 4) Mexican - Baja California, Gulf of California, Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Mexican mainland; and 5) Central American – Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia (IWC 2018a).<br/><br/>The least well-known wintering area is the west-central Pacific, because only a few whales have been observed there (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017), but the existence of a substantial wintering ground had been inferred from the substantial proportion of Humpback Whales in the Aleutian Islands that could not be matched to other known wintering grounds (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). It remains to be determined whether this is the Marianas region, which was a Humpback whaling ground in the 19<sup>th</sup> century (Townsend 1935).<br/><br/>The Central American wintering ground overlaps the winter range of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, but there is probably not much temporal overlap because the Southern Humpback Whales occupy the area in the austral winter (Rasmussen <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Small numbers of Humpbacks have recently been seen at previously unknown winter locations such as Amami-Ohshima Island (28°N 129°E) and Hachijō-jima Island (33°N 140°E, about 300km south of Tokyo, Japan) (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The various wintering populations have different summer distributions but with considerable overlap. The whales wintering off Central America and mainland Mexico feed mainly off the coasts California, Oregon and Washington (USA), while whales from the Revillagigedo Islands feed mainly in the Gulf of Alaska (Urbán <em>et al</em>. 2017). Whales wintering off Hawaii are found in summer mainly in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska (including Southeast Alaska) and the waters of British Columbia (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Most of the whales summering off Kamchatka migrate to the Asian wintering grounds, a lower number to the Hawaiian grounds, and a few to the Mexican grounds (Titova <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Movements between wintering grounds have also been documented (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008) but these appear to be sufficiently few that the wintering populations remain genetically differentiated, especially with respect to mtDNA, which reflects maternal lineages (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><em></em><br/>The majority of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales migrate to the Antarctic in summer. They are abundant throughout the Antarctic in summer south to the ice edge, but not within the pack ice zone. There are also subantarctic summer feeding grounds around South Georgia (Dawbin 1966<em>,</em> Engel <em>and</em> Martin 2009) and the Fuegian archipelago (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Some mothers with calves remain in mid-latitude waters in the Chilean fjords in the summer (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the winter, Southern Hemisphere whales aggregate in specific nearshore breeding areas in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, at least two of which extend north of the equator, i.e. off Colombia and Central America in the eastern Pacific and in the Bight of Benin (5°N, 2°E) in the eastern Atlantic. Some wintering grounds are fairly localized, for example around island groups, and some are more diffuse, such as along the west coast of southern Africa and the coast of West Africa. As evidenced by acoustic detections, part of the population remains in the Antarctic in winter (van Opzeeland <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The currently known wintering grounds, with the names originally assigned by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (IWC 1998) but with some subsequent regrouping (IWC 2017), are:<br/><br/>A. Western South Atlantic: Coast of Brazil from Cabo São Roque (5°S) to Cabo Frio (23°S), but especially on the Abrolhos Bank (17-20°S);<br/><br/>B. Eastern South Atlantic: Benin Bight and Gulf of Guinea, from the waters of the Republic of Congo to the waters of Guinea (B1), West coast of southern Africa, including waters of South Africa, Namibia and Angola (B2);<br/><br/>C. Southwestern Indian Ocean: Coast of Natal, northeastern South Africa &#160;East Africa, including waters of Mozambique, Tanzania (incl. Zanzibar), Mayotte and the Comoros Islands (C1+C2), Eastern and southern Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius (C3+C4);<br/><br/>D. Western Australia: migration along the west Australian coast to wintering grounds off northwestern Australia;<br/><br/>E. Eastern Australia and Southwest Pacific: Eastern Australia (E1),<br/><br/>F. Oceania: New Caledonia (E2), Fiji and Tonga (E3), Cook Islands (F1), French Polynesia (F2);<br/><br/>G. Eastern South and equatorial Pacific: &#160;Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The groups A-G were originally considered to represent main breeding populations with the numbered sub-groups representing subpopulations. However, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently grouped subgroups E2, E3, F1 and F2 together as the Oceania breeding population. Subgroups C1 and C2 were combined, as have C3 and C4.<br/><br/>The feeding ranges of the different populations overlap in the Antarctic, with some movement of individuals around the Antarctic (IWC 1998), but overall the whales appear to feed preferentially in the sectors nearest to their wintering grounds. The sex ratio in the wintering areas tends to be biased towards males, potentially reflecting a reduced presence of females in their non-calving years or a generally shorter residence time of females (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). Rare movements of both sexes between breeding populations have been observed (e.g., western Africa to Madagascar (Pomilla and Rosenbaum 2005) and Brazil to Madagascar (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2011)).<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><em><strong></strong></em><br/>There is a resident year-round population in the Arabian Sea, whose range includes the waters of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011) and which is genetically isolated from other Humpback Whales (Pomilla <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, song types characteristic of Humpback Whales in the southwestern Indian Ocean have been detected off Oman (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2018); this could indicate the presence of Humpbacks from different populations in the Arabian Sea, or that Arabian Sea Humpbacks sometimes venture further afield and acquire new songs.<br/><br/>Only a few calves have been seen in the Arabian Sea, but from foetus sizes in pregnant whales captured in November 1966, Mikhalev (1997) concluded that the peak calving season is probably in February, with some spread. This is in contrast to Southern Humpback Whales, where peak calving occurs in July-August (Clapham and Mead 1999).<br/><br/>There have been a few records in the Persian Gulf, including the type specimen for <em>M. indica</em> (Gervais 1883) assumed to be a Humpback Whale; these were previously regarded as vagrants, but it is now thought that the regular range extends into the Persian Gulf (Dakhteh <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales seem to be quite rare in Indian waters (Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008) but there have been occasional strandings (Sutaria 2018) and acoustic detections (Madhusudhana <em>et al</em>. 2018) along the west coast. Of 14 individuals satellite-tagged off Oman during 2014-17, one was tracked to Goa and thence to the southern tip of India by January 2018 and back to the tagging site by March 2018 (Willson <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two specimens from the west coast of Sri Lanka (a bycatch in 1981 and a stranding in 1990) (Ilangakoon 2006) and Humpback Whale songs have been during February and March 1982 in the Gulf of Mannar, NW Sri Lanka (Whitehead 1985). Humpback Whales seem to be rare or absent in the northeastern Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.<br/><br/>There have been several sightings over the past 10 years in the northern Red Sea, including the Gulf of Aqaba, but the provenance of those Humpback Whales is unclear (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Large-scale exploitation of this species has ceased, but hunting for local consumption continues in Greenland and the island of Bequia (eastern&#160; Caribbean) (IWC 2018b).

The last substantial catches occurred in 1968. Despite having been severely depleted to a world population in the low thousands at that time, Humpbacks have recovered strongly to a world population that is estimated at over 80,000 mature animals and is increasing.<br/><br/>Humpback Whales enjoy additional protective measures, such as sanctuaries, in a number of countries.

50367651,13704,Monodon monoceros,Least Concern,,2017,2017-07-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Narwhal is widely distributed in a number of distinct subpopulations. Combining the most current abundance estimates for the known and surveyed subpopulations results in a total global abundance of more than 170,000 whales, however this does not include Northeast Greenland or the Russian Arctic for which no estimates are available. Ten subpopulations number more than 10,000 individuals, and two subpopulations number more than 35,000. One subpopulation is thought to be increasing, five are considered stable, and for five the trend is unknown. As a species, the Narwhal does not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and is listed as Least Concern </p>  <p></p><p>Across the global range of the Narwhal, subpopulations are of various sizes and subject to differing levels of threats. Due to this variability, some of the subpopulations warrant Red List assessment.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Narwhals spend approximately two months each summer in ice-free bays and fjords of the Canadian Arctic, eastern Baffin Island, western and eastern Greenland, and Svalbard (Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). In some parts of this range during summer they may aggregate at tidewater glacier fronts (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2014, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). In autumn, Narwhals migrate with the forming fast ice to wintering areas that tend to be deep, offshore, ice-covered habitats along the continental slope (Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are highly adapted to winter habitats with limited open water (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). Few other cetaceans use areas with such dense sea ice cover, and Narwhals have remarkable site fidelity to these areas. They may dive to depths of over 1,500 m multiple times per day and spend over 3 h per day at depths of 800 m (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003,<em></em> 2010). A double-platform visual aerial survey over a Narwhal wintering ground in West Greenland found high densities of whales in the leads and cracks of the Baffin Bay pack ice, up to an average density of about 77 Narwhals/km² (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011).</p>  <p></p><p>In the winter, Narwhals feed intensively at the sea floor (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2003, <em></em>2004; Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a) but some subpopulations may also feed on pelagic prey (Watt and Ferguson 2014). A major portion of the annual energy intake is obtained during the winter. Although there seems to be relatively little feeding activity during the summer, Narwhals apparently feed opportunistically during this time. Narwhal sighting probability in winter in habitats with &lt;50% open water is significantly higher than sighting probability in habitats with &gt;50% open water, suggesting that the animals select for optimal foraging areas in dense pack ice regardless of the availability of open water (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). In the autumn and winter Narwhals are vulnerable to ice entrapments, or sassats, when rapidly changing conditions cause open-water areas used by the whales to freeze over and trap them, sometimes leading to suffocation (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). Calving occurs in spring during the northbound (or in some populations inshore) migration that coincides with the receding sea ice. There is remarkable consistency across Narwhal subpopulations in the types of habitat used, in site fidelity to migration routes and summering and wintering areas, and in feeding patterns (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Fish, squid, and shrimp make up the Narwhal’s diet (Hay and Mansfield 1989, Heide-Jørgensen 2009), especially Arctic fish species, such as Greenland Halibut (<em>R</em><em>einhardtius hippoglossoides</em>), Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), and Polar Cod (<em>Arctogadus glacialis</em>) (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a).</p>  <p></p>","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease (see also Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Narwhals are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance among the many Narwhal subpopulations varies. </p>  <p>Narwhals were never the targets of large-scale commercial hunting except for a brief period of several decades of the early 20th century in the eastern Canadian Arctic (Mitchell and Reeves 1981). They were hunted opportunistically by commercial whalers, explorers and adventurers in many parts of their range. At present, Narwhals are hunted only in some indigenous communities in Canada and Greenland – for both human consumption and for ivory (see Use and Trade). In some communities Narwhal carcasses are at least partially used as dog food. The strong fidelity of Narwhals, which causes them to return to the same nearshore areas each summer, makes them highly vulnerable to overexploitation. In nearly all parts of their range, hunting is now controlled by limits on harvest levels that are judged to be sustainable (NAMMCO in prep.) (also see the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section) </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial loss of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), including changes in the timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015, Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The effects of climate change on Narwhals are uncertain. Broad changes in the ecosystem may influence the distribution of their prey. Narwhals are well adapted to a life in the pack ice as indicated by the fact that there is very little open water in their winter habitat (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005b), and they can be found in high densities in areas with more than 98% ice coverage (Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2011). They spend much of their time in heavy ice and in some areas are vulnerable to ice entrapments where hundreds can become trapped in a small opening in the sea ice and die (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). This occurs when sudden changes in weather conditions (such as shifts in wind or rapid drops in temperature) freeze shut leads and cracks that the Narwhals were using, and such entrapment may be occurring more often as autumn freeze-up occurs later in the year and on an unpredictable schedule (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2012). When entrapped whales are discovered by hunters, they normally are harvested. Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) are known to prey on Narwhal in summering areas (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the presence Killer Whales in such areas can greatly affect Narwhal behavior (Breed <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sea ice normally inhibits movements of Killer Whales, and Higdon and Ferguson (2009) documented substantial increases in Killer Whale presence in Hudson Bay when sea ice reduction allowed them to pass through Hudson Strait. An assessment of the sensitivity of all arctic marine mammals to climate change ranked the Narwhal as one of the three most sensitive species, primarily due to its narrow geographic distribution, specialized feeding and habitat choice, and high site fidelity (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p>Known or potential threats to Narwhals include a variety of commercial human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is facilitating increases in the scale and distribution of those activities. Oil and gas development is ongoing and expanding, and along with commercial shipping is likely to modify and degrade habitat used by Narwhals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas in Greenland and arctic Russia are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which often includes seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by ice breaking and shipping. Finley <em>et al</em>. (1990) found that Narwhals at an ice edge reacted strongly to ice-breaking ships, and Cosens and Duek (1993) concluded that Narwhals would likely be able to detect the high-frequency components of icebreaker noise 25-30 km from the source. Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> (2013) speculated that noise from seismic surveys, at least in some contexts, could enhance the susceptibility of Narwhals to ice-entrapment.</p>  <p>Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants that are high enough to cause impacts on health and reproductive performance (Ross 2000). Organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants have been found in Narwhals in several areas (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2004). At Svalbard, Wolkers <em>et al</em>. (2006) found that levels of contaminants in Narwhals were higher than those in Beluga Whales (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>). </p>  <p></p><p>Commercial fisheries for Greenland Halibut operate in both the Canada and Greenland sides of Baffin Bay/Davis Strait and have done so on the inshore Greenland side for several decades (Treble and Bowering 2002). This fishing overlaps spatially with where Narwhals winter and feed extensively on the target species, Greenland Halibut (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2004, Laidre and Heide-Jørgensen 2005a). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Narwhals are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2006), but significant epizootics have not been recorded. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2001) found a low prevalence of exposure to <em>Brucella</em> spp. in Narwhals sampled in arctic Canada. Nielsen <em>et al</em>. (2000) found no serological evidence of exposure to morbilliviruses, and speculated that because they are immunologically naïve, Narwhals are at considerable risk of a serious epidemic if they become exposed. Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could influence disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The global Narwhal population consists of about 12 subpopulations with varying degrees of genetic differentiation and geographical isolation (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to incomplete sampling in parts of the range, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee recognized two stocks of Narwhal but noted that there were probably more that were not yet recognized (IWC 2000). A recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids (GROM) hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 12 Narwhal stocks (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>Discrimination and definition of subpopulations are based mostly on nearshore areas (principally fjords and bays) where Narwhals congregate during summer. Genetic studies, satellite telemetry, traditional ecological knowledge, stable isotope values, and contaminant analyses have shown that Narwhals have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (e.g., Palsbøll <em>et al.</em> 1997, Riget <em>et al</em>. 2002, de March <em>et al</em>. 2003, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2013). <br/></p>  <p>Available information on sizes of Narwhal subpopulations is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Northern Hudson Bay</strong></p>  <p></p><p>Narwhals from the Northern Hudson Bay subpopulation summer in northwestern Hudson Bay, particularly in Repulse Bay and in waters around Southampton Island. They winter in eastern Hudson Strait (Richard 1991, Westdal <em>et al</em>. 2010). The abundance of Northern Hudson Bay Narwhals in 2011, corrected for perception bias (animals that were at the surface but not seen by observers) and availability bias (animals too deep to be seen by observers), was estimated as 12,485 (CV 0.21; Asselin <em>et al</em>. 2012). Richard (1991) reported results of surveys conducted in 1982, 1983, and 1984 that were limited to areas with less than 20% ice cover and his estimates were not corrected for availability. Abundance estimates from Richard (1991) ranged from 1,038 to 1,517 but were certainly biased negatively. A similar survey in 2000 estimated uncorrected abundance as 1,780 (Bourassa 2003). Abundance of this subpopulation is believed to be fairly stable (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Somerset Island</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Somerset Island subpopulation range over a large area in the eastern Canadian Arctic. During summer, satellite-tagged animals were mostly concentrated around Somerset Island and they spent winter in Baffin Bay (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). The abundance of Somerset Island Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 49,768 (CV 0.20; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Previous abundance surveys were flown in 1982, 1996, and 2002. The corrected estimate for 1982 was 27,656 (CV 0.54; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggests that abundance has been increasing. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Admiralty Inlet</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals from the Admiralty Inlet subpopulation remain in and near the Inlet during summer, and spend winter in the Baffin Bay region (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, Watt <em>et al</em>. 2012). The most recent abundance estimate for Admiralty Inlet Narwhals comes from aerial line-transect surveys flown in 2013 (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). When corrected for perception and availability biases the abundance estimate for this stock was 35,043 (CV 0.42). Four previous surveys in 1975, 1985, 2003, and 2010 yielded lower mean abundance estimates with wide confidence intervals. Analysis of those data by Witting (2016) suggested that abundance has been stable. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eclipse Sound</strong></p>  <p>Narwhal from the Eclipse Sound subpopulation generally stay in and near the Sound in the summer, and winter in Baffin Bay (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). The abundance of Eclipse Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 10,489 (CV 0.24; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). A previous survey in 2004 produced a higher corrected estimate of 20,225 with wide confidence limits (95% CL 9,471-37,096; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Available data are insufficient to detect any trend in abundance for this subpopulation (Witting 2016). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Baffin Island</strong></p>  <p>The Eastern Baffin Island Narwhal subpopulation summers in Cumberland Sound and along the Baffin Island coast to the north, and winters in northern Davis Strait (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). Abundance in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 17,555 (CV 0.35; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Surveys in 2003 that had similar coverage of the eastern Baffin Island fiord area produced a corrected estimate of 10,073 (SE 3,123) Narwhals in the surveyed region (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Available data are insufficient to detect any trend in abundance for this subpopulation (Witting 2016).&#160;  </p><p><strong>Jones Sound</strong></p>  <p>  </p><p>The Jones Sound subpopulation of Narwhals summers between Devon Island and Ellesmere Island and in fiords of western Ellesmere Island. Jones Sound Narwhals have not been tagged and tracked, and their distribution at times of year other than summer is unknown (NAMMCO in prep.). The abundance of Jones Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 12,694 (CV 0.33; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). That is the only abundance survey conducted in Jones Sound so <a name=""_Hlk486932453"">there is no information on trend for this subpopulation</a>. </p>    <p><strong>Smith Sound</strong></p>  <p> </p><p>The Smith Sound Narwhal subpopulation summers along the southeastern coast of Ellesmere Island (Richard 2010); its wintering area is unknown. Abundance of Smith Sound Narwhals in 2013, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 16,360 (CV 0.65; Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al</em>. 2015). That is the only abundance estimate for Smith Sound so there is no information on trend for this subpopulation. </p>  <p><strong>Inglefield Bredning</strong></p><p>This subpopulation of Narwhals summers in Inglefield Bredning which is its major concentration area in northwestern Greenland (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994). Little is known about distribution at other times of year. Abundance of Inglefield Bredning Narwhals in 2007, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 8,368 (CV 0.25; Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). Previous surveys of this subpopulation were conducted in 1985-86 (Born <em>et al</em>. 1994) and 2001-02 (Heide‐Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2004) with generally similar results, and abundance appears to be stable (Witting 2016).&#160; <br/></p>  <p><strong>Melville Bay</strong></p>  <p> </p><p>The Melville Bay Narwhal subpopulation spends the ice-free season in and near Melville Bay, and may spend significant time at the fronts of coastal glaciers that are important habitats for them (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2016). With freeze-up they move south to the southern part of Baffin Bay for overwintering (Dietz and Heide-Jørgensen 1995). Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported that the range of Narwhals in Melville Bay contracted over the period from 2007 to 2014. Abundance in 2014, corrected for both perception and availability biases, was estimated as 3,091 (95% CI 1,228-7,783). Previous surveys resulted in estimates of 5,605 whales (95% CI 1,319-23,815) in 2007 and 2,983 (95% CI 1,452-6,127) in 2012 (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2014). Confidence limits for all three surveys overlap broadly and abundance appears fairly stable (Witting 2016). </p>  <p><strong>Northeast Greenland</strong></p>  <p>Narwhals assigned to the Northeast Greenland subpopulation are frequently seen during May-August in Young Sound (74°N) and along the coast as far north as Nordost Rundingen (82°N; Boertmann <em>et al</em>. 2009). There has been no attempt to estimate abundance of Narwhals in north-eastern Greenland, but surveys of the area were planned for 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.).<strong>&#160; </strong><strong><br/></strong></p>  <p><strong>East Greenland</strong></p>  <p></p><p>In summer Narwhals occur along the east coast of Greenland mostly from about 64° to 72° N, but they have been reported at more than 81° (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994), which means the distinction between Northeast and East Greenland Narwhals is uncertain. Narwhals are relatively common in Scoresby Sound and the Kangerlussuaq fjord (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). They winter in sea ice in the Greenland Sea and Fram Strait, but winter observations are sparse (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 1994, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2015). Aerial surveys conducted in Scoresby Sound in 1983-84 and from Tasiilaq to Scoresby Sound in 2008 and 2016 resulted in conflicting results, leading to the conclusion (as of summer 2017) that Narwhals off East Greenland are widely scattered and may number fewer than 1,000 individuals (NAMMCO in prep.).</p>  <p><strong>Svalbard- Russia</strong><br/></p><p>Narwhals that occur around Svalbard and in the northwestern Russian High Arctic have been little studied but they are thought to be widely distributed in low numbers throughout this region (Heide-Jørgensen 2009). Gjertz (1991) described previous observations and catches that were largely west and north of Svalbard. In August 1998, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. (2007) tagged three subadult Narwhals at Svalbard with satellite-relay data loggers and tracked them for up to 46 days. The whales spent time in fiords in western Svalbard, then moved north and east to deep offshore waters north of 80°N. A survey in the marginal ice zone north of Svalbard in August 2015 produced a corrected estimate of 837 (CV 0.50) Narwhals, but this estimate is negatively biased because the study area did not include the whole range used by Narwhals around Svalbard (Vacquie-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are no estimates of abundance for other areas and overall abundance and trend for this subpopulation are unknown (NAMMCO in prep.). &#160;  </p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p></p><p>The sum of the abundance estimates for the 12 Narwhal subpopulations listed above is 173,134. There is no estimate for Northeast Greenland and the figure for the Svalbard-Russia region is known to be an underestimate because only a portion of the known range was surveyed. If 71% of the overall Narwhal population consists of mature animals (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), the minimum number of mature individuals would be 122,925. The number of mature individuals in the largest subpopulation (Somerset Island) is estimated as 35,335. For the six subpopulations for which there is some information on trend, one is thought to be increasing and five are likely stable. </p>  <p>The generation length for the Narwhal was estimated as 21.9 years by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) and as 30 and 33 years in East and West Greenland, respectively, by Garde <em>et al</em>. (2015) using aspartic acid ageing. Using these estimates, three generations is 66-99 years. For most subpopulations, abundance estimates for years prior to 2000 do not exist, so trends in abundance over a three-generation period cannot be calculated.</p>  <p></p><p>  </p><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p></p>",Unknown,"Narwhals primarily inhabit the Arctic, including northeastern Canada, northern Greenland, Svalbard, and waters of northern Russia as far east as the East Siberian Sea. Their principal distribution is from the central Canadian Arctic (Peel Sound – Prince Regent Inlet and northern Hudson Bay) eastward to Greenland (Rice 1998). In the Canada-Greenland region in summer, Narwhals spend approximately two months in the high Arctic, largely in bays and fjords; they overwinter in offshore, deep, partially ice-covered habitat along the continental slope (Heide-Jørgensen and Dietz 1995). Narwhals migrate annually between these disjunct seasonal concentration areas, with the migratory periods lasting approximately two months (Koski and Davis 1994, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2001). Vagrants have been recorded at Newfoundland, the British Isles, Germany, and the Netherlands in the east, and in the Chukchi and Bering seas as far south as the Alaska Peninsula and Commander Islands (Rice 1998).","<p>Narwhals are hunted in Canada and Greenland for human and animal food and for tusk ivory. They supply various staples in the traditional subsistence economy. Today the main products are mattak (skin with some blubber attached) and ivory (Reeves 1993, Reeves and Heide-Jørgensen 1994, Heide-Jørgensen 1994). Narwhal tusks from Canada and Greenland are sold in specialty souvenir markets domestically and are also exported, either as whole tusks or as carved items. </p><p>In the 2008 IUCN Red List assessment (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 2012), intense hunting of Narwhals (including associated loss due to wounding and sinking) in Greenland and Canada was described as a cause for concern, particularly given the lack of reliable data on hidden mortality and serious injury (see Finley and Miller 1982). Statistics on the number of Narwhals reported as landed by the hunting communities are available starting in the 1950s for Greenland and the 1970s for Canada (NAMMCO in prep.).​ Data summarized by Shadbolt<em> et al</em>. (2015) for the period 2007-2011 show a mean annual retrieved catch of 358 in Greenland and 621 in Canada. The Canadian catch was unusually large due to 624 Narwhals being taken from an ice entrapment event in 2008. Watt and Hall (2016) presented Canadian harvest data that had been corrected for estimated struck and lost. Those data indicate that the total number of Narwhals killed in Canada averaged 620/year (range 515-768) during 2011-2015. <br/></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>The Narwhal is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). As a result, a non-detriment finding (NDF; analysis showing that the taking and trade is not detrimental to the species’ survival or to maintenance of the species “throughout its range at a level consistent with its role in the ecosystems in which it occurs”) by the Scientific Authority of the exporting country is required for export. This requirement has had the effect of forcing both Canada and Greenland to document catch and trade levels and to provide data on abundance and trends of hunted Narwhal stocks. Negative NDFs were issued for both countries (Greenland in 2005, Canada in 2010; Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015) making exports of Narwhal ivory from several stocks in Canada illegal for a brief period in 2010-11 and leading to a temporary export ban in Greenland in 2006. This ban remained in effect through at least February 2014 despite the fact that new information reported in 2009 indicated that removal levels for at least some stocks in Greenland were sustainable (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015). The NAMMCO Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic and the JCNB [Canada/Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga] Scientific Working Group meet jointly every other year to review new information on the biology of Narwhals and Belugas, update assessments, and provide advice to the Canada and Greenland governments based, in part, on a catch allocation model designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of removals from the various stocks (NAMMCO 2016, in prep.). Greenland’s annual report to NAMMCO in 2016 (NAMMCO 2017) noted that the NDF for 2016 compared catches and advice for 2013, 2014, and 2015, concluding that, “as a whole, in the period 2013-2015, catches … followed the advice from NAMMCO, JCNB or IWC for all stocks, except Narwhals in Inglefield Bredning, Melville Bay, Ittoqqortormiit and Tasiilaq.”<br/> <br/> The European Union established an import ban on Narwhal tusks in December 2004. This ban apparently was lifted in February 2010 in response to the fact that Greenland had introduced a quota system “based on scientific advice and more accurate population abundance numbers” (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015). Importation of Narwhal products into the United States has been prohibited under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act since 1972.</p>  <p>Particularly in the context of NAMMCO (NAMMCO, in prep.) and among non-governmental organizations (Shadbolt <em>et al.</em> 2015), there is increasing recognition of the need to improve understanding of the impacts – direct and indirect, individual and cumulative – on Narwhals from climate change and associated changes in human activity in the Arctic (e.g., mining, oil and gas development, shipping, fisheries, tourism).</p><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Killer Whales are numerically abundant (at least tens of thousands of mature individuals) and very widely distributed. Experts agree that the present taxon likely includes more than one subspecies, and possibly multiple species. Some small regional populations are known to have declined significantly and would easily qualify for a threatened status if assessed individually (e.g., ENP southern residents, the Bluefin Tuna-dependent population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar), but there is insufficient evidence to support a global decline in the species abundance that would make it meet Criterion A. However, the statement in the previous species assessment (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2013) still holds: “The combination of potential declines driven by depletion of prey resources and the effects of pollutants is believed sufficient that a 30% global reduction over three generations (77 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out for some ‘groups’ that may [eventually] be designated as species.” <br/></p>  <p>Although considerable effort continues to be made on improved understanding of the taxonomy of the genus <em>Orcinus</em>, the taxonomic issues have not been fully resolved. This is especially problematic due to the occurrence of sympatric, non-interbreeding ecotypes in the ENP, Antarctic, and possibly elsewhere. The taxon has previously been listed by IUCN as Data Deficient due to taxonomic uncertainty, and that listing should be continued until proper taxonomic units are described and Red List assessments of them can be carried out.</p>","<p>Killer Whales are known to   feed on a wide array of prey, including most marine mammal species (except river dolphins and Manatees), seabirds, sea turtles, many species of fish   (including sharks and rays) and cephalopods (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Ford   and Ellis 1999, Ford 2009). They have a diversity of foraging tactics,   including intentional beaching to capture pinnipeds on shore, creating waves   to wash seals off ice floes, and using cooperative techniques to herd fish   and to attack large prey such as Tuna and large whales (Dahlheim and Heyning   1999, Baird 2000, Pitman and Durban 2012).</p><p>Although Killer Whales are a generalist as a species, at least some   subpopulations (ecotypes and/or morphotypes) specialize on particular types   of prey (Bigg <em>et al</em>. 1990, Baird 2000). Studies in coastal waters of   the ENP, from California to Alaska, have described three distinct ecotypes of   Killer Whales, referred to as residents, transients (or Bigg’s Killer Whales),   and offshores. Although distinguished by ecological differences, there are   also differences in coloration, external morphology, behavior and acoustics   (Ford and Ellis 2014). The three ecotypes maintain social isolation from each   other (<em>i.e</em>., no interbreeding)   despite sometimes overlapping ranges. The ENP residents are Pacific Salmon   specialists and have a strong preference for one species, the Chinook Salmon   (Ford and Ellis 2006). Transients in coastal waters of the ENP focus their   foraging on pinnipeds and small cetaceans but also take large whales, especially   calves, opportunistically. Killer Whales in coastal Norway specialize on Herring   (Simila <em>et al</em>. 1996) and in the Strait of Gibraltar on Bluefin Tuna   (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006). Some Killer Whales in New Zealand may forage   selectively on rays and other elasmobranchs (Visser 1999), and in Western   Australia, Killer Whales take scores of Humpback Whale calves for several   months a year (Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2015).   Off the south coast of Western Australia one group of Killer Whales forages,   at least seasonally, on Beaked Whales (Wellard <em>et al</em>. 2106). In the Antarctic, there are five described ecotypes   of Killer Whales, each of them morphologically distinct with different   habitat and prey preferences. One type specializes on Minke Whales and Elephant   Seals taken in open water, one eats mostly ice-associated seals taken off ice   floes, another regularly preys on penguins but is probably mainly a   fish-eater, another rarely seen form has only been observed depredating Patgonian   Toothfish from commercial longlines, and the smallest form appears to be   entirely a fish-eater (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durban <em>et al.</em>   2016). <br/></p>   <p>Long-distance migrations   have been documented for high-latitude Killer Whales. Matthews <em>et al</em>. (2011) satellite-tracked an   individual for 5,400 km (and 38° of latitude) from the eastern Canadian   Arctic into the central North Atlantic. Durban and Pitman (2012) tracked Killer   Whales from the Antarctic Peninsula to southern Brazil and back – a non-stop   roundtrip of almost 9,400 km, and Pitman <em>et   al</em>. (in prep.) tracked fish-eating ecotype Killer Whales from the Ross   Sea to north of New Zealand and back – a &gt;11,000 km roundtrip covering 48°   of latitude. Many Antarctic Killer Whales appear to be highly philopatric. In   the Antarctic, some ecotypes readily enter areas of floe ice in search of   prey, while others hunt only in open water (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman and   Durban 2012). Killer Whales in some areas congregate seasonally in coastal   channels to forage and occasionally enter river mouths.</p>","<p>Killer Whales have been exploited (i.e., deliberately hunted) in several regions. Norwegian whalers in the eastern North Atlantic took an average of 56 whales per year from 1938 to 1981. Whalers in Japan took an average of 43 per year in coastal waters from 1946 to 1981. Soviet commercial whalers took an average of 26 Killer Whales annually from 1935 to 1979, primarily in the Antarctic, and then took 916 animals in the 1979/80 Antarctic season (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999,). Killer whales are also taken in small numbers for food (or as a population control measure) in coastal fisheries in Japan, Greenland, Indonesia, and the Caribbean islands (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/> Fishermen in many areas see Killer Whales as competitors, and intentional shooting is known to occur. This problem was especially serious in Alaska, where depredation of longline fisheries is extensive (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, Yano and Dahlheim 1995, Donohue <em>et al</em>. 2003), and retaliation for depredation was credited with contributing to a temporary population decline at Crozet Island, in the Southern Ocean (Poncelet <em>et al</em>. 2010). Depredation of longline catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., Aleutian Islands and Southeast Alaska, South Georgia, Crozet Islands, and several other Southern Ocean Subantarctic island areas, Australia, and other locations in the South Pacific). Increased depredation of Toothfish hooked in fisheries in the Crozet Archipelago appears to have had a positive effect on calving rates of female Killer Whales (Tixier <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> Incidental mortality in trawl, longline and driftnet fishing operations occurs, but is considered rare (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> Persistent bio-accumulating contaminants present a serious potential risk to some Killer Whale populations. Ross <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were very high in three Killer Whale populations (2 resident and 1 transient) frequenting the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada. Transient Killer Whales were particularly contaminated due to their high trophic position in the marine ecosystem. PCB levels in most Killer Whales sampled were greater than levels established at which adverse effects occur in Harbor Seals, suggesting that the majority of free-ranging Killer Whales in this region are at risk of toxic effects. The southern resident and transient Killer Whales of British Columbia and Washington are considered among the most PCB-contaminated cetaceans in the world (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2000). &#160;More recently, Jepson <em>et al</em>. (2016) found very high mean blubber PCB concentrations in Killer Whales in Europe. Small or declining populations of Killer Whales in the northeastern Atlantic (e.g., the very small population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar) have been associated with low recruitment, which is consistent with PCB-induced reproductive toxicity. Also, increasing levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers which, like PCBs, can cause immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive impairment, have become a concern in the southern resident population in British Columbia and Washington (Mongillo <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p><br/> Disturbance is another concern in areas where Killer Whales are subject to whale-watching tourism. Moving boats can disrupt foraging and resting, and underwater boat noise can affect social and echolocation signals of the whales or otherwise interfere with foraging (Erbe 2002, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, Noren <em>et al.</em> 2009). For example, close approaches by whale-watching vessels have been shown to result in avoidance responses by resident Killer Whales in British Columbia, which presumably has energetic costs to whales that are frequently subjected to this activity (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2006). Fast-moving boats in the proximity of Killer Whales also present a risk of vessel strikes (e.g., Visser 1999). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Potential disturbance and acoustic masking effects of increasing ambient noise levels associated with shipping and other vessel traffic is a growing concern in some regions (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Disturbance responses and masking of echolocation signals in areas with heavy ship activity have the potential to disrupt foraging behavior and reduce prey acquisition with possible population-level consequences (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014, Veirs <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/> <br/> </p>  <p>The <em>Exxon Valdez</em> oil spill in Alaska in March 1989 was strongly correlated with the subsequent loss of Killer Whales from transient and resident pods that had been seen swimming near or through oil slicks early in the spill (Dahlheim and Matkin 1994). The AT1 pod had at least 22 individuals when first censused in 1984, before the spill. Eleven individuals have been missing from this pod since 1990 and two more since 1992. Four more whales from this pod died in the early 2000s and there have been no recorded births within the pod since 1984. As of 2012, only 7 of the original 22 AT1 pod members remained. A resident Killer Whale pod affected by the oil had failed to recover 16 years after the spill (Matkin <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2012). Oil spills may also have indirect effects on Killer Whales by reducing prey abundance. </p>  <p><br/> There have been large-scale reductions in predatory fish populations (Myers and Worm 2003; Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003) along with overfishing and collapse of several important “prey” fish stocks worldwide (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2001). There have also been large declines in some marine mammal populations but many of those populations have recovered or are recovering under protection, and this may mean that some mammal-eating populations of Killer Whales are recovering as well. The same is not likely true of many fish-eating populations, however. </p>  <p><br/> Due to their dietary specialization, some populations of Killer Whales could be especially vulnerable to a reduction of their food supply. In British Columbia and Washington State, many Pacific Salmon stocks have significantly declined as a result of overfishing, habitat degradation, and reduced survival at sea. Declines in survival and reproductive rates of resident Killer Whales were found to correlate with a multi-year reduction in Chinook Salmon abundance in coastal British Columbia and Washington State (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ford <em>et al.</em> 2010). Mammal-eating Killer Whales along the west coast of North America likely experienced periods of reduced prey availability due to depletion of pinniped populations prior to 1970 (Ford and Ellis 1999). Depletion of Bluefin Tuna stocks in the Mediterranean Sea has almost certainly had a serious impact on the survival of Killer Whales near the Strait of Gibraltar (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006, Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> How global climate change and its impacts on the marine environment will affect the different populations and ecotypes of Killer Whales is uncertain (e.g., Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, in the Arctic, declining extent and duration of sea ice has given Killer Whales more access to marine mammal prey (Belugas, Narwhals, Bowhead Whales) that depend on ice for refuge from predation (Ferguson <em>et al.</em> 2010, Higdon <em>et al</em>. 2012, George <em>et al.</em> 2015). Similarly, in the Antarctic, the abundance and availability of Killer Whale prey is mediated through the presence of ice (<em>e.g</em>., Pitman and Durban 2012), which means that many species, including both Killer Whales and their prey, face an uncertain future.</p>","<p>Killer Whale populations   have been relatively well-studied in the North Pacific. In the Eastern Tropical   Pacific, a line-transect survey resulted in an estimate of 8,500 (CV=0.37) in   1986-1990 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). A catalogue of 86 individuals was   compiled for waters around the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, from   1972-1997 (Guerrero-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 1998). A shipboard line-transect   survey of the Hawaii EEZ in 2002 resulted in an estimate of 349 (CV = 0.98) Killer   Whales (Barlow 2006). The southern resident population that inhabits the   inland waters of Washington State and southern British Columbia numbered 77   whales in June 2017 (K.C. Balcomb, Center for Whale Research, pers. comm., 13   June 2017); it is depleted due to past live removals and is listed as   endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and Canada’s Species at Risk   Act. The northern resident population in British Columbia numbered 290 in   2014 and had been increasing at a mean rate of 2.2% per annum since 1974   (Towers <em>et al</em>. 2015). A   photographic catalogue of the west coast transient population in British   Columbia and Southeast Alaska included 272 individuals in 2012 (Towers <em>et al.</em> 2012). This population was   estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of about 2% in the two   decades ending in 2006 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2007). Bayesian mark-recapture modelling estimated that there were 300   offshore-type Killer Whales (95% CL 257–373) in the region from Alaska to   California in 2012 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2014). Shipboard line-transect surveys extending out to 300 nm offshore in   2005 and 2007 resulted in an estimate of 691 (CV=0.49) off California, Oregon   and Washington (Carretta <em>et al</em>.   2016); these estimates likely include whales from the aforementioned west   coast transient, southern resident, northern resident, and offshore   populations. A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of   Alaska resulted in an estimate of abundance for transient Killer Whales of   251 (CV=0.51) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007), while the AT1 transient   population (which inhabits Prince William Sound and waters of the Seward   Peninsula, Alaska) numbered only 7 animals in 2010 (Matkin <em>et al</em>.   2012). Over 700 unique individual resident Killer Whales were   photo-identified over the course of a field study during 1984-2010 in coastal   waters of the Gulf of Alaska (Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a subset of   pods within this population were regularly encountered, and those pods   increased in abundance at an average rate of 3.5% per annum during the study.   A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of Alaska   resulted in an estimate of 991 (CV=0.52) resident Killer Whales and 251 (CV=0.51)   transient Killer Whales (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/></p>   <p>The following figures are   available for Killer Whales in the Russian Far East, all representing   photo-identified individuals and therefore “minimum” counts (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014, Erich Hoyt, Whale and   Dolphin Conservation, pers. comm. 12 June 2017): Avacha   Gulf/eastern Kamchatka (1999-2013) – resident type 688, transient type 26   (note that rate of new discovery is very low indicating this may be close to   actual levels of abundance, and site fidelity is much higher than in the   Commander Islands); Commander Islands (2008-2013) - residents &gt; 800,   transients 18 (note that rate of new discovery is high so actual abundance is   certainly higher and about 80% of the identified individuals were encountered   in only one year); western Okhotsk Sea (from Udskaya Gulf to Sakhalin Gulf,   mainly Academiya Gulf) (2011-2013) – residents none, transients 55 (note that no dedicated study was carried out, only   opportunistic sightings along with beluga research; also this is the   population that has been subject to live-capture since 2010).<br/>   <br/>   Line-transect surveys have resulted in high estimates of abundance in several   regions in the North Atlantic, 3,100 (CV=0.63) in Norwegian waters in the   1980s (Øien 1990) and 6,618 (CV=0.32) in Iceland and Faroe Islands waters   also in the 1980s (Gunnlaugsson and Sigurjónsson 1990, Sigurjónsson <em>et al</em>.   1989). A long-term photo-identification study in coastal northern Norway   resulted in an abundance estimate of 731 (CI = 505-1059) in 2003 (Kuningas <em>et al</em>. 2014). In central and southern   European waters there are only two known populations of Killer Whales – one   in the Strait of Gibraltar with 39 individuals in 2011 (Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016) and the other a pod of   nine individuals regularly seen around western Ireland and northwestern   Scotland (Beck <em>et al</em>. 2013). Killer   Whales are not common in the waters off the eastern United States. Line-transect   surveys yielded an estimate of 133 (CV=49%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico in   the early 2000s (Waring <em>et al</em>.   2006).<br/>   <br/>   Several analyses of line-transect surveys have yielded abundance estimates   for Killer Whales around Antarctica (Hammond 1984, Kasamatsu and Joyce 1995);   however, some of the estimates have been considered biased by methodology and   survey coverage (Branch and Butterworth 2001). More recent analyses that   account for some of these biases resulted in an estimate of about 25,000 for   waters south of 60°S (Branch and Butterworth 2001); however, there are still   uncertainties related to coverage of areas in the pack ice, so true abundance   could be higher. Densities are known to vary locally within Antarctic waters,   ranging from very abundant to uncommon (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pitman   and Ensor 2003), and it has been recognized that Killer Whale densities are   higher closer to the ice edge and within the marginal ice zone where the   smaller, fish-eating Killer Whales can occur in aggregations of tens to   hundreds of animals (Berzin and Vladimirov 1983, Pitman and Ensor 2003). A   photo-identification study of type C Killer Whales (a small, fish-eating   form) in McMurdo Sound from 2001-2015 estimated a population of at least 370   animals including 70 that were resident in the Sound each year during the   summer; the remainder were mostly just passing through (Pitman <em>et al</em>. submitted). In the Antarctic   Peninsula area, a photo-identification study of the three different ecotypes   that occur there has to date (June 2017) identified at least 372 type A Killer   Whales (specialist predators of Minke Whales; R. Pitman unpublished data).   Photo-identification studies in the Prince Edward Island Archipelago (mainly   around Marion Island) from 2006-2009 estimated a local population there of   around 42 individuals (95% CI=35-50) that prey seasonally on Penguins and Elephant   Seals (Reisinger <em>et al</em>. 2011). In   other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, 119 (CV=0.20) Killer Whales have been   estimated in New Zealand waters (Visser 2000), and 30 were identified off northern   Patagonia, Argentina, during 1975-1997 (Lopez and Lopez 1985, Iñíguez 2001). No   abundance estimates have been made for type D Killer Whales in the Southern   Hemisphere.<br/>   <br/>   According to Forney and Wade (2006), although the available data are far from   complete, abundance estimates for sampled areas provided a minimum worldwide   abundance estimate of about 50,000 Killer Whales of all types. Those authors   noted that the total was likely higher, because estimates were not available   for many high-latitude areas of the northern hemisphere and for large areas   of the South Pacific, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Killer Whale is the most cosmopolitan of all cetaceans and may be the second-most widely ranging mammal species on the planet, after Humans (Rice 1998). Killer Whales may occur in virtually any marine habitat but are most common in cold-water areas of high marine productivity, particularly at higher latitudes and near shore (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Forney and Wade 2006). Sightings range from the surf zone to the open sea with no clear restrictions of water temperature or depth on their range. The distribution extends to many semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf.<br/></p>  <p>Although Killer Whales occur worldwide, reported densities are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower in the tropics than in the highest latitudes in the Arctic and Antarctic where there has been sampling (Forney and Wade 2006). Killer Whales tend to be more common along continental margins; however, there is some variation in this general pattern that appears linked to ocean productivity. Killer Whales appear to be less common in warm western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio Current, than in more productive eastern boundary currents, such as the California Current. However, they are also common in cold-water western boundary currents such as the Oyashio and Falkland Currents.<br/> <br/> The map shows the inferred range based on a very large number of observations at sea.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>During the period 1962-1977, at least 65 Killer Whales were live-captured in British Columbia and Puget Sound, Washington (Bigg 1982). In addition, from 1976-1988, 59 Killer Whales were captured alive off Iceland: eight were released, three died and 48 (average 3.7 per year) were exported (Sigurjónsson and Leatherwood 1988). Small numbers of Killer Whales have also been live-captured in Japanese waters (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Killer Whales are still in demand for display in aquariums and amusement parks, especially in China. Most recent captures and exports have been of animals in the Russian Far East (Fisher and Reeves 2005, Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014). Of 21 Killer Whales known to have been live-captured in the western Sea of Okhotsk from 2012-2016, at least 13 of them were exported to China between 2013 and 2016 (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). The eastern North Atlantic as well as the ENP populations are included in Appendix II of CMS. <br/> <br/> Further studies on subpopulation structure, abundance and life history are needed for most regions. Regional populations of Killer Whales can be small and highly specialized, and therefore vulnerable to over-exploitation, disturbance, prey reductions and habitat deterioration. Several small populations are already recognized as having a high risk of extinction. Many similarly small and threatened populations may exist worldwide but have not yet been adequately studied and described (e.g., Foote <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

They occur primarily in coastal and continental shelf waters. <br/><br/>Harbor Porpoises are bycaught often in fishing gear, especially gillnets, throughout their range and several populations are of conservation concern, including the Baltic Sea subpopulation which is classified as Critically Endangered (Hammond et al., 2016), and the Black Sea subspecies which is classified as Endangered (Birkun Jr and Frantzis 2008). They are also subject to direct hunting in some areas, especially in Greenland. Other factors that likely affect the health of Harbor Porpoises include contaminants, noise, and prey depletion. Despite this, the species remains one of the most widespread and abundant cetaceans in the Northern Hemisphere, available estimates indicate that there are well over a million Harbor Porpoises globally, and there is no evidence that the threats are resulting in a continuing global population decline. This species was listed as Least Concern on the Red List in 2008 and it remains Least Concern in this updated assessment. Despite this, there are some populations, such as the Afro-Iberian Harbor Porpoise population, that are of conservation concern and may warrant separate subpopulation assessment. <br/><p></p>","<p>Harbor Porpoises mature earlier and have shorter gestation and lactation periods and life spans than most other cetaceans. Their normal reproductive cycle is annual.&#160; Throughout their range, Harbor Porpoises are largely limited to continental shelf waters. They typically frequent bays, estuaries, and tidal channels less than about 200 m in depth although in some areas, such as Greenland, they are found regularly beyond the 300m depth contour (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carretta <em>et al</em>. (2001) found that the main distribution of Harbor Porpoises in northern California was in waters shallower than 60 m deep. However, dives to at least 400 m have been recorded via telemetry (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). <br/> <br/> Harbor Porpoises eat a wide variety of fishes and cephalopods, and the main prey items vary regionally (see Smith and Gaskin 1974, Recchia and Read 1989, Fontaine <em>et al</em>. 1994, Gonzales <em>et al</em>. 1994, Aarefjord <em>et al</em>. 1995, Gannon <em>et al</em>. 1998, Read, 1999, Børjesson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2004, Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).&#160; Although small schooling fish (e.g. herring) are important, demersal foraging is characteristic in many areas. &#160;In most areas of the North Atlantic, the diet is dominated by just a few prey species from six families (in terms of biomass): Gadidae, Clupeidae, Osmeridae, Ammodytidae, Gobiidae, Carangidae. In terms of prey numbers, other groups with small individual body size, notably gobies, assume more importance. Off the Iberian Peninsula where the continental shelf is narrow, pelagic and offshore species are more important than in most other areas.&#160; Dietary shifts have been seen when important prey have declined in abundance – and originally preferred prey species do not necessarily reappear in the diet of the porpoises when stocks recover. This tendency to switch prey and not revert to ‘ideal’ prey once stocks recover, coupled with their high metabolic rate, makes Harbor Porpoises vulnerable to prey depletion (IMR/NAMMCO 2019).</p>  <p>Surveys in 1994, 2005 and 2016 in the North Sea and adjacent waters showed a shift in distribution from northern to southern areas (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2002, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017), a change that is reflected by increases in sightings from shore in countries like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Camphuysen 2004, Thomsen <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160; <br/> <br/> The ecology of Black Sea Harbor Porpoises may be unusual, reflecting the high degree of geographic isolation of their habitat, the low water salinity, seasonal fluctuations of water temperatures and large amounts of anoxic waters below 100-250 m (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Birkun 2010).<br/> <br/> <br/> </p>","<p><strong>Direct Catches</strong><br/> Harbor Porpoises have been hunted in many parts of their range, e.g. Puget Sound, Bay of Fundy, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Labrador, Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, Black Sea, and Danish Belt Seas (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). There is evidence that Harbor Porpoises were harvested by indigenous people in Maine (USA) and the Canadian Maritimes before the 1960s, and the meat was used for human consumption, oil, and fish bait. The extent of these past harvests is unknown, though it is believed to have been small and localized. Many of the above hunts are now closed but Harbor Porpoises are still hunted regularly in Greenland where both their meat and skin are consumed. The Greenland hunt is currently unregulated, however, catches do have to be reported. In Greenland more than 700 per year were taken in 1990-1993 (Teilmann and Dietz 1998). In 2003 the reported catch had increased to 2,320 (NAMMCO 2005). Catches increased between 1990 and 2017, up to an average annual harvest of approximately 2200 animals and a total of 55,495 individuals are estimated to have been killed between 1993 and 2017 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). These catch statistics may underestimate total mortality because there is a degree of under reporting and because an unknown proportion of animals killed may not be successfully secured by hunters. An annual total removal of 2,900 Harbor Porpoises allows for a 70% chance that the population will increase, but assessment of the population-level impacts of the hunt is hampered by unreliable reporting (NAMMCO 2019) and the sustainability of the current harvest level is questionable. Harbor Porpoises are also hunted and bycaught in the Faroes but quantitative data are lacking (IMR/NAMMCO 2019).</p>  <p>In Japan, there has never been a directed hunt for Harbor Porpoises. Differences in the local names used for cetacean species in Japan in the past mean that catches of other species may have been misreported as Harbor Porpoises (Kasuya 2017). In the Black Sea, large directed takes occurred during 1976-1983. Within that period, the total number of Harbor Porpoises killed was at least 163,000-211,000. Commercial hunting of Black Sea cetaceans, including Harbor Porpoises, was banned in 1966 in the former USSR (present Georgia, Russia and Ukraine), Bulgaria and Romania, and in 1983 in Turkey. Illegal direct killing of unknown numbers of Harbor Porpoises continued in some parts of the Black Sea until 1991 (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006; Birkun Jr and Frantzis 2008).<br/> <br/> <strong>Fisheries Bycatch</strong><br/> Today, the most significant threat to this species in most areas is incidental catch in fishing gear, primarily gillnets. Substantial bycatch rates were documented in the 1980s and 1990s and are summarized in Donovan and Bjørge (1995). Mortality due to bycatch was estimated for the Gulf of Maine (1,200-2,900/year), Bay of Fundy (80-400/year), West Greenland (1,400/year), North Sea (4,600/year) Celtic Shelf (1,500/year), and also off central California (tens to hundreds per year; Barlow and Hanan 1995). </p>  <p>Bycatch in gillnet fisheries off the central coast of California were documented to cause high levels of mortality and population declines of Harbor Porpoises, with a peak in the 1980’s and a gradual subsequent decline when management measures, including fishery closures in some areas, were put in place to protect marine mammals (Barlow and Forney, 1994). Following implementation of these measures, surveys conducted in 1991-1993 did not indicate increases in populations (Forney, 1995), but increases were documented between 2002 and 2007 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2009). Bycatch in current fisheries off the Pacific coast of the USA does not appear to represent a population-level threat (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2018), with the exception of the salmon gillnet fisheries in southeast Alaksa, where annual mortality from bycatch was estimated at 34 individuals, exceeding the calculated potential biological removal limit of 8.9 individuals per year (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>  <p>In Japan, 83 bycatch deaths in set nets and bottom gillnets were reported during 2008-2017, most of them in Hokkaido. This number is likely to be only a small part of the actual mortality&#160;(Marine Mammals Strandings Database, National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, https://www.kahaku.go.jp/english/research/db/zoology/marmam/drift/detail.php?id=93). Annual incidental catches and deaths of Harbor Porpoises in the large set nets at Usujiri, Hokkaido during 1992-1997 were reported as <a style=""mso-comment-reference: RR_1;mso-comment-date:20191017T0946"">3.67 caught, and 0.17 dead per net</a>, respectively, because animals enter the nets but often either leave of their own accord or are released by fishers (Iwata <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although the mortality of animals per net is not large, considering that there are about 1,000 large set nets along the coast of Hokkaido, substantial incidental mortality is suspected. </p>  <p>Across the North Atlantic, gillnets, including bottom-set gillnets, tangle nets and drifting gillnets, are responsible for most of the Harbor Porpoise bycatch, and the data were recently reviewed by IMR/NAMMCO (2019). The fisheries responsible for the majority of Harbor Porpoise by-catch tend to be those using medium to large mesh-size gillnets set for species such as cod, hake, turbot, monkfish and lumpfish. The reason for the high by-catch rates in these fisheries is a combination of net type and fishing effort. The observed decrease in bycatch of Harbor Porpoises in some areas is most likely due to a reduction in fishing effort, which is in turn due to a reduction in total allowable catches of the target species.</p>  <p>Along the US Atlantic coast Harbor Porpoise bycatch in set gillnets was estimated as 2,900 individuals/year in the early 1990s. Rates remained near this level until implementation of Take Reduction Plans in December 1998 that included a series of time and area closures and gear modifications which saw bycatch rates drop to approximately 300-900 individuals/year (Orphanides 2009; IMR/NAMMCO 2019). After that, by-catch increased when compliance with rules related to the use of pingers decreased. Harbor Porpoises are still caught in the gillnet fisheries targeting monkfish and other groundfish on the east coast of the United States from North Carolina north along the continental shelf and into the Gulf of Maine (Orphanides, 2009). In the Gulf of Maine/Lower Bay of Fundy (Canada) the total annual average human-caused mortality and serious injury, estimated using observer data from U.S. fisheries in 2011-2015, was 307 Harbor Porpoises (CV=0.16) (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2018). The majority of this mortality was in the sink gillnet fishery.<br/><br/>The best Harbor Porpoise bycatch estimates for Newfoundland range from 862 (95% CI= 130-2,135) in 2001 to 2,228 (95% CI 315-5,223) in 2003 (Benjamins et al. 2007). Estimates for the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Scotian Shelf stratum range from 2,215 (95% CI= 1,151-3,662) in 2000 to 2,394 (95% CI= 1,440-3,348) in 2001 (Lesage <em>et al</em>. 2004). A preliminary estimate of 1,841 Harbor Porpoises a year is considered as an upper bound for the bycatch in cod gillnets in Iceland over the period 2013-2017 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). The bycatch rate averaged over a 10-year period for Norwegian coastal waters is approximately 2,300 animals/year (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). In 2017, the Harbor Porpoise was the second-most frequently reported cetacean species to strand on the French Atlantic coast (Bay of Biscay) (6.7% of 1211 stranded individuals) and the most frequently reported species on the French Channel coast (74.1% of 307 stranded individuals) (Dars et al. 2017). Recent monitoring of Danish set-net fisheries in the North Sea revealed an average of 5,591 Harbor Porpoises taken annually in the period 1987-2001 (Vinther and Larsen 2002, 2004), with a significant reduction in by-catch towards the end of the time series as a result of a decrease in fishing effort and fish landings. The north-western Iberian Peninsula is a productive fishing area, and has one of the highest rates of marine mammal strandings recorded in Europe. Harbor Porpoises comprised 7% of strandings in Galicia (López <em>et al</em>. 2002) and 13% of strandings in central-north Portugal (Ferreira 2007). Between 1990 and 2010, a total of 305 Harbor Porpoises were recorded as stranded along the north-western Iberian Peninsula and around 60% of these porpoises bore evidence of fisheries interactions. Preliminary data suggest that this would represent an annual human-caused mortality rate of 4.3-11% of the Iberian Harbor Porpoise population, which is very likely to be unsustainable (F. L. Read <em>et al</em>. 2020). The estimated average annual by-catch across Portuguese polyvalent, purse seine and beach seine fleets in 2010 to 2014 was 906 Harbor Porpoises (IMR/NAMMCO 2019).<br/></p>  <p>A study of cetaceans stranded in the Netherlands examined the gross pathology of 255 Harbor Porpoises and found that in the period 1990-2000, and in 2006 and 2007, between 50 and 60% of the animals showed signs of definite or probable by-catch in fishing gear. A study using remote electronic monitoring and logbooks to monitor bycatch in bottom-set gillnet fisheries in the Netherlands yielded an estimated average of 23 Harbor Porpoises (95% C.I. 2-44) caught per year between 2013 and 2017 – thought to represent between 0.05 and 0.07% of the Netherlands’ Harbor Porpoise population (Scheidat <em>et al</em>. 2018). Evidence suggests that Harbor Porpoise lifespans are shortened in areas of high human activity and increased bycatch risk in the Baltic Sea (Kesselring<em> et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>In the Black Sea incidental mortality in bottom-set gillnets is estimated to have been in the thousands annually through the 1980s (e.g., Birkun 2002a). The scale of this mortality has almost certainly increased in recent times owing to the rapid expansion of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Black Sea (Tonay and Öztürk 2003; Birkun Jr and Frantzis 2008).</p>  <p><strong>Other Threats<br/> </strong>Other types of threats to Harbor Porpoises include chemical pollution, vessel traffic, noise, and depletion of prey by overfishing. Due to their near-shore distribution, Harbor Porpoises are exposed to coastal sources of pollution throughout most of their range. Chemical pollutants (specifically PCBs) have been described as having adverse effects (Hammond<em> et al.</em> 2016). Immunosuppression by contaminants (heavy metals and PCBs) is reported in the eastern North Atlantic (Bennet <em>et al.</em> 2001, Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2005), and a similar cause was suggested for the high rate of infectious disease found in stranded Harbor Porpoises in Canada (Fenton <em>et al</em>. 2017). Following the EU-wide ban of commercial penta- and octa-mix polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) products in 2004 (Law <em>et al</em>. 2012), a significant (and consistent) decline was observed in concentrations of brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) in marine sentinel species (including the Harbor Porpoise) during the period 2008 to 2012 (Law <em>et al</em>. 2012). Declines were also observed in HBCD, tributyltin (TBT) and organochlorine pesticide concentrations in the blubber of UK-stranded Harbor Porpoises over the same period (Law <em>et al</em>. 2012). Concentrations of PCB, a known endocrine disruptor, in Harbor Porpoise blubber have remained stable since 1997, with mean ΣPCB concentrations in adult male and female porpoises (sampled between 1990 and 2012) exceeding an established mammalian toxicity threshold of 9 mg/kg ΣPCB for onset of physiological (immunological and reproductive) endpoints in marine mammals (Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2016, Kannan <em>et al.</em> 2000, Law <em>et al</em>. 2012). Preliminary results suggest that reproductive dysfunction in UK porpoises, either through endocrine-disrupting effects or via immunosuppression and increased disease risk, is related to PCB exposure.<br/> <br/> Noise pollution in coastal waters is increasing, and seal scarers, which are powerful acoustic harassment devices designed to keep seals away from fish farms and fishing gear, are increasing in number. They are known to deter porpoises at distances of many kilometers, and likely more than 10 km (Johnston 2002, Mikkelsen <em>et al</em>. 2017, Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 2002). In almost all studies (in captivity and in the field) the reaction of porpoises to sounds has been negative (evasion).&#160; <br/> <br/> Habitat degradation and prey depletion caused by intensive fishing in the Black Sea, together with the explosive growth of populations of invasive species, are considered significant threats for Harbor Porpoises in this semi-enclosed sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Reduced prey availability coincided with two mass mortality events (in 1989 and 1990) that affected all three Black Sea cetacean species, but primarily Harbor Porpoises (Birkun 2002c). Severe pulmonary nematodosis, caused by <em>Halocercus spp</em>. and complicated by bacterial super-infection, was recognized as the proximate cause of the deaths, which were mainly of young animals.</p>  <p>An explosion at a gas-drilling platform in the Azov Sea in August 1982 resulted in the deaths of over 2,000 Harbor Porpoises (Birkun 2002b).&#160; </p>","<p>No synoptic surveys have covered the entire range of the species across ocean basins, but abundance has been estimated for many portions of the range. In the North Atlantic (including the Black and Azov seas), 18 assessment units have been proposed (IMR/NAMMCO 2019), and in the North Pacific, several population units or stocks have been identified based on genetic studies (Chivers <em>et al</em>. 2002, Taguchi <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p><u>Pacific Ocean</u><br/> Based on aerial or vessel surveys conducted between 2007-2013 corrected for availability bias, about 68,500 animals occur along the west coast of the USA (including 2,917 (CV=0.41) in the Morro Bay population, 3,715 (CV=0.51) in the Monterey Bay population, 9,886 (CV=0.51)] from San Francisco to the Russian River, 35,769 (CV=0.52) in northern California and southern Oregon, 21,487 (CV = 0.44) in Oregon and Washington , and 11,233 (CV=0.37) in Washington inland waters) (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p>Aerial line transect surveys conducted in summer 1998 and 1999 estimated (corrected for availability and perception bias) about 90,500 Harbor Porpoises (including 11,146 (CV=0.24) in coastal and inland waters of southeast Alaska, 31,046 (CV=0.21) in the Gulf of Alaska, and 48,215 (CV=0.22) in the Bering Sea) (Hobbs and Waite 2010, Muto <em>et al.</em> 2018). Using vessel-based line transect methods, from 2010-2012, there were estimated to be 975 (CV=0.1) Harbor Porpoises in inland waters of Southeast Alaska (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dalheim <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p><u>Atlantic Ocean</u><br/> A comprehensive review of the status of Harbor Porpoises in the entire Atlantic Ocean was conducted in 2018 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019), and compiled abundance estimates are available in the online supplementary files here: <a href=""https://nammco.no/topics/scientific-workshops-symposia-reports/#2018"">https://nammco.no/topics/scientific-workshops-symposia-reports/#2018</a> and summarized below.</p>  <p>In the western Atlantic, an abundance estimate of 79,883 (CV=0.32) Harbor Porpoises was generated from a shipboard and aerial survey of the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy in June–August 2011 (Palka 2012, Hayes <em>et al. </em>2018). This estimate is likely negatively biased because no correction was made for availability bias (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2018). Aerial line transect surveys of the Atlantic coast of Canada in 2016 generated a Harbor Porpoise abundance estimate of 256,355 (CV=0.40), comprised of a Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) stratum with 48,723 individuals (95% CI= 23,566-100,754), a Gulf of St Lawrence stratum with 185,258 animals (95% CI=101,006-286,117), and a Scotian Shelf stratum with an estimate of 20,464 individuals (95% CI=6,831-37,317) (Lawson &amp; Gosselin 2018).&#160; </p>  <p>Abundance estimates for Harbor Porpoises in East and West Greenland were generated from aerial surveys conducted in 2007 (West Greenland only) and 2015 (West and East Greenland). These estimates, corrected for animals that were outside of the survey strata and not counted (based on satellite tracking data), were 69,595 porpoises (CV=0.37; 95% CI= 34,689-139,624) in 2007 and 106,822 (CV=0.35, 95% CI= 55,149-206,909) in 2015 (NAMMCO 2019).</p>  <p>Harbor Porpoise abundance in Iceland was estimated by aerial surveys in 2007 as 43,179 (CV 0.45) individuals; however, since the survey was not designed for Harbor Porpoises this estimate should be treated with caution as it is likely to have underestimated abundance (Gilles <em>et al</em>. 2011, IMR/NAMMCO 2019). Aerial surveys in the Faroes in June 2010 estimated 5,175 (CV=0.44, 95% CI=3,457-17,637) Harbor Porpoises, however these surveys did not cover areas outside the 300 m depth contour and therefore this is considered a minimum estimate (Gilles <em>et al.</em> 2011, IMR/NAMMCO 2019). </p>  <p>Harbor Porpoises (along with Common Dolphins) were the most abundant cetaceans recorded during the SCANSIII survey program in July 2016 in the European Atlantic (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). The program estimated a total of 466,569 (CV=0.154, CI=345,306-630,417) Harbor Porpoises from aerial and ship surveys, which included 24,526 porpoises (CV=0.28, CL low=14,035, CL high=40,829) in Norwegian coastal waters, 24,370 (CV=0.23) in western Scotland, 53,336 (CV=0.24) in the Celtic and Irish Seas, 345,306 (CV=0.18) in the North Sea, 67,691 (CV=0.22) in the Kattegat/Belt Seas/Skagerrak area, and 2,898 (CV=0.32) around the Iberian Peninsula of Spain and Portugal (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017, Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2018). Ship-based line-transect surveys between 2002 and 2007 estimated Harbor Porpoise abundance in the Barents Sea as 55,394 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). Line transect aerial surveys conducted throughout the waters of the Netherlands from May 2008 to March 2010 generated an estimate of 66,328 porpoises (95% C.I. 32,745–125,220; CV=0.34) (Scheidat <em>et al</em>. 2012). No abundance estimates are available for Harbor Porpoises off Northwest Africa.</p>  <p><u>Baltic Sea</u><br/> Abundance of Harbor Porpoises in the Baltic Sea was estimated as 497 animals (95% CI=80-1091) based on two years (May 2011-Apr 2013) of static acoustic monitoring data collected at 304 survey stations (SAMBAH 2016). Aerial surveys were conducted during different seasons in the years 2002 to 2006 to obtain estimates of abundance in the southwestern Baltic. Abundance estimates for the total area ranged from 457 (CV=0.97) in March 2003 to a high of 4,610 (CV=0.35) in May 2005 (Scheidat <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p><u>Black Sea</u><br/> The results of line transect surveys conducted during the early 2000s in different portions of the Black Sea suggested that the total population of Harbor Porpoises was at least several thousand and perhaps as many as 10,000-12,000 (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Ongoing surveys mean that this estimate will be updated in the near future.</p>  <u>Global</u><br/> Taken together, these numbers indicate that the global abundance of Harbor Porpoises is well over a million individuals.",Unknown,"Harbour Porpoises are found in cold temperate to sub-polar waters of the Northern Hemisphere (Gaskin 1992, Read 1999). They are usually found in continental shelf waters, although they occasionally travel over deeper offshore waters. In the North Pacific, they range from central California and northern Honshu to the southern Beaufort and Chukchi Seas (including the Bering and Okhotsk Seas, and Sea of Japan). In the North Atlantic, they are found from the southeastern United States to southern Baffin Island (they apparently do not enter Hudson Bay) in the west, and from Senegal to Novaya Zemlya in the east. They also occur around southeast and western Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, and this is the only cetacean species that currently regularly occupies the Baltic Sea. The species occurs in the Black Sea, Marmara Sea, and Sea of Azov, but with the exception of the adjacent northern Aegean Sea, they do not regularly occur in the Mediterranean Sea.","<p>Most directed harvests of this species have now been closed, but they continue in Greenland (NAMMCO 2019).</p>",Marine,"<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES and Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). It is on Appendix II of the Bonn Convention, Appendix I of the Berne Convention and Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive. Harbor Porpoises are covered under ACCOBAMS (CMS Agreement for the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Areas) and are ‘managed’ by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO). The CMS 13th Conference of Parties (COP) in February 2020 adopted a Concerted Action for Baltic and Iberian Harbor Porpoise populations.</p>  <p>The introduction of fisheries bycatch mitigation measures, including time/area closures, off California and in inland waters of Washington State, effectively reduced Harbor Porpoise mortality and led to population increases over time (Forney 1995, Carretta et <em>al. </em>2009).</p>  <p>In the North Sea, bycatch (incidental mortality) has been determined to be above the advised maximum level of removals. The European Union adopted a regulation aimed at reducing the incidental catch of small cetaceans in fisheries in EU waters. The use of acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) has proven to be effective in reducing bycatch mortality for this species without negatively impacting target fish catches (Carlström <em>et al</em>. 2009; Larsen and Eigaard 2014). As such, EU regulations require the use of pingers in some EU gillnet fisheries in the North and Baltic Seas, and the use of onboard observers to monitor bycatch on vessels of over 15 m in length. Recommended improvements to these measures and their implementation include better monitoring, data collection and management to more effectively assess and mitigate bycatch (Dolman<em> et al.</em> 2016), and the use of time area closures in conjunction with acoustic deterrents (Beest<em> et al.</em> 2017). Similarly, on the east coast of the USA, Harbor Porpoises have been the subject of Take Reduction Plans since 1998 that include time and area closures and gear modifications.&#160; </p>",Afrotropical|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
57549321,899,Vulpes lagopus,Least Concern,,2014,2014-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Arctic Fox has a circumpolar distribution in all Arctic tundra habitats, with a global population in the order of several hundred thousand animals. Most populations fluctuate widely in numbers between years in response to varying lemming numbers, but in most areas population status is believed to be good and there is no reason to believe that the species currently qualifies for listing as threatened under any of the criteria.","Inhabits Arctic and alpine tundra on the continents of Eurasia, North America and the Canadian archipelago, Siberian islands, Greenland, inland Iceland and Svalbard, and Sub-Arctic maritime habitat in the Aleutian island chain, Bering Sea Islands, Commander Islands and coastal Iceland. <br/><br/>The Arctic Fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger but in most inland areas, the species is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. The species' main prey items include lemmings, both <em>Lemmus</em> spp. and <em>Dicrostonyx</em> spp. (Macpherson 1969, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1999). In Fennoscandia, <em>Lemmus lemmus</em> was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in faeces) followed by birds (Passeriformes, Galliformes and Caridriiformes, 34%) and reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>) (21%; Elmhagen <em>et al</em>. 2000). In winter, ptarmigan and grouse (<em>Lagopus</em> spp.) are common prey in addition to rodents and reindeer (Kaikusalo and Angerbjörn 1995). Changes in fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles (Macpherson 1969, Angerbjörn <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2013) with up to 20 cubs produced by a single female (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1998).<br/><br/>Foxes living near ice-free coasts have access to both inland prey and sea birds, seal carcasses, fish and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996). In late winter and summer, foxes found in coastal Iceland feed on seabirds (<em>Uria aalge</em>, <em>U. lomvia</em>), seal carcasses and marine invertebrates. Inland foxes rely more on ptarmigan in winter, and migrant birds, such as geese and waders, in summer (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996). In certain areas, foxes rely on colonies of Arctic geese, which can dominate their diet locally (Samelius and Lee 1998).&#160;Some populations switch between lemmings, migratory birds and marine resources depending on intra- and interannual variations in prey availability. The Arctic Fox depends also on remains of carrion left by larger predators, e.g. Polar Bear, Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupus</em>, and Wolverine <em>Gulo gulo</em>. It is itself a victim of predation, mainly from Red Fox, Wolverine, Golden Eagle, and humans.","Hunting for fur has long been a major mortality factor for the Arctic Fox. With the decline of the fur hunting industry, the threat of over-exploitation is lowered for most Arctic Fox populations. They may also be subject to direct persecution (as on St. Paul Island). Misinformation as to the origin of Arctic Foxes on the Pribilofs continues to foster negative attitudes and the long-term persistence of this endemic subspecies is in jeopardy. In areas connected to marine ecosystems, Arctic Foxes may also be affected by indirect threats, such as diseases and the effects of persistent organic pollutants (Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2008); indeed, an emerging threat in Fennoscandia is the impact of sarcoptic mange on populations (Mörner 1992).&#160;In some areas, gene swamping by farm-bred blue foxes (see Conservation) may threaten native populations (Norén&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009).","The world population of Arctic Foxes is in the order of several hundred thousand animals. Most populations fluctuate widely in numbers between years in response to varying lemming numbers. In most areas, however, population status is believed to be good. The species is common in the tundra areas of Russia, Canada, coastal Alaska, Greenland and Iceland. Exceptions are Fennoscandia, islands in the Bering Sea (Mednyi Island, Russia; Pribilof Islands, Alaska, e.g., St Paul), where populations are at critically low levels and appear to be declining further. On some Aleutian Islands, Alaska, non-native Arctic Foxes are being eradicated in the course of bird conservation efforts (Walton <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Vagrant Arctic Foxes are common over the northern sea-ice where can move several thousands of kilometres following Polar Bears <em>Ursus maritimus&#160;</em>as scavengers (Tarroux <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Stable,"The Arctic Fox has a circumpolar distribution in all Arctic tundra habitats. It breeds north of and above the tree line on the Arctic tundra in North America and Eurasia and on the alpine tundra in Fennoscandia, ranging from northern Greenland at 88°N to the southern tip of Hudson Bay, Canada, 53°N. The southern edge of the species' distribution range may have moved somewhat north during the 20th century resulting in a smaller total range (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1992). The species inhabits most Arctic islands and many islands in the Bering Sea. The Arctic Fox was also introduced to previously isolated islands in the Aleutian chain at the end of the 19th century by the fur industry (Bailey 1992), where they are now often being eliminated by bird conservation efforts (Walton <em>et al</em>. 2013). The Arctic Fox has also been observed on the sea ice up to the North Pole. They may occur up to 3,000 m asl in elevation.&#160;<br/><br/>During the last glaciation, the Arctic Fox had a distribution along the ice edge, and Arctic Fox remains have been found in a number of Pleistocene deposits over most of Europe and large parts of Siberia (Dalén <em>et al</em>. 2007).","The Arctic Fox remains the single most important terrestrial game species in the Arctic. Indigenous peoples have always utilized its exceptional fur, and with the advent of the fur industry, the Arctic Fox quickly became an important source of income. Today, leg-hold traps and shooting are the main hunting methods. Because of their large reproductive capacity, Arctic Foxes can maintain population levels under high hunting pressure. In some areas, up to 50% of the total population has been harvested on a sustainable basis (Nasimovic and Isakov 1985). However, this does not allow for hunting during population lows, as shown by the situation in Fennoscandia. The Arctic Fox has nevertheless survived high fur prices better than most other Arctic mammals. Hunting has declined considerably in the last decades, as a result of low fur prices and alternative sources of income. In the Yukon, for example, the total value of all fur production decreased from $1.3 million in 1988 to less than $300,000 after 2000.",Terrestrial|Marine,"The species is not included in the CITES Appendices.<br/><br/>In most of its range, the Arctic Fox is not protected. However, the species and its dens have had total legal protection in Sweden since 1928, in mainland Norway since 1930, and in Finland since 1940. In Europe, the Arctic Fox is a priority species under the Actions by the Community relating to the Environment (ACE). It is therefore to be given full protection. On St. Paul Island the declining Arctic Fox population currently has no legal protection (Walton<em> et al</em>. 2013). In Norway (Svalbard), Greenland, Canada, Russia, and Alaska, trapping is limited to licensed trappers operating in a defined trapping season. The enforcement of these laws appears to be uniformly good. In Iceland, bounty hunting takes place over most of the country outside nature reserves.<br/><br/>For occurrence in protected areas, good information is available only for Sweden and Finland. For Iceland, Arctic Foxes could potentially appear in most protected areas. <br/><br/>An action plan has been developed for Arctic Foxes in Sweden (Elmhagen 2008) and status reports have been published for Norway (Ulvund <em>et al</em>. 2013) and Finland (Kaikusalo <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Sweden, Norway and Finland, a conservation project led to significant increases in the population (Angerbjörn <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>The Arctic Fox occurs widely in captivity on fur farms and has been bred for fur production for over 70 years. The present captive population originates from a number of wild populations and has been bred for characteristics different from those found in the wild, including large size. Escaped ""blue"" foxes may already be a problem in Fennoscandia (and to a lesser extent in Iceland) due to gene swamping (Norén <em>et al</em>. 2009).&#160;In Norway, foxes bred in captivity have successfully been released into the wild (Landa <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The following gaps still exist in knowledge of the Arctic Fox:<br/><br/>1) Little is known concerning the impact of diseases on fox populations, e.g. sarcoptic mange and <em>Echinococcus multilocularis</em>. Allied to this is our lack of knowledge of the epidemiology of Arctic rabies.<br/><br/>2) Considering the northward spread of the Red Fox in certain areas, studies are necessary to determine the effects of competition between Red Foxes and Arctic Foxes on various population parameters and Arctic Fox life-history patterns.<br/><br/>3) The non-recovery of the Fennoscandian population is a cause for concern, and requires specific attention, especially in terms of disease and genetics.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Notably, locally adapted subpopulations often form morphologically and genetically distinct 'species pairs', some of which have been wiped out as a result of water quality degradation, invasive species, and hybridization. &#160;The species is common and has a vast range, and there are no widespread major threats. Although sub-species level conservation management is warranted for many subpopulations, <em>Gasterosteus aculeatus </em>is globally listed as Least Concern.","This species is typically found in quiet weedy pools and backwaters. It is also found in the marginal vegetation of streams, over sand and mud bottom substrates. Marine populations are pelagic, and usually found inshore along the coast, in estuaries and coastal lagoons. In some lakes, two morphologically and ecologically distinct forms may occur, differing in habitat and morphology (one littoral, the other mainly limnetic) (Taylor 1999).&#160;<br/>The species can be anadromous, but there are numerous resident populations in brackish or pure freshwater. Anadromous populations forage at sea until two years old, then move to lower parts of rivers in March-April to reproduce (van Mullem and van der Vlugt 1964). Freshwater populations usually spawn for the first time at one year. In spawning season, males develop a bright orange to red belly and blue-green flank and eyes. They defend territories, in which in April-June they construct a nest on the bottom, in relatively shallow areas, very rarely attached to plants. They make a depression up to 14 × 10 cm to which they bring plant materials (especially filamentous algae), which are glued together with kidney secretions.&#160;Eggs are deposited in freshwater in a nest of plant material made by the male on the bottom in shallow water (Craig-Bennett 1931, Sargent and Gebler 1980). The female will typically lay a few hundred eggs and may lay eggs in several nests over a period of several days (Morrow 1980).<br/>Several females are individually led to the nest to spawn, then chased away. Males guard and fan eggs to provide them with oxygenated water. &#160;Eggs hatch in 7-8 days and juveniles are guarded for a few days after which the male abandons the nest. Anadromous individuals usually die of exhaustion after spawning, while freshwater individuals are able to complete several cycles within one year or sometimes over several years. Juveniles move to sea (anadromous populations) or to deeper, larger water bodies (freshwater populations) in July-August where they form large feeding schools (Symons 1971).&#160;<br/>They feed on small aquatic invertebrates, especially insects and crustaceans (Kuiter 2000).","No major widespread threats known.

Archaeologically, subpopulations were abundant throughout its range despite natural fluctuations; however, more recently (1900’s) this species has exhibited erratic, and at times, catastrophic declines, possibly caused by heavy industrial exploitation during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century combined with natural causes like food availability and climatic changes. Overall, currently available (~ 2000 – present) global population information for this species is extremely variable. Some regions within its distribution (e.g., northeast Pacific: Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) have long time series data available (e.g., spawning stock biomass estimates, landings data, etc.), while other regions (e.g., northwest Pacific: Japan, Russia, Korea, China) have little to no current information available. Within some areas where data are available, spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates suggest rapid fluctuations (e.g., Alaska, California, Canada, etc.); however, these estimates are spatially and temporally asynchronous. For example, in some localities (e.g., Prince William Sound, Alaska; Cherry Point, Washington; West Coast Vancouver Island, British Columbia) SSB estimates decreased by up to 77 % in the most recent 15 years available (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). However, in other neighboring localities (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska; Quilcene Bay, Washington), SSB estimates have increased by up to 400 % in the most recent 15 years available. Given the inconsistencies in the trends of available data within and between regions (including temporal differences in biological characteristics such as maximum age and age at first maturity), we are unable to extrapolate trends in SSB across the entire global population.</p>  <p>The prominent threat to this species is likely a changing climate which can impact food availability for each of several life history stages (larvae, juveniles and adults), spawning distribution and recruitment within local stocks. Additionally, climatic changes can also impact the distribution of major predators (e.g., birds, pinnipeds and other fishes) which can have widespread ecological and fishery effects. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that disease can significantly affect recruitment especially as a consequence of anthropogenic impacts, though more research is needed. In general, this species is also exploited to a varying degree throughout a large portion of its global range. It is regarded as the second most important targeted species in the northwest Pacific; it is one of the few important commercial species targeted in Russian Far East territory and has been taken in industrial trawl fisheries since the early 1900s. However, little current information on the status of this species in this region is available. In the eastern Pacific, this species is targeted at varying intensities in the purse seine and gill net fisheries for food, bait and sac roe exploitation. Throughout its range, it likely also contributes small quantities to bycatch in trawl, seine and longline industrial fisheries that target other important species such as Alaska pollock, cod and various flatfishes. Given the commercial importance of this species, fisheries management regulations have been implemented within its range, such as yearly fishery closures and stock-specific management plans including yearly stock assessments, catch quotas, harvest rates, and biomass reference points. In some areas, (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska) herring have responded to management measures. However, it has not proven to respond well to management and conservation measures in other localities where it has experienced major declines in abundance, even after periods of long-term fisheries closures in some cases (e.g., Cherry Point, Washington, Yellow Sea, Hokkaido-Sakhalin). This may further suggest that natural changes are possibly preventing the recovery of this species in these areas. </p>  <p>In general, the status of this species within the southernmost portions of its range (e.g., within the Yellow Sea and off coastal Japan in the western Pacific and off the continental U.S. in the eastern Pacific, including California, Oregon and Washington) is of concern. Sea surface temperatures are expected to continue to increase in these areas as a result of global climate change, potentially leading to a northward contraction of its range into cooler waters. It is known that the spawning distribution of this species changes naturally throughout its range in response to local abundance and environmental conditions; some areas observe new spawning localities or renewed spawning in previously known localities, while other areas observe a cessation or contraction in known spawning localities leading to the concern of the possible depletion of local stocks. More research is needed to determine whether changes are due to fishing pressure or a natural shift in distribution.</p>  <p>In light of the major commercial importance of this species, marked declines in some places and increases in others, and major data gaps in large regions of its range where it is known to be exploited (e.g., current/recent status in Japan and Russia), assessing the overall status of this species globally as per the IUCN Red List Criteria is not possible, and therefore <em>Clupea pallasii</em> is assessed as Data Deficient. If and when information becomes available where it currently is not, this species should be immediately be reassessed. Furthermore, due to the variations in life history characteristics, exploitation level and biomass trends, sub-global assessments for this species are urgently needed. </p>","<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is a pelagic-neritic schooling species that mainly occupies the deeper waters of coastal shelf regions to about 300 – 400 metres at maximum. Herring move inshore to breed in high-energy, shallow intertidal and subtidal habitats from about November to July (Whitehead 1985, Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Hay <em>et al. </em>2009). Spawning takes place once a year (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a) in many localities throughout its global range. Pacific herring are late winter and spring spawners (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001a) with peak spawning events occurring later in the spring at progressively higher latitudes (Haegele and Schweigert 1985). For example, in the eastern Pacific, spawning takes place from November to March in California, February to April in British Columbia, and from March to June off south and north Alaska, respectively (Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Age at maturity varies geographically from 1 – 4 years of age (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). During mass spawning events, females deposit adhesive eggs directly on the bottom, on vegetative substrata such as seagrasses and seaweeds, rocky intertidal areas or man-made structures (e.g., pier pilings, rip rap: Blaxter 1985, Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em><em>2001a, </em>2009, Shirafuji <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160; After spawning, individuals generally migrate back to foraging grounds in deeper water (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Similar to age at maturity and spawning time, there is latitudinal variability in other biological factors including, maximum size, longevity and migration patterns. For example, compared to herring within the eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska herring reach a smaller maximum size overall, have a shorter maximum longevity, more frequent recruitment events (every four years compared to every ten years in the eastern Bering Sea) and do not undergo large migrations (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In general, schools consist of individuals of similar size/age such that juveniles do not mix with larger juveniles or adults (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This species is known to a maximum standard length of 33 cm (Whitehead 1985), though there are records of this species with a total length of 46 cm (Coad and Reist 2004). Maximum longevity varies from 7 – 15 years (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Adult herring are known to exhibit extensive diel vertical migrations where they are deeper in the water column by day and shallower during the night (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Herring diets vary but they mainly consume zooplankton; larvae consume copepod eggs, nauplii and young stages of other organisms, juveniles mainly consume copepods and adults predominately feed on copepods and euphausiids (Wailes 1936, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Long-term cyclic changes in size-at-age of Alaskan herring have been correlated to zooplankton abundance and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), though direct causes are not known (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). It is possible that subpopulations elsewhere (e.g., Hokkaido – Sakhalin, Yellow Sea) are impacted by food availability and climatic variation as well, though more research is needed. </p><em> </em>","<p><em>Clupea pallasii</em>&#160;is heavily fished throughout a large portion of its global range and has shown considerable population fluctuations with dramatically reduced abundance levels in parts of its range (see summaries in: Ware 1991, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat 2009, Schweigert <em>et al</em>. 2010, FAO 2016, WDFW 2018<em>a</em>). Archaeological evidence indicates that this species exhibited natural fluctuations; however, over the last century, some subpopulations have exhibited erratic, and at times, catastrophic declines (McKechnie <em>et al.</em> 2014). It is possible that drastic declines stemmed from natural causes; however, excessive industrial harvesting is suggested to be a likely reason for differences in ancient and modern herring abundance (McKechnie and Smith 2013). In more recent years, other factors such as food availability and environmental forcing, rather than heavy fishing pressure, likely play a larger role in the overall abundance throughout its range (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Ward <em>et al. </em>2017, 2019), as most fisheries appear to be regulated and respond to management. For example, in British Columbia, precautionary harvest policies have been in place since 1986 (i.e., stocks are managed using a 20% harvest rate and a commercial fishery threshold of 25% of the estimated unfished spawning biomass, 0.25B<sub>0</sub>: Cleary <em>et al. </em>2010). Since policies have been in place, most major stocks within British Columbia experienced declines in biomass until 2010 (Schweigert <em>et al</em>. 2010). Similarly, all five major British Columbian stocks experienced declines in weight-at-age from the mid-1980’s to 2010, with a levelling off and/or increase in the most recent five years available (2012 – 2017: DFO 2018). Additionally, herring in British Columbia previously displayed a long-term decline in size-at-age, suggesting a possible reduction or limitation of the food supply or other resources that may have prevented recovery (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2010); however, this declining trend has reversed in the most recent years (2010 – present: Hay <em>et al. </em>2019). </p>  <p>It is known that the spawning distribution of this species changes naturally throughout its range in response to local abundance and environmental conditions; some areas observe new spawning localities or renewed spawning in previously known localities, while other areas observe a cessation or contraction in known spawning localities leading to concerns about possible depletion of local stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2009). More research is needed to determine whether changes are due to fishing pressure or a natural shift in distribution (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2009). There is also evidence to suggest that disease significantly affects recruitment of this species (Marty <em>et al</em>. 2011); however, more research is needed to determine the overall severity of this potential threat.</p>","<p></p><p><strong><u>OVERALL POPULATION TRENDS</u></strong></p>  <p><em>Clupea pallasii</em> is a cold-water clupeid distributed throughout the Arctic and northern Pacific Oceans. Overall, available population information for this species is extremely variable. For example, some regions within its distribution (e.g., northeast Pacific: Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) have long time series data available (e.g., spawning stock biomass estimates, landings data, etc.), while other regions (e.g., northwest Pacific: Japan, Russia, Korea, China) have little to no current information available. This species, similar to other clupeids, is known to have large episodic recruitments (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the past (e.g., 1977) there has been broad temporal synchrony throughout many years with the arrival of strong cohorts in British Columbia and Alaska (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001b), though this is not consistent with current trends. Within some areas where data are available, spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates suggest rapid fluctuations (e.g., Alaska, California, Canada, etc.); however, these SSB estimates are usually asynchronous with respect to neighboring localities. For example, in some localities (e.g., Prince William Sound, Alaska; Cherry Point, Washington; West Coast Vancouver Island, British Columbia) SSB estimates decreased by greater than 85 % over the time series and up to 77 % in the most recent 15 years available (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). However, in other localities (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska; Quilcene Bay, Washington), SSB estimates have increased by 35 – 1000 % over the time series and up to 400 % in the most recent 15 years available. Given the inconsistencies in the temporal trends of available data within and between regions (including differences in biological characteristics such as maximum age and age at first maturity), we are unable to extrapolate trends in SSB across the entire global population. For consistency, all data reported in short tons (e.g., U.S. data) were converted and are expressed in metric tonnes. </p>  <p>In general, the conservation status of herring within the southernmost portion of its global range (e.g., within the Yellow Sea and off coastal Japan in the western Pacific and off the continental U.S. in the eastern Pacific, including California, Oregon and Washington) is of concern due to climate forcing. Sea surface temperatures are expected to continue to increase in these areas as a result of global climate change (Perry <em>et al. </em>2005, Hillebrand 2018, USGCRP 2018), potentially leading to a northward contraction of its range into cooler waters.</p>  <p><strong><u>NORTHWESTERN PACIFIC</u></strong></p>  <p>Within the northwestern Pacific, this species is divided into three subsections: the northwestern North Pacific, which includes five major stocks in Russian waters; the southwestern North Pacific, which includes the Sakhalin region of Russia and the Hokkaido region of Japan; and the Yellow Sea (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In the northwestern Pacific region, there appear to be three distinct forms of herring: (1) a migratory ‘marine’ herring, which is relatively long-lived and which undergoes considerable migrations; (2) a similar ‘coastal’ form which consists of a number of smaller groups and spends most of its life close to shore with little or no migrations; and (3) a unique ‘lagoon’ form (sometimes referred to as ‘lake’ herring) whose life history is connected with low-salinity lagoons or embayments (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In general, the five major Russian stocks, along with the Hokkaido-Sakhalin stock constitute the major ‘marine’ forms of the western Pacific, which comprise the largest total biomass and support large commercial fisheries in the northwest Pacific (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Coastal and ‘lagoon’ forms may be unique to the western Pacific; similar forms have not been described from the eastern Pacific (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Specific information regarding the three subsections in the northwestern Pacific is listed below.</p>  <p><strong><u>Northwestern North Pacific (Russia):</u></strong><em> </em>Five major stocks exist within this region: Korf-Karagin stock in the northwestern Bering Sea; Gizhiga-Kamchatka stock along the Kamchatka Peninsula; Okhotsk stock in the Sea of Okhotsk; Dekastri stock in the Strait of Tartary; and Peter the Great Bay stock in the Sea of Japan (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Additionally, Russian scientists recognize roughly 20 smaller groups of ‘coastal’ and ‘lagoon’ herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Commercial fisheries for Dekastri and Peter the Great Bay stocks were established first (~1920s); substantial commercial fisheries began to target other stocks in later years (Korf-Karagin in 1939, and Okhotsk and Gizhiga-Kamchatka in the mid – to late – 1940s: Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Catch records are characterized by substantial variation in annual catch overall, reflecting fluctuations in the availability of herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The three northernmost stocks (Okhotsk, Gizhiga-Kamchatka and Korf-Karagin) previously supported very large catches which increased rapidly in the late 1950s and exceeded ~500,000 tonnes in the 1960s (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This peak was followed by a rapid decline in all five ‘marine’ stocks where a decline in catch rates and assessed biomass led to a prohibition of commercial fishing (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). A period of very low abundance persisted until the late 1990s where there was evidence of a modest recovery of the Okhotsk and Korf-Karagin stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). As of the early 2000s, the southernmost Russian stocks (Dekastri and Peter the Great Bay) remained in a state of severe depression (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Information regarding the more recent status (i.e., 2001 – present) is not available for these five major stocks. </p>  <p><strong><u>Southwestern North Pacific (Hokkaido-Sakhalin):</u></strong><em> </em>One major stock is recognized within this subsection of the northwestern Pacific waters, which includes the waters off the Sakhalin region of Russia and the Hokkaido region of Japan. It is referred to as Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring (sometimes also referred to as Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring). Previously, this stock was the most abundant among all western Pacific herring stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). During the first half of the 1900s, Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring were very widely distributed and supported an industrial fishery in the northern part of the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk (along the shores of eastern Sakhalin to the Island of Iona, and along the Kuril Islands to the Island of Paramushir), and the Pacific Ocean (along the southern Kuril Islands: Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Catches have been recorded by national and provincial authorities in Japan and Russia since 1887, with a historical peak of 973,000 tonnes in 1897 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Since the peak in 1897, catches show fluctuations with an overall declining annual trend and fishing grounds moved north along the western coast of Hokkaido; spawning herring have disappeared from the Hokkaido coast altogether (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In the most recent years available (~ 1960s – 2000), the Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring has been at the lowest level of abundance for the entire history of its commercial exploitation; it has declined from an average of 67.2 billion fish in the late 1800s – 1950 to about 5.8 billion fish in the 1950s, and has further declined to an average of 1.6 billion fish between 1961 and 2000 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Small fisheries have continued since the collapse of this stock with annual catches less than 50,000 tonnes on average (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The cause of collapse is not certain; oceanographic conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature) have changed, which may limit recruitment in the region. Additionally, the major decline coincided with a period of increased effort, efficiency and industrialization of the fishery (e.g., introduction of acoustic sounders, spotter planes and trawl nets) where immature and young fish were caught in high numbers, which likely further limited recruitment. As of 2000, there were no indications of change in the extremely depressed status of the Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a); information regarding the more recent status (2001 – present) is not available for this stock.</p>  <p><strong><u>Yellow Sea:</u></strong> Herring in the Yellow Sea may be completely isolated from others within the northwestern Pacific (Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008). In the Yellow Sea region, this species undergoes rapid and extreme fluctuations in abundance. Changes in biomass may be caused by herring seasonally moving in an out of the Yellow Sea (D. Hay, pers. com. January 2019); long-term changes may be correlated with a 36-year cycle of dryness/wetness in eastern China (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). It is commercially important in the Yellow Sea and has a very long exploitation history in the surrounding countries. In the last century (1900 – 2000) the commercial fishery experienced three major peaks (1900, 1938 and 1972) followed by periods of little to no catch (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This stock experienced a historical maximum abundance in 1972 following a strong recruitment event in 1970; biomass was estimated to be 200,000 tonnes in 1972 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). However, since 1982, this species has substantially declined in the Yellow Sea due to a series of very weak year classes (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The catch decreased to below 1,000 tonnes in 1989 – 1990 and no fishing took place until at least 2000 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Currently, it is listed as a species of special concern in the Yellow Sea as abundance has decreased significantly and it requires protection and enhancement programs (National Fisheries Research and Development Institute 1988 as cited in Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>  <p>Overall, nearly all herring in the northwestern Pacific have undergone long-term periods of extreme fluctuations in the past; during periods of active fishing most stocks have declined to a state of depression or even collapse. However, based on the most recent estimates available (prior to 2001), most stocks have recovered to the point where abundance equaled or exceeded historical estimates. Pacific herring within the Hokkaido-Sakhalin and Yellow Sea regions are of concern as its abundance has remained severely depleted in the most recent years available. </p>  <p><strong><u>NORTHEASTERN PACIFIC </u></strong></p>  <p>In contrast to the northwestern Pacific, where this species is found in a few, large subpopulations, in the northeastern Pacific, it consists of a large number of (&gt;20) relatively small subpopulations (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001a), many of which have long-term time series data available that continue to the present. For the purposes of this assessment, the delineation of this species within the northeastern Pacific encompasses its geographic distribution throughout western U.S. and Canadian territories, from Alaska, south to California. Available species-specific information regarding the northeastern Pacific is described below.</p>  <p><strong><u>Alaska (U.S.)</u></strong><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Western Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>Arctic – Yukon – Kuskokwim (AYK) region: </u></em>Projected 2018 biomass for the Arctic – Yukon – Kuskokwim region (Norton Sound south to Security Cove) was estimated to be 54,782 tonnes (ADF&amp;G 2018a). The largest abundance of herring in the AYK region is in the Norton Sound district (Menard <em>et al. </em>2017); projected biomass for this district in 2018 is 30,775 tonnes, which makes up over half of the total projected biomass for the AYK region (57,782 tonnes: ADF&amp;G 2018a). Total allowable harvest is 10,683 tonnes. Commercial fishing may occur in this region in 2018 given that all preseason projected biomass thresholds are expected to be exceeded (ADF&amp;G 2018a). However, based on limited fishing effort from previous years and a lack of market interest in the region since 2006, only a small portion of the total allowable catch is anticipated to be taken in 2018 (ADF&amp;G 2018a). A commercial fishery is not anticipated in the Kuskokwim district due to a lack of market interest; a small commercial bait fishery is anticipated out of Norton Sound in 2018 (ADF&amp;G 2018a). Catch monitoring will be implemented if commercial fishing occurs (ADF&amp;G 2018a). </p>  <p><em><u>Togiak District (Bristol Bay)</u></em><u>: </u>The preseason biomass forecast for 2018 in the Togiak district was projected to be 124,062 tonnes, which is considered healthy and stable (ADF&amp;G 2018b). Herring in the Togiak district are commercially harvested for sac roe, spawn on kelp, as well as for food and bait; the herring fishery in this district is the largest in Alaska (ADF&amp;G 2018b). The commercial sac roe fishery was opened in this region in 2018; however, no commercial harvest of spawn on kelp took place in 2017 due to a lack of commercial interest (ADF&amp;G 2018b). </p>  <p>Overall, the recent abundance in the Bering Sea (early 2000s), based mainly on SSB estimated from the Togiak district, is much lower (~140,000 tonnes) than the highest estimate of nearly 500,000 tonnes in 1985 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The abundance of the many smaller stocks in the same region showed no clear trends in time (Hay <em>et al</em>. 2001a). </p>  <p><strong><em>Central Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p>Information from Central Alaska is available from the Prince William Sound district. A Bayesian assessment of this species within the Prince William Sound was conducted using biomass data up to 2013; findings indicate that abundance remains at low levels in recent years (Muradian <em>et al. </em>2017). Aerial survey acoustic estimates of SSB from 1973 – 2016 agree with the Bayesian assessment; SSB, although stable, has remained at very low levels since the mid- to late-1990s following a drastic decline in the late 1980s (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). All commercial fisheries for this species in the Prince William Sound have remained closed for 17 consecutive years because age structure and the available surplus in the spawning biomass currently does not support a fishery in this region (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). </p>  <p><strong><em>Southeast Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p>Long-term time series of SSB estimates are available for most stocks within Southeast Alaska, including Sitka Sound, Lynn Canal, Seymour Canal, Craig, Ernest Sound, Hobart Bay- Port Houghton, Hoonah Sound, Revilla Channel (including Kah Shakes- Cat Island and Annette Island Reserve), Seymour Canal, West Behm Canal and Tenakee Inlet (Hebert 2017). Stocks in southeastern Alaska have asynchronous SSB trends; some stocks have declined in the most recent 15 years available (e.g., Ernest Sound, Hobart Bay – Port Houghton, Hoonah Sound, Seymour Canal, Tenakee Inlet), while others have remained stable (e.g., Sitka Sound, Revilla Channel, West Behm Canal), or increased (e.g., Lynn Canal, Craig). Overall, combined SSB estimates show a fluctuating pattern in the most recent 15 years (2003 – 2017) with a declining trend since the most recent peak (2011); however, SSB appears to have stabilized at a low level in the most recent 4 – 5 years available (Hebert 2017). The total combined SSB estimates in 2017 for all of Southeast Alaska as calculated from spawn deposition estimates was 62,457 tonnes and is at a similar level to that of the late 1990s (Hebert 2017). Overall, the relatively stable pattern between 2016 and 2017 SSB estimates can be largely attributed to changes in the two largest stocks, which typically account for about 80 % of the total SSB in southeastern Alaska – Sitka Sound showed a decline of approximately 41 % between 2016 and 2017, while Craig showed an increase in 2017 roughly double that of 2016 (Hebert 2017). Despite overall stability in the most recent 4 – 5 years, there was a decline between 2016 and 2017 (~ 26 %). However, several areas (i.e., Lynn Canal, West Behm Canal, Revilla Channel, Tenakee Inlet, Ernest Sound, Hoonah Sound and Hobart Bay-Port Houghton) were not surveyed in 2017 and this may have led to some of the discrepancy between the two years (Hebert 2017). Combined spawn deposition estimates for 2017 suggest that SSB in southeast Alaska is at a moderate level relative to the period 1980 – 2016 (Hebert 2017). The combined SSB estimate of 62,457 tonnes is about 67 % of the mean SSB (1980 – 2016); however, this is considered to be an underestimate because several areas were not surveyed in 2017 (Hebert 2017). </p>  <p><strong><u>British Columbia (Canada)</u></strong></p>  <p>This species in British Columbian waters is divided into five major stock areas that are assessed regularly: Haida Gwaii (HG), Prince Rupert District (PRD), Central Coast (CC), Strait of Georgia (SOG), and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI); and two minor stock areas: Haida Gwaii Area 2W and WCVI Area 27 (DFO 2018). Each major stock area is made up of numerous smaller spawning groups (D. Hay, pers. comm. January 2019). Spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates are available for the five major stocks until 2017 and estimates have been projected to forecast the 2018 SSB (DFO 2018). In general, all five major stocks show a decline in weight-at-age from the mid-1980s to 2010, with a leveling off or slight increase in the most recent five years available (2012 – 2017: DFO 2018, Hay <em>et al. </em>2019). Stocks within the Haida Gwaii and West of Vancouver Island regions, however, continue to show a declining SSB trend in recent years (DFO 2018). Additionally, there is a large portion of the British Columbian coast (e.g., Johnstone Strait) where many small spawning groups exist but are not assessed regularly and no commercial fisheries occur (D. Hay, pers. comm. January 2019). In this region, herring predominantly reach maturity at age three (DFO 2018). </p>  <p>&#160;<strong><em>Haida Gwaii:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB have remained low in the most recent years available, including 2017; two models estimate a declining trend in SSB since 2013 (DFO 2018). Additionally, since 2000, the Haida Gwaii stock has been in a low productivity, low biomass state, which indicates a negative stock growth (DFO 2018). Median estimated SSB in 2017 was 3,963 tonnes and the projected median pre-fishery SSB estimate for 2018 is similar to the 2017 level (4,367 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Prince Rupert District:</em></strong></p>  <p>This stock has been characterized by two periods of consistent and stable spawning biomass: 1996 – 2003 and 2006 – 2007 (DFO 2018). Since 2005, estimated SSB productions have been positive, indicating stock growth (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 21,738 tonnes and the projected median pre-fishery SSB for 2018 is similar to 2017 (23,924 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Central Coast:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB show an increasing trend since 2012, including 2017 (DFO 2018). Since 2012, estimated SSB production for the Central Coast stock has been positive, indicating stock growth (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 30,474 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 is similar to 2017 (32,458 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Strait of Georgia:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB show an increasing trend since 2010 (DFO 2018). Since 2008, estimated SSB production for the Strait of Georgia stock has been positive, indicating stock growth. The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 114,626 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 are similar to 2017 (125,285 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI):</em></strong></p>  <p>In most years since 2005, including between 2016 and 2017, the WCVI stock has been in a prolonged low productivity, low biomass state, indicating negative stock growth (DFO 2018). Given a decline in estimated SSB, WCVI has been closed to fisheries since 2006, with the exception of the spawn on kelp (SOK) fishery permitted in 2011 (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 17,742 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 are similar to 2017 (20,003 tonnes: DFO 2018). </p>  <p><strong><u>Washington (U.S.)</u></strong></p>  <p>This species is separated into 21 small stocks within four major stock regions in inland Washington waters, including north Puget Sound, south-central Puget Sound, Hood Canal, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca (combined, these areas are now referred to as the “southern Salish Sea”). In this region, only the Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass stocks can be genetically differentiated; the other herring stocks have not shown genetic divergence, suggesting adequate gene flow (WDFW, 2018a). </p>  <p>Spawning stock data are available for most stocks through 2018 (WDFW 2018b). Stocks can fall into one of seven categories based on the previous 4 – year mean abundance compared to long-term previous 25 – year abundance (Stick <em>et al.</em> 2014): <strong>Increasing</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance more than 20% above the 25-year mean; <strong>Healthy</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance within 20% of the 25-year mean; <strong>Declining</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 21-50% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Depressed</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 51-80% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Critical</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 81-99% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Undetected</strong> - A stock that can no longer be found in a formerly consistently utilized spawning ground for four consecutive years; <strong>Unknown</strong>- Insufficient assessment data to identify stock status with confidence. Overall, 19% of stocks were listed as Increasing or Healthy in 2016, though the percentage of stocks listed as such has steadily declined over the years available (e.g., 38% in 2000: WDFW 2018b). Currently, three stocks are listed as Increasing (i.e., Quilcene Bay, Samish/Portage Bay and Semiahmoo Bay), one as Healthy (i.e., South Hood Canal), two as Declining&#160; (i.e., Holmes Harbor, Dungeness/Sequim Bay), two as Depressed (Squaxin Pass and Skagit Bay), and ten as Critical (Wallochet Bay, Quartermaster Harbor, Port Orchard-Port Madison, Port Susan, Port Gamble, Killisut Harbor, Discovery Bay, Interior San Juan Islands, Fildalgo Bay and Cherry Point). Three other stocks currently have Unknown status (Purdy, Elliot Bay, Northwest San Juan Islands) due to a lack of long-term data (WDFW 2018b). Excluding the genetically distinct stocks (i.e., Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass), all other Washington herring stocks combined reportedly have a Healthy standing overall (WDFW 2018b), although this is driven by the rapidly expanding Quilcene Bay stock, which currently makes up over 50% of the total estimated spawning biomass. If Quilcene Bay is excluded from the overall total, the remaining stocks are collectively considered to be Declining. Individual stocks listed as Critical (especially the genetically distinct Cherry Point stock which has declined more than 96% since the initial SSB estimate in 1973: WDFW 2018b) are of concern in Washington. </p>  <p>Overall, estimated SSB for all stocks within the Puget Sound has shown a fluctuating trend with an average just under 11,800 tonnes throughout the available time series (1973 – 2017: WDFW 2018b). Using the most recent 15-year window available (2003 – 2017), estimated SSB has declined from 12,287 tonnes in 2003 to 7,790 tonnes in 2017, which represents an approximate 37 % decline within three generations.</p>  <p>There is a limited commercial fishery for herring in Puget Sound which targets 2-3 year old fish for the sport bait market. Over the past decade this fishery has taken an average of 6% of the total estimated biomass for all stocks; no fishing is allowed north of Admiralty Inlet or south of the Tacoma Narrows to protect the Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass stocks.</p>  <p><strong><em>Puget Sound:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>Northern Puget Sound (including Cherry Point): </u></em>The Northern Puget Sound region includes the Fidalgo Bay, Samish/Portage Bay, Interior San Juan Islands, NW San Juan Islands, Semiahmoo Bay and Cherry Point stocks. The Cherry Point stock has shown genetic divergence from the remaining stocks (WDFW 2018a) and is of particular concern in this region. The Cherry Point stock status has been listed as Critical since 2000 and has shown a declining trend (greater than 96 %) in SSB estimates since the beginning of the available time series in 1973 (WDFW 2018b).</p>  <p><em><u>South/Central Puget Sound (including Squaxin Pass): </u></em>The South-Central Puget Sound region includes the Purdy, Wollochet Bay, Quartermaster Harbor, Elliot Bay, Port Orchard-Port Madison, South Hood Canal, Quilcene Bay, Port Gamble, Kilisut Harbor, Port Susan, Holmes Harbor, Skagit Bay and Squaxin Pass stocks. The Squaxin Pass stock has shown genetic divergence from the remaining stocks (WDFW 2018a) and is currently in a Depressed state (WDFW 2018b). Of particular concern are the stocks recently reported to be in a Critical condition (i.e., Quartermaster Harbor, Wollochet Bay, and Port Orchard-Port Madison).</p>  <p><strong><em>Strait of Juan de Fuca:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>The Strait of Juan de Fuca:</u></em> includes the Kilisut Harbor, Discovery Bay and Dungeness/Sequim Bay stocks. The Discovery Bay stock has been in a Depressed or Critical state since 1996 and remains Critical in 2016. The Dungeness/Sequim Bay stock was reported to be Increasing in 2000 but has been either Declining or Critical since that time. The Kilisut Harbor stock has also declined since 2000, with no spawn detected from 2009-2012 (a Disappearance event), but spawning has returned and the stock was listed as Critical in 2016. </p>  <p><strong><u>Oregon (U.S.)</u></strong></p>  <p>In Oregon, SSB is estimated from the number of spawning adults surveyed in the previous year (Baraff and Loughlin 2000). Biomass estimates exist from Yaquina Bay, Oregon from 1979 – 2011 with a mean of 487 +/- 501 tonnes over a 31 year time series (Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017). Despite an overall decline in SSB estimates throughout the available time series, within the most recent fifteen years available (1997 – 2011), SSB estimates have largely fluctuated but show a 2 – 3 fold increase overall. </p>  <p><strong><u>California (U.S.)</u></strong><strong> </strong></p>  <p>The four largest spawning areas in California are San Francisco Bay, Tomales Bay, Humboldt Bay and Crescent City Harbor (Hay <em>et</em> <em>al.</em> 2001a); however, little to no information is available from Tomales Bay, Humbolt Bay, and Crescent City Harbor. </p>  <p><strong><em>San Francisco Bay: </em></strong></p>  <p>Long-term time series of SSB estimates are available from San Francisco Bay (1979 – 2018) with an average of 44,000 tonnes (CDFW 2018). The SSB estimate in 2017 – 18 was 13,879 tonnes which represents the fourth year in a row of below average estimated SSB (CDFW 2018). </p>  <p>Commercial fishing of this species within San Francisco Bay continued during the 2017 – 18 season at a low level of effort relative to historical levels, which coincided with an estimated SSB well below the long-term average and the fourth year of low overall returns for this fishery (CDFW 2018). Low SSB estimates likely reflect sustained impacts from El Niño conditions (i.e., high sea-surface temperatures and depressed productivity in the California Current Ecosystem: CDFW 2018). </p>  <p>In the most recent 15 years available (2003-04 – 2017-18), SSB has fluctuated with an average of about 37,920 tonnes, but shows a declining trend overall. Estimated SSB in 2003-04 was 31,207 tonnes and has declined to about 13,879 tonnes in 2017-18, representing a decline of 55.5 % within 15 years (thought to represent three generation lengths for this species).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is widely distributed throughout the Arctic and northern Pacific Oceans. It occurs in the Arctic from the White Sea, east to the Ob Inlet, and the Beaufort Sea to the Amundsen Gulf off the Yukon, Northern and Nunavut Territories. In the Pacific, this species occurs in the northwest region from the Bering Sea, including the Anadyr Bay and the eastern coast of Kamchatka, south to&#160; northern Japan, and the western coast of Korea; and in the northeast region throughout the Gulf of Alaska including off the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, south along the coast of Washington, Oregon and California to northern Baja, California (Tester 1937, Whitehead 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Coad and Reist 2004, Kim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017). This species has been included in a checklist of fishes from Shandong, China (Cheng and Zhou 1997); however, this requires verification. This species occupies a depth range of 0 - 475 m (Coad and Reist 2004).<strong></strong></p>","<p></p><p>This species is exploited with varying intensity throughout a majority of its geographic distribution. Level of harvest ranges from heavy exploitation in industrial and commercial fisheries to areas of no exploitation such as various small subpopulations within the northeastern Pacific, including those fisheries which have closed due to a low SSB (i.e., Prince William Sound, Alaska: Russell <em>et al. </em>2017) or lack of market interest (i.e., Norton Sound, Alaska: Menard <em>et al. </em>2017). This species appears to be less important in Arctic regions, but in general, it is a highly important commercial species in both western and eastern Pacific regions (Whitehead 1985, Coad and Reist 2004, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat 2009, Schweigert&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;McKechnie and Smith 2013, McKechnie<em> et al</em>. 2014). It is regarded as the second most important targeted species in the northwest Pacific (Zeller <em>et al. </em>2018); it is one of several important commercial species targeted in Russian Far East territory. This species has been taken in industrial trawl fisheries since the early 1900s but also contributes small quantities to bycatch in trawl, seine and longline industrial fisheries that target other important species such as Alaska pollock, cod and various flatfishes (&lt;3 %: Sobolevskaya and Divovich 2015). It is also taken in commercial purse seine and gill net sac roe, spawn on kelp and other food and bait fisheries (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). It likely also contributes to bycatch throughout its range. </p><br/><p></p>",Marine,"<p>Given this species ecological and commercial importance, species-specific stock management regulations are in place in parts of its range (e.g., British Columbia, Alaska) such as yearly fishery closures, stock-specific management plans including yearly stock assessments, catch quotas, harvest rates, and biomass reference points (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2010, Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2017, Menard <em>et al.</em> 2017). For example, in British Columbia, this species is fished with a 20% harvest rate and commercial fishery threshold (Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2010). During periods of low abundance, closures are implemented in some regions. For example, no commercial removal is currently allowed from the Haida Gwaii, central coast and western coast of Vancouver Island stocks (Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2017). Also, all commercial fisheries for this species in the Prince William Sound have remained closed for 17 consecutive years because age structure and the available surplus in the spawning biomass currently does not support a fishery in this region (Russell <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species geographic distribution also overlaps with many existing marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). More information in needed to determine how this species is impacted by food availability and climatic variation especially regarding larval and juvenile herring. <strong></strong></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This species occurs at depths from the surface down to 2,647 m, but mainly at 300–500 m in Baffin Bay. This species potentially has the world's longest generation span of 274 years, however, we conservatively use a generation length of 150 years, and consider a generation length of 50–75 years.&#160;The maximum intrinsic rate of population increase (<em>r</em><sub>max</sub>)&#160;of Greenland Shark is 0.032 year<sup>−1</sup>&#160;which is nearly half the lowest&#160;<em>r<sub>max</sub></em>&#160;previously calculated for any shark or ray.&#160;There have been target fisheries for this species for its for liver oil since the 13th century with an increase in fisheries since the 17th Century (one generation length). Target fishing pressure increased up to the 1900s, ending in the 1940–1960s with the development of synthetic oils. Since then, it has been taken as discarded bycatch of demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries with approximately 3,500 individuals caught each year in the Northwest Atlantic, Arctic Ocean and Barents Sea. A population reconstruction, based on catch records, reveals that the Greenland Shark has been declining since the early 1600s with steepest declines beginning in the early 1800s through to the 1940s whereupon target fisheries were ended. Since then there is ongoing mortality from bycatch, but the overall fishing mortality is significantly reduced but is close to a level that may cause a decline, depending on bycatch survival rates and population generation length and resilience. The Greenland Shark was estimated to have declined by 57% in the 420 years since the 1600s, but is likely to have increased by 3% in the past century (1920–2020). The global estimated population reduction is 59% over the equivalent of three generation lengths (450 years),&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">but this value could range from&#160;11.7–72.9 depending on whether the generation length is shorter (50<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">75 years) or longer (274 years). The historic and current catch levels are uncertain, in particular the population reconstruction is likely to be highly sensitive to the catch of adults versus juveniles and post-release survival rate. Most catches seem to comprise juveniles, which might be more sustainable, but the abundance of adults seems very low and uncertain. Further, climate-change induced reduction in Arctic sea ice is providing greater access for fishing fleets and there is a projected loss of Arctic sea ice by 50% over the next 100 years. Taken together, the long history of fishing, ongoing exploitation (albeit at significantly lower levels than historically), and an extremely conservative life history, and climate change impacts of declining Arctic sea ice, it is suspected that the Greenland Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generations (450 years).&#160;Therefore, the Greenland Shark is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.</span></p>","The Greenland Shark is demersal and mesopelagic on continental and insular shelves and upper slopes from the surface down to at least 2,647 m, but mainly at 300–500 m in Baffin Bay (Ebert <em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Campana <em>et al. </em>2015, N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). It tends to move inshore coastal areas in summer and offshore in winter (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). It reaches a maximum size of 640 cm total length (TL), possibly to 730 cm TL; males mature at 260 cm TL and females mature at 400 cm TL (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012).&#160;Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparous with at least 2 and a maximum of 10 pups per litter, the later based on a single individual (Koefoed 1957, Castro 2011) and size–at–birth of 40–100 cm TL (Yano&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007, MacNeil <em>et al. </em>2012, Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Reproductive periodicity is assumed to be biennial based on other sleeper sharks (Somniosidae:&#160;Longnose Velvet Dogfish&#160;<em>Centroselachus crepidater</em><em>&#160;</em>and<em> </em>Plunket’s Shark <a style=""font-style: italic;"">Scymnodo</a><em>n plunketi</em>)&#160;(Simpfendorfer and Kyne 2009).&#160;Female age-at-maturity is&#160;estimated as&#160;156 years and maximum age is&#160;estimated as&#160;392 years (Nielsen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016); hence generation length could be as much as 274 years. However, the radiocarbon dating of eye lens structures relies on understanding <sup>14</sup>C dynamics prior to nuclear weapons testing and the rate of mixing of surface waters into the deep ocean and these uncertainties can result in a wide range of birth dates (Natanson <em>et al. </em>2018, M.A. MacNeil pers. comm. 27/07/2020). These sharks live in deep-water which is depleted in radiocarbon and hence it is difficult to determine what pre-and post-nuclear weapon-testing radiocarbon levels should be to serve as a baseline for aging (S.E. Campana pers. comm. 24/08/2020).&#160;It is likely that the generation length is more similar to other deep-water sharks at 50–75 years (S.E. Campana pers. comm. 24/08/2020). Here, we assume an intermediate generation length of 150 years.","<p>Historically, this species has been targeted for its liver oil since the 13th century in Norway, and from the 14th century in Iceland, with target catches peaking in the early 1900s and ending in the 1940s–1960s. There has been increase in fisheries for liver oil since the 17th century and target catches of Greenland Shark have been significant over the past three centuries (at least two generation lengths). Target fishing pressure increased up to the 1900s, peaking and largely ending in the 1940s with the development of synthetic oils. The fishery in Greenland commenced in the early 19th century and by 1857 the estimated catch was 2,000–3,000 individuals per year. Thereafter, the fishery expanded until the beginning of the 1890s and catches increased to 11,500–15,000 growing to 32,000 individuals per year by 1910 (Jensen 1914). Peak catch was of an estimated 58,000 individuals annually based on reported production of 2.8 million kg of liver oil in Norway in 1948 (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Commercial fishing of Greenland Shark for liver oil ceased in the 1960s along with the cessation of export of liver oil and skin from Greenland&#160;(Hedeholm&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). During the 1970s, the species was perceived as a problem for other fisheries in western Norway and the government subsidized a fishery in order to reduce the stock of the species (Castro<em>&#160;et al. </em>1999). Target artisanal fisheries still occur in Greenland and Iceland, with the catch averaging 25 t annually in Iceland since 2005 (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;</p><p>More recently, since the 1960s, this species was threatened by bycatch in industrial fisheries. Greenland Shark has been taken as bycatch of trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries in the Arctic Ocean and off Canada and the USA since the 1960s (Benjamins <em>et al. </em>2010) and Barents Sea (Rusyaev&#160;and Orlov 2013). Approximately 3,500 individuals are taken as bycatch each year in the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean and Barents Sea (see Supplementary Information 1). While little is known of discard mortality is it likely to be much lower from longlines through ice than from deep-water trawls (D.W. Kulka pers. obs. 2020). However, higher mortaltiy may occur when longline gear wraps the tail too tightly cutting off circulation causing the tail to die and when longline hooks pull through, breaking the jaw, when the shark surfaces (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020).&#160;Based on recent observations by fishery observers, more than 1,000 individuals are caught annually from Arctic waters (NAFO Subarea O) south to USA waters (NAFO Subarea 6) (Bryk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018,&#160;Hedeholm&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018,&#160;Hendrickson 2018, Hendrickson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Simpson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018,&#160;Wheeland and Devine 2018). Bycatch of Greenland Shark was likely higher historically in waters south of the Arctic given much higher levels of effort. Annual catch of Greenland Shark from the Barents Sea was estimated to be 1,200 individuals per year, based on catch weight of 140–150 t (Rusyaev and Orlov 2013). In the Canadian Arctic, Greenland Shark was mainly a discarded bycatch in demersal shrimp trawls before the introduction of the Nordmore grate. It is now only a bycatch in the Greenland halibut demersal trawl fisheries&#160;with some catch in gillnets, longlines, and setlines in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, on the Labrador shelf since the 1990s (based on observer data, M. Treble, unpub. data 2019, D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2019). Catches rose to peak at 800 t in 1990, before declining to 100–200 t between 2002–2008 with a more recent decline to 100 t due to shifting fishing patterns towards the target species (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Greenland sharks captured by demersal longlines can become entangled with the mainline tightly wrapped around the caudal peduncle complicating release efforts. There are cases of persecution in Iceland and Canada where the tails have been cut off before the animal is returned to the water (Davis <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Norwegian vessels take Greenland Shark as bycatch in the halibut longline fishery of the Northeast Atlantic and livers occasionally harvested from discarded carcasses (C.F. Cotton pers. obs. 2004).&#160;The distribution and carrying capacity of Greenland Shark is likely to be affected by anthropogenic climate change, which is affecting the quantity, dynamics, and distribution of Arctic sea ice (Edwards&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). With few exceptions, Greenland shark is primarily found in the seas around the Arctic polar icecap and in continental and insular fjord ecosystems (Walter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). While poorly understood, the rate of projected loss of sea ice will have and will continue to negatively influence the abundance, distribution and availability of prey (Edwards&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The climate-change induced reduction in Arctic sea ice is providing greater access for fishing fleets (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). Climate change has warmed mean summer sea surface temperatures by approximately 0.7<sup>o</sup>C per decade from 1982—2017, very likely resulting in a recent reduction in extent of sea ice extent of 3.5–4.1% per decade from 1979 to 2012 (Stocker <em>et al. </em>2013). Overall, there has been a ~50% reduction in summer sea ice extent since 1850 (Walsh <em>et al. </em>2017). Sea ice is projected to decline by at least a further 50% over the next 100 years (IPCC 2019). Consequently, existing demersal longline, trawl and gillnet fisheries for Northern Shrimp (<em>Pandalus borealis</em>) and Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius h</em><em>ippoglosoides</em>) are expanding northwards into previously unfished habitats and fishing seasons are lengthening allowing sustained effort for longer periods (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). Further, there is greater potential for new fisheries to develop as more productive and abundant southerly species invade the warming Arctic waters (Tai <em>et al.</em> 2019). These newly developing fisheries are reportedly catching greater numbers of sharks and skates, particularly Greenland Shark (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2013). The common bycatch of Greenland Shark in some western Greenland fisheries has led to the proposal to once again use them as a biofuel (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>","<p>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of Greenland Shark. Population trend data are available from three sources (1) local abundance estimates, (2) an estimate of maximum population growth rate, which combined with catch data was used to (3) reconstruct population trajectory from 1600 to 2020.&#160;</p><p>First, in unfished areas local densities can be high in summer ranging from 0.4–15.5 individuals km<sup>-2</sup> in the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. These density estimates are comparable to estimates of Grey Reef Shark (<em>Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos</em>) in the relatively pristine Palmyra atoll. These comprise mainly juvenile size classes with an average length of 2.48 m and a notable absence of adults (Devine <em>et al.</em> 2018). However, in areas where there have been large historic fisheries Greenland Shark are now less common. However, this could be an artefact of using fishing gear that is not strong enough to land the larger individuals (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). Annual demersal trawl surveys throughout west, south, and east Greenland suggest Greenland Shark are patchily distributed and uncommon. For example, only 106 individuals were captured from 9,744 hauls between 1988–2011 by the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources (GNIR) survey (Nielsen <em>et al. </em>2014) and catch rates in Canadian Research surveys are low (Simpson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). However, large catches can be made in certain places and at times of year, e.g. catches of 5–15 sharks on 50 hooks in a 12-hour period (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020). Trawl swept area estimates are highly uncertain yet suggest high biomass and abundance of 70,000 t and 100,000 individuals in West Greenland Shelf, from south Greenland to Upernavik (Hedeholm <em>et al. </em>2018). However, this estimate depends highly on catchability and little is known of catchability in trawls, but it is likely lower than the catchability of this species in longlines (D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2020).</p><p>Second, while patchily abundant throughout Arctic and boreal regions of the Atlantic,&#160;this species is thought to have the world's longest generation length (GL) of 274 years, however, this age has not been validated and is more likely that the generation length is much lower (S.E. Campana pers. comm. 24/08/2020) and here we assume a more conservative value of 150 years. The median maximum intrinsic rate of population increase, <em>r<sub>max</sub></em>, of Greenland Shark is 0.032 year<sup>−1</sup> (95th percentile = 0.025–0.044; Supplementary Information). This is nearly half the lowest <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> previously calculated for any shark or ray. For comparison, the lowest shark <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> is 0.054 for the Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>) and the lowest ray <em>r<sub>max </sub></em>is 0.067 for the Manta Ray (<em>Mobula birostris</em>) (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016). The median maximum intrinsic rate of population increase, <em>r<sub>max</sub></em>, is the limit of fishing mortality that can be withstood without the population declining to extinction, <em>F<sub>extinct</sub></em><sub> </sub>hence 100*(exp(<em>r<sub>max</sub></em>)-1) yields the percentage mortality each year that would drive this species to extinction which is 3.3% (95th percentile = 2.5–4.5%). Assuming the breeding population size (<em>N<sub>b</sub></em>) was 130,945 (calculated estimated assuming a GL of 150) (Walter&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017) then killing only around 4,300 adults&#160;(95th percentile = 3,321–5,832) would be sufficient to cause a decline. The current estimated bycatch of around 3,500 individuals may be sufficient to cause a decline (see Supplementary Information). We caution that this bycatch level assumes 100% post-release mortality and this species may have moderate discard survival. Hence, this species is least likely to be able to sustain even light levels of fishing mortality.&#160;</p><p>Third, the population trajectory was reconstructed over the 420 years 1600–2020 (approximately 2.5 generation lengths, assuming a 150 GL) based on a Schaeffer-Logistic population model and reconstructed catches, assuming a carrying capacity of 3.2 million individuals and a population growth rate <em>r<sub>max</sub></em> = 0.032 year<sup>−1</sup>&#160;(95th percentile = 0.025–0.044; Supplementary Information). These carrying capacity estimates are arbitrary but smaller numbers resulted in the catch reconstruction tending toward extinction. It is likely that the Greenland Shark has been declining since the early 1600s with steepest declines beginning in the early 1800s through to the 1940s whereupon most target fisheries were ended. Since then the population is most likely to have increased despite continued low levels of bycatch mortality that most recently are in the region of 3,500 individuals captured annually (Supplementary Information). These broad patterns are highly sensitive to generation length,&#160;<em>r<sub>max</sub>,&#160;</em>and carrying capacity assumptions. Slightly lower generation length,&#160;<em>r<sub>max</sub>, </em>and&#160;carrying capacity assumptions led to extinction and slightly higher values led to complete recovery. Any values capturing the likely decline due to target fishing also suggest there has been recovery since the cessation of target fisheries. Specifically, the population reconstruction reveals that the Greenland Shark has declined by 57% in the 420 years since the 1600 (range 9–100%&#160;depending on&#160;<em>r<sub>max</sub>&#160;</em>and&#160;carrying capacity assumptions<span lang=""EN-US"">). I<span lang=""EN-US"">n the past century 1920<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">2020 Greenland Shark&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">has increased slightly 3% (range: 57% increase to 100% decline)<span lang=""EN-US"">. The global estimated population reduction is 59.3% (range 9.8<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">100%) over the equivalent of three generation lengths (450 years) (Supplementary Information, Figure 6b middle panel). Assuming a much more modest generation length of 50<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">75 years, then the estimated population reduction is 11.7% (range 1%<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">99.9%) over three generation lengths (Supplementary Information,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Figure 6a middle panel). Assuming a longer generation length of 274 years, then the estimated population reduction is 72.9% (range 22.9%<span lang=""EN-US"">–<span lang=""EN-US"">100%) over three generation lengths (Supplementary Information,&#160;Figure 6c middle panel).&#160;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Fourth, the population reduction analysis does not consider the likely reduction in carrying capacity of Greenland Shark from anthropogenic climate change, which is affecting the quantity, dynamics, and distribution of Arctic sea ice (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). With few exceptions, Greenland shark is primarily found in the seas around the Arctic polar icecap and in continental and insular fjord ecosystems (Walter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). While poorly understood, the rate of projected loss of sea ice will have and will continue to negatively influence the abundance, distribution and availability of prey (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). Overall, the Greenland Shark has undergone an inferred population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations lengths (450 years), but this value could range from&#160;11.7–72.9% depending on whether the generation length is shorter (50<span lang=""EN-US"">–</span><span lang=""EN-US"">75 years) or longer (274 years).</p><p><br/></p>",Decreasing,"The Greenland Shark is found in the&#160;North Atlantic from the USA and Canada to Greenland in the west and from Portugal to the Barents Sea and Eastern Siberian Sea (Moreno and Pol 1992, MacNeil <em>et al. </em>2012, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, A.M. Orlov pers. comm. 25/08/2020). Genetic analyses caution that the geographic range of this species may be much narrower, ranging from Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, and Norway, with occasional records from Cuba, France and Spain (Canary Is.) (Yano <em>et al.</em> 2007, MacNeil <em>et al. </em>2012, Walter&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2017, Simpson <em>et al.</em> 2018). Records from the western Atlantic, including records from the northern Gulf of Mexico and Canadian side off the Davis Strait exhibit evidence of introgressive hybridisation with Pacific Sleeper Shark (<em>Somniosus pacificus</em>) which has been recorded as far north as the Azores Islands (Portugal) (Walter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).","<p>This species was taken in target fisheries for liver oil (for lamps, engine oil and vitamin A), skin (for leather), and meat for dogfood since the 13th century in Canada, Norway, Iceland, and Greenland (Jensen 1914, MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Hedeholm&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It is now taken as discarded bycatch in Canadian Arctic demersal trawls, longlines, and gillnets (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). There is some subsistence utilization in Canada, Greenland, and Iceland (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, ICES-WGEF 2018). There is a small private fishery&#160;of the Greenland Shark&#160;for dogfood in northwest Greenland and probably East Greenland (Hedeholm <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>",Marine,"<p>The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) prohibited directed fishing for Greenland Sharks and sought to minimise incidental catch and mortality and, where alive, release Greenland Shark in a manner that causes least possible harm (NAFO 2018).&#160;The U.S. has regulated shark fisheries since 1993 and manages 39 species. In 1999 the USA effected a Fishery Management Plan (FMP), that includes catch limits and quotas for sharks, swordfish and tunas. Greenland Shark is not included in the USA FMP&#160;because they are not targeted and rarely encountered by U.S. fishing vessels.&#160;</p><p></p><p>In Canada, there is also a Shark Management Plan but Greenland Shark is not included because the species is not targeted in Canadian waters. There is a short-term objective to, ""Reduce harm to Greenland Shark by promoting awareness of safe release techniques""&#160;for the NAFO Subarea 0 Greenland halibut fishery and this species is subject to a number of conditions as part of the Marine Stewaardship Council certification f the Canadian&#160;Canada 0AB 2+3KLMNO Greenland Halibut fishery (Knapman <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">This species was caught in multiple locations along the mid-Atlantic ridge and Hatton Bank during an exploratory research survey of the ridge (<a>Dyb and Bergstad, 2004) and&#160;</a>North-east Atlantic Fisheries Commission closed large areas of the mid-Atlantic ridge to bottom fishing (NEAFC 2009).&#160;</p><p>There is a zero total allowable catch (TAC) for deep-sea sharks in&#160;European Union (EU)&#160;vessels fishing in EU and international waters of ICES Subareas 5–10 (CEC 2015).&#160;Greenland Shark is included in a list of deep-sea sharks on European Commission quota regulations. The following measures are recommended: prohibition on the retention and landing of Greenland Sharks, live release of captured animals, promotion of safe handling practices, the introduction of gear restrictions and area closures aimed at keeping fishing mortality as close to zero as possible. Improved observer coverage and mandatory reporting of catch data for all sharks and rays, including species identity, numbers, size, sex, and discard status are recommended. Catch data quality could be improved with the development and use of a Greenland shark photographic identification sheet for fishery observers (Hendrickson <em style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"">et al.</em> 2018).</p><p>The development and implementation of bycatch policy and mitigation measures is recommended (Hendrickson <em>et al.</em> 2018). The Nordmore grate, a bycatch excluder meant to allow escapement of bycatch was made mandatory for the Canadian shrimp fisheries of the Labrador Shelf and Davis Strait in the 1990s. This modification of the gear allowed the sharks to escape immediately from the net with minimal harm thus greatly reduced the shark bycatch, from hundreds of tonnes per year (thousands of fish) to less than 1 tonne per year. Before its implementation, the shrimp fishery was responsible for the largest proportion of the incidental catch of Greenland sharks (D.W. Kulka, unpub. data 2019).</p><p>Further, the use of weak breaking-strength longline gangions resulted in release of Greenland Sharks bycatch without losing the target species Greenland Halibut because of the large size disparity between the species (Simpson <em>et al.</em> 2018, S.W.

For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. Assuming a 31-year generation time, the 3-generation window for criterion A is the period 1926-2018. The global mature population size in 1926 was probably around 140,000. The current global mature population size is uncertain but likely to be in the range 5,000-15,000. This corresponds to a reduction of 89%-97%, which overlaps the boundary of Critically Endangered and Endangered with respect to past reduction under the A1 criterion (90% reduction over three generations). Given the evidence of increase in those regions where the species was most depleted (Antarctic and North Atlantic), Endangered (A1abd) seems the most appropriate category at this time, taking into account both the current population level and the likely global trend. The dominant contribution to the reduction in the global population was the massive reduction of the formerly very large Antarctic population.

Bannister pers. comm. 2007), <em>Nyctiphanes simplex</em> off the Galápagos (Palacios 1999), <em>Euphausia pacifica</em> and <em>Thysanoessa</em> spp. in the North Pacific (Fiedler <em>et al.</em> 1998), and <em>Meganyctiphanes norvegica </em>and <em>Thysanoessa </em>spp. in the North Atlantic (Visser <em>et al.</em> 2011, McQuinn <em>et al.</em> 2016). They feed both at the surface and at depths of up to 300 m (Sears and Calambokidis 2002, Calambokidis <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>The migration patterns of Blue Whales are not well understood, but appear to be diverse. Although there is evidence of migratory behaviour in most of the populations studied, both wintering and summering areas appear to be occupied at some level throughout the year. Some individuals may reside year-round in habitats of year-round high productivity, while others undertake long migrations from tropical waters to high-latitude feeding grounds, but possibly stopping to feed in areas of high productivity on route, while yet others may undertake more limited migrations (Branch <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Gill <em>et al.</em> 2011, de Vos <em>et al.</em> 2014, Silva <em>et al.</em> 2013, Torres 2013, Lesage <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>The main threat to Blue Whales in the past was direct exploitation, which only became possible on a regular basis in the modern era using deck-mounted harpoon cannons. Modern Blue Whale hunting started in the North Atlantic in 1868 and spread to other regions after the northeastern Atlantic population had been severely reduced, and whaling was temporarily banned in Norway from 1905 and in Iceland from 1915 (Tønnessen and Johnsen 1982). The Antarctic and North Atlantic populations were each probably depleted to the low hundreds by the time whaling ceased in the 1960-1970s, but have increased since. Blue Whales have been legally protected worldwide since 1966, although they continued to be caught illegally by former USSR fleets until 1972. The last recorded deliberate catches were off Spain in 1978 (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>Blue Whales in a calving ground off southern Sri Lanka appears to be especially subject to ship strikes, as indicated by both direct observations of strikes and strandings that exhibit blunt trauma (Ilangakoon 2012, de Vos <em>et al</em>. 2016) and observations of living animals that appear to have injuries that prevent normal swimming (IWC 2018b). The large volume of ship traffic around the southern coast of Sri Lanka makes it one of the busiest ocean-going shipping lanes in the world, but Priyadasharnha <em>et al.</em> (2016)&#160;showed that the expected frequency of ship strikes on Blue Whales would be greatly reduced by moving the lanes slightly further offshore.<br/><br/>Nine deaths of Blue Whales plus some serious injuries were attributed to ship strikes on the west coast of North America during 2007-13 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). Of 21 carcasses of Blue Whales found off California during 1988-2007, eight were found to have been killed by ship strike (Berman-Kowalewski <em>et al.</em> 2010).&#160;This suggests that ship strikes represent a substantial addition to natural mortality (Rockwood <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;Monnahan <em>et al</em>. (2015), on the other hand, argued that ship strikes have only a small effect on this population.&#160;As of 2018 this issue had not been resolved.<br/><br/>Of the Blue Whales in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence photo-identification catalogue, 16% appear to have scars or wounds resulting from ship strikes (Sears and Calambokidis 2002).<br/><br/>McKenna <em>et al.</em> (2015) concluded from tracking data that Blue Whales do not demonstrate effective avoidance behaviour when ships are near.&#160;However, Priyardashana <em>et al.</em> (2016) showed, based on densities of whales and shipping, that the expected frequency of ship strikes off southern Sri Lanka would be an order of magnitude higher than current estimates if the Blue Whales took no evasive action.<br/><br/>Incidental catches of Blue Whales in fisheries appear to be rare. The only reported cases this century were one in the northeastern Pacific in 2015 and one in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in 2002. Blue whales in cold waters often have marks or scars caused by contact with ice, which can make it harder to identify scars caused by contact with fishing gear.<br/><br/>The main food of Antarctic Blue Whales, <em>Euphausia superba</em> and <em>E. crystallorophias</em><em>,</em> are predicted to decline during the 21<sup>st</sup> century due both to reduced ocean productivity associated with warming (Piñones and Fedorov 2016) and to increasing ocean acidity that limits their shell-building (Kawaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160; Comparable changes are likely in other oceans.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic</em></strong><br/>Nearly 11,000 Blue Whales were specifically recorded as taken in the North Atlantic since the start of modern whaling in northern Norway in the 1860s, but an additional 13,000 unspecified large whales were recorded as caught in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Allison 2017), of which perhaps 30% could have been Blue Whales based on specified catches in the same areas in the same and following years. In addition, whaling in the earlier years (pre-1916) is thought to have involved substantial struck-and-lost rates (IWC 2010, 2017b) such that the total number of Blue Whales killed in the North Atlantic was probably in the range 15-20,000.<br/><br/>Catches started off the coast of Finnmark, northern Norway, where it is likely that over 3,000 Blue Whales were taken before whaling was banned from mainland Norway in 1905. Operations spread to Svalbard, where over 1,000 Blue Whales were taken, and to Iceland where probably over 5,000 were taken before whaling was banned for about 20 years starting in 1916 due to noticeably declining abundance. Over 2,000 Blue Whales were taken off Newfoundland, about 500 in the Gulf of St Lawrence and nearly 1,000 around the Faeroes, Scotland, and Ireland. Very few Blue Whales were caught off Spain and Portugal. After the main period of whaling, low-level catches throughout the range probably impeded recovery until catches all but ceased around 1960. The last recorded directed catches  were six Blue  Whales taken off Spain in 1978,  three by pirate whaling vessels, and three  by catchers boats working for land stations (Allison  2017).<br/><br/>Post-whaling abundance estimates for the central and eastern North Atlantic (Iceland, Denmark Strait, southeastern Greenland, Jan Mayen, Faeroes and the British Isles and the Norwegian and Barents Seas) rose from 298 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.25) in 1987 to 1,012 (CV 0.23) in 2001 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2009). The increasing trend is consistent with a previous trend detected in sighting rates from Icelandic whaling vessels during 1969-88 (Sigurjónsson and Gunnlaugsson 1990). The Blue Whales in these surveys were most abundant west of Iceland, but with a shift to the northeast of Iceland in recent years (Víkingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and around Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Blue Whales are now very rare along the coast of Norway despite large catches there in the past. Further surveys of this area were conducted in 2007 and 2014-16 but the data have not yet been analysed to produce updated estimates of Blue Whale abundance (NAMMCO 2017).<br/><br/>Too few Blue Whales were observed in a survey of the Canadian Atlantic in 2007 to estimate abundance (Lawson and Gosselin 2009) and none were seen in US waters in 2011 surveys (Palka 2012).<br/><br/>Only one Blue Whale was seen (west of Cap Finisterre) during the summer 2016 SCANS III surveys which covered UK waters, the North Sea, English Channel, Bay of Biscay, and the Atlantic waters of France and Spain (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). By comparison, over 1,000 Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) were seen. These results suggest a Blue Whale summer abundance in the area only in the tens. A separate survey of waters south-west of Ireland in 2013 (Baines <em>et al.</em> 2017) recorded16 Blue Whales (including resightings), and the data suggest that about 10-20 individuals were present. A Blue Whale seen in southeastern Biscaya in 2016 was the first live sighting off Spain since the last catches in the 1970s (Covelo <em>et al.</em> 2017). <br/><br/>About 500 individual Blue Whales were photo-identified in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during 1979-2015 (Sears <em>et al.</em> 2015). In view of the long time period, many of the animals in the catalogue are likely no longer alive. The Northeast Atlantic photo-id catalogue contained over 500 individuals by 2015, including 125 collected off Iceland during 1995-2005 and 335 in the Azores during 2002-15. The catalogues have not yet yielded estimates of abundance.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em></strong><br/>About 9,000 Blue Whales were recorded as caught in the North Pacific, in addition to over 7,000 unspecified whales, some of which would have been Blue Whales (Allison 2017). The Blue Whale was protected by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1966, but a further 760 Blue Whales were taken illegally by USSR fleets until 1972 (Doroshenko 2000, Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2017)<br/><br/>The best estimate of abundance for the eastern North Pacific population, from&#160;photographic capture-recapture with an allowance for heterogeneity, is 1,647 (CV 0.07) (Calambokidis and Barlow 2013). Using the estimated catch history, including the assignment of a portion of the past catches in the Gulf of Alaska to the eastern North Pacific population, Monnahan <em>et al. </em>(2015) concluded that the eastern North Pacific population had recovered to near its pre-whaling abundance, estimated to be 1,750-2,500 whales. The population seems to have been roughly stable since the early 1990s (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The international POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) surveys covered the North Pacific east of 170°E and north of 40°N up to the Aleutian chain and the Alaska coast during 2010-12 (IWC 2018a). A total of 16 Blue Whales were seen. No abundance estimate has been calculated but the survey results suggest an abundance in the range 500-1,500, but which possibly includes some of the animals that are included in the above mark-recapture estimate. Only one Blue Whale was seen during the 2013-16 POWER surveys which covered the area between 20°N and 40°N. No Blue Whales were sighted in surveys of coastal British Columbia waters during 2004-08 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the northwestern Pacific, Hakamada and Matsuoka (2016) estimated the late summer abundance in 2008 west of 170°E and north of 35°N at about 1,000 whales (CV ~0.5). The survey did not include the waters within the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone along the Kuril chain and Kamchatka, where Blue Whales also occur in summer (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Blue Whales remain rare or absent in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Miyashita 2006, Friday et al. 2013), and very few historical catches are recorded from these areas.<br/><br/>Although over 2,000 Blue Whales were taken by coastal whaling in Japan until the 1960s, no Blue Whales were seen around Japan and in the North Pacific west of 155°E in extensive scouting vessel surveys during 1964-90 (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160; Blue Whales were seen from 145°E eastward in surveys conducted during 1994-2015, but not near the coast of Japan (Matsuoka <em>et al.</em> 2016). <em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern South Pacific and eastern equatorial Pacific</strong></em><br/>A total of 5,276 Blue Whales were reported as caught in the eastern South Pacific including equatorial waters in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Allison 2017). Allowing for some Blue Whales among the unspecified catches and for some level of struck and lost animals, and a lack of catch records for some whaling operations, the likely total kill is in the range 6,000-7,000. However, about 1,000 animals which were taken in equatorial waters during the austral summer/northern winter may have consisted partly of animals from the North Pacific populations. Furthermore, in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Antarctic Blue Whales were much more abundant than today, hence a significant portion of early catches off Peru and Chile, especially in the austral winter, may have been of Antarctic Blue Whales.<br/><br/>For the first 60 years of modern whaling, catches of Blue Whales off Chile and Peru averaged only 60 per year but catches increased from 1964 for meat exports, and 964 whales were taken during 1964-67, between 19°-39°S. Following a recommendation by the Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur (the international body responsible for regulating whaling in the southeastern Pacific at the time) (CPSS 1966) catching of Blue Whales were suspended in Peru after the 1966 season and in Chile after the 1966/67 season. Clarke <em>et al</em>. (1978) cited the high catches off Peru and Chile at a time when the Antarctic Blue Whale stock was reduced to less than 1,000, as evidence that the Chilean and Peruvian whales were not from the Antarctic population, an observation that was later confirmed (see <em>Geographic Range</em> above). Sighting rates of Blue Whales from Peruvian and Chilean whaling vessels apparently remained reasonably high after catches of this species ceased (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Maturana 1982), but the high catches of the mid-1960s would probably have been unsustainable if they had been allowed to continue.<br/><br/>A survey conducted under the IDCR (International Decade of Cetacean Research) programme in November-December 1982 between 10°S and 10°N from the coasts of Peru and Ecuador out to 110°W resulted in 16 Blue Whale sightings, all within 100 nm of the coast (Donovan 1984), but the survey coincided with the onset of an especially severe El Niño event.<br/><br/>A survey conducted under the international SOWER (Southern Ocean Whale and Environmental Research) programme during December-January 1997/98 covered the area between 12-200nm off the Chile coast between 18°S and 38°S and resulted in an abundance estimate of 303 Blue Whales (95% confidence interval (CI) = 176-625) for this area (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2011). Most Blue Whale sightings were between 27°S-33°S.&#160; A mark-recapture estimate using photo-id data collected around Chiloé Island (42°S) during 2004-11 yielded an estimate of 450 whales (CV 0.17) in 2008 with no significant trend (Cooke and Jackson 2017) but it is unclear what population this estimate pertains to because it includes both resident and transient individuals. Only one match was found between the 23 “individuals” (actually: left or right sides) identified on the SOWER cruise and the 563 “individuals” identified around Chiloé Island&#160;(IWC 2017a), which suggests that the whales either belong to distinct groups or to quite a large common population. Likewise, only one match was found between the Chiloé whales and the Blue Whales individually identified off Chañaral (29°S) (Galletti Vernazzani <em>et al</em>. 2017). The overall abundance and trend of Chilean Blue Whales is currently uncertain. Williams <em>et al</em>. (2011 revised 2017) show possible population trajectories from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century to the present<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. <em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Indian Ocean and Southwest Pacific</strong></em><strong><br/> </strong>No comprehensive estimate of the population of Pygmy Blue Whales is available. From a survey in December 1996, Best <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the abundance of Pygmy Blue Whales in a survey area south of Madagascar to be 424 (confidence limits about 190-930) and suggested, based on the distribution of past catches, that the total population in the southwestern Indian Ocean was about three times that in the survey area. The Western Australia population has been estimated&#160;at 662-1,559 based on acoustic recordings during 2000-2006 (McCauley and Jenner 2010), and 712-1,754 based on photo-identification during 2000-2005 (Jenner <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, these estimates do not cover the full range of the species in the southeastern Indian Ocean, and updated estimates based on photo-identification and genetic recapture are in preparation (IWC 2017a). A total of 31 distinct blue whales were identified in New Zealand waters during 2004-2014 (Olson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and a population estimate is currently in preparation. The catch of over 9,500 Pygmy Blue Whales in the southern Indian Ocean in the period 1960-72 (Allison 2017) suggests that the initial population was at least this size, and hence that the current population is still depleted, but not as severely as that of the Antarctic Blue Whale.<em><br/><br/><strong>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Mikhalev (2000) documented 1,294 Pygmy Blue Whales caught illegally by Soviet fleets in the northern and equatorial Indian Ocean during 1963-66, mainly in the Gulf of Aden, north of the Seychelles, off the Maldive Islands and Laccdive Islands, and west of southern India and Sri Lanka. Priyadarshana <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated a population size of 270 whales (CV 0.09) in a 7,500 km² area off southern Sri Lanka, which probably does not cover the full extent of this area of occurrence. No other abundance estimates in the Northern Indian Ocean are available.<em><br/><br/><strong>Antarctic</strong></em><br/>Catch records did not distinguish between subspecies until biologists accompanying Japanese and Russian whaling fleets started recording them separately from the 1960s (Ichihara 1966, Doroshenko 2000). Branch <em>et al.</em> (2009) concluded that virtually all of the Blue Whales taken south of 52°S in the southern Indian Ocean sector were Antarctic Blue Whales. The catch history of the various subspecies can be approximately reconstructed by assuming that Blue Whales not specified to subspecies taken south of 52°S or in the South Atlantic were <em>B. m. intermedia</em>, that Blue Whales taken off the west coast of South America were Chilean Blue Whales, and that Blue Whales not specified to subspecies taken in the northern Indian Ocean or in the Indian Ocean or the western South Pacific north of 52°S in the austral summer were Pygmy Blue Whales (understood here to include both <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> and <em>B. m. indica</em>). This leaves just a few hundred early catches in the southern Indian Ocean of doubtful identity.<em> </em>Allowing for some of the unspecified (to species) catch to have been Blue Whales, and for some struck and lost whales in the early years, the estimated total historical kill is about 350,000 Antarctic Blue Whales and 14,000 Pygmy Blue Whales (<em>B .m. brevicauda</em> and/or <em>B. m. indica</em>). These figures include the approximately 9,400 Blue Whales taken illegally by Soviet fleets in the 1960s and early 1970s that were not reported at the time (Ivashchenko <em>et al.</em> 2011), of which about 80% were Pygmy Blue Whales based on the above criteria.<br/><br/>The most recent circumpolar estimate of abundance for Antarctic Blue Whales agreed by the IWC Scientific Committee is 2,280 (CV 0.36) in 1998, based on sightings south of 60°S in summer, with an estimated annual increase rate of 8.1% (95% CI 1.6%-14.9%) (Branch 2007). A recalculation of the increase rate using more years of data is in progress (IWC 2017a).<br/><br/>An estimate from Japanese surveys covering just half of the Antarctic (35°E to 145°W) south of 60° S is 1,223 (CV 0.35) in 2008, with an estimated annual increase rate reported as 8.3% (95% CI 3.9% - 12.5%) (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). However, the annual increase rate implied by the presented data is 6.6% with a wide confidence interval (95% CI 0.0%-13.2%).<br/><br/>Photo-identification of Antarctic Blue Whales during 1991-2016 yielded 441 distinct individuals of which 14 were re-sighted in different years (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160; The number of inter-annual re-sightings is too small for reliable estimation of abundance and trends, but is broadly consistent with the above circumpolar abundance estimate.</p><p><br/><strong><em>Assessment</em></strong><br/>The IWC Scientific Committee in 2008 accepted a stock assessment of Antarctic Blue Whales by T. Branch (IWC 2009). However, the assessment is redone here because the Committee's assessment did not use an age-structured model and thus could not estimate the numbers of mature individuals that are required for the IUCN Red List assessment. The historical catch data have also been revised since then (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>The age at first reproduction is not well-known for Blue Whales in general, but Sears <em>et al.</em> (2013) found a youngest age of 11 years for first known calvings of female Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific. This agrees with the estimate of 11 years  by Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) from inter-specific comparisons. The generation time was estimated by Taylor <em>et al.</em> to be 30.8 years, which corresponds to a 3-generation period from 1926-2018 for application of the A criterion for the Red List.<br/><br/>Plausible rates of natural increase, taking into account the age at maturity and reproductive rates have been estimated to be 4.1% per year (Branch 2008a) for Antarctic Blue Whales and 2% per year for Pygmy Blue Whales, which appear to have a lower reproductive rate (Branch 2008b). Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) inferred an intrinsic increase rate of 5% for Blue Whales and estimated the proportion mature to be 72% for a stable population or 48% for a population increasing at the intrinsic rate.    </p><p>For Antarctic Blue Whales, a 5% intrinsic increase rate with logistic density-dependence, and&#160;assuming a 5 year mean age at recruitment, as for Fin Whales, an annual natural survival rate of 0.975 (Ramp <em>et al.</em> 2006, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), and a total population size of 2,280 whales in 1998, would imply a mature population size in 1926 of 125,000 or a total population size of 189,000, declining to a minimum of less than 1,000 in the late 1960s, and increasing to about 3,000 mature or 6,500 total by 2018 (see Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>As discussed above, there are no complete estimates of recent or current abundance for the other regions, but plausible total numbers would be 1,000-3,000 in the North Atlantic, 3,000-5,000 in the North Pacific, and possibly 1,000-3,000 in the eastern South Pacific. The number of Pygmy Blue whales is very uncertain but may be in the range 2,000-5,000. Taken together with a range of 5,000-8,000 in the Antarctic, the global population size in 2018 is plausibly in the range 10,000-25,000 total or 5,000-15,000 mature, compared with a 1926 global population of at least 140,000 mature. The current mature population would therefore be between 3 and 11% of the 1926 level. This overlaps the boundary (90% decline or 10% remaining) between the Endangered and Critically Endangered categories under criterion A1.<br/><br/>There is evidence of increasing abundance, at least up to around the year 2000, in the Antarctic and North Atlantic, and at least stability in the North Pacific. There is as yet no evidence of trend in the abundance of Pygmy Blue Whales or of Chilean Blue Whales, but it is likely that the global population of Blue Whales has increased in recent decades.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Blue Whale is a cosmopolitan species, found in all oceans but absent from some regional seas such as the Mediterranean, Okhotsk, and Bering seas. Until the 1960s, evidence of Blue Whale distribution came primarily from commercial catches, subsequently from whaling vessels sightings, then in the 1980s and 1990s from dedicated sighting surveys and platforms of opportunity, and since the 2000s also from acoustic detections, especially of males.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic</em><em><br/> </em></strong>In the North Atlantic the summer distribution of Blue Whales extends in the west from the Scotian Shelf to the Davis Strait (Canada/Greenland) and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (Sears and Calambokidis 2002, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2010). Blue whales occur in the Denmark Strait, around Iceland and north to the ice edge, and in the northeast to and around Svalbard (Norway), but not far into the Barents Sea. Historically, Blue Whales were commonly caught along the coasts of northern and western Norway, the Faeroes, and to the north and west of Scotland and Ireland. Small numbers were caught off northwestern Spain&#160;and near the Strait of Gibraltar, but the species does not occur in the Mediterranean (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/><br/>The winter distribution is poorly known but Blue Whales may have been dispersed over much of the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2004). There have been winter sightings off the coast of Mauritania (Baines and Reichelt 2014).&#160; Blue Whales are regularly observed around the Azores in spring and at least some migrate northward from there (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2013). Blue Whales have been tracked from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the New England Seamounts and to the coasts of North and South Carolina (34°N) in winter (Lesage <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are virtually no records from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Photo-identification data show that there are two largely separate populations in the North Atlantic: the northwest Atlantic population occurs in summer in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, on the Scotian Shelf, and around Newfoundland and west of Greenland. The northeast Atlantic population occurs in summer east of Greenland, around Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard, and west of Ireland; in spring it occurs around the Azores and in winter off northwest Africa. About 500 individuals have been identified to date in each of the two populations, but so far only one crossover (from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the Azores) has been documented through photographic matching (Sears <em>et al</em>. 2015.<em><br/><br/><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong><br/></strong><em></em>Blue Whales occur in summer north of 35°N in the western North Pacific, and north of 40°N in the central North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska, but not in the Bering or Okhotsk Seas. In the eastern North Pacific, they occur year-round off Baja California, Mexico, and the California coast (Calambokidis and Barlow 2004). Analysis of song types suggest that Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific are a separate population from those in the central and western North Pacific, but that whales from the eastern population mingle with whales from the western population in the Gulf of Alaska in summer (Monnahan <em>et al</em>. 2014). While some Blue Whales remain off California in winter, some of the Californian Blue Whales, including females with or without calves, migrate into the Gulf of California in winter (Sears <em>et al</em>. 2013). Some North Pacific Blue Whales migrate in winter to the Costa Rica dome (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1999)&#160; and perhaps further south into Peruvian waters (Le Duc <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) and eastern South Pacific</strong></em><br/>Blue Whales are present year-round on the Costa Rica Dome but it is unclear whether any animals are resident there, or whether it is sequentially occupied by whales wintering from the northeastern and southeastern Pacific (Reilly and Thayer 1990).<br/><br/>Sightings recorded by whalers taking other species show that Blue Whales were quite abundant during 1976-82 in the waters west of northern Peru (exact locations not given), especially in January-March, but with much reduced presence during the severe El Niño event of 1982-83 (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Donovan 1984). Their presence in November-December from the coast out to well beyond the Galápagos Islands was also shown by sightings from Japanese scouting vessels during 1979-82 (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996). Their presence in the waters of Ecuador and Peru was shown by tuna vessel surveys during October-March 1975-88 (Reilly and Thayer 1990) and later by dedicated cetacean surveys in July-December during 1986-2003 (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Blue Whales have been hunted in the past from several locations on the Chilean coast from 20°S to 42°S in all seasons (Allison 2017). Current areas of regular summer abundance include Chañaral (29°S) and Chiloé Island (42°-44°S) (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004, Vernazzani <em>et al</em>. 2012). A summer survey in December-January 1997/98 of offshore waters 12-200 nm from the coast between 18°S and 38°S showed presence from 20°S southward, with most sightings between 27°S and 33°S (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Based on morphology, genetics and migration, Branch <em>et al</em>. (2007a) proposed that Chilean Blue Whales are a separate subspecies from <em>B. m. intermedia </em>and <em>B. m. brevicauda</em>. However, while Chilean Blue Whales are clearly distinct from the other Southern Hemisphere subspecies, the division between Chilean and North Pacific Blue Whales is not yet clear. LeDuc <em>et al</em>. (2017) found that most Blue Whales biopsy sampled during July-November on the Costa Rica Dome were genetically closer to whales sampled in the North Pacific, while most Blue Whales biopsy sampled in the same months off Ecuador and the Galápagos were genetically closer to whales sampled in Chilean waters, but there was a high degree of uncertainty in individual assignments to the two groups. There is movement between the two grounds, with individual whales matched or tracked between California and the Costa Rica Dome, between the Costa Rica Dome and the Galápagos, and between the Galápagos and southern Chile (IWC 2017a, Huecke-Gate <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Chilean waters, the seasonal distribution of acoustic detections suggests a migration to northerly tropical latitudes in winter, but calls typical of Chilean Blue Whales were also recorded year-round in the ETP (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2015). Calls typical of Antarctic Blue Whales are detected in the ETP during the austral winter (Stafford <em>et al</em>. 1999, IWC 2017a). Clearly more research is needed to clarify the seasonal presence and distribution of the different groups of Blue Whales in the ETP, as the area is used by North Pacific, Chilean, and Antarctic Blue Whales, and there may also be resident individuals.<br/><br/>Calls typical of Antarctic Blue Whales have also been detected from January to June near Chiloé Island, but appeared to be from individuals making only brief visits to the area (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Indian Ocean and southwestern Pacific</strong></em><br/><br/>Pygmy Blue Whales (<em>B. m. brevicauda</em>) occur north of 52°S, with very few or no individuals south of this latitude (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007a, 2009). They occur off northwestern Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2016), on the Madagascar plateau (Best <em>et al</em>. 2003), in the offshore waters of Kenya (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2016) around and north of the Seychelles (Mikhalev 2000), across the pelagic southern Indian Ocean, and off South Australia and Western Australia, where they form part of a more or less continuous distribution from Tasmania to Indonesia. The Blue Whales observed around New Zealand also appear to be Pygmy Blue whales, based on genetics (Sremba <em>et al</em>. 2015) and morphology (Olson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Blue Whales appear to be rare or absent in the central South Pacific between the New Zealand and Chilean areas of occurrence (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b).<br/><br/>Based on acoustic detections, Antarctic Blue Whales (<em>B. m. intermedia</em>) occur in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean only in winter and spring, while Pygmy Blue Whales occur year-round but with a tendency to move southward in the austral summer (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2013). Other data are also broadly consistent with a lower-latitude distribution in the austral winter and a more southerly distribution in summer (Zemsky and Sazhinov 1982, cited by Best <em>et al</em>. 2003): Pygmy Blue Whales were present at the Seychelles in November but not April (Mikhalev 2000), and off Kenya in September and October but not during November to January (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2016). Foetuses found in the Pygmy Blue Whales taken by Soviet whalers near the Seychelles and in the southern Indian Ocean indicated that calves are born in the austral winter (Mikhalev 2000).<em><br/><br/><strong>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><strong> </strong><br/>Blue Whales are found year-round in the northern Indian Ocean, especially around Sri Lanka, and seasonally around the Maldive Islands and in the Gulf of Aden (Alling <em>et al</em>. 1991, Mikhaelev 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2011, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). They occur virtually year-round off southern Sri Lanka but are most abundant during December to May and least abundant during July to September (Randage <em>et al</em>. 2014). Analyses of fetuses in Blue Whales taken by Soviet fleets in the Northern Indian Ocean (Mikhalev 2000) revealed no clear seasonality of reproduction, being consistent either with year-round reproduction or perhaps a bimodal pattern.<br/><br/>Anderson <em>et al</em>. (2012) considered that there is some east-west migration within the northern Indian Ocean, with peak occurrence in the western Arabian Sea in May-October, followed by dispersal eastward after the end of the southwest monsoon, past Sri Lanka and into the Bay of Bengal, with peak abundance northeast of Sri Lanka occurring in February and March. However, Samaran <em>et al</em>. (2013) found that call types detected off Sri Lanka were also heard in the southern Indian Ocean in December and January, at least as far south as 43°S, which suggests that some Blue Whales may migrate between Sri Lanka and the temperate southern Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Although Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean are tentatively considered to be the distinct subspecies <em>B. m. indica</em>, their distinction from <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> is unclear. Mikhalev (2000) found the maximum body length, body length at maturity, and ovulation rate of Arabian Sea Blue Whales to be similar to Pygmy Blue Whales in the Southern Indian Ocean.<br/></p><strong><em>Antarctic and Southern Ocean</em></strong><br/>The Antarctic form <em>B. m. intermedia</em>, occurs throughout the Antarctic in summer, from the Antarctic Polar Front up to and into the sea ice, and in the subantarctic South Atlantic including the South Georgia area (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b). The winter distribution is not well known, but at least some and possibly most of the population migrates to lower latitudes in winter. Evidence for this comes from past catches of Antarctic-sized Blue Whales off Angola, Namibia, and South Africa in winter only (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b) and more recently from acoustics: call types characteristic of Antarctic Blue Whales have been recorded in the austral winter just north of the equator in the mid-Atlantic (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2017),&#160; in the southeastern Atlantic on the west coast of South Africa (Bell 2016 ), in the tropical Indian Ocean and southwest Pacific Ocean (Balcazar <em>et al</em>. 2017), and near the Galápagos Islands (Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2004).

The preference of this species for cold water may cause it to be particularly susceptible to periods of extended warming (Stark 2011), and therefore it may be negatively impacted by climate change and the related increasing water temperatures. Preliminary data suggest that this species may have shifted its distribution northward in response to increasing water temperatures (D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).","This species has a similar morphology to the Flathead Sole (<em>Hippoglossoides elassodon</em>) and their distributions overlap in the&#160;northern half of the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, but not in the Gulf of Alaska (Turnock<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017)<em>.</em>&#160;<em>Hippoglossoides elassodon&#160;</em>is more abundant and generally inhabits warmer water than<em>&#160;H. robustus&#160;</em>at least in the eastern Pacific<em>&#160;</em>(McGilliard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Studies are needed to examine the genetic structure throughout its range (Turnock&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Vinnikov <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Russia:</strong>&#160;This species is common and abundant in the Sea of Okhotsk, off western and northeastern Kamchatka, in Aniva Bay, off the northern Kuril Islands and in the Chukchi Sea (Li <em>et al</em>. 2017, Lukyanova <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dyldin <em>et al.</em> 2018, Saveliev <em>et al. </em>2019, Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2020). Its abundance increased on the Chukchi shelf in the Russian EEZ in 2012 (Gavrilov and Glebov 2013). The stock of flounders in the Sea of Okhotsk, where this species is taken in commercial fisheries, is considered stable (Ovchinnikov <em>et al</em>. 2017). According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort of this species has been stable with no noticeable trend over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/><strong>United States: </strong>This species is abundant in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska<strong>&#160;</strong>(Norcross<em> et al</em>. 2013). Annual stock assessments are conducted for this species in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands. According to the most recent assessment of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands stock, overfishing is not occurring, and this stock is not overfished nor approaching an overfished condition. The exploitation level has been light in recent decades. This species composed only 0.5% of the total commercial catch in 2017 and 2018, and the highest catch proportion was 6% in 1980. It is naturally uncommon in the Aleutian Islands. Fishery-independent scientific surveys have been conducted annually in the eastern Bering Sea since 1983, or over the past 36 years. Survey biomass&#160;peaked in 1991 at 27,630 t and then declined&#160;to a low of 2,092 t in 2019, which represents a 92% decline over the past 29 years (McGilliard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, 2019a). In the southeastern Bering Sea, water temperature was relatively warm from 2001 to 2005 before undergoing a distinct shift to relatively cold from 2006 to 2010. This environmental change corresponded with changes in fish catches in the Bering Sea shelf trawl survey (Stevenson and Lauth 2012). The preference of this species for cold water may cause it to be particularly susceptible to periods of extended warming (Stark 2011). <br/><br/>There are several sources of uncertainty associated with the survey biomass trend. During the 1980s and 1990s, this species could have been easily confused with <em>H. elassodon</em>, and this causes the biomass estimates at the beginning of the decline (1991) and just prior to be uncertain. Availability of this species to the surveys also introduces uncertainty. It is suspected the species is more common in the western Pacific as it is more frequently captured in the U.S. surveys conducted near the Russian EEZ boundary. In addition, it is suspected this species has shifted its distribution northward beyond the current survey extent (D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).",Stable,"This species is distributed in the North Pacific and Arctic oceans, from the northern Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk, in the Bering Sea, the Arctic Ocean and south to the Aleutian Islands (Mecklenburg<em> et al</em>. 2002<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">, Parin&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2014</span>).

158637991,158625941,Hippoglossus stenolepis,Least Concern,,2021,2020-11-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This widely distributed, demersal species has an estimated generation length of 19 years. It is highly valued by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range and has been exploited since the 1800s. Abundance is higher in the eastern Pacific than in the west. Biomass in Russian waters experienced declines by the early 1970s due to high fishing mortality but increased from the mid-1980s to 2000s as fishing pressure was reduced. Catch per unit effort in scientific surveys conducted since 1976 has been stable over time. In the western Bering Sea and Karaginskaya, biomass fluctuated widely in some years from 1996 to 2017 but these stocks are currently considered stable and exploited at a sustainable level. Biomass in Petropavlovsko-Komandorskaya, however, has declined since 2007 with some stabilization at lower levels in recent years. Fishing is regulated and managed by catch limits, including vessel monitoring.&#160;<br/><br/>Spawning biomass in the U.S. and Canada over the past three generations, or since about 1964, has fluctuated. Since increasing to a peak in 1997, biomass declined by about 70% to 2010 and has been stable at that lower level since then. The primary cause of this most recent decline is a decline in size-at-age of individuals since the 1970s, the cause of which is not clearly understood. Suspected contributing factors include size-selective fishing, increasing abundance of competing predators, changing water temperatures and reduced availability of high-energy prey items. As water temperatures are projected to continue increasing as climate change progresses, there is concern for impacts to this species related to future biomass decline or shifts in distribution. Though high fishing mortality contributed to past declines, fishing effort is now stringently managed and is not likely a driver of decline.&#160;<br/><br/>On the global level, this species is listed as Least Concern with a recommendation to improve the application of total allowable catch limits in the western Pacific and to continue research on declines in size-at-age in the eastern Pacific.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong>The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.","This demersal species occurs on soft and hard bottoms from coastal bays to the continental shelf and slope (Tokranov <em>et al</em>. 2005, Kells<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016, Hurst 2016). Post-larvae feed on small zooplankton. One- to three-year-old fish feed on small shrimp and other small crustaceans (e.g. crabs), as well as small fishes (IPHC 2014, Lajus <em>et al.</em> 2019). Adults feed on both benthic and pelagic prey, especially cod, sablefish, Walleye Pollock, rockfishes, sculpins, smelt, sand lance, capelin, and flatfishes (including smaller Pacific Halibut), but also relatively high amounts of hermit crabs (IPHC 2014, Webster 2014, Lajus <em>et al.</em> 2019). To a lesser extent, adults also feed on cephalopods, larger crabs, and clams (Hart 1973, Lajus <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>During its life history, this species undergoes ontogenetic and long-term movements, though these movements typically decrease with age and size (IPHC 2014). It conducts annual feeding and spawning migrations (Webster <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the summer, the species typically occurs shallower followed by movement to deep water in the autumn, a secondary movement to an even deeper depth stratum in winter, and a return to shallow water the following spring. Some individuals return to the same feeding grounds in the summer after spawning in winter. Subsequent studies also indicate high rates of interannual homing in conjunction with the potential for basin-scale segregation among spawning groups (Seitz <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;<br/><br/>Spawning typically occurs between November and March in deeper waters (180-500+) along the continental slope concentrated in submarine canyons (Hart 1973, St. Pierre 1984, IPHC 2014, Drinan <em>et al.</em> 2016). Documented major spawning sites include Cape St. James, Langara Island, and Frederick Island in British Columbia, Yakutat, Cape Suckling – Yakataga, Portlock Bank, and Chirikof Island in Alaska, as well as Middle Canyon near the US/Russia border in the eastern Bering Sea (IPHC 2014, Drinan <em>et al.</em> 2016). It is unclear if individuals return to their natal spawning sites to spawn (Drinan <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>This species batch spawns pelagic eggs that hatch after 15-20 days and the pelagic larval duration is typically 5-6 months, during which time larvae are carried counterclockwise around the northeast Pacific by the Alaskan Stream and/or Alaska Coastal Current (IPHC 2014, Drinan <em>et al.</em> 2016). Settlement of juveniles in shallower nursery areas leads to southerly and easterly (clockwise) migration over an additional 2-3 years and potentially hundreds of miles before reaching the adult stage (IPHC 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The maximum total length recorded for this species is for a female of 267 cm (Hart 1973). The largest specimen had a live weight of 500 lbs (227 kg). Females grow faster and reach larger sizes than males (Hart 1973, Mecklenburg <em>et al.</em> 2018), but they reach maturity slower than males (IPHC 2014). Males reach maturity at about 72 cm (fork length) and eight years of age, and females mature at about 120 cm and 12 years. Despite substantial size-at-age decreases in recent decades, the average size/age of maturation has not changed in the eastern Pacific (IPHC 2014). The maximum age is approximately 55 years. Recently, female natural mortality is estimated to be 0.15-0.22, although some uncertainty is associated with this estimate (Stewart and Hicks 2020). However, earlier studies (Thompson and Herrington 1930, Myhre 1967) report substantially higher natural mortality rates (around 0.30). When applying the equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is estimated to be about 19 years.","Changes in the biomass of this species are largely driven by changes in size-at-age and variability in recruitment. The recent biomass decline in the eastern Pacific is primarily driven by declines in size-at‐age, and despite several studies, the cause of this is still not fully understood. Projections suggest that further decline is a result of poor recruitment.&#160;Size-selective fishing, which occurs when fishers preferentially capture or retain large individuals, may have contributed to the decline (Sullivan 2016).&#160;A recent modelling study reported the changes in size-at-age could be driven by changes in growth potential related to reduced foraging rates and availability of high-energy prey items, such as Walleye Pollock, which is related to anomalous warm conditions observed in Alaskan waters (Holsman<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2019). For example, according to an examination of the isotopic signatures of Pacific Halibut otoliths, oceanic conditions differed between the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska during the early 1990s (Gao and Beamish 2003). Declines in size-at-age may persist given that water temperatures are projected to increase according to climate change forecasts and that the abundance&#160;of&#160;predators/competitors may continue increasing in the Gulf of Alaska (Holsman<em> et al. </em>2019). A large increase of Arrowtooth Flounder (<em>Atheresthes stomias</em>)&#160;biomass in the Gulf of Alaska that occurred from the 1960s to mid-2010s has been explored as a source of prey competition. A recent study concluded that dietary overlap between these two flatfish species is low, but the potential impact from competitive interactions requires further investigation&#160;(Barnes <em>et al</em>. 2018). Further research is needed on the implications of high trophic-level prey species availability in the eastern North Pacific for the growth of the largest size-at-age Pacific Halibut females, which have a relatively specialized diet (Wolf <em>et al</em>. 2019).","Genetic and spawning unit structuring are present, but are relatively low across the extent of the stock in the eastern Pacific (Drinan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Seitz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;Low-level genetic differentiation exists between eastern (United States and Canada) and western (Russian) Pacific Ocean sampling locations (Drinan <em>et al.</em> 2016). Connectivity between the western and eastern subpopulations is poorly understood, but studies are underway (Stewart and Hicks 2020). More work is needed to fully understand the genetic population structure of this species.<br/><br/>Overall, this species is more abundant in the eastern Pacific (U.S. and Canada) as compared to in the western Pacific (Russia and Japan) and propagule exchange would be expected to occur from the east to the west (Orlov 2000, 2004). This species has been described as ""abundant"" from the Sea of Japan, the Aleutian Islands, and from the Bering Sea to California, but it is considered ""uncommon"" to ""rare"" in the Artic Ocean (Mecklenburg <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Russia:</strong> In Russian waters, this species is abundant in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Gulf of Anadyr and the Olyutorsky and Navarinsky regions of the western Bering Sea, but is naturally rare in the Sea of Japan (Batanov<em> et al</em>. 2017, Orlov and Tokranov 2019). In fisheries catches, it is lumped with three other species that are categorized by fishers as 'halibut', including Kamchatka Flounder (<em>Atheresthes evermanni</em>), Arrowtooth Flounder (<em>Atheresthes stomias</em>),&#160;and Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>).<em>&#160;</em>The Pacific Halibut and Greenland Halibut represent the majority of the halibut catches with Kamchatka Flounder and Arrowtooth Flounder constituting a very small quantity. Total annual halibut catches were stable around an average of 15,000 tons per year for the period 2008-2019 with a decreasing trend since 2016. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of halibuts has declined since 2012. According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since 1976), the CPUE of this species was stable with no noticeable trend over time. Survey CPUE slightly declined over time in the western Bering Sea, increased in eastern Sakhalin, was stable in western Kamchatka, and declined in eastern Kamchatka and the northern Kurils&#160;(I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>Age structure of the catch in the northwestern Bering Sea did not noticeably&#160;change from the 1930s to the 1960s and did not change in the southern Kuril Islands over the last century. Age composition did change to younger ages in the 2000s in the northern Kuril Islands and southeastern Kamchatka despite suggested relatively low fishing pressure in the western Pacific (Orlov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). From the mid-1980s to the 2000s, biomass of this species increased in the western Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk and eastern Kamchatka. From 1998-2008, catches of this species in the bottom longline fishery operating in the western Bering Sea declined from 1998 to 2000, but increased thereafter. The proportion of the catch that it composed also increased over time (Tuponogov <em>et al</em>. 2013). This species had declined due to high fishing mortality by the early 1970s, but the cessation of targeted fishing effort in 1975-1985 allowed biomass to increase in Russian waters from the mid-1980s to 2000s. In the most recent decade, annual catches exceeded total allowable catch limits in some Russian stocks, and combined with reduced recruitment in recent years, this is cause for concern regarding population status. In the western Bering Sea zone and Karaginskaya subzone, biomass fluctuated widely in some years from 1996 to 2017 but remained above the sustainable total biomass limit. These stocks are currently considered to be stable and exploited at a sustainable level. Biomass in the Petropavlovsko-Komandorskaya subzone has declined since 2007, has remained below the maximum sustainable yield limit since 2012, and is stable at a relatively low level in recent years (Lajus <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/><strong>United States and Canada: </strong>This species has been commercially fished in North American waters since the 1800s. Large declines occurring through the 1920s may have been a result of increased fishing mortality in the early 1900s. To manage the stock and establish a recovery plan, the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) was formed in 1923. The stock is assessed as a single unit throughout its known range within the IPHC Convention Area. This known range extends from northern California to the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea (including Canada but excluding Russia). After improved fishery management and reduced fishing effort, spawning biomass increased overall from about 1930 to 1997. Over the past three generations, or since about 1964, biomass declined somewhat from 1964 to 1980, increased to a peak in 1997, declined by about 70% by 2010 and has been stable at that lower level since then.&#160;<br/><br/>Fluctuations in stock biomass are linked to changes in recruitment, which are related to the decadal changes in productivity of the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The most recent biomass decline is primarily driven by a 50% reduction of individual size-at-age since the 1970s and somewhat weakened recruitment as compared to the 1980s and is not driven by fishing intensity (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Until about 1985, males and females recruited to the fishery in the central Gulf of Alaska at about the same age (males at seven years and females at eight years). As a result, commercial catches were composed of sex ratios relatively similar to underlying abundance (Clark 2004). However, between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, mean growth rates declined across the population, generating a sex-specific disparity with respect to fishing mortality. Females now enter the central Gulf of Alaska fishery on average at 10 years of age and males at nearly 15 years (Galindo <em>et al</em>. 2011). Size-at-age was also low in the early 1900s. Harvest reductions were made as the modern-day declines were detected. The cause of the reduced size-at-age is unknown (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Size-at-age changes are thought to result from a combination of factors, such as density-dependent competition for food, ocean productivity, size-selective fishing, etc. (see threats section for more details). <br/><br/>The relative spawning biomass has been above the 30% limit since 2015, which indicates fishing intensity is at a sustainable level. In the most recent assessment (2019-2020), it was 32% (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Size-at-age was also low in the early 1900s. Harvest reductions were made as the modern-day declines were detected. The cause of the reduced size-at-age is unknown. Spawning biomass is projected to continue declining through at least the next three years, or until 2023, based on the known strength of cohorts and status quo fishing mortality levels. There are several integral points of uncertainty related to the biology and population dynamics of this species that lead to a high degree of uncertainty in both stock scale and trend (Stewart and Hicks 2020).",Stable,"This species is distributed in the North Pacific Ocean.

The stock in the United States and Canada has been managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission since 1923 (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Fishing regulations for the U.S. and Canada include total mortality limits, daily bag limits, fish size limits, license and permit requirements, incidental mortality limits, seasonal closures, area closures, and fishing gear restrictions (IPHC 2020). When targeting of groundfishes increased in the early 1960s, bycatch from all areas of the North Pacific steeply increased to a peak in 1965. Bycatch mortality has steadily declined since the early 1990s due to bycatch management measures. In 2011, an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) programme was implemented for the U.S. West Coast trawl fishery alongside requirements for 100% observer coverage and a program for managing halibut bycatch, and this substantially reduced bycatch; a similar program also exists in Canadian waters (IPHC 2014). In Alaska, Pacific Halibut bycatch is managed to static mortality limits by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council. All sources of mortality are included in stock assessment analyses and evaluation of mortality limits set by the IPHC. <br/><br/>There is a total allowable catch limit for this species in Russian waters (Tuponogov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). The longline fishery in the western Bering Sea is subject to catch limits, vessel reporting requirements, and other fishing control measures. Improvements in configuring total allowable catch limits may be needed (Lajus<em> et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>Research is needed and is currently underway to understand the level of exchange of individuals between Russian and Alaskan waters. This is especially important as water temperatures are warming in the Bering Sea, which may cause increased population movement across international borders (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Fish condition and growth should be monitored in the Alaskan region to identify early indicators of climate impacts on these life history parameters (Holsman <em>et al.</em> 2019). Furthermore, current estimates of natural mortality are uncertain; as such, more research is needed to improve the estimate of natural mortality.","",,false,false,Global

It is highly valued and exploited by commercial flatfish fisheries throughout its range. In U.S. waters, overfishing is not occurring. According to scientific survey data and stock assessment models,&#160;survey biomass in the Gulf of Alaska declined by 43% over the past 35 years, or since 1984 (about two generation lengths), while exploitation has been low. The cause of this decline is not well understood, but it is not likely related to fishing pressu<span style="""">re, but rather&#160;may be related to the population range shift, which alters the proportion of the population existing in surveyed areas. </span>In the eastern Bering Sea, which has a higher abundance than that in the Gulf of Alaska, total and female spawning biomass significantly increased since 1964, or over the past three generation lengths. However, a gradual decline of 23 and 27% has occurred since 1985 and 1994, respectively. The decline is due to reduced recruitment strength, which is caused by interannual changes in bottom water temperatures. Stock assessment models indicate that female spawning biomass is projected to slightly increase through 2032 in the Bering Sea, and biomass has been increasing since 2010 in the northern Bering Sea. Fishery management and monitoring are stringent in U.S. waters and expected to remain in place. Declines over the past one to two generation lengths and projected about one generation into the future do not reach the quantitative thresho<span style="""">lds to qualify for even a Near Threatened status at this time. In Russian waters, biomass of this species has been declining in some areas since the mid-1990s, or a little over one generation length. Cyclical changes in environmental conditions that led to reduced recruitment success are considered the primary cause of this decline, with fishing pressure as a secondary cause in some areas, especially when high fishing pressure occurs during periods of undesirable environmental conditions.&#160;Catch per unit effort in scientific surveys conducted in Russian waters since 1976 was stable over time. Fishing is managed by annual catch limits and some seasonal closure to bottom trawling. Therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern.&#160;</span><span style="""">Reco</span>mmendations include: collecting quantitative data to verify that there is a northward population shift, to evaluate the impacts of changing water temperatures and sea ice extent, as well as to conduct further research on genetics, population structure, movement between the Eastern Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska, identifying spawning areas in the Gulf of Alaska, and regarding certain aspects of its life history.&#160;<br/><br/>The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.","This demersal species occurs on soft and hard bottoms from the continental shelf to the slope. It has a maximum total length of 56 cm (Tuponogov and Kodolov 2014). It conducts an annual feeding migration to the shelf-slope break in the winter and a spawning migration to nearshore waters in spring and summer. Juveniles utilize coastal bays as nursery grounds. The diet primarily consists of polychaete worms, miscellaneous worms, clams, and benthic amphipods. <br/><br/>The natural mortality rate is estimated to be 0.12 and sexual maturity occurs at about 10.5 years of age (TenBrink and Wilderbuer 2015, Spies&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Russian waters of the southwestern Bering Sea, age and length at first maturity for males is 4.6 years and 21.4 cm and for females, 7.7 years and 28.5 cm (Zolotov 2008).&#160;According to work by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, it has been aged to a maximum of 40 years (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/commercial-fishing/fish-species-maximum-age-data). When applying the equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is estimated to be about 19 years.","Shifts in distribution of flatfishes and other demersal species of the eastern Bering Sea can occur when water temperatures are anomalous, a situation which has been occurring with a climate pattern that has developed in recent years where water temperatures alternate between above average and below average annual values. In addition to impacts in adult habitats, nursery grounds, such as Norton Sound and Kuskokwim-Togiak Bays in the eastern Bering Sea, are also experiencing higher than normal temperatures due to climate change. These anomalous water temperatures are expected to impact growth and condition of juveniles of this species (Spies <em>et al</em>. 2019), which, in turn, likely affect recruitment success and have long-term impacts on the ecosystem (Stevenson and Lauth 2019). In Russian waters, similar declines in biomass are also attributed to cyclical climatic changes that have led to reduced recruitment success, which are amplified by fishing pressure (Zolotov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Anthropogenic activities in nearshore, coastal habitats that serve as nurseries for juveniles are likely to negatively impact this species.","<strong>Russia: </strong>This species is common and abundant in the northwestern Bering Sea (also known as the Olyutorsky-Navarin region),&#160;especially on the Koryak Shelf. Its subpopulation is considered stable there based in part on the continued presence of older individuals in scientific survey catches in the northwestern Bering Sea&#160;(Datsky and Maznikova 2017). It is also common in the Sea of Okhotsk and western Kamchatka shelf (Napazakov 2015), and northeastern Kamchatka (Orlov <em>et al.</em> 2020). According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species was stable with no noticeable trend over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>This species is the primary target of flounder fisheries in the Sea of Okhotsk. Fishing mortality was high in the mid-1970s but declined with the reduction of effort when EEZ boundaries were implemented in the late 1970s (Dyakov 2014). The fishery remains active but is no longer open access (Yusupov 2014). Exploitation remained at low levels until 2004 when an industrial targeted fishery began in the Magadan region of the northern Sea of Okhotsk (Pustovoit and Yusupov 2011). Off Sakhalin Island, targeted fishing of this species began in the late 1940s. Catches were high in the 1950s, but declined in the 1960s to an average of 2.6 thousand tons, and averaged between 1.7 to 2.1 thousand t to the 1990s. Abundance of this species was high in the 1950s to 1960s and 1985-1995, but declined in 1970-1980 and in the mid-1990s to 2013 (the terminal year of data).&#160;Similar patterns were reported in the western Bering Sea and for the western Kamchatka shelf. <span style="""">The primary cause of decline is attributed to natural cyclical fluctuations in water temperature that led to reduced recruitment success, but fishing pressure during the years of undesirable conditions is considered to amplify such declines. </span>In the 15-20 years preceding 2014, fishing effort changed due to a large-scale reorganization of the fishing fleet. In western Sakhalin in 2001-2013, fishing effort was unsustainable. Changes in the size and age composition from 2001 to 2012 indicated the stock underwent a sharp decline. In 2014, new regulations were introduced to address overfishing. Scientific bottom trawl surveys were conducted from 2000-2013 off Sakhalin, and according to those data, the biomass of this species averaged 5 thousand tons in 2000-2005, but then declined by about 60% to 1.6-2.1 thousand t&#160;in 2007-2013, with a low of 1.1 thousand t recorded in 2010. In eastern Sakhalin, targeted fishing began in the 1950s and the stock gradually declined as the average annual catch declined significantly to 4.6 thousand tons in the 1960s, 2.9 thousand t in the 1970s and less than 1 thousand t by the early 1980s. A flounder fishing moratorium was implemented from 1981 to 1990. Fishing was reinstated with stricter controls in 1991-1994, and catches gradually increased to 5.6 thousand t in 2000 and afterwards averaged 2.7 thousand tons to 2013, with a range from 1.6-4.6 thousand t. Similar to the subpopulation off western Sakhalin, that off the eastern coast is also suspected to be undergoing some level of overfishing in the 2000s based on changes in the size and age composition of individuals in the catches in 2000-2012 (Zolotov <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Survey CPUE in east Sakhalin since 2013 slightly declined over time to 2018 and the species did not occur in survey catches in 2015 and 2016 (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>In the Pacific waters off the northern Kurils and southeastern Kamchatka, the highest survey indices were observed during 1994-1998, with lowest values in 1992-1993 and 1999-2002 (Orlov and Tokranov 2014). On the western Kamchatka shelf, this species constitutes the majority of the flounder catch and its stock increased until the late 1990s (Dyakov 2009). According to scientific surveys conducted on the western Kamchatka shelf, biomass of all species of Pleuronectidae&#160;harvested significantly declined from a peak of a little over 1 million tons in 1997 to about 400 thousand t in 2000, and catches remained between 400-500 thousand t until the terminal year of data in 2010. This decline is thought to be due to natural causes rather than overfishing since exploitation levels were below catch limits (Gorbatenko and&#160;Savin&#160;2012). Survey CPUE of this species in western Kamchatka since 2010 was stable over time to 2018 (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).&#160;In southeastern Kamchatka, this species constitutes a lower proportion (15%) of the flounder catch. Stocks of flounder declined there in the 1960s to a minimum in the mid-1970s, increased in the 1980s to the mid-1990s and then declined again from 2001-2006. Declines are thought to be due to natural cycles, but further study is needed (Zolotov and&#160;Zakharov&#160;2008). In northeastern Kamchatka in the Karaginsky and Olutorsky bays, this species constitutes&#160;45-85% of the catch in Danish seine and trawl fisheries, and declines in size and age of this species in the early 2000s are thought to have been caused by overfishing (Zolotov 2008). Off Primorye, in the Sea of Japan, where this species constitutes&#160;a dominant portion of the flatfish catch, abundance of flatfishes declined since the mid-1990s to at least the early 2000s. Since fishing levels were low and slightly declined over time, this decline is inferred to be due to changes in productivity during the natural 50-year cycling of cold and warm periods. Flatfish abundance was high during warm periods and low during cold periods (Antonenko 2007).<br/><br/><strong>United States</strong>: The abundance of this species is naturally lower in the Gulf of Alaska than it is in the Bering Sea. In the Gulf of Alaska, this species is managed as part of the ""shallow-water flatfish stock complex"", which besides this species, is primarily composed of Alaska Plaice (<em>Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus</em>), English Sole (<em>Parophrys vetulus</em>), Sand Sole (<em>Psettichthys melanostictus</em>), Starry Flounder (<em>Platichthys stellatus</em>), Butter Sole (<em>Isopsetta isolepis</em>), Northern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta polyxystra</em>), and Southern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta bilineata</em>). According to the most recent stock assessment, overfishing is not occurring and the exploitation rate on this complex is relatively low. According to scientific surveys conducted from 1984 to 2019 in the Gulf of Alaska, biomass of this species declined overall by 43% from 1984 to 2019, or over the past 35 years (Turnock&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Bryan 2019<span style="""">). This decline is not well understood, but fishing was not likely to be a driver. The exploitation rate (i.e., catch/biomass) has been less than 0.001 per year since 1993 (Bryan 2019). Temperature-mediated differences in seasonal spawning migrations into and out of inshore areas effect the availability of the population to trawl surveys in the eastern Bering Sea (Nichol <em>et al</em>. 2019), and a similar phenomenon may affect survey-based biomass estimates in the Gulf of Alaska. The connectivity between the Eastern Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska is not well understood. However, a large proportion of the population in the Gulf of Alaska is concentrated near the western boundary of the survey area, and there are no notable barriers between the survey area and the Aleutian Islands to the west, or the Bering Sea to the north. Thus, some proportion of the population may be moving out of the Gulf of Alaska and into the surrounding regions over time&#160;(M</span>. Bryan and D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>This is one of the most abundant flatfish species in the eastern Bering Sea, but it is encountered in low abundance in the Aleutian Islands. The bottom trawl fishery, which included foreign fleets, began targeting this species on the Bering Sea shelf in 1954 and this stock was overexploited by 1959-1962. In the later 1970s, fishing effort was reduced, and the stock showed recovery by the early 1980s. The most recent assessment of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands stock concluded that overfishing is not occurring and it is not overfished nor approaching an overfished condition, but the stock has been in a slowly declining condition since 1994, or over the past 26 years. According to scientific surveys conducted in the eastern Bering Sea since 1982, biomass declined by 45% from 1983 to 1986, and has mostly fluctuated somewhat at around 2 to 2.5 million tons since then (34 years). Variability in this survey's estimate of biomass is in part due to the level of overlap in the timing of the survey and timing of annual spawning migrations into nearshore areas not sampled by the survey. The migration to inshore spawning grounds occurs earlier than normal in warm water years and somatic growth also increases. Biomass estimates are generally lower in years with colder shelf bottom temperatures. Water temperature has been warmer than the mean annual temperature in recent years. Survey biomass&#160;in&#160;the northern Bering Sea increased from 310,617 t in 2010 to&#160;520,029 t in 2019. A large-scale shift of abundance from the eastern Bering Sea to the northern part has not yet been detected but this possibility should be monitored as climate change progresses.&#160;Total biomass and female spawning biomass (FSB) have been modeled for the 65-year period of 1954 to 2019. Total biomass was low in the 1960s and early 1970s, but doubled between 1975 and 1979, peaked at 4,025,010&#160;t in 1985 and slowly declined thereafter by 23% to 3,090,480 t in&#160;2019, or over the past 35 years. FSB increased to a peak of 1,455,350&#160;t in 1994 and then gradually declined thereafter by 27% to 1,062,990 t in 2019, or over the past 26 years. This decline is likely caused by mostly below average recruitment strength in the years from 1984-2005. Compared to 1964 (26,218&#160;t), FSB increased significantly to 2019 (1,062,990 t), or over the past three generations.&#160;FSB is projected to slightly increase through 2032. The exploitation rate is low to moderate (Nichol <em>et al.</em> 2019, Spies <em>et al.</em> 2019). Due to warming temperatures in the Bering Sea, the population might be shifting northward outside the historical extent of scientific surveys, and this would introduce uncertainty to biomass estimates (I. Spies and D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the North Pacific and Arctic oceans from Korea to the Beaufort Sea, and south to&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Canada (</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Hart 1973</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">, Mecklenburg&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2002</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">).&#160;</span>In the western Pacific, it occurs in the Sea of Japan, from Busan (South Korea), Peter the Great Bay, Primorye, and&#160;the Tatar Strait; all coasts of Hokkaido; the Sea of Okhotsk; southeastern Kamchatka; the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas; and south to&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada (Hart 1973, Sakamoto 1984a,b; Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002,&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Shinohara&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2011, Nakabo 2013, Parin&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2014</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">).&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The depth range is 4-716 metres, but it typically occurs shallower than 150 m (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Shinohara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Nakabo 2013, Parin <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kells&#160;</span><em>et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2016, I.

According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species slightly increased over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020). Since the 1980-1990 period, the density of this species increased in the Anadyr Bay/Navara region to the 2011-2018 period and was stable or increasing during the same periods in western Kamchatka (Shuntov and Volvenko 2020).<br/><br/><strong>United States:</strong>&#160;This species is rare along the Arctic North American coast to Bathurst Inlet (Mecklenburg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, it is most common in coastal parts of the Bering Sea, and naturally uncommon in the Aleutians (D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020). It is managed as part of the ""other flatfish complex"", which besides this species, primarily comprises Rex Sole (<em>Glyptocephalus zachirus</em>), Starry Flounder (<em>Platichthys stellatus</em>), Dover Sole (<em>Microstomus pacificus</em>) and Butter Sole (<em>Isopsetta isolepis</em>).<strong>&#160;</strong>It is not targeted in this area but is retained as bycatch in fisheries that target&#160;other flatfish species and Pacific Cod.

Fishery-independent scientific surveys have been conducted annually in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands since 1982. Survey biomass of this species in the Bering Sea was highest in 1982 at 103,806 t before declining from 1983 to 1985 to 9,107 t, although the variability around these data years is high.

The cause of this decline is not well understood, but is not thought to be related to fishing activities. The survey in the Bering Sea does not sample the shallow, coastal parts of the distribution of this species, which introduces uncertainty to the biomass estimates. In addition, substantial areas of suitable habitat are available in the Bering Sea, an area not regularly surveyed, where this species is potentially shifting northward to as sea ice extent decreases over time (D.

159717244,19014407,Platichthys stellatus,Least Concern,,2021,2020-11-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This widely distributed, demersal species has an estimated generation length of 10 years. It is exploited by demersal commercial fisheries throughout its range. According to fishery independent scientific surveys, biomass in the eastern Bering Sea has been mostly increasing since at least 1982. Biomass in the Gulf of Alaska increased overall since 1984, but there has been some decline over the past decade, or one generation length. According to scientific surveys conducted over the past 42 years in Russian waters, the catch per unit effort of this species increased over time; although, there has been some localised decline in Peter the Great Bay.&#160;It has experienced major declines off Korea and China due to overf<span style="""">ishing. Its status in Japan is unknown; however, it commands a low price and is generally not considered to be commercially important.&#160;Overfishing is a major threat in part of its range and degradation of estuarine nursery habitats is another major threat. The species is listed as Least Concern based on a stable or increasing abundance in Russian and U.S. waters, where more than 50% of its global population are located. Recommendations include improving fisheries management in Korea and China, as well as conducting research on its status in Japan.&#160;</span><br/><br/>The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.","This demersal species inhabits soft and mixed bottoms from the intertidal zone to the continental slope, but is generally found on the shelf and in inshore, coastal waters (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Kells&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). It also enters brackish waters, rivers, and lakes, often to the limit of tidal influence (Mecklenburg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, 2018; Parin<em> et al.</em> 2014). It has a high tolerance for low salinity and young can be abundant at low to medium salinities (Hart 1973). Adults spawn in marine waters and juveniles migrate to estuarine and freshwater nursery grounds (Hart 1973, Yamashita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). It has been observed at least 40 km upstream from marine waters (Kirillov <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;Food reported includes crabs, shrimps, worms, clams and clam siphons, other small molluscs, and small fish<span style="""">es (Clemmons and Wilby 1961), nemertean worms, and brittle stars (Hart 1973). The maximum total length is 91 cm (Miller and Lea 1972; Ha</span>rt 1973;&#160;Mecklenburg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, 2018).<br/><br/>Natural mortality was estimated as 0.15 for this species in the eastern Bering Sea (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2015), 0.2 for fish in the Gulf of Alaska (Turnock<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017), and 0.5 for fish in Korean waters (Yoon <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). It has been aged to 24 years in the eastern Pacific and 36 years in the western Pacific (Yusupov and Kashchenko 2017). According to a study in Russia, males reach sexual maturity at 22-25 cm and 4-5 years and females at 28-31 cm and 6-7 years (Yusupov&#160;2011). <span style="""">According to a study in northern California, males reach maturity at 2 years and females at 3 years.&#160;Females live longer and attain somewhat larger sizes at older ages than do males (Orcutt 1950, Hart 1973).&#160;</span>When applying an age at first reproduction of 5 years and a natural mortality of 0.2, its estimated generation length is about 10 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species in parts of its range and it is taken as bycatch, and retained, in other areas. The estuarine habitats that it depends on have been degraded by pollution and coastal development in Korea (An&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), and likely other parts of its range.","<strong>Russia</strong>: This species is common in Russian waters, especially in the Sea of Okhotsk (Parin&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014), and abundant in the Amur estuary&#160;(N. Bogutskaya&#160;pers. comm. 2020). It is common in the Karaginsky and Olyutorsky bays (Orlov <em>et al.</em> 2020). According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species increased over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).&#160;Biomass of this species has been increasing since the early 2000s off northeastern Sakhalin (Tok 2014). Stock assessments are only conducted for northeastern Sakhalin since it is less abundant in other areas. The current status of the subpopulation in Russian waters is unclear. The last bottom trawl survey&#160;was conducted in 2012 and biomass was estimated to be about 5,900 tons. This is less than in other survey years, but data are not available after 2012 (A. Orlov pers. comm. 2020). Since the 1980-1990 period, the abundance of this species declined in Peter the Great Bay to the 2011-2018 period and increased overall during the same periods in western Kamchatka (Shuntov and Volvenko 2020).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Japan</strong>: This species is known to hybridize with&#160;<em>Kareius (Platichthys) bicoloratus</em>&#160;in the coastal waters of Japan (Yamashita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). It is taken in the demersal fishery off Fukushima, but it is not the primary species of flounder targeted&#160;in this region (Wada <em>et al.</em> 2011).&#160;<span style="""">Starry flounder are caught by coastal fisheries and landed at fish markets, but this species is not commercially important and&#160;no stock assessment has&#160;been undertaken in Japan. In the Miyagi Prefecture, northeastern Japan, the CPUE of Starry Flounder did not decrease from 2008 to 2015 (T. Tomiyama&#160; pers. comm. 2021).</span><br/><br/><strong>China</strong>: This species is highly overexploited in Chinese waters. It is bred in captivity with 3 million fry released to the wild per year (Tian<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016), but it is unknown whether these releases are improving the status of the species in Chinese waters.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Korea</strong>: This species is naturally common&#160;off eastern Korea and&#160;is one of the six main flounder species in the commercial catch (Kwak and Park 2016). Major continuous declines in the Korean stock of this species have occurred due to overfishing. Korean flatfish fisheries have been overfished since at least the 1980s (Yoon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Hatchery-reared fish have been released to the wild since the early 2000s as part of an effort to enhance the resource. The broodstock supply for this hatchery is both wild-caught and captive-cultured, but mature individuals have become increasingly difficult to find in the wild, so the use of captive-cultured individuals has increased. This has led to poor genetic quality of the hatchery-reared stock&#160;(An <em>et al</em>. 2014). The impact of these releases on the status of the species in Korean waters is unknown.<br/><br/><strong>United States:</strong>&#160;This species is relatively common in Washington and Oregon (Pietsch and Orr 2015). In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, it is managed as part of the ""other flatfish complex"", which besides this species, primarily comprises Rex Sole (<em>Glyptocephalus zachirus</em>), Longhead Dab (<em>Myzopsetta proboscidea</em>), Dover Sole (<em>Microstomus pacificus</em>) and Butter Sole (<em>Isopsetta isolepis</em>).<strong>&#160;</strong>It is not targeted in this area but is retained as bycatch in fisheries that target&#160;other flatfish species and Pacific Cod. In recent years, the majority of the catch within the ""other flatfish complex"" is represented by Starry Flounder (<em>Platichthys stellatus</em>) and Rex Sole (<em>Glyptocephalus zachirus</em>). The exploitation rate of this species has been low since at least 1997. Stock biomass across the complex is currently at a relatively high level. Fishery-independent scientific surveys have been conducted annually in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands since 1982. Survey biomass of this species in the eastern Bering Sea has mostly increased since 1982 with the exception of a decline after 2007 (98,623 t)&#160;punctuated by a peak value of 110,907 t&#160;in 2014 and return to decline in 2015 (56,190 t). Biomass remains at levels significantly higher than in the 1980s (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2015, 2018, 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Alaska, this species is managed as part of the ""shallow-water flatfish stock complex"", which besides this species, is primarily composed of Alaska Plaice (<em>Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus</em>), English Sole (<em>Parophrys vetulus</em>), Sand Sole (<em>Psettichthys melanostictus</em>), Butter Sole (<em>Isopsetta isolepis</em>), Yellowfin Sole (<em>Limanda aspera</em>), Northern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta polyxystra</em>) and Southern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta bilineata</em>). According to the most recent stock assessment, overfishing is not occurring and the exploitation rate on this complex is relatively low. According to scientific surveys, biomass of this species in the Gulf of Alaska from 1984 to 2019 fluctuated widely in some years, but overall, increased. Biomass peaked in 2001 at 76,418 t and had a secondary peak in 2007 at 73,039 t before declining by about 50% to values ranging between 39,757 to 23,446&#160;t from 2009 to 2019 (Turnock<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Bryan 2019).",Stable,"This species<em>&#160;</em>is widely distributed in the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent Arctic Ocean (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2018). It occurs from the Yellow Sea (China) to the Sea of Japan, including the Korean Peninsula and Japan (throughout Hokkaido to Hiroshima), and off the Pacific coast of Japan from Hokkaido to Motoyama in Kochi. In Russian waters, it is found from Peter the Great Bay, Primorye to the northern Tatar Strait and off western Sakhalin Island, the Sea of Okhotsk, including the Amur, Tym and Poronai rivers, the southern and northern Kuril Islands and southeastern Kamchatka. It is found in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea and Beaufort Sea (to Bathurst Inlet, Canada). It also occurs from the Gulf of Alaska south to Los Angeles Harbor, California, U.S. (Hart 1973; Sakamoto 1984; Lindberg and Fedorov 1993; Li and Wang 1995; Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2018; Parin <em>et al</em>. 2014). The depth range is 1-600 metres (Nakabo 2013, Parin <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kells <em>et al.</em> 2016), but it typically occurs shallower than 100 m (Hart 1973, Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002).","This species is retained as bycatch in demersal fisheries in U.S. waters (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2015). It is commercially exploited in Russian waters, such as the Sea of Okhotsk and off Sakhalin Island. It is taken in fisheries in Japan (Wada&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), but it is not an esteemed species and commands a relatively low price (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021).&#160;In Korea and China, it is highly valued and commercially important (Kwak and Park 2016, Tian<em> et al.</em> 2016); so much so, that with decreasing natural abundance, a large&#160;aquaculture industry has developed for this species (Tian<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016, Jin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).",Marine,"The subpopulation of this species in U.S. waters is closely monitored through scientific surveys and annual stock assessments. It is managed through the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands Groundfish Fishery Management Plan and the Gulf of Alaska Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. Fishing is regulated through permitting, size limits, daily and total catch limits, seasonal and area fishing closures, gear restrictions, and a trawl catch share program. While it appears in commercial catches in Japan, it is regarded as a low-value species and is not targeted. In some parts of its range (e.g., China and Korea), attempts to augment natural subpopulations have been undertaken through releasing aquaculture-reared juveniles; however, the relative effectiveness of these releases in augmenting the wild stocks is undocumented, as are population genetic effects of these measures on the wild population are undocumented.","",,false,false,Global
